MORLEY MEREDITH, 77, BARITONE WHO SANG HED

<TEXT>
<P>
   Morley Meredith, a versatile baritone who sang 40 roles in 31
seasons at the Metropolitan Opera, died last Thursday at the Palm
Beach Gardens Medical Center in Florida. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Peter Clark, a spokesman for the Met.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith was born in Winnipeg, Canada, and began his musical
studies there, but when he entered the University of Manitoba he
intended to study medicine. While an undergraduate he performed
regularly as a recitalist and as a soloist in oratorios and
recorded a series of recitals for the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   He made his New York debut as a recitalist at Town Hall in 1956
and sang Escamillo in a New York City Opera production of
``Carmen'' in 1957. He also undertook leading roles in several
musical theater productions, including ``Gentlemen Prefer
Blondes,'' with Carol Channing, and ``Christine,'' with Maureen
O'Hara.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith made his Metropolitan Opera debut singing the four
villains in Offenbach's ``Contes d'Hoffmann'' in January 1962.
Other roles he sang at the Met include Rangoni in ``Boris
Godunov,'' Alfio in ``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' Pizarro in
``Fidelio,'' Klingsor in ``Parsifal'' and Scarpia in ``Tosca.'' He
sang many smaller roles at the Met, too, and was frequently singled
out for his character acting.
</P>
<P>
   Meredith also performed with opera companies in Chicago,
Philadelphia and San Francisco, and in 1970 he made his European
debut as Scarpia at the Grand Theater in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a sister, Cecile Feldman of Minneapolis.

DUKE'S STARS ARE GONE, NOT ITS STAR POWER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an October luncheon and Mike Krzyzewski was supposed to
be offering a forecast for Duke's coming season. But the coach
could not look forward, or touch his sandwich, until he tried one
final explanation of what happened to last season's team. Looking
back at the Blue Devils team that won 37 games, was crowned as a
team for the ages and ended up losing to Connecticut in the
national title game, he could not hide his irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Not with the season _ a splendid one that fell short of a
championship in a wonderfully played final in the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. What bugged Krzyzewski
was what followed the championship defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The coach who had never lost an underclassman to the
professional draft suddenly had three turn aside the potential of a
Duke degree for the National Basketball Association. He expected
Elton Brand to leave and thought his big man was ready. But Brand's
fellow sophomore William Avery and the freshman Corey Maggette?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't support their decisions,'' Krzyzewski said. ``I'm
glad for them, but I know we didn't have four of the top 14 players
in the world on our team,'' he added, referring to the draft
positions of the trio, plus the graduating senior Trajan Langdon.
</P>
<P>
   Of this season's Blue Devils, Krzyzewski merely shrugged and
confessed he had no idea what a team with so many freshmen might
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had 60 percent of my team as freshmen,'' he said,
digging heartily into his meal. ``I got seven guys who are 17, 18.
I've got four guys 21 and 22. It's screwy how they relate. I'm not
sure it translates into 37 wins.''
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Now, after dropping its first two games of the
season in the Coaches vs. Cancer Classic at Madison Square Garden,
this team of all ages has won 18 straight and is ranked No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils head into Wednesday night's game against No. 23
Maryland possessing the kind of numbers that transcend consistency:
31 consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference victories and 46
consecutive home victories,
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're the best team in the country,'' North Carolina
Coach Bill Guthridge said after the Tar Heels lost, 90-86, in
overtime to the Blue Devils in Chapel Hill, N.C., last Thursday.
``Mike has done a tremendous job of molding those freshmen in with
Shane Battier and Chris Carrawell and Nate James.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there any better coach at taking wet clay and movable parts
and sculpting them into a potential championship team? No, because
in 20 years at Duke, Krzyzewski has built a self-sustaining
basketball brand name that recruits like a Wall Street law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Final Four appearances and two national championships
don't attract just any freshmen, but top-class starters like point
guard Jason Williams and forward Carlos Boozer, who along with
their fellow freshmen and key substitutes Mike Dunleavy and Nick
Horvath, contribute immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The team's top five freshmen, including Casey Sanders, have
combined for 854 of the team's 1,803 points (47 percent); 348 of
the team's 817 rebounds (43 percent); and 184 of 346 assists (53
percent).
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Blue Devils who stayed behind _ Battier, Carrawell
and James _ who have had the biggest impact on and off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the trio were the stagehands who moved the props
while the featured performers filled the spotlight. Swingman
Carrawell guarded the other team's best scorer and made the extra
pass. Battier ran down rebounds and drew offensive fouls. James
brought energy and few mistakes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the tricaptains are the strongest performers in an
ensemble cast. They have combined for an average of 44.8 points a
game to power a rebuilding team into one that scores 90.2 points a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were overlooked last year because we had all these guys who
could take over the game,'' said Carrawell, a senior who averages
18.3 points and shoots 51 percent from the field. ``We knew we
could do what we had to on the floor, but there were other issues
that needed to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, the three took a desperate plea Carrawell uttered
after dropping back-to-back games to Stanford and Connecticut _
``We need each other'' _ and turned it into a theme for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we'd roll the balls out and win by 30,'' Carrawell
said. ``This year we've won four games in overtime. No doubt we
were more talented last year, but now we're a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski's concern about how his team's two factions might
communicate was overcome early by a simple fact of life for most
college freshmen. ``We had cars, they didn't and needed rides,''
Carrawell said, laughing. ``We've kept them close ever since. We're
their big brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether captive in an automobile or on the practice floor, the
Duke captains have pounded a message into the underclassmen that,
Carrawell says, may have gotten lost late last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to play together and win a championship,'' he
said. ``We wanted to do that last year, but the hype was more about
how good we were and who was leaving early. The more we won the
more it built, and we may have gotten distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski, of course, has been fierce in keeping his Blue
Devils focused on the task at hand throughout this season. His team
ahead by 20 in the first half last Saturday against Virginia, the
coach erupted when no one came back to take an inbounds pass as the
Cavaliers applied full-court pressure.
</P>
<P>
   He yelled across the court at his players, called a timeout and
berated them. The Blue Devils went on to score on 15 of their next
18 possessions to build a 65-33 lead at the half; they won, 106-86.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hungry; the older guys are hungry,'' Carrawell said. ``I
know the younger guys may not get yet what we're after. They don't
have the experience of losing the last game for the title. But we
all have it and we're going to keep telling them until we get back
and win it.''

HONEYMOON ON FOR CUBAN AND NBA'S HIGH-TECH GROUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If NBA Entertainment is paying closer attention to new Mavericks
owner-in-waiting Mark Cuban, it isn't because he's some dot-com
billionaire bringing a cross-dressing rebound leader back into the
NBA.
</P>
<P>
   NBA Entertainment, which produces NBA.com along with other
NBA-related high-tech entities, is rightfully embracing Cuban as
one of its own. And Cuban, whose innovative Broadcast.com changed
the way we listen to sports on the Internet, represents the NBA
Entertainment's cyber-savvy style better than any dot-com
billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it's a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a depth of knowledge, experience and understanding
of this medium that few others have,'' said Adam Silver, chief
executive officer of NBA Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail, Cuban wrote that he's excited about bringing ideas
to the NBA: ``From media, to international, to every interactive
opportunity you can think of. The NBA has done a great job with
their Internet presence, and I will work with them any way they see
fit.''
</P>
<P>
   This relationship with Cuban and NBA's high-tech division
officially starts Friday when the league plays host to the first
NBA Technology Summit in San Francisco as part of the activities
surrounding the All-Star Game in nearby Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban is among the guests who'll participate in a series of
panel discussions about the future of sports programming in the
digital age. The panel is scheduled to discuss branding, content
development, strategic alliances and new media business models.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban isn't the first Internet billionaire to join the ranks of
NBA ownership. Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, bought the
Portland Trail Blazers in 1988. Allen later started Web development
company Starwave, which produced NBA.com before it was acquired by
the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA, Cuban is getting involved with a league that has
skillfully learned to use the Internet for information and an
interactive experience. From a basic public-relations tool a few
years ago, NBA.com has emerged into a site that showcases its
multimedia, including thousands of exclusive video and audio clips
and courtside robotic cameras. The site also is host for each
team's official site, with hundreds of pages of information on
players and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Where this relationship could get rocky is for audio rights.
Audio of NBA games were at first free on Broadcast.com, but the
league regained the rights and charges a $20 audio pass.
</P>
<P>
   Because the NBA keeps a firm grip on its licensing and broadcast
rights, Cuban's background in technology with Broadcast.com _ and
his budding reputation as a proactive owner _ might make for some
interesting power struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone can make it work, \RCuban\S can,'' said Patrick
Keane, an analyst for Jupiter Communications. ``He has incredibly
deep pockets.''

NETS RELEASE FRUSTRATION WITH FIRST-HALF OUTBURST
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ If all the misery, sadness and
frustration the New Jersey Nets endured over the last three weeks
could be made up for in 48 minutes, the recompense would look
something like what transpired Tuesday at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   There would be Nets shots penetrating the basket at an
uncommonly frequent rate; there would be chemistry, symmetry and
unity ingrained in the home team's offensive execution; and there
would be an opponent that overdosed on haplessness shortly before
the opening tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   As if fate felt sorry for the reeling Nets, that was the
scenario played out by them and the Boston Celtics Tuesday night.
Powered by an awesome display of offense in the first half, the
Nets recorded their highest point total of the season in routing
Boston, 131-113, before a pleased and perhaps stunned crowd of
15,836.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was a complete reversal of what occurred just four
days earlier at Boston's Fleet Center, when the Celtics overcame a
17-point deficit in the final 13 minutes to defeat the Nets,
100-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in the back of our minds _ that we lost a 17-point
lead,'' Stephon Marbury said. ``I was embarrassed. I was
embarrassed for me and for my little brother, who had to see that
on his birthday. That was tough for me. But we rebounded from that
game to this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury, who was referring to his brother Zack, made sure there
was no letdown this time. In a near perfect performance, he shot 10
of 12 and scored 30 points, and added 10 assists, four steals and
without having a turnover. He was matched by Keith Van Horn, who
also scored 30 points in tying a season high and grabbed nine
rebounds. But in the Nets' only downer of the night, Van Horn also
committed eight of the team's 14 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who won their second straight after losing 9 of 11,
rolled because of their performance in the opening 12 minutes.
Shooting a season-high 71 percent (17 for 24) and led by Marbury's
14 points, they grabbed a 46-23 lead. It was the most points scored
by a Nets team in the first quarter of a game and just two points
shy of the team mark for any period, set in the fourth quarter of a
game against the Detroit Pistons on March 9, 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets remained charmed in the second quarter, shooting 61
percent (11 for 18) as part of a season-high 74 first-half points.
The lead, which rose as high as 29 points, was 21 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   While the game already appeared to be over, anyone with
knowledge of the Nets' recent past had to be hesitant about
celebrating. The Nets had blown all manner of leads in their last
nine defeats. So even as the Nets jogged into the locker room with
a nearly insurmountable lead, there was a sense of apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   But this one was never competitive. Boston drew within 15 points
in the final quarter, but the Nets, who finished with a season-high
shooting percentage of 58 percent, held off the Celtics without
things getting scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we played defense like the Washington Generals trying
out for the next Harlem Globetrotters game,'' Celtics coach Rick
Pitino said. ``Our guys would all get starring roles. They were
fighting over who could get the leading role in the next Washington
Generals movie. I have nine candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Nets' first in four games this season
against Boston (21-27), and once again rekindled talk of making the
playoffs. Their margin of error at practically zero, the Nets are
viewing Wednesday's game at Philadelphia as a must-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to finish strong before the All-Star break,''
said Scott Burrell, who scored seven points off the bench. ``We're
trying to get three wins in our last three games. At 20-29, you can
work your way out of that right after the All-Star break. If you're
17-32 or whatever, it will be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be tough, if not impossible, regardless. After
Philadelphia, the Nets play Atlanta, Miami (twice), Minnesota, the
Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte. Then they start a five-game road
trip against Utah. Each of those teams except Atlanta appear headed
to the postseason.

AFTER UPSET, SETON HALL ASSUMES ROLE OF THE HUNTED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While preparing for Syracuse, Seton Hall Coach Tommy Amaker told
his players the improbability of a team going undefeated. If a loss
was inevitable, he asked, ``Why not us?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Seton Hall handed the fourth-ranked Orangemen their
first loss of the season Monday night, 69-67, at the Carrier Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Rutgers Coach Kevin Bannon was most likely telling his
Scarlet Knights that the Pirates will come to Piscataway, N.J.,
Wednesday night with visions of a top 25 ranking and a National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament berth, and asking his
players, ``Why not us?''
</P>
<P>
   Amaker, flattered with the notion that the Pirates would vault
into the national rankings, was quick to add the disclaimer that
Seton Hall has two games to play _ at Rutgers and against Boston
College at home Saturday _ before the votes are cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two more games to play this week before rankings come
out,'' Amaker said. ``Those things are wonderful to be a part of.
I'm not going to say it doesn't mean anything. It means a lot since
we haven't been there in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that's one of things Kevin is going to talk about.
But it's not like Syracuse. We're not a ranked team and not
undefeated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Seton Hall (16-4) might deserve to be ranked for the first
time since the end of the 1992-93 season. After a 10-18 record in
1996-97, the season before Amaker arrived, the Pirates have won 15
games in each of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   While their schedule does not rank among the tougher ones in the
nation, a fact that has kept them outside the Top 25, they do have
Big East victories over St. John's, which was ranked No. 19 at the
time, and at Syracuse (19-1). In the latest polls, they are in the
``others receiving votes'' category, sitting 29th in the Associated
Press poll and 32nd in the USA Today/ESPN poll. Other forms of
recognition have already trickled in. Even before the victory over
Syracuse, Darius Lane was named as the Big East rookie of the week
and Rimas Kaukenas was named as the conference's player of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in the afterglow of the upset, Seton Hall dismissed
the question of what they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about us beating Syracuse,'' the senior point guard
Shaheen Holloway said. ``It's about Seton Hall trying to make a
statement, trying to build and get better. That's what we're doing.
This was a step in the right direction for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a team that continues to try to get better every
day. I don't know about the Top 25. That's not in my power. But we
really don't want a lot of recognition. We want to earn our stuff.
If they pick us, then we've earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaker added: ``Those things are wonderful to be a part of. I'm
not going to say it doesn't mean anything. It means a lot, since we
haven't been there in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The first task though is getting past Rutgers (12-9, 4-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so important for us how we handle things, how we
prepare,'' Amaker said. ``What we try to preach to our kids is that
they have to believe we can do this. I believe Rutgers feels that
they're as good as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   For Amaker, this might seem like much ado about nothing, having
played for Duke, where he was a member of teams that went 108-30 in
four years and made five Final Four appearances in his nine years
as an assistant coach. But Duke was not the powerhouse it has
become after his playing time there and it is that turning point
under Coach Mike Krzyzewski that he cherishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited for Shaheen, for the other players, for our
school,'' Amaker said. ``I can remember being at Duke and we
weren't there either when I first got there. I remember the first
time being ranked, the first time going to the NCAA tournament in
Coach K's tenure. I can't tell you the excitement it gives you
being in on ground floor. That never goes away. The first few guys
there to lay the bricks down, they never forget it or are
forgotten.'' &QL;

COKE IN TALKS TO RESOLVE DISCRIMINATION SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
 ,  (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to put one of its largest image problems to rest,
Coca-Cola Co. has begun settlement talks with lawyers representing
eight current and former black employees who filed a
racial-discrimination lawsuit against the company nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
   No meetings have been held between Coke's lawyers, the lawyers
for the plaintiffs, and the mediator, who has not been identified
except as ``a neutral third party'' by the judge, Richard W. Story,
who set up the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Story ordered both sides on Jan. 25 ``to attempt in good faith
to settle this case by participating in nonbinding, confidential
mediation.'' At the same time, the litigation was allowed to
continue. In some cases, litigation is suspended when settlement
talks begin.
</P>
<P>
   The order was made public late Tuesday as a result of complaints
by the plaintiffs' lawyers that black employees laid off at Coke in
recent days were being asked, in exchange for receiving severance
pay, to sign waivers that would prevent them from taking part in
the lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status and would include
all past and present black workers.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, none of those workers knew about the settlement
talks, which might have influenced their decisions. It is not known
how many black Coke employees have waived their rights to
participate in the lawsuit so that they could receive severance pay
or early-retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The waivers advised those who received them to consult lawyers
representing the plaintiffs in the case before making any decision.
However, the lawyers were not allowed to mention the settlement
talks, because they were being kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that class members will know about the
existence of the mediation while deciding whether to stay in the
case or accept the enhanced severance package,'' said Cyrus Mehri,
a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coke announced it was laying off 6,000 people, about one-fifth
of its worldwide work force, on Jan. 26, the day Story issued the
original order, which Coke lawyers had asked the court to keep
under seal.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Jack L. Stahl, Coke's incoming president and
co-chairman of its diversity advisory council, said the company
welcomed the order. ``This process may take some time and its
outcome is uncertain,'' he said. ``Our hope, however, is that we
may be able to resolve this lawsuit in a way that is reasonable and
fair to all concerned: the plaintiffs, the prospective class
members, the company and its employees and shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The diversity council, also headed by Carl Ware, Coke's
executive vice president for corporate affairs and community
relations, was formed last year after the lawsuit was filed.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One civil rights leader in Atlanta praised the settlement
effort. ``Coke has got a chance now to really get its image
together,'' said Joe Beasley, the human resources director at the
Antioch Baptist Church North, steps from Coke's headquarters in
downtown Atlanta. Several members of Beasley's church have been
laid off and have had to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of
signing the waiver. ``We had some who didn't feel good about it,''
he said. ``They are still waiting. They have not signed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit prompted an e-mail message from M. Douglas Ivester,
Coke's chairman and chief executive, saying that ``we believe the
lawsuit is without merit.'' In the message, sent to all of the
company's employees in the United States, Ivester, who is stepping
down in April, added: ``I take these allegations seriously. And our
management takes them seriously. As you have heard me say many
times: We will do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said the settlement talks were an opportunity for the
company to do that. ``We hope Coke will go in and get it right, and
be fair to their loyal employees'' he said. ``Our admonition to
Coke is, go and sin no more. Be fair, be open. It's good
business.'' &QL;

HUSKIES KNEW WHEN TO LET LOOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The questions have been floating around. It gets that
way when the University of Washington basketball program is down on
its luck, especially after two trips to the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   (begin italic) Why can't the Huskies recruit better in-state?
</P>
<P>
   How come hometown guys like Doug Wrenn and Jamal Crawford don't
play for the Huskies? (end italic)
</P>
<P>
   Well, something says the hard-working guys over on Montlake are
feeling a bit relieved this week. Not that you would ever catch a
class act like Bob Bender gloating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only thing with both Jamal and Doug is that something
positive can come out of it. And that's always a possibility,'' the
UW coach said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anything beyond that is not really something I concern
myself with, nor should I, because my first obligation and priority
is with the team, getting ready to play Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Bender will say nothing to substantiate why his
program turns out to be better off without Wrenn and Crawford. Some
of Bender's assistants, however, are a little more to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful what you wish for,'' is how Huskies assistant coach
Byron Boudreaux put it.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because at the University of Connecticut, the defending
national champions, have fallen out of the Top 10, and word is that
Wrenn may have played his last game for UConn.
</P>
<P>
   Wrenn, a former Washington state basketball tournament MVP out
of O'Dea High School, was caught in a scam to exchange tickets for
clothing. He had been suspended for a game last week by UConn coach
Jim Calhoun, who reinstated the reserve small forward but did not
allow him to practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wrenn's poor judgment is one thing. The kid has a history of it,
including his decision to quit attending high school classes two
years ago in order to ruin his college eligibility so that he could
back out of his commitment to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Washington staff took the high road, letting time
roll on to prove why they weren't consumed by the loss of Wrenn.
</P>
<P>
   In Crawford's case, the unfolding controversy is a more broad
example of what can go wrong with a top athletic prospect whose
trust is placed in the hands of people who take shortcuts.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Michigan is finding out how costly it is to
have signed this talented player out of Rainier Beach High, even
when the Wolverines knew Crawford wanted to stay in school only
long enough to establish himself for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, the Wolverines' leading scorer this season, has been
suspended for six games _ one by the university, five by the NCAA.
And Tuesday, Michigan athletic director Tom Goss was forced to
resign in part because of the growing controversy surrounding
Crawford's relationship with a ``family friend'' who supplied
Crawford with cars, jewels and money.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has ordered Crawford to repay $15,000 in food, loans
and gifts to Barry Henthorn, a telecommunications executive in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's eligibility was jeopardized in the wake of
revelations that Henthorn allegedly went far beyond the scope of
what a loyal ``family friend'' would do for a teenage basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   Who's at fault? Whose problem is this? Are Wrenn and Crawford in
part victims of this system of entitlement set up all along the way
for athletic prospects? Or must they be held accountable, even when
punishment represents the loss of opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   Say anything you want about the duplicity of the NCAA and its
rules. The NCAA as an institution signs TV deals worth billions of
dollars but won't allow an assistant coach to give a player a ride
to practice, even if it's pouring rain.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA and its members generate millions of dollars off the
backs of so-called student-athletes and is therefore viewed as a
shady bunch of trenchcoat-wearing snoops out to bust some poor kid
looking to make out only a fraction as good as the coach with the
$300,000 sneaker deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until the NCAA comes up with some solution to compensate
these ``student-athlete/volunteer employees,'' the need for policy
and policing exist.
</P>
<P>
   If the NCAA is deemed petty and displays too much zeal in its
sleuthing, it's because you never know when the next University of
Minnesota scandal is going to erupt, where entire programs are
sustained by liars and cheats.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know everything about every kid who can
dribble or dunk a basketball, but it is certainly painful to find
out you didn't do your homework good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting is an inexact science,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm old-fashioned. To me, the university's image is the most
important point of pride. I would do nothing to diminish that. And
if you're ever even tempted, you don't take the shortcut because
you wouldn't do anything to hurt the university,'' he said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win a national championship. But what will I be
willing to do to win one, that's not a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies might be losing this season, but being clean enough
to squeak is almost worth it, considering the alternative.

CHRISTOPHER RIOS, 28, RAPPER KNOWN AS `BIG PUN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Rios, a 698-pound rapper who sold more than a
million albums under the name Big Pun, died on Monday. He was 28.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was problems related to extreme obesity, said Joseph
Cartagena, known as the rapper Fat Joe, who was also Rios' producer
and manager. The Associated Press reported that the final
determination of the cause of death by Dr. Louis Roh, a Westchester
County medical examiner, was pending.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, who lived in the Bronx with his wife, Liza, and his
children, Christopher, Vanessa and Amanda, was staying with his
family at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in White Plains, N.Y., while their
home was being renovated. He suddenly had trouble breathing, and
paramedics could not revive him. He was pronounced dead on arrival
at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Big Pun, short for Big Punisher, was a leader among the growing
ranks of Latino rappers; his family was Puerto Rican. The trademark
of his style was to take a deep breath and pour out rhyme after
quick-talking rhyme. His first album, ``Capital Punishment,'' which
mixed hints of salsa and a few Spanish lyrics with smooth
rhythm-and-blues tracks and stark New York hip-hop, sold more than
a million copies and was nominated for a Grammy Award last year. It
was the first platinum album by a solo Latino rapper.
</P>
<P>
   He described his style as ``sophisticated hard-core,'' bringing
the tough-talking realism of gangsta rap to concerns beyond tales
of crime and violence. ``I'm talking about everyday life, losing
your job, losing a loved one, stress, happiness, whatever,'' he
said in an interview with MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``People loved his charisma, his whole aura,'' Fat Joe said.
``They would love his lyrics, his breath control, his being able to
tongue-twist so many words, his punch lines, his being able to make
a song about pain and hurt and being able to make a song about good
times. He did it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rios had been a boxer and basketball player as a teen-ager but
then took to overeating until, he once said, he couldn't tie his
shoelaces. Early in his career, he called himself Big Moon Dog. Fat
Joe decided to work with him after Rios met him on a street corner
and recited a rhyme for him. ``I knew he was one of the great
ones,'' Fat Joe said.
</P>
<P>
   Big Punisher became part of the group of Latino rappers
associated with Fat Joe, called the Terror Squad. He appeared as a
guest on Fat Joe's 1998 album ``Don Cartagena'' and was one of the
few newcomers on ``The Mix Tape Vol. 1,'' assembled by the
influential disc jockey Funkmaster Flex.
</P>
<P>
   Big Pun's ``Capital Punishment,'' released in 1998 on Loud
Records, included the hit ``I'm Not a Player.'' He and Fat Joe had
their own float in the Puerto Rican Day parades in 1998 and 1999,
and they were in demand as guest rappers, appearing on albums and
singles by Heavy D, Brandy and the Ruff Ryders. They rap on
Jennifer Lopez's current hit, ``Feelin' So Good.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Pun appeared on ``The Terror Squad: The Album,'' which was
released in September. But his obesity made it increasingly
difficult for him to get around. Although he and Fat Joe were to
perform with Lopez on Feb. 5 on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,'' Big
Pun did not appear. He had completed a new album, ``Yeeeah Baby,''
that is to be released in April.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHEN PERSONAL APPEAL TRUMPS PARTY LABELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HOWELL RAINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Political consultants, pollsters and commentators like to nurse
the impression that political outcomes are highly predictable along
proven analytical lines, and sometimes they are. For example, a
Democratic presidential candidate with AFL-CIO backing is very hard
to defeat in the Iowa caucuses, as Bill Bradley wishes he had
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But even beyond upset-prone New Hampshire, there is a wild-card
factor in presidential politics that is much harder to predict, and
that has to do with the mysterious chemistry that develops between
certain candidates and those in the electorate usually referred to
as swing or crossover voters. They may be true independents or
people with wobbly party loyalty. They may be reacting to hard
times, war or a political crisis like Watergate or simply feeling
an inchoate longing for a leader who seems new, trustworthy or just
different.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, a candidate pops up who can get votes even
from people who understand that they disagree with the candidate on
specific issues or even broad ideology. In 1976 Jimmy Carter, with
his promise never to lie, ran strongly among independents and soft
Republicans offended by Watergate and among working-class Democrats
in the North who thought their party had drifted too far to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, those same culturally conservative Democrats
had become Reagan Democrats. Ronald Reagan won the presidency in
1980 by cutting deeply into such traditional Democratic blocs as
union members and urban Catholics. Reagan is remembered as the
classic example of the candidate with supra-ideological appeal, and
that is why John McCain paid a visit this week to Macomb County,
Mich., a Reagan blue-collar stronghold, to appeal openly for
independent and Democratic support. ``That's the way you lead the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, handily, the way to defeat a primary opponent who is
favored by the party establishment. A party's congressional
leadership and its governors seldom, if ever, favor insurgents who
try to flood their primaries with independents and crossovers. In
1976, establishment Democrats ginned up the Anybody But Carter
movement. In 1980, Northeastern and Beltway Republicans tried to
lure former President Gerald Ford out of retirement to stop Reagan,
whom they regarded as an unelectable extremist.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the greatest upsets of a seemingly inevitable nominee
came in 1952, when Dwight Eisenhower defeated ``Mr. Republican,''
Robert Taft. In that campaign, Peter G. Peterson, the New York
investment banker who became commerce secretary in 1972, was
polling and interviewing voters for a group called Citizens for
Eisenhower. The interviews, he recalled, showed that with
Eisenhower, ``there was something there that transcended the
issues. The stuff on Eisenhower would come pouring out: `That's a
guy I really like.' `I trust him.' `I really think he'd do the
right thing.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote up a memo,'' Peterson recalled, ``that talked about
the transcendent importance of character and trust and how it was a
far better strategy for Dwight Eisenhower to build on that than get
on overly gritty nuances of his positions and Taft's positions,
because he was seen as a transcendent figure that people trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to know whether McCain can sail above the issues
with a modern approximation of Ike's father-figure appeal. McCain
is a hotter and, potentially, a more divisive presence than
Eisenhower was in 1952. Tuesday, George W. Bush's surrogates were
condemning McCain as hotheaded and disloyal for airing commercials
that accuse Bush of Clintonesque dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   One danger for McCain is that he could wind up looking too
liberal for GOP voters and too conservative or overly abrasive to
independents and crossover Democrats he needs. There can be other
pitfalls as well for candidates who run as true outsiders. ``McCain
doesn't quite say if I ever lie to you, don't vote for me, but he
says something like that,'' says Jody Powell, who was Carter's
press secretary. ``He should remember that if you say that, the
press will hold you to it and decide that it is all right for all
the other candidates to lie since they never promised not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Another kind of expectation game is, however, working in
McCain's favor. Designated nominees are expected to operate with a
tough professionalism and steady competence that Bush has not
projected since he got tagged in New Hampshire. A defeat in South
Carolina could be an irremediable blow to his standing with a
Republican establishment whose support came to him so early and
easily.

FORMER TRADER SUES GOLDMAN, CHARGING FIRING WAS ILLEGAL
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former bond trader for Goldman Sachs Group contends
in a lawsuit that the investment bank fired him last year because
he was having an extramarital affair with a co-worker, and his boss
had religious objections to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The trader, Thomas R. Hudson Jr., sued Goldman in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan on Monday, complaining that he was a victim of
sex and religious discrimination and that, in firing him, the firm
had violated a federal civil rights statute, state labor laws and a
city human-rights law. In his complaint, Hudson, who is no longer
married, contends that because Goldman accepted his entertaining
clients at strip clubs he believed an inter-office romance would be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the firm, citing a policy of not discussing
legal matters, declined to comment on the suit. But people inside
the firm said that Hudson was not fired for having an affair with a
co-worker, but for denying the relationship when his bosses asked
him about it.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hudson nor his lawyer, William Roth, could be reached
for comment. According to records kept by the National Association
of Securities Dealers, Hudson now works for Amroc Investments in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, Hudson contends that he had been a successful
trader of distressed bank debt at Goldman for two years after being
hired away from a competitor, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., in 1997. He
contends that Goldman derived profits from his trading of about $10
million in 1997 and another $10 million to $15 million last year.
The complaint did not mention 1998. He was promoted and, before the
firm went public last may, it rewarded him with stock that is worth
about $5 million, according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   He is seeking $50 million in lost salary, bonus, stock and
future earnings, as well as damage to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year at Goldman, Hudson contends, he began having
an extramarital affair with a woman who worked on the same trading
floor. People at the firm said she also was dismissed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson says in the suit that he believed the relationship did
not violate the firm's rules because there was no prohibition in
the employee manual and because he had been encouraged by senior
Goldman officials, including John Urban, a managing director, to
take married men to strip clubs. He contends that the firm endorsed
such entertainment by reimbursing employees for expenses incurred
in the clubs.
</P>
<P>
   One of his bosses confronted him about the affair in June 1998
and told him it would not affect his standing at the firm, Hudson
contends, but Urban made clear that he disapproved of extramarital
affairs on religious grounds. After discussing the affair with
Urban one day last May, Hudson contends, he was fired.

MARINERS ASK GRIFFEY'S AGENT TO TALK TO REDS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This has been an unusual week in the recent life of Ken Griffey
Jr. No news outlet, legitimate or otherwise, has reported that the
Seattle Mariners are imminently trading him to the Cincinnati Reds.
Which is why it will probably happen this week.
</P>
<P>
   That development, however, remained highly unlikely Tuesday as
the Mariners threw up their empty hands and invited Griffey's agent
to talk to the Reds to see if he can get anywhere with them. The
invitation to Brian Goldberg, the agent, appeared to be a last-gasp
effort to resolve a potentially difficult problem for the Mariners
and grant Griffey's wish to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning,'' Goldberg said by telephone from Cincinnati,
``the Mariners said: `Brian, you try to break this thing. If you
can do something in the next couple days, fine. If not, let's shut
it down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Gillick, the Mariners' general manager, said he had not been
aware that Goldberg had been granted such permission, but Goldberg
said he had spoken with Chuck Armstrong, the club president.
Goldberg declined to say if he had talked with Jim Bowden, the
Reds' general manager, who despite his intense interest in
acquiring the slugging center fielder has resisted Gillick's
request for a package of some of the Reds' best young players.
</P>
<P>
   It may be to the Mariners' advantage if Goldberg has not spoken
with any Cincinnati executive. If he has, or even if he has not,
the Mariners face possible disciplinary action by the
commissioner's office. Baseball rules do not permit clubs to give a
player or his representative permission to speak to another club.
The only way that can happen is if two clubs agree on a trade, then
ask the commissioner's office for permission for the acquiring team
to talk to the player about a new contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure exactly what happened,'' said Rich Levin,
baseball's top public relations executive. ``If what we're hearing
is what happened, we'll have to investigate it and see where it
takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the Mariners have not had enough trouble with the Griffey
matter since he told them three months ago that he did not intend
to sign a new contract with them and they decided to trade him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any discussions with the Reds for probably
five, six days,'' Gillick said by telephone from Seattle. ``Right
now, we're thinking he'll be back in center field. Something could
happen, but I don't see anything happening. Right now I don't think
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillick said the Mariners would welcome Griffey back in the
lineup, even though they could lose him after the coming season as
a free agent. He dismissed the possibility that Griffey's presence
could create a reprise of the destructive situation that arose
after the Mariners failed to trade Randy Johnson, then their ace
pitcher, in similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I gather, Randy Johnson was a different animal,''
said Gillick, who joined the Mariners this off-season, ``This is
not Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his public comments, Griffey seems to have become
increasingly unhappy at the prospect of being a lame-duck member of
the Mariners. He recently told of a death threat he received at his
home in Orlando, Fla., in a letter postmarked from Seattle, calling
it ``the last straw'' in his determination to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is the elsewhere that has presented the primary problem.
Griffey began the off-season by giving the Mariners a list of teams
he would agree to go to. He has the right to veto a trade, because
he has been in the major leagues for at least 10 years, the last 5
with the same team.
</P>
<P>
   The process deteriorated when the Mariners went to Goldberg and
Griffey with a succession of possible trades to teams not on his
list. It seems the player and his agent knew the Mariners planned
to talk to other teams (the Yankees, for example) but, their
understanding was, only to try to drive up the price the Mariners
might eventually command for the player many consider to be the
best in the game today.
</P>
<P>
   After the first month, Griffey ended the charade, telling the
Mariners he would consent to be traded only to the Reds, who play
in the city where his father played and now coaches, and where
Griffey grew up.

CLAUDE AUTANT-LARA, 98, A FILM DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Claude Autant-Lara, the director who made his name with
films like ``Devil in the Flesh'' and ``The Red and the Black'' and
who made an infamous foray into far-right politics late in his
life, died on Saturday in a clinic in Antibes in the south of
France. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
   One of France's most prolific directors, Autant-Lara made more
than 30 films, many of which are classics of 1940s and '50s French
cinema. His work, characterized by emphasis on plotting and
dialogue and often based on literary adaptations, frequently
attacked or ridiculed social institutions and made provocative jabs
at bourgeois society. But in his lifetime, his politics veered 180
degrees. As a young man he was an avant-garde left-wing atheist. By
the time he left politics in 1989 he was a member of France's
far-right National Front party.
</P>
<P>
   Autant-Lara's career as a filmmaker reached its height in the
1950s with films like ``Le Diable au Corps'' (``Devil in the
Flesh''), which scandalized France with its steamy account of an
adolescent's affair with a young woman whose husband was away at
war. The sensation of its day, the film condemned those who
glorified adultery and tacitly criticized the war. The British
banned it for six years, finally releasing it with an X rating. But
the movie, starring Micheline Presle and Gerard Philipe, was also
seen as capturing the cynical mood of the postwar generation and
won several awards.
</P>
<P>
   Autant-Lara's best-known films also include ``Le Rouge et le
Noir'' (``The Red and the Black''), based on Stendahl's novel, and
``La Traversee de Paris'' (its English title was ``Four Bags
Full''), a black comedy about two men stealthily crossing Paris at
night during the German occupation, trying to sell suitcases full
of meat on the black market. He also directed ``Le Comte de Monte
Cristo'' and ``En Cas de Malheur'' (``Love Is My Profession''), in
which a young Brigitte Bardot lifts her skirt while flirting with a
lawyer played by Jean Gabin.
</P>
<P>
   Born Claude Autant on Aug. 5, 1901, as an adult he combined his
mother's and father's surnames. His architect father and actress
mother both adored the theater. His mother held strong pacifist
views, so unpopular in France during World War I that she took
refuge in England with her son. As a teen-ager Autant-Lara returned
to France, where he got his first film job painting sets for Marcel
L'Herbier's film ``Carnaval des Verites.'' He made his first short
films in the 1920s before heading to Hollywood in the '30s to
supervise the French versions of Buster Keaton films, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Back in France in 1932, Autant-Lara directed his first
feature-length film, ``Ciboulette,'' with Jacques Prevert, only to
have the producers cut a half-hour out of it without telling him.
The critics lambasted the film, and it was three years before he
made another. But during World War II his career really took off
with the witty and refined ``Le Mariage de Chiffon.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, Autant-Lara and his contemporaries in the French
``tradition of quality'' films came under sharp attack, notably
from Francois Truffaut, who argued that their films were ``stale''
and relied too much on adaptation of old material. Though
Autant-Lara continued making films into the 1970s, he was
effectively eclipsed by the more vital French New Wave filmmakers.
His last film, ``Gloria'' in 1977, was largely ignored by critics.
</P>
<P>
   Active in the 1950s as a spokesman for the film industry and
later as the head of several film trade unions, he emerged on the
national political scene in the late '80s. He was elected to the
European Parliament in 1989 as a member of the National Front,
though he soon resigned after the monthly magazine Globe quoted him
as saying that a French politician who survived a concentration
camp had been ``missed'' by the Nazis. He also cast doubt on the
existence of Auschwitz and said he was glad the Israelis had a home
and that he wished they would stay put there.
</P>
<P>
   Autant-Lara, who spent much of his life in the south of France,
was married to Ghislaine Auboin, who died several years ago. They
had no children.  &QL;

DOCTORS THINK BLOOD CLOT WAS CAUSE OF THOMAS' DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The blood clot that doctors think was responsible for Derrick
Thomas' death Tuesday is a common hazard for patients who spend
long periods confined to their beds.
</P>
<P>
   Pulmonary embolisms, as clots that enter the lungs are called,
affect 500,000 or more people in the United States each year. About
one in 10 cases proves fatal.
</P>
<P>
   And as in Thomas' case, death can come swiftly and unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing extremely well (Tuesday) morning,'' said Frank
Eismont, one of the surgeons at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami
who repaired the spinal injuries the Kansas City Chiefs' linebacker
suffered in a car crash last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``His spirits were good. He was joking with staff. He was joking
with his family. Does this come as a shock? Sure it does.''
</P>
<P>
   While they do not know with certainty why Thomas died, Eismont
said he and Barth Green, the other surgeon who operated on Thomas,
think a pulmonary embolism was the most likely cause.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kansas City doctors who have followed Thomas' case agreed.
</P>
<P>
   People like Thomas who suffer paraplegia _ the paralysis of
their legs _ are susceptible to pulmonary embolisms, said Paul
Arnold, a neurosurgeon and director of the spinal cord injury
center at the University of Kansas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``In paraplegia, it's standard to treat every patient'' for
pulmonary embolisms, Arnold said. ``That's because there's such a
high risk of getting them.''
</P>
<P>
   When patients are bedridden and are not able to move their legs,
blood can pool in the veins of their legs and pelvis. Clots can
form and grow steadily, filling the veins.
</P>
<P>
   ``These can be sizable veins with sizable clots,'' said John
Nelson, the physician who directs the intensive care unit at
Overland Park (Kan.) Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Long, cylindrical pieces of a clot can break off. The clot can
travel through veins into the heart and then lodge in the pulmonary
artery.
</P>
<P>
   That artery is a large blood vessel that carries blood from the
heart to the lungs, where the blood receives oxygen. A small clot
that partly blocks blood circulation to the lungs may cause chest
pain and shortness of breath.
</P>
<P>
   But if the clot is large, ``it tends to be catastrophic,'' said
Vincent Lem, a lung specialist at St. Luke's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   When a clot is large enough to block all blood flow to one or
both lungs, blood circulation in the body can stop. Blood pressure
drops, and the person loses consciousness. Death follows instantly.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had been making steady progress at Jackson Memorial
Hospital. He even received passes Saturday and Sunday to spend time
outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Thomas was in the hospital's rehabilitation
center getting ready to go to the gym for therapy. His mother,
Edith Morgan, and a nurse helped him out of his bed and into a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Just after he was seated, Thomas told his mother he wasn't
feeling well. His eyes rolled back in his head. He lost
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and other medical personnel rushed into his room, but
they were unable to resuscitate him.
</P>
<P>
   Eismont said precautions had been taken to prevent lethal blood
clots. Thomas was receiving injections of the blood-thinning drug
heparin.
</P>
<P>
   During his first week at the hospital, Thomas' legs were kept in
a sequential compression device, which works in a cycle, applying
pressure to the feet, then the calves and then the thighs to
squeeze dormant blood through the veins. Thomas later wore
compression stockings to keep blood from pooling in his legs.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an autopsy is performed, doctors won't be able to say
with complete confidence why Thomas died. Eismont said he was not
sure whether there would be an autopsy.

 CSU NEAR EQUITY FOR WOMEN IN SPORTS  &HT;     By TANYA SCHEVITZ 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The California State University system has made ``significant''
progress in increasing opportunities for women athletes, but nearly
half of its campuses still fall short of laws requiring equity in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   A report released Tuesday showed that 11 of the 19 CSU campuses
that offer college sports are meeting five-year goals set as part
of a settlement between CSU and the California National
Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
   The organization sued CSU in San Francisco Superior Court in
1993, alleging that the system was not complying with state and
federal laws requiring equal opportunities for women in college
sports. Under the settlement, CSU agreed to improve participation,
funding and scholarships for women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   The report found the CSU system as a whole is meeting the
agreement in terms of participation and funding, but missing its
goal of increased scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some campuses are not yet in compliance in one or
more areas: CSU Chico, CSU Bakersfield, CSU Los Angeles, CSU
Dominguez Hills, Sonoma State, CSU San Bernardino, CSU Northridge
and CSU Stanislaus. San Francisco State, San Jose State and CSU
Hayward were in compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very proud of our accomplishments during this period,''
John Welty,(cq) &LR;  CSU Fresno president and chair of the CSU/CalNOW
Consent Decree Monitoring Committee, said Tuesday at a news
conference in Los Angeles. ``However, we have not fully completed
the task and we will continue to take steps on individual
campuses.''
</P>
<P>
   He estimated it would take another two years.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Joplin, chair of the CalNOW athletic equity committee,
said that the organization is willing to give CSU extra time
instead of returning to court to force action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Significant progress has been made. All of the schools had a
very large gap to make up,'' Joplin said. ``We are taking them at
their word that they will continue compliance with the goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Systemwide, the proportion of female athletes grew from 34.7
percent in 1992-93 to 53.6 percent in 1998-99, an increase of 81
percent.
</P>
<P>
   CSU added 38 new sports for women, spent more than $40 million
on new or renovated facilities, increased funding for women's
athletics $29.8 million and gave $4.5 million in grants.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco State, Sonoma State and CSU Chico also eliminated
their football programs, at least in part to comply with the
agreement. And men's sports, from tennis to water polo and
volleyball, were discontinued at several campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Joplin said she will continue to monitor CSU's progress.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for:
</P>
<P>
   -- The percentage of female athletes on a campus to be within 5
percentage points of the percentage of NCAA-eligible women enrolled
on campus;
</P>
<P>
   -- The percentage of funding for women's athletics to be within
10 percentage points of the percentage of NCAA-eligible women
enrolled on campus, allowing an adjustment for more costly sports
such as football;
</P>
<P>
   -- And for women to receive grants for a portion of the total
that is within 5 percentage points of the percentage of
NCAA-eligible women enrolled on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Campuses not able to meet the schedule _ like Sonoma State,
which was 2.4 percentage points short of the participation and
grants goals _ have prepared reports detailing efforts that will be
undertaken to achieve the required criteria.
</P>
<P>
   California NOW has also lodged complaints against other
campuses, including Saint Mary's College in Moraga, the University
of California at Los Angeles, and the University of Southern
California. It has plans for more, Joplin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an issue that we have cared about for a long time,'' she
said.

NAVY EXPANDS SEARCH FOR FLIGHT 261 DEBRIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Navy will begin searching a new area of
the Pacific off the California coast for pieces of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 that may have broken off about the time it began a
horrifying, twisting dive from more than three miles above the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   During that final dive, the plane experienced negative ``G''
forces that aviation experts said would have violently thrown
anything not tied down into the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Radar signals showed what could have been pieces of the plane
floating down in the direction of the wind for up to 2{ minutes
after the plane hit the water, Jim Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a preliminary analysis of the flight data recorder _
one two ``black boxes'' pulled from the ocean last week _ Hall
revealed many new details about what was happening to the plane
during its final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall also disclosed something that was not on the recorder _
the plane's maintenance history.
</P>
<P>
   The McDonnell Douglas MD-83 had two previous stabilizer trim
maintenance write-ups, both of them in late 1999, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of Flight 261 had reported a serious problem with the
plane's stabilizer trim system and had been troubleshooting the
problem for more than a half-hour when the plane went out of
control and crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer is the wing-like piece on top of the tail that is
moved up or down _ or ``trimmed'' _ to help keep the plane stable.
A jetliner's nose has a tendency to pitch up or down in flight
because of the aerodynamics of the wing.
</P>
<P>
   After the first maintenance write up in October, Hall said, the
trim system on the MD-83 checked out okay and the plane was
returned to service.
</P>
<P>
   Then in November, Hall said, the alternate trim switch was
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83 has a primary and an alternate stabilizer trim system,
each driven by two electric motors. The primary system is
controlled by the pilots with two switches on their respective
control columns.
</P>
<P>
   The alternate system is used by the autopilot.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Evans, an Alaska spokesman in Seattle, said he could not
provide more details on the October and November maintenance. He
cited the safety board investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could Evans say whether two maintenance reports on the jet's
horizontal stabilizer in two months is unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 261 was on a flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to
Seattle, with a stop in San Francisco, when it crashed. All 88
people on the plane, including nearly 50 from Seattle, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   After takeoff from Puerto Vallarta, Hall said, the autopilot was
engaged at approximately 7,500 feet. About 13 minutes later, the
autopilot was disengaged when the aircraft was at 29,000 feet. In
the following three minutes, the plane climbed to 31,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder showed the crew flew the plane for 1
hour and 53 minutes with the autopilot disengaged, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the autopilot would be used during a long flight, and
the fact that the crew did not use it suggests an early problem
with the trim system, aviation experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not very normal,'' said John Hansman, head of the
aeronautics and astronautics department at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. ``Flying at cruise altitude with the
autopilot off makes it hard to have a good, smooth ride for
passengers in the back of the plane. ... There was something funny
apparently going on and these guys shut it (the autopilot) down and
were hand-flying the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 31 minutes of the flight, the pilots are known to
have been battling a jammed stabilizer. They had contacted Alaska
Airlines in Seattle and then an airline mechanic at Los Angeles to
discuss the stabilizer problem.
</P>
<P>
   The flight data recorder suggests the problem with the
stabilizer may have started early in the flight. The stabilizer
apparently would only move in one direction _ up _ which meant the
plane's nose would have pitched down. The pilots would have had to
counter this using the elevators that are attached to the rear of
the 40-foot-long stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Not long before the crash, the autopilot was re-engaged and
Flight 261 was cruising level at 31,000 feet at an airspeed of 301
knots, Hall said. The autopilot then disengaged _ it's not clear if
the crew turned it off _ and the stabilizer moved to its full
nose-down trim position in about 6 seconds, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane then began a steep dive, at 7,000 feet per minute _ or
more than three times the typical rate of descent from cruise
flight, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   It took about a minute for the crew to regain control, Hall
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder shows that it was about this time in
the flight that a flight attendant reported hearing a loud noise in
the rear of the plane. The pilots said they heard it, too. Hall
said investigators have reached no conclusions about the noise.
</P>
<P>
   During the initial steep descent, Hall said, the pilots deployed
the plane's speed brakes to try to slow it.
</P>
<P>
   When the pilots regained control, the plane was at 24,300 feet.
For the next nine minutes or so, the plane was in what Hall
described as ``controlled flight,'' and descended to 18,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of this period, the crew extended the plane's
flaps for about 30 seconds, and the plane was controllable in this
configuration, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Flaps are extended for landing because they provide more lift as
the plane slows. Experienced commercial pilots said Flight 261's
pilots wanted to see how stable the plane would be with the flaps
down as they prepared for an emergency landing at Los Angeles
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane was at about 18,000 feet, ``things began to
happen very quickly,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane was flying at 270 knots, with its nosed pitched down
2.7 degrees and the stabilizer in the full nose-down trim position.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Hall said, the flaps began to extend to 11
degrees. Three seconds later the slats on the front of the wing
started to deploy. Slats also help provide lift.
</P>
<P>
   Four seconds after the beginning of the flap deployment, Hall
said, the plane began to fall out of control. Its nose pitched down
at 26 degrees per second, eventually reaching 70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The jet subsequently rolled into an inverted dive and plunged
into the ocean in about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane began its final dive, Hall said, several ground
radar sites showed what could have been pieces coming off.
</P>
<P>
   ``These primary radar hits might be indicative _ and I emphasize
might be indicative _ of something coming off Flight 261 near this
point,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, however, if the pieces might have come off
before the dive, or immediately after it began.
</P>
<P>
   The cockpit voice recorder picked up a second loud noise about
the time the plane made the final dive, but Hall said investigators
had not yet identified that noise.
</P>
<P>
   John Thom, a Boeing MD-83 spokesman in Long Beach, Calif., said
the plane is structurally designed to be able to fly with a force
of negative 1 G.
</P>
<P>
   Hansman, the MIT aeronautics expert, said the plane was flying
above its structural limits in the final dive and that might
account for pieces coming off.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been part of the stabilizer, he said, but it might
also have been the plane's flaps or some other part.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy on Monday recovered two parts of the horizontal
stabilizer from the crash site, including an eight-foot section,
Hall said, adding that the entire wreckage will probably be
recovered as part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   If something did come off the plane as the radar data suggests,
Hall said, it would likely have hit the water about 4 miles from
the crash site. That's the area that the Navy plans to search.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has been able to find and retrieve small but key pieces
of airplanes that fell into the ocean before, including the cargo
door that ripped away from a United Airlines Boeing 747 after it
left Honolulu. The cargo door was found in water several thousand
feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Navy confirmed sonar was being used
yesterday to search for debris about four miles from where most of
the Alaska wreckage has settled on the ocean bottom. But the
spokesman refused to give a more exact location of the search.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County Medical Examiner Ron O'Halloran said three
people, all from the Seattle area, have been identified through
fingerprints or dental records and that their families have been
notified. They are Harry Stasinos, 54, of Brier; Meghann Hall, 19
of Enumclaw; and Joseph Knight, 54, of Snohomish.
</P>
<P>
   O'Halloran said he expects his office to quickly release more
names, but said some may never be identified. All the victims
appeared to have died immediately on impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Halloran indicated that the identification process will be
long and complicated.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10 bodies have been found, but all were too badly
injured for easy identification. In addition, ships have recovered
a substantial amount of partial remains.
</P>
<P>
   O'Halloran said fingerprints, dental records, tattoos, scars and
other means will be used to identify victims. In some cases, DNA
tests will be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the week since the crash, three U.S. jetliners have returned
to their gates because of stabilizer problems. Airline officials
said Monday at least two of the incidents probably can be traced to
pilots inadvertently overheating the motors by repeatedly testing
the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Boeing issued recommendations that any pilot with a
stabilizer problem simply complete the operating manual checklist
and, if that doesn't work, attempt no more trouble-shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priority should be given to landing at the nearest suitable
airport or where maintenance can be performed,'' Boeing said in an
update to operators of the DC-9, MD-80, MD-90 and Boeing 717.

FLAMINGO CASINO HAS ANOTHER PROSPECTIVE BUYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Flamingo Hilton Casino's grinning pink
mascot may soon be replaced by the Isle of Capri's rainbow-hued
macaw parrot.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri Casinos Inc. announced Tuesday it has struck a
deal with Hilton Hotels Corp. to buy the Flamingo. The proposed
$33.5 million deal faces approval by Kansas City authorities and
the Missouri Gaming Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Biloxi, Miss.-based Isle is the third prospective buyer of the
troubled Kansas City casino to emerge in the past year. Two other,
less lucrative, deals failed to win quick approval and fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always had a strong desire to extend `Isle style' to
the state of Missouri,'' said Isle President Jack Gallaway. He said
it was too early to talk about specific changes to the facility or
the fate of the Flamingo's 785 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make no guarantees,'' he said. ``We have no plans until we
understand the operation a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of the tentative sale was met with cautious optimism by
casino employees who have endured years of uncertainty over the
scandal-scarred casino's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Miller, acting general manager at the Flamingo, said
Tuesday that morale is somewhere between ``neutral to
positive....We've been down the aisle twice before and now we're
getting ready for a third trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isle of Capri is a good company and is a good fit for us,''
Miller said. ``There's excitement that we're finally moving
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, Hilton was forced to sell its Kansas City casino
or face Gaming Commission discipline over a $250,000 payment in
1993 that later was linked to city approval of Hilton's lease of
publicly owned riverfront land.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Commission forced Hilton to sell after the disclosure
of the payment in 1993 to associates of then-Kansas City Port
Authority Chairman Elbert Anderson. Anderson's political support
that year swung the deal for the Flamingo to be selected over two
other bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton later agreed to pay the government $655,000 in fines and
penalties to avoid a criminal trial and almost certain regulatory
woes in other states for its corporate behavior in the Anderson
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry shoved Hilton to the brink of being fined, suspended
or stripped of its Missouri gaming license _ where it remains
today. Hence, the pressure to sell the Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts Inc. agreed to buy the
Flamingo for $15 million, but when the Gaming Commission balked at
licensing the Trump organization, the purchase deal with Hilton
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Next came a bid by Station Casinos Inc. That $22.5 million deal
unraveled in the wake of Gaming Commission probe of questionable
legal fees paid by Station in years past to a St. Louis lawyer who
now is the subject of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said mandatory background checks of key Isle
executives and company finances will move quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two previous companies that attempted to buy it were
unable to consummate the deal,'' said Mel Fisher, executive
director of the Gaming Commission. ``It's important for the
commission, for the Hilton and certainly for all the employees
there that this issue gets resolved.''

   Isle of Capri operates seven casinos in Mississippi, Louisiana
and Colorado, and in recent months has made aggressive expansion
moves into Iowa and Missouri markets, including St. Louis and
Boonville.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo grosses around $6 million a month, equal to about
13 percent of Isle's posted casino revenues of $269.8 million for
the six months that ended Oct. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly traded Isle prides itself on what it calls ``Isle
style,'' a cookie-cutter approach to building and running casinos
with near-identical Caribbean-themed decor and amenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do a casino the way you can do a McDonald's,'' said
Timothy M. Hinkley, senior vice president for operations. ``But you
can standardize a great number of day-to-day procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's marketing strategies vary from city to city. But
Hinkley said each casino sports the same basic floor plan,
carpeting, wall coverings and color schemes, along with
Capri-trademark Farradday's restaurants, Calypso cafes, Banana
Cabana gift shops and Capri Club private lounges for high rollers
and preferred players.

FLAMINGO CASINO HAS ANOTHER PROSPECTIVE BUYER

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ...high rollers and preferred players.
</P>
<P>
   The company last year announced a development deal with singer
Wayne Newton to add live-theater venues at its casino locations,
starting with Tunica, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Hinkley said it was ``premature'' to speculate whether a Newton
theater or Capri hotel might be in Kansas City's future.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri founder and Chairman Bernard Goldstein was a key
player in winning the Iowa legislature's approval of riverboat
gaming in 1989. His companies subsequently operated two of the
nation's first modern-era riverboat casinos there in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   A Goldstein company also managed a riverboat casino operation in
Peoria, Ill., until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, a scrap-metal and river-barge tycoon, founded Casino
America Inc. in 1990. The company changed its name in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein also is chairman of the board of the Alter Cos.,
including Alter Barge Line Inc. and Alter Trucking. He has been
associated with the company since 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Goldstein was inducted into the National Rivers Hall
of Fame. He also co-wrote Navigating the Century, an
autobiographical look at American river commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and members of his family control about one-third of
Isle's common stock, which closed Tuesday on the Nasdaq at 13, up
1/16. The company's stock has tripled in value the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the pending deal in Kansas City, Isle of Capri is
negotiating rights to a riverboat casino project in Boonville. It
also is one of several companies pressing the Gaming Commission to
allow an additional riverboat casino operation in suburban St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri owns or has majority interest in riverboat casinos
in Biloxi, Tunica and Vicksburg in Mississippi, Bossier City and
Lake Charles in Louisiana, and a land-based casino and hotel in
Black Hawk, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns the Pompano Park harness racing track and
poker club in Florida, and 50 percent of the Enchanted Capri cruise
ship that sails from New Orleans on Caribbean excursions. An Isle
of Capri casino is on board.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado officials said the company's slate is clean since it
opened there in December 1998. Mississippi and Florida regulators
could not be reached Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Records show Louisiana regulators have fined the company for 10
minor rules infractions since 1994, including three instances when
underaged persons gained access to the casino floor. In each of
those cases the company paid a $1,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer and Louisiana anti-gambling activist C.B. Forgotston Jr.
said Tuesday, ``There's a taint to anybody that got a casino
license in Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the current trial of former Louisiana Gov. Edwin
Edwards over alleged payoffs for casino licenses.
</P>
<P>
   A list of nearly 60 unindicted co-conspirators made public in
that case includes at least three persons with past ties to Isle of
Capri.
</P>
<P>
   Those include Eddie DeBartolo Jr., the former San Francisco
49ers co-owner who has pleaded guilty to a felony stemming from the
Edwards investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The DeBartolo family-owned Louisiana Downs racetrack was
co-developer and co-owner with Isle in the company's Bossier City
casino. Isle bought out the DeBartolo family's interest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Mr. DeBartolo's activities with the former governor
occurred after we bought him out, and were actually competitive
with things we were looking to do,'' Isle general counsel Allan B.
Solomon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two others on the list, a lawyer and a former Casino America
executive, also left the company prior to their alleged involvement
with the indicted former governor, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana authorities combed Isle's history in the state, ``as
they did with all gaming companies in Louisiana, and we've had no
(improper) involvement whatsoever,'' said Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri is working toward a March closing of its announced
purchase of the Lady Luck Gaming Corp., which operates riverboats
in Coahoma and Natchez in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Isle also would acquire options on the Miss Marquette Casino in
Marquette, Iowa, and the Lady Luck Casino &AMP; Hotel in downtown Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate deal, Isle also is purchasing the Lady Luck
riverboat in Bettendorf, Iowa. The boat is co-owned by Lady Luck
and Goldstein's son Robert.

MISSING PIECES SOUGHT IN MIDAIR COLLISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff Writers Steve Carney and Stephanie Cain contributed to this
report.) 
BY HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ Investigators on Tuesday collected most of the
charred wreckage from a midair collision over the San Fernando
Valley that killed four people, but said they are still looking for
two pieces of an experimental plane involved in Monday's crash.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as local pilots expressed concern about dense air traffic
near the Newhall Pass, devastated families of the victims said the
two men piloting the planes were both experienced, competent
fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles D. Oliver, 53, of Glendora, pilot of the Questair
Venture experimental plane, had logged 18,000 hours of flying time
over the years, according to a spokesman for his employer, Peterson
Aviation in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Oliver said her husband was obsessed with flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved flying, and I think he'd almost rather fly than
breathe,'' Ann Oliver said. ``People would call home sometimes and
say, Is Charlie home? And I'd say, Are you kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver normally piloted Gulfstream IVs, the ``Rolls-Royces of
the skies,'' according to Peterson spokesman Joseph Molina, but at
the time of the crash was flying his own homemade two-seater plane,
which he had purchased only a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Oliver's job included ferrying celebrities around in
luxury planes. His passenger roster included Ronald Reagan, Bill
Cosby and Mariah Carey, Ann Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office has yet to
officially identify any of the victims through dental records,
family members said Oliver's passenger was Jean Bustos, 64, of La
Verne, a longtime family friend who learned flying from Oliver
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bustos' nephew, Jerry Hill of Phoenix described his aunt as
outgoing, gregarious and always up for an adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is she was doing something she loved to do,''
Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Bustos retired 10 years ago from her job as an administrator
with a Covina school district. She is survived by a daughter and
three sisters. Her husband died in 1957 when he was hit by a plane
propeller, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The occupants of the other single-engine plane, a Bellanca
Citabria, were identified by friends and family members as Thomas
E. Quist, 42, and Kevin P. Kaff, 22, both of Bakersfield. Quist
owned an oil pipeline surveying company, and Kaff had just started
working for him less than a month ago, according to Kaff's family.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin's uncle, Brent Kaff, said officials told the family that
Quist was flying the plane, although both men were considered able
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin's mother, Janice Kaff, said her family was devastated by
the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flying was his love,'' she recalled. ``He was responsible, he
was cautious. Kevin was a joy. He loved life.''
</P>
<P>
   According to National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Paul
Schlamm, investigators have placed the wreckage in a hangar, but
said there are two pieces still missing from the Questair Venture:
the aileron, a flap on the back edge of the wing used to help steer
the plane; and part of a wing tip.

Derrick Thomas, the Kansas City Chiefs linebacker who had been
showing remarkable progress in his recovery from a spinal injury
suffered in an auto accident last month, died Tuesday of a heart
attack.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas, 33, had been paralyzed from the chest down since the
Jan. 23 crash, which killed a close friend. Thomas went into
cardiac arrest Tuesday and couldn't be revived in the trauma center
at Jackson Memorial Hospital in his hometown of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a great part of this organization, a great player and
also a great person,'' said Chiefs president Carl Peterson, who
flew from Hawaii to Miami to visit Thomas on Monday. ``He was
upbeat. He was positive. He was Derrick.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Frank Eismont, a neurosurgeon at Jackson
Memorial, Thomas was being transferred from his bed to a wheelchair
when he said something to his mother and his eyes rolled back.
</P>
<P>
   While the exact cause of the heart attack has yet to be
determined, Dr. Barth Green said a massive blood clot was likely
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who in 1989 was the first building block in the
reconstruction of the Chiefs, was recovering from surgery that
stabilized his spinal column by using screws, rods and hooks. Bone
grafts had been implanted from his hip, and he was determined to
walk again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Derrick a couple of weeks ago, and he was flat and
immobile, and he wasn't in a good way,'' Peterson said. ``We took
him down, and he had his surgery, and he went through that
successfully. Things looked positive for what the situation was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday we got there and he was in therapy. I stepped out in
the hall, and coming down the hall was Derrick, in a wheelchair but
upbeat. I said, `Son, you're mobile.' And he said, `Father, I am.
I've got wheels.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there is any explanation to what transpired. I
know that he had the best medical assistance possible. I know that
these things do happen, unfortunately, with people who have had an
accident like Derrick. He has meant so much to this organization,
and not only as a great football player.''
</P>
<P>
   After reaching the playoffs one time in 17 years, Kansas City
owner Lamar Hunt made a decision in 1989 that turned around the
Chiefs and helped them develop into one of the most successful
franchises in the NFL. Hunt hired Peterson, who brought in Marty
Schottenheimer as head coach. Thomas was the first draft choice of
the Peterson/Schottenheimer era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our staff that sometimes we're fortunate that some
individual can transcend your life and be there and be special
about it,'' Peterson said. ``Derrick was one of those people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to be three things in life. He wanted to be the
greatest linebacker that ever played, and I think he came pretty
darn close to that. He wanted to be the greatest businessman that
could possibly be out there, and I know how hard he worked at that.
But he also wanted to be the greatest philanthropist _ the biggest
charity-giving guy there was.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was an All-American at Alabama and made the Pro Bowl nine
consecutive years. In 1993, he was named NFL Man of the Year for
his philanthropic efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Derrick told me yesterday that he wanted to make a public
statement himself in the very short future,'' Peterson said. ``He
wanted to express for himself and for his family, thank you to all
of those people, players, coaches, football staff, fans, friends
and loved ones throughout this country, for all their prayers, for
their letters of concern and for their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something good will come of this, because a good man left our
presence. I hope that people will do one thing, and I have
personally, ever since this tragedy happened: Buckle that seat
belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and the passenger who died weren't wearing seat belts
when their sport utility vehicle crashed Jan. 23 on an icy Missouri
highway. The passenger who was wearing a seat belt walked away with
minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, flags were lowered to half staff at Arrowhead
Stadium, and the Missouri Legislature paused for a moment of
silence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Thomas set an NFL record with seven sacks in a game. In
his career he had 126.5, ninth on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   At Super Bowl XXXIV, the Rams and Titans wore Thomas' No. 58 on
their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never looked at Derrick Thomas the football player,'' said
Chiefs coach Gunther Cunningham, who was Thomas' defensive
coordinator before he replaced Schottenheimer last year. ``I looked
at Derrick as one of the finer people I've ever been around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I'll always remember about Derrick is his smile.
Derrick will hang over this stadium forever.''
</P>
<P>
   During preparations for the Pro Bowl last week, Chiefs
cornerback James Hasty organized a postpractice telephone call from
the players to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire National Football League family is deeply saddened
by the death of Derrick Thomas,'' commissioner Paul Tagliabue said.
``Derrick's immense talent on the field was matched by his caring
and generous spirit in the Kansas City community.
</P>
<P>
   ``As both a player and an individual, Derrick leaves a
tremendously positive legacy that will permanently enrich everyone
whose life he touched. We extend our deepest sympathies to
Derrick's family, the Kansas City Chiefs organization and all of
Derrick's many friends and fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas grew up fatherless in Miami. His father was an Air Force
pilot killed in Vietnam. Each year, Thomas dedicated the Chiefs
game closest to Veterans Day to his father.

TIGER Woods is making the turn down by five to Byron Nelson but
charging hard.
</P>
<P>
   Who's your money on?
</P>
<P>
   The first six tournaments were the easy part, relatively
speaking, for Woods. But now he has passed the halfway mark on the
way to Nelson's remarkable feat of winning 11 PGA tournaments in a
row, and we all know how Woods performs down the stretch in a
seemingly impossible chase.
</P>
<P>
   We saw Woods at his eyes-focused, red-shirted, fist-pumping best
Monday afternoon in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, popping
a 97-yard wedge into the hole on the way to an unlikely win after
trailing by seven strokes with seven holes to go.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the winds of change will be howling and swirling around
him every weekend now, adding compelling plot twists to the drama
that is Tiger's story. Woods has entered an altogether different,
surreal world.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure will multiply with every swing of the club. Cameras
will click, and perhaps even soap operas will be pre-empted if the
tournament drags into Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds will push the ropes tighter and tighter around Woods as
throngs of fans stretch their necks and stand on their tiptoes
hoping to catch a glimpse of him.
</P>
<P>
   When he hits a shot, no matter if his playing partner has yet to
even address the ball, a mass of Tiger fanatics will sprint forward
to claim a spot near his next shot, spilling beer on each other,
elbowing their way to a better view, lifting children to their
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is making the turn in more ways than one. From superstar,
he is becoming supernatural, and it is only too good.
</P>
<P>
   To see Woods walk into a clubhouse now conjures memories of
Larry Bird's unforgettable words spoken in the locker room before
the NBA's 3-point shooting contest in 1988: ``All right, which of
you guys is playing for second?''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is popping in clutch shots against the odds despite
playing in a league where on any given day any of the world's
greatest players can get hot. He is like Bird with a wide-open
look, or Michael Jordan with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan won six NBA championships, each more captivating than the
previous one. Woods has won six tournaments in a row in much the
same manner, taking Monday's championship after seemingly being out
of contention.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of sports defined by numbers _ RBIs, yards per carry,
rebounds, goals scored _ no numbers transcend more than Joe
DiMaggio's 56 and Nelson's 11.
</P>
<P>
   Woods enters this weekend's Buick Invitational in La Jolla,
Calif., defending his six wins in a row, and it is said to be
impossible for him to realistically challenge Nelson's magical 11
of 1945.
</P>
<P>
   It might be improbable. But impossible?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not ever be amazed anymore,'' said Matt Gogel, the
unfortunate PGA rookie who had Monday's title all but won before
Woods began his charge.
</P>
<P>
   For most golfers, trailing by seven on the back nine at Pebble
Beach is the equivalent of facing the 1998 Utah Jazz at the Delta
Center in Game 6. The track was abounding with danger. The air was
heavy, and the Pacific Ocean crashed ominously close.
</P>
<P>
   But for Woods it was only a time to soar above them all, going
eagle, birdie, par, birdie over his last four holes and flashing
that toothy grin of his like it was all just a Nike commercial.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods to win five more tournaments consecutively indeed
seems improbable. Woods must tee it up Thursday after traveling
Tuesday and turning in only one practice round.
</P>
<P>
   Life in the PGA today also is worlds apart from the one Nelson
knew in 1945 and figures to catch up to anyone, even Woods.
Consider that during Nelson's run, he never played west of Texas,
the media demands were next to nil, and only a handful of
contenders could seriously threaten his hot streak.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, must overcome some 20 or more top contenders
from every corner of the world while being pulled in every
direction for appearances, pro-ams and media requests. Already, he
has won in Spain, Florida, California and Hawaii during the streak,
and his remaining schedule _ he tentatively figures to play on five
of the next nine weekends _ will take Woods through Northern
California, back to Florida and then on to Augusta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Woods teeing it up at the Masters with a chance to tie
Nelson's revered record. It might be asking too much. It might be
too surreal.
</P>
<P>
   But if Woods somehow continues his roll and makes it to 10 in a
row, we no longer will be asking, ``Who's your money on?''
</P>
<P>
   We'll be asking: ``All right, which of you guys is playing for
second?''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets have established something of a pattern. Stars get
hurt. The team takes a step or two back, then learns how to live
without someone who had seemed irreplaceable.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rockets got Steve Francis back from his injury Tuesday. But
they also learned to live without him, at least against a team even
more injury-ravaged than they are. Francis struggled, but the
Rockets rallied past the Cavaliers for a 91-83 win in which they
didn't need their star guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to tell people: It's not my team; it's all of
our team,'' Francis said. ``We all work hard. We were fortunate we
were able to play this way together.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis said he had no trouble with his right knee, but he felt
the effects of resting it for four days. He made two of 13 shots
for four points, his fewest of the season other than the three he
had in Dallas when he was ejected early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got to see what it's like to watch the game from the
bench,'' said Francis, who was limited to 24 minutes. ``It's not a
pleasant feeling. I was running pretty good, but I got tired. My
knee held up real well. I have to get my timing back.''
</P>
<P>
   After the same sort of slow shooting start _ 6-of-21 _ that had
doomed them at Minnesota and Detroit, the Rockets found a variety
of scoring sources who had not been there to the same extent when
Francis was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It moves around,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``Just
being a good team is having a good concept of `today is somebody
else's turn.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it was Shandon Anderson's turn. Anderson led the
Rockets with 23 points and 10 rebounds and added three steals. Walt
Williams made seven of 11 shots for 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the difference might have come off the bench. Hakeem
Olajuwon, Kenny Thomas and Cuttino Mobley were more than the
short-handed Cavaliers could handle in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has a lot of talent,'' Olajuwon said. ``You have to
realize that. It's utilized. The system now is the person in the
best position to score gets the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The win moved the Rockets to 13-13 at home, their first .500
record at Compaq Center this season. It was also just their second
fourth-quarter comeback of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important, finding a way to get it done,''
Tomjanovich said. ``Early in the year, it seemed like it was just
the opposite. One little area here or a missed assignment there
seemed to sting us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, who had been 1-24 when trailing after three
quarters, took control of the game as soon as the third quarter
made way for the fourth. In a span of five minutes, they outscored
the Cavaliers 18-3 to take a 79-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon made a pair of turnaround jumpers that were reminiscent
of his best days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad when he left the game,'' Cavaliers forward Shawn
Kemp said. ``The flash he showed lets you know how great of a
player he has been. I've always loved to watch Hakeem play.''
</P>
<P>
   Mobley and Thomas each drained 3-pointers. Anderson scored on a
pair of drives to the basket. And when Kelvin Cato replaced
Olajuwon, Mobley set him up inside for a layup. Thomas' two free
throws pushed the Rockets' lead to 12 with seven minutes left in
the game and the Cavaliers struggling badly.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland made just one of eight shots while committing four
turnovers to start the quarter. Kemp, who had 23 points and 10
rebounds but never took control of the game, finally scored on a
drive. But when Thomas answered with a 3, the Rockets had their
largest lead.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson put the win away with a drive on the baseline. He took
a hard foul from Kemp but still completed the drive for a
three-point play and an 87-75 lead with 2:12 left. By then, the
Cavaliers had made four of 16 shots with six turnovers in less than
10 minutes of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very inconsistent,'' Kemp said. ``We have a lot of
guys that are having to do a lot of different things they are not
used to doing. We are struggling, and we need to mature as a team.
Nights like this are frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of Cleveland's injuries, Kemp has remained healthy and
played in every game. But the Cavs' guards, pressed into starting
roles with little or no relief, did have their problems running the
offense Tuesday. Andre Miller had 21 points but committed six
turnovers. And Kemp, playing his usual role on the low block, had
eight turnovers as the Rockets came up with a season-high 14
steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we handled the ball too carelessly,'' Cavaliers
coach Randy Wittman said. ``Being short-handed, every possession is
important. Twenty-two turnovers was really the difference in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets, however, believed the difference was their defense.
After holding 13 consecutive opponents below 50 percent shooting,
they had allowed the last three to make more than half their shots.
As often as the Cavaliers turned the ball over, they also shot just
43.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more focus on defense,'' Anderson said. ``We realized
(that in) a lot of games our defense keeps us in the game. Even
though we weren't shooting the ball well, we did a good job
defensively. We got Kemp in foul trouble, so he wasn't as
aggressive.''

SONICS FALTER IN CRUNCH TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ They have been mostly a wayward bunch for the
better part of the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, though, the Sonics had managed enough gall to
battle with fervor in big games and show a steady hand in close
ones. They needed both of those qualities Tuesday night against the
San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, putting up a good fight just wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   Shoddy offensive execution derailed the Sonics in the final
moments of their 79-77 loss to the Spurs at the Alamodome. Coming
in, the Sonics had a hearty 7-1 record in games decided by four
points or less.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they were uncharacteristically meager in crunch time.
Too often the ball was in the wrong hands at the wrong times. That,
combined with poor decisions on defense, sent the Sonics to their
second consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game they should have won with a 77-71 lead and 3:23
left in the fourth quarter. However, the Sonics did not make a
field goal the rest of the game. The offense was so out of whack,
hardly any of their final field goal attempts were good shots,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just made stupid mistakes at the end of the game and didn't
execute,'' said Sonics point guard Gary Payton, who grabbed a
career-high 16 rebounds to go with 17 points. ``They ran off eight
straight points on us. We made dumb defensive moves and it cost
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup guard Shammond Williams played well enough to be on the
floor with Payton, Vin Baker, Brent Barry and Horace Grant in the
game's final minutes. But even though it was Williams' 20-footer
that put the Sonics ahead by six, his struggles at the end of the
game proved detrimental.
</P>
<P>
   After Tim Duncan scored on a bank shot over Grant to tie the
game at 77-77, Williams attempted a floater in the lane that fell
short. That led to the defensive blooper of the night when Baker
went to double-team Duncan moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Baker wasn't supposed to leave David Robinson. And when he did,
Duncan found Robinson under the basket with Barry standing next to
him. Robinson's dunk over Barry put the Spurs ahead with 28.9
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics called a timeout and were supposed to run a play for
Payton or call another timeout if it didn't work. But the 6-foot-1
Williams attempted a shot with Robinson, a foot taller, standing in
front of him. Robinson rejected the shot and the Sonics' comeback
bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got the ball I didn't see (Robinson),'' Williams said.
``It was a bad shot. Nothing more or less. It's that simple. And
basically it cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was fouled after the block and missed two free throws
to give the Sonics another opportunity to tie the game with 8.4
seconds left. This time, Payton caught the inbound pass, but
immediately drew a double team. Payton eventually got between Terry
Porter and Duncan to get the shot off, but his bank shot bounced
off the rim at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   For the Sonics, the final three minutes weren't exactly the type
of basketball the game's founders would have envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a different mix of guys in there, and the team bogged
down a little,'' Barry said. ``We fought hard and gave ourselves a
chance to win. Now we really have to focus on Dallas (tonight). We
need to go into the All-Star break on a good note.''
</P>
<P>
   Say it again.
</P>
<P>
   In losing to the Spurs for the first time in three games this
season, the Sonics suffered their seventh defeat in the last 10
games. Dallas typically is earmarked for a relatively easy victory
on the schedule. But the Mavericks are hot by their standards,
having won 10 of their past 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sonics did a decent job of holding the defending
champion Spurs down a notch, their offense is sputtering. Twice the
Sonics endured long scoring droughts against the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics managed just 11 points in the third quarter and went
nearly six minutes without a field goal. And then there was the
fruitless three minutes at the end of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was proud of our effort,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said.
`` ... We just couldn't make baskets near the end of the game. We
had some unfortunate choices, but we played hard.''

UNIVERSITY'S WOMEN RISE IN SPORTS, BUT NOT ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff Writers Robert Monroe and Chris Branam contributed to this
story) 
BY TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  LOS ANGELES _ California State University, Northridge, made
significant progress in opening sports to women in the past five
years but still lags behind other state university campuses, a
study released Tuesday found.
</P>
<P>
   The school ranked last in the 23-campus system for spending on
women's sports and second to last for scholarships and the number
of eligible women participating.
</P>
<P>
   The push to provide women athletes with more opportunities is
the result of a consent decree reached in a 1993 lawsuit filed by
the California National Organization for Women claiming that the
California State University system violated Title IX rules for
gender equity.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN officials said they believe they have worked diligently to
give women more chances to play sports, and they hope to close the
gap by potentially adding three more water polo, rowing and
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Also, CSUN may switch from the Big Sky Conference to the Big
West Conference, which would free up football scholarships that
could be used by women athletes in other sports, officials said. A
decision on whether to change conferences is expected today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've made tremendous progress,'' spokesman John
Chandler said. ``We've about tripled women's scholarships and
women's team funding. In terms of participation, we now have
actually more female athletes than we do male athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we add the additional women's teams over the next
several years, we fully expect to meet all the goals in the consent
decree.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Joplin, chairwoman of the CalNOW athletic equity
committee, said several factors explain why CSUN is behind in
reaching the goals, including its decision to keep football.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have put off hard decisions where other campuses have
bitten the bullet,'' Joplin said. ``They had a long road ahead, but
the new athletic director deserves a chance to move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   On campus Tuesday, male and female student athletes hailed gains
under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're still far shy of what men will get,'' said
softball pitcher Jessica Creith, a 21-year-old senior. ``Don't get
me wrong, you need men's sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's softball coach Janet Sherman lauded the progress but
said CSUN could be in compliance if not for football, which
requires 60 scholarships and has no equivalent for women on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took football out of that equation, we'd be equal,''
Sherman said, adding, however, that she does not advocate
eliminating football necessarily. ``I'm pro-sports and I think the
real crime here was in (the Cal State system) not giving any
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's report comes two years after CSUN dropped four men's
sports teams including baseball to comply with the requirements,
but reinstated them following community pressure.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN decided to keep its men's football team, while other CSU
schools including Fullerton and Long Beach dropped theirs to meet
the gender equity requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the state system made massive gains, and those not
in compliance including CSUN are close, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``CSU has made more progress in this area than probably any
other university system in the country,'' said John Welty,
president of California State University, Fresno, and chairman of
the CSU/Cal-NOW Consent Decree Monitoring Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires the percentage of women athletes on
campus to be within 5percent of the number of those who are
eligible under National Collegiate Athletic Association rules,
funding to be within 10 percent and grants to be within 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At CSUN, from 1993 to 1999, the number of women participating in
sports rose from 186, or 34.5 percent of total participation, to
242, or 53.3 percent. CSUN missed the goal by 2.7 percent, ranking
second lowest in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Team spending rose from $1.2 million, or 40 percent of total
spending, to $3.4 million, or 48 percent. CSUN ranked worst in the
state, missing the mark by 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships and grants rose from $250,000, or 40 percent of the
total, to $773,138, or 49 percent. CSUN ranked second worst in the
state, coming in 7.2 percent off the goal.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN attributed the low rankings to several factors, including
increases in female enrollment in the past two years that now
places the percentage of women at 61 percent, although other
schools have similar proportions. The statewide average is 56
percent.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN athletic director Dick Dull, who took over administration
of the Northridge athletics program in the fall, said he is
satisfied with the campus's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to look at this in the context of where we were when
the consent degree was signed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A key to reaching CSUN's goals involves its plan to add three
more women's sports and 80 more women athletes in the next three
years. Among the possible additions are water polo because it is
relatively inexpensive and one of the hottest sports for women in
Southern California, Dull said. Gymnastics and crew are other
possibilities, but both are expensive because of the equipment
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Further helping CSUN reach compliance will be its expected move
today from the Big Sky Conference to the Big West.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Sky requires 60 scholarships for football, but the Big
West does not compete in football, which would free up scholarships
for women's sports.

BANK OF AMERICA IS $3 MILLION BUYER OF LOANS.COM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The mask came off Tuesday when Bank of America
said it was the mysterious buyer of the Internet domain name
loans.com.
</P>
<P>
   The domain name, the Internet equivalent of an address, was sold
Jan. 28 by Universal City-based domain name broker and auctioneer
GreatDomains.com for $3 million. But the purchaser's identity had
remained a secret until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That price was the steepest paid to date for a domain name in an
auction and the third-highest price fetched by a domain name, said
Jeff Tinsley, GreatDomains.com's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America spokesman Scott Scredon said the domain name
will help the bank reach customers in areas it does not already
serve as well as deepen its reach to customers in states such as
California, where it has banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the bank to get entry into a new state or part of the
country through acquisition can cost billions of dollars,'' Scredon
said. ``When you look at what a Web site can do for you, the price
we paid is a lot less than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank plans to activate the domain name soon with a link to
its existing Web site with the hopes of bringing new customers in
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting the interest of such a huge customer as Bank of
America was a coup for GreatDomains.com, Tinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy that it's a big organization that bought the name,
someone that can put it to its best use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Siero, the San Jose computer consultant who in 1994
registered the domain name at no charge, said that although Bank of
America was the only bidder, he was happy with the price he got.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was actually my reserve (bid),'' He said. ``If they had
one competitor, who knows what it might have been?''
</P>
<P>
   Siero said he registered the name when he was managing a small
Internet service provider in the Bay Area. He had no idea of the
future commercial potential of the name at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were there early on, but even then we had a lot of
competition,'' Siero said. ``I wanted to differentiate myself from
(other) companies.''
</P>
<P>
   His intention at first was to attach the name to e-mail
addresses for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Loans.com isn't Siero's first entrepreneurial venture on the
net, but it is his most lucrative. Last year, he sold the name
postoffice.com for an undisclosed amount that included an equity
stake in the company formed around the name.
</P>
<P>
   ``That particular site _ in my modest opinion _ is going to
revolutionize e-mail. It's going to provide a better e-mail
interface than what's there now,'' said Siero,
</P>
<P>
   Siero said he will put his share of the sale price to good use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably going to use at least part of the proceeds to do
other entrepreneurial endeavors,'' Siero said.
</P>
<P>
   Siero said he wants to start an Internet incubator to help
entrepreneurs develop their ideas into working companies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Siero paid nothing to register the name loans.com, he
doesn't think of it as getting the name for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never thought of it that way. There was so much work
involved in running that small ISP,'' he said.

MINIMED PUMPED UP FOR EARNINGS REPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Strong sales in December are expected to drive an
increase in revenues for insulin pump maker MiniMed Inc. when the
company reports fourth-quarter results Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Faulkner, stock analyst with Chase Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, said a
November customer notification of problems with one of MiniMed's
products had little effect on sales.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are unsure of the revenue impact of the customer
notification, which pointed out a minor glitch in the pump's
software, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, December was a very strong month for the company,
indicating that once they sorted their problems out, the volume
took off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are estimating revenues between $61 million and $66
million, which translates to estimated earnings of 22 cents per
share, according to Thomson Financial's First Call service. The
company earned 17 cents per share in the 1998 fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my expectation that they will be certainly near the high
end,'' Faulkner said of sales.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year the First Call poll pegs MiniMed's earnings at
68 cents per share vs. 46 cents for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent MiniMed's stock slightly lower Tuesday in advance
of the earnings report, which is expected before the market opens
for trading this morning. The stock closed at $73.125 per share,
down 2.5625.
</P>
<P>
   The company dealt quickly with the software problem in its model
508 pump, which reset the rate at which it discharged insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Now MiniMed has bright spots in its future, Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those are a new insulin pump and the expected completion
of development of a consumer version of its glucose monitor, which
now is only available for use under close medical supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner predicts the company might file its application for
federal Food and Drug Administration approval of the consumer
version of the glucose monitor sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   An application filed during the first half of the year could
result in approval for sale in 2001, he said.

MAJOR E-COMMERCE WEB SITES ARE ATTACKED BY HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for new 17th graf reporting slowdown at Amazon.com) 
(bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL with SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hackers mounted what appeared to be coordinated
attacks on the world's largest electronic commerce sites Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which opened a window on the widespread
vulnerability of the Internet, began Monday with a three-hour
assault on Yahoo.com, one of the world's most popular Web sites,
and continued Tuesday, temporarily crippling at least four other
major sites, including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com. By Tuesday
night it had spread to a leading media site, CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Buy.com, an online retailer, and the popular
auction site eBay.com said they could not determine for certain
whether all the attacks were related or were by the same person or
persons.
</P>
<P>
   George Grotz, a spokesman for the San Francisco office of the
FBI, said: ``We are still in dialogue with Yahoo. We are aware of
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the attacks had been by the same people, Grotz
said, ``I think it would be premature at this point to say anything
along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But security experts and the companies themselves said the
nature of the attacks seemed too similar to be coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Levy, chief technology officer for SecurityFocus.com,
which researches computer security issues, said the scope of the
attacks was rare, if not unprecedented. He said the attackers had
managed to assault and take down some of the world's most heavily
enforced sites.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said the evidence suggested the attacks were related.
Significantly, he said given how many resources were required to
take down these sites, it would have been difficult for a copycat
who witnessed Monday's attack on Yahoo to have instantly have
followed suit in such similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt these are coming from the same individual or
group,'' echoed John Vranesevich, the founder of antionline.com, a
Web site focusing on computer security and hacking issues.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is unthinkable'' that several groups of hackers would have
access to this many computers used to direct the attack, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he expected to see a substantial response from the FBI
in the coming days. ``We're going to see some very busy law
enforcement tomorrow,'' he said. ``I picture planes full of FBI
agents heading to San Jose right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the attackers used what is known as distributed
denial of service, a technique that basically hijacks dozens or
even hundreds or computers around the Internet and instructs each
of the hijacked computers to bombard the target site with
meaningless data.
</P>
<P>
   As the site's server tries to accommodate all the phony data, it
soon runs out of memory and other resources. As a result, its
responses to real customers slows to a crawl or ceases altogether.
</P>
<P>
   However, while it cripples the servers ability to deliver Web
pages to customers, it does not violate the integrity of the
system, nor does it allow access to data stored on the server. So
while such attacks are an expensive form of vandalism, they do not
threaten sensitive data like credit card numbers or other consumer
information.
</P>
<P>
   While such attacks are not unusual, the intensity of the recent
attacks, as measured by the sheer number of computers thought to
have been hijacked for the effort, was virulent enough to bring
down e-commerce sites that are typically fortified enough to fend
off these kinds of assaults.
</P>
<P>
   An eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said the auction site became
inaccessible to some customers around 3:20 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time, and it was still struggling to thwart the attack two hours
later. He said the company had contacted Yahoo and Buy.com to seek
advice and assistance in defending its servers.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News reported Amazon.com was slowed for an hour by a
deluge of junk traffic that started at about 5 p.m. Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour assault on Buy.com started at 10:50 a.m. Pacific
time and, unfortunately for the company, the timing coincided with
the company's initial public offering of stock. In the first day of
trading, its shares closed at $25.125 each.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it was getting hit with data from ``more than 50''
computers on the Internet. The company said it was contacted this
morning by the FBI in connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Hawkins, chief executive of Buy.com, said the timing of the
attack on the day of the IPO was ``completely out of control,
needless to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some people get in, '' he said, ``but in most cases,
people couldn't get into the site.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the site ``clearly lost revenue'' though he did not know
how much. ``We were hoping to see an increase in traffic because of
the IPO.'' The stock opened at $27 and traded as high as $35.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich said the preliminary evidence suggested that the

IWERKS BACK AS PRESIDENT

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ The co-founder and namesake of Burbank-based
Iwerks Entertainment Inc. came out of retirement and assumed
day-to-day operation of the company Tuesday following the abrupt
exit of its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Don Iwerks will be the president and interim chief executive
officer replacing Charles Goldwater, who resigned effective
immediately to pursue other interests, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, previously president and chief executive of Mann
Theatres, led Iwerks for less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman declined to discuss Goldwater's departure.
Iwerks' earnings for the quarter ending Dec. 31 are due within a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Iwerks creates filmed entertainment and ride simulation
attractions, specializing in large-screen and 3-D formats. The
company was co-founded in 1986 by Stan Kensey and Iwerks, the son
of pioneering animator Ub Iwerks.
</P>
<P>
   Don Iwerks, who has held the title of chief technical officer,
said he would fill the chief executive post until a replacement for
Goldwater could be found.
</P>
<P>
   He said Iwerks board member Gary Matus will assist with the
company's overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as large-screen movies and ``location-based'' entertainment
have surged over the past several years, Iwerks has struggled due
to tough competition and some misguided forays away from its core
business.
</P>
<P>
   After going public in 1993, Iwerks stock hit a high of $37. In
the past year, though, the stock has climbed no higher than $5.25,
and has traded at close to $1.
</P>
<P>
   The company has lost millions of dollars in recent quarters, and
its staff has been cut in half to less than 90 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Iwerks expects to release results for the quarter that ended
Dec. 31 by no later than Monday. For the quarter that ended Sept.
30, the company lost $1.57 million on revenues of $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Iwerks claims the title of the industry leader in ride
simulation, but Toronto-based Imax Corp. strongly dominates
large-format theater. Iwerks sued Imax in 1996 for alleged
antitrust violations, but the case was dismissed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Iwerks attractions in California include a large-screen theater
at Hearst Castle and a ride simulator in the Dave &AMP; Buster's family
entertainment center in the Irvine Spectrum center. In all, Iwerks
has more than 250 installations in 38 countries, in locations as
diverse as theme parks, movie theaters, museums, shopping centers
and casinos.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Iwerks stock on the Nasdaq closed at $2.13, down 6
cents.

   INDONESIA-MALUKU (Ambon, Indonesia) _ Maluku, the former Spice

the society descends into chaos as religious and communal hatreds
boil to the surface, beyond the reach of the central government or

   MCCAIN-DOMESTIC-POLICY (Washington) _ John McCain is not a
policy wonk, at least when it comes to domestic concerns. His
assertion on the stump that he is the one ``fully prepared to

expertise in national security affairs. While he can speak in great
detail about unneeded weapons systems, he seems less fluent on the

Copernican revolution under way that puts the consumer at the
active center of the business universe. That's his vision of the
Internet economy, and he isn't by himself. Why listen to Professor
Prahalad? A decade ago, he and a colleague, Gary Hamel, opened up
new pathways in business thinking with a relatively simple but
powerful idea. They said that a business should think of itself not
as boxes on an organization chart but as a collection of skills _
competences _ that cut across internal boundaries. Break down those
boxes, they said. And most critical was that a company truly
understand its ``core competences.'' By Fred Andrews.

   MAINE-SHRIMP (New York) _ Even as some places in New York are
trying to jump-start spring with softshell crabs and shad roe in
February, a shellfish with its own short season is suddenly turning
up in fish markets and restaurants all over town. This winter
bounty is Maine shrimp, tiny shellfish from deep waters that are
rarely available fresh and almost never in the quantities flooding
markets this month. These are shrimp so tender and flavorful they
can be eaten raw. By Florence Fabricant.

<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: About a decade ago, Bruno
Prats, then the owner of Chateau Cos d'Estournel, in St.-Estephe,
declared that there would be no more bad vintages of wine. At the
time I considered his remarks the height of arrogance, a
characteristic not unknown among the Bordelais. I was wrong. His
was a bit of an overstatement, perhaps, but essentially, Prats was
right on the mark. Great wine may still be elusive, but rarely now
does a year go by that doesn't produce good wine, even in marginal
regions like Bordeaux where the weather is as risky as a dot-com
stock. The fact of the matter is that in the cellar and the
vineyard, the winemakers of the world have rendered the vintage
chart obsolete. By Frank J. Prial.

Riberas are on the shelves in the more affordable range of $18 to
$30 a bottle. By Eric Asimov.

LITTON TO SELL WEATHER SERVICES UNIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Litton Industries Inc. will sell its weather
services subsidiary for $120 million cash, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles-based defense company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to sell the company's Weather Services
International Corp. to Landmark Communications Inc., based in
Norfolk, Va., came after a disastrous Monday earnings warning from
Litton. That warning led to a sell-off that sliced about $5.81, or
nearly 14 percent, from Litton's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Randy Belote said the sale will help the company
concentrate on its core business.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement's timing was not related to the earnings
warning or its market impact, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has more to do with us continuing to analyze the assets
of the corporation and determine what is in the interest of our
investors,'' Belote said. ``This will have no effect (on) _ nor is
(it) tied to _ the second quarter earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the $120 million will be only a minor help after
officials' admission that they expect the company to report
earnings of 80 cents a share next month, far below the consensus of
$1.05 a share that was expected by analysts surveyed by Thompson
Financial First Call.
</P>
<P>
   Litton said cost overruns on two development contracts
contributed to the earnings shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock fell from $42.25 to $36.438 after the
earnings warning Monday. It rose slightly Tuesday, closing at
$36.625.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Campbell, an analyst with Lehman Brothers, said the stock
plunge reflects serious concerns about the company's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's management cannot be satisfied with a $36 stock
price,'' Campbell said. ``The law of the Serengeti is that the
limping die.''
</P>
<P>
   Litton acquired WSI, a leading weather services firm, in 1997 as
part of a larger purchase. WSI has about 230 employees and is based
in Billerica, Mass., a suburb of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed $120 million sale will require the approval of the
U.S. Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   An official with Landmark said no layoffs are expected at WSI.

UCLA OFFENSE IN STATE OF DISORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
The UCLA Bruins begin their most important stretch of the season
tonight against USC _ 10 games to determine their NCAA Tournament
fate and possibly shape the program's future.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After four months of practice, they should be confident,
cohesive and charging to a fabulous finish. The quality of their
play should be approaching the quality of their talent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Bruins (12-8, 3-6) are suffering from what appears
to be philosophical and tactical confusion about their offense.
Should they run a freewheeling motion attack or a methodical,
structured system? Their latest idea, conceived after the Stanford
defeat, is to merge motion and structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to get to is a hybrid of the two,'' UCLA coach
Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Get to?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty games into the season, shouldn't they be there?
</P>
<P>
   The decision hints at frustration and desperation. The Bruins
are tied for seventh in the Pac-10 and they've lost three
consecutive games for the first time in eight years. In each loss,
they suffered major offensive breakdowns at crucial times:
</P>
<P>
   _ They were scoreless for an astounding 6:37 of the second half
at Oregon. During that time, the Ducks scored 18 consecutive
points.
</P>
<P>
   _ They shot 36 percent and scored just 22 points in the first
half against No. 2 Stanford. The Cardinal had an insurmountable
16-point lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lavin attributed the Cal loss two days later to defense, but
lousy offense was UCLA's undoing. The Bruins shot 36.9 percent from
the field, they made two baskets in the last six minutes and did
not score on three possessions in the final 50 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mixing and matching,'' said assistant coach Jim Saia,
who oversees the offense. ``It's one of those things where we've
had some breakthroughs, but sometimes it takes awhile to learn a
new system. ... We've done a lot of positives on offense, but it
bogs down in stretches.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lavin replaced Jim Harrick before the 1996-97 season, the
Bruins used John Wooden's famed high-post offense, a structured
attack that emphasized precision, passing, shooting and screening.
A few months later, Lavin realized his sleek, slashing athletes
(Charles O'Bannon, Toby Bailey, Jelani McCoy) were best suited for
the formless, freewheeling motion offense. The move was
instrumental in UCLA's charge to the Pac-10 title.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins remained a motion team until last summer, when Lavin
and Saia switched to what they call the ``1-4 high.'' An offshoot
of Wooden's high post, the 1-4 places a premium on passing,
shooting, screening and cutting. (The motion, by contrast, relies
on athleticism, quickness and improvisation.)
</P>
<P>
   Lavin and Saia believed the spacing created in the 1-4 would
enable big men Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric to flourish in the low
post. When run correctly, the 1-4 is an effective attack. For
proof, Saia and Lavin point to the Jan. 27 victory over Oregon
State in which the Bruins dominated the final 10 minutes with crisp
passing and near-flawless execution.
</P>
<P>
   But that game was an illusion. The Beavers are in ninth place
and they have one of the worst defenses in the league. Everyone
looks good against them. Instead, consider UCLA's three
performances against the top teams in the conference, Stanford,
Arizona and Oregon:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Bruins lost each game by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   _ They averaged an anemic 60.7 points.
</P>
<P>
   _ They shot just 43 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   _ They had 37 assists and 58 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The problems begin with poor fundamentals. They don't set good
screens and they don't make hard cuts. They makes poor passes,
especially into the low post, and they take more bad shots than an
intramural team. Gadzuric hasn't developed a low-post move, so he's
often helpless with the ball. Ray Young, Rico Hines, Billy Knight,
Matt Barnes and Earl Watson are average 3-point shooters, so they
can't take advantage of the double teams inside.
</P>
<P>
   Without a foundation of fundamentals, without skills to match
the system, UCLA's offense consistently crumbles against good
defense.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Bruins don't run the 1-4 properly. They're
struggling with the reset action, which causes all that standing
around midway through the possession. (``Our players haven't
grasped that yet,'' Saia said.) As a result, Lavin scrapped the 1-4
and went to the motion in the second half of the Stanford game.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Saia and Lavin will combine the two, a move they say
is based on practicality, not panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is find a balance,'' Lavin said. ``When we
have those long stretches (of stagnation), it's because we're out
of rhythm. We're trying to get better rhythm and flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? It didn't against Cal. The Bruins shot 36.9
percent and had fewer assists (12) than turnovers (15). But there's
time. A victory tonight over USC and a split next week in Arizona
gets them back on NCAA Tournament pace. That's right. For all their
troubles, the Bruins are a win or two from salvaging the season.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, they're a loss or two from collapse. &QL;

USC'S BLUTHENTHAL STILL A WHIRLWIND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When David Bluthenthal was little, his family nicknamed him the
Tasmanian Devil, based on the wild, frolicking cartoon character.
Bluthenthal always seemed to be running all over the house, getting
into things and causing havoc.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was quiet, you had to go look for him, because he might
stick a pin in a light plug or something,'' said his father, Ralph
Bluthenthal. ``He was very active.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Bluthenthal has turned that boundless energy into a
special talent on USC's basketball team. The 6-foot-7 sophomore
forward tied a school-record with 28 rebounds against Arizona State
and has averaged a league-leading 10.1 rebounds in Pacific-10
Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a remarkable turnaround for a player who barely got
off the bench his freshman season, when he played just seven
minutes and averaged two points. The frustration from that season
was considerable. Bluthenthal entered USC as the City Section 4-A
Player of the Year, but was virtually invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year, people wrote me off,'' Bluthenthal said.
``Every game is a big game for me now. I think every game is
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby regretted that Bluthenthal didn't play
more following last season but is glad to have him today,
especially after the Trojans lost forwards Sam Clancy (broken foot)
and Jarvis Turner (broken ankle) two weeks ago with potentially
season-ending injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has been very patient to wait and let the game come to
him,'' Bibby said. ``This is his freshman year of playing
basketball. I wish we could have redshirted him last year. The kid
didn't play. This is his first year of playing college basketball
and first playing small forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal seemed a natural to attend USC. His great, great,
great grandfather was Isaias Hellman, one of the three major donors
of the land where USC sits in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But his lifelong dream was to play for UCLA. During his senior
year at Westchester High, he narrowed his choices to USC, UCLA and
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA wanted me to sign in the spring and I wanted to sign
early,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I think they wanted me in case they
didn't get JaRon Rush. They didn't pursue me as much as USC, and
they started to recruit me after USC. I visited Oklahoma State. But
it was too country. So I chose USC.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal probably regretted coming to USC during that
tumultuous freshman season, but he's too quiet and well-mannered to
complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always quiet, in his own way,'' Ralph Bluthenthal said.
``It was probably tougher on me than on him that he didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal didn't always internalize his feelings. When he was
4, he decided to run away from home. So he packed a small knapsack
with some clothes and tied it on the end of a stick. He started
walking down the street, with his family following in their van.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Bluthenthal turned the corner, his father
intentionally turned the van in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said, `Stop, he's screaming for us,' '' Ralph
Bluthenthal said. ``Then we opened the door and he didn't want to
get in the van.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the incident, David says, ``I don't remember much. I
think every kid did that.''
</P>
<P>
   A matter-of-fact answer to any question is typical for
Bluthenthal. After his 28-rebound performance against Arizona
State, he wasn't shocked or surprised by his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can top that,'' Bluthenthal said. ``I don't think it
was a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   He followed up the next game by scoring a career-high 26 points
in the Trojans' upset of Arizona, and immediately went from being a
role player to a key to USC's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's got a certain look in his eyes ... you can't stop
him,'' Ralph Bluthenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   Bluthenthal is now one of USC's top four players, with the
freedom to shoot at nearly any time without worrying about being
benched by Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The biggest difference) is confidence this year,''
Bluthenthal said. ``Knowing that I can play at this level. I think
I can deal with the pressure even though this is really my first
year playing college basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the stress of playing basketball isn't much compared to
the problems he has endured. Five years ago, his mother, Suzanne,
died from cancer. Bluthenthal, who is Jewish, owns a Star of David
that contains some of her ashes, but prefers not to wear it around
his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid of losing it,'' he said. ``It's definitely
something I hope to have the rest of my life. It is pretty special
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also something that he would probably prefer to keep
private. He doesn't like drawing attention to himself, and that
includes his personal style. Unlike many players, Bluthenthal does
not have any tattoos on his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Bird never had tattoos, Magic Johnson never had
tattoos,'' Bluthenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   It just wouldn't fit with his personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been more of a team player,'' Bluthenthal said.
``On this team, I've felt like more of a role player. But now that
(Clancy) is out, I guess I'll have to start taking more shots.'' &QL;

MABYE KAREEM WILL RISE WITH CLIPPERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as prolific at the word processor as he was
in the paint, has written his fourth book, this one a memoir of the
months the Hall of Fame center spent in 1998-99 coaching a high
school team at the White Mountain Apache Reservation in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Season on the Reservation'' (William Morrow and Company) is
about more than basketball, as we've come to expect from
Abdul-Jabbar. It's about race and history and self-realization. But
there's something for just plain basketball fans as well.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar jabs back at Magic Johnson and Kurt Rambis for
their criticisms of their old Showtime Lakers teammate. He explains
why he had to get away from the sport after retiring as a player in
1989. He discusses (yet again) his aloof image.
</P>
<P>
   And he expresses his frustrated desire to get back into big-time
basketball as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro and college executives seemed to be looking for people who
had come up through the ranks as coaches or who had always stayed
attached to the game,'' he writes. ``I was a loner, people said,
who didn't fit the corporate mold that some universities or pro
franchises were now pursuing.''
</P>
<P>
   He muses that he might prefer coaching at the college level _
``maybe I would be more at peace in the academic world.'' He adds,
``Or maybe the right opportunity in the NBA simply hadn't come
along yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the right opportunity might yet exist in the shadow of
Kareem's Beverly Hills home, if a certain local pro franchise shows
the imagination to consider him.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers fired head coach Chris Ford last week and put
assistant Jim Todd in charge on an interim basis. The move made
perfect sense since you can't fire the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the NBA's second-worse team improves fast, it will be
looking for another new head coach at the end of the season. And
Todd is not off to a promising start, losing his first two games,
one at home to the Chicago Bulls, the NBA's worst team.
</P>
<P>
   If (when) they go looking for their next coach, the Clippers can
settle for another NBA retread, of which Ford was one in a long
line. Or they can take the kind of gamble for which they are
uniquely suited, having so little to lose.
</P>
<P>
   How does Coach Kareem sound?
</P>
<P>
   It's a good fit for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem, being eager for a chance to coach, presumably would
accept a sub-market salary to do so, something that would appeal to
the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem would bring some intrigue and excitement to the Clippers'
corner of the Staples Center, and maybe a few more fans.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem, if the team showed any improvement under him, could,
with his presence alone, help the Clippers keep and attract free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem would be well qualified to coach the Clippers' young
front line. In fact, he once did some one-on-one tutoring with
7-foot center Michael Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   Kareem writes about his fear that ``certain aspects of the game
were being lost _ especially those having to do with how big men
should play basketball. ... The way I'd been taught to approach the
sport was fading. ...'' Let's see what he'd do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Being the leading scorer in pro basketball history doesn't
automatically qualify Kareem to be a great coach. Plenty of Hall of
Fame players in every sport have tried and failed.
</P>
<P>
   But recent ex-players seem to have a head start when it comes to
relating to current players. Kareem would have an edge in that
regard compared to the next Don Casey, Mike Schuler, Bob Weiss or
Bill Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   Does Kareem have the personality to coach? That might be the
trap-door question. So far the closest he has gotten to an NBA job
is an interview with the Washington Wizards last April. The Wizards
hired Gar Heard (prior career record: 9-44).
</P>
<P>
   Kareem has the interest, though. He told a CBS interviewer the
lack of job offers ``is kind of baffling'' and bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   And what if he gets the Clippers job but loses interest? At
least working for Donald Sterling for a year or two would provide
great material for book No. 5. &QL;

<P>
   &LR;  NEWHALL, Calif. _ Rescued after six days in Alaska's vast
wilderness, Rod Boyce wanted two things _ to hug his wife and to
eat a bacon cheeseburger.
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview Tuesday, the 1979 Hart High School
graduate, who lost the trail in a blizzard during a dog sled race,
said he got both his wishes Feb. 4, when rescuers finally spotted
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the trail was out there, Boyce said from Newhall,
northwest of Los Angeles. ``I just couldn't see it. I could hear
the snow machines. They would have gotten to me eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bad week in the mountains outside Fairbanks, where
avalanches were reported and high winds gusted more than 50 mph,
blowing about the helicopters as they searched for the 38-year-old
musher.
</P>
<P>
   During the longest six days of his life, Boyce said he shouted
in vain for the searchers he could hear in the distance and waved
his red jacket in hopes of being spotted.
</P>
<P>
   He ate sparingly from his meager food supply _ a bag of Reese's
Pieces candy, a sausage stick and the dehydrated lamb dog food he
shared with his team of 10 dogs. He said he melted snow on the
miniature camp stove he carried on his sled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always kept myself busy, I had 10 dogs to take care of,''
said Boyce, who moved to Alaska in 1991 after graduating from
Humbolt State University. ``I probably learned a lot more than if I
had finished the race.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Boyce, a reporter for a Fairbanks newspaper and
former editor of the College of the Canyons newspaper in Valencia,
was himself making news. He was feared dead as the overnight
temperatures dipped to a frigid 20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But when rescuers found him, he refused medical attention,
instead racing to his wife as she waited at the Soldotna Airport.
The bacon cheeseburger and a good night's sleep in a motel room
followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very lucky,'' said Tim DeSpain, spokesman for the Alaska
State Troopers. ``It is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyce, a rookie dog sled racer, was among 18 people who
participated in the Tutumena 200 Sled Dog Race, a two-day,
300-kilometer race. He took a wrong turn Jan. 30 as it began to
snow and ended up off the race trail.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled on for hours in the dark, hoping to rejoin the
other racers, but to no avail. Finally he set up camp and waited
for rescuers to find him. At that point he was 10 miles off the
race course.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next six days snuggled near a ridge in the Kenai
Peninsula's Caribou Hills, about 125 miles south of Anchorage. He
used his miniature stove to melt snow, heat food for his dogs and
dry out his gloves and socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I burned them a little, but they were dry,'' said Boyce, who
was dressed in ``refrigewear,'' heavily insulated clothing.
</P>
<P>
   At times he was frightened, especially at night, but the dogs
were good company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't very far to my next food bag, but I never got
there,'' said Boyce, adding that he was only 18 miles from the
second checkpoint. ``You can survive for a long time on water
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times Boyce heard snowmobiles and saw helicopters and,
although he yelled, swung his red jacket around and used a
headlight to send an SOS signal, his efforts were fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   He even used sticks he found in shrubs to spell out ``HELP,''
but got no results.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 55 snow machiners, nearly every Alaskan state trooper
and the Civil Air Patrol participated in his search, many others
volunteered to assist the searchers.
</P>
<P>
   DeSpain said Boyce survived because he was dressed for the cold
weather, had some survival gear and the weather was unseasonably
warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to know what to do to survive,'' DeSpain said.
``Sometimes people disappear and they aren't found till the summer.
They don't always have a good outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   As the weather cleared Friday, Boyce left his sled, hiked four
miles to a peak and spotted a snow machine trail, where he was
spotted by a retired Coast Guardsman.
</P>
<P>
   Though this was just his third race, Boyce said it will not be
his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the unofficial state sport,'' said Boyce. ``It's very,
very popular up here.''

LAKERS FORWARDS KEEP QUIET, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neither of the Lakers' small forwards was in much of a talking
mood Tuesday, but for vastly different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   An upbeat Rick Fox didn't want to jinx his hot streak. An upset
Glen Rice didn't want to say the wrong thing in the wake of another
benching.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson played Fox over Rice for the last 17 minutes
of Monday night's comeback victory over Denver. Rice sat stoically
on the bench and avoided reporters afterward _ a repeat of the
scene Feb. 1, when Rice was benched at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got no comment, man,'' Rice said Tuesday. A subject he
didn't want to touch? ``Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for his role in the near future, Rice said only, ``That's
something you've got to ask (Jackson).''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he'll continue to go with the hot hand from game to
game. Fox has averaged 11.0 points over the last two games, hitting
8 of 13 shots and 4 of 7 from 3-point range. He's also hitting
shots at key moments, though Jackson said the decision Monday was
intended to get ``more intense defense.''
</P>
<P>
   And he doesn't seem concerned about Rice's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he understands entirely,'' Jackson said, ``because you
have to ... coach to win a ballgame....
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a message. It's about winning ballgames. Glen had a
couple shots, they weren't going in, and Rick's been the guy that's
been shooting the ball well. So it's his opportunity to step out
there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is enjoying his resurgence and admits he's in a bit of a
groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, and from past experiences I don't really like to talk
about it too much,'' he said, ``but things are going well now.''
</P>
<P>
   TESTY: Jackson said the Lakers' two consecutive wins don't
necessarily mean they've turned a corner, and he made sure his
players knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very difficult practice today,'' he said. ``I was
coarse and I was demonstrative in what I want this team to be able
to do, that they could not do. There's some execution factors that
we're still short of being able to do that really upset me, so I'm
asking for more concentration, more focus from this team, and a
better direction, an idea. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Our individual strength, our individual abilities have given
us a record that's at the top of the league, but if we're satisfied
with that, it's still not going to be good enough when it comes
championship playoff time.''
</P>
<P>
   PASSING FANCY: Kobe Bryant's 11-assist effort Monday was no
anomaly. Over the previous three games, he put up five, eight and
nine assists and is averaging 8.3 over four games to raise his
season average to 4.3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's shooting the ball well from the outside and that
helps when he's shooting,'' Jackson said. &QL;

BILL WOULD HELP DODGERS, VERO BEACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In eight days, pitchers and catchers report to
Dodgertown, and amid the questions to be answered is the Dodgers'
future at their Vero Beach, Fla., training complex.
</P>
<P>
   Short on money after Florida Gov. Jeb Bush opted not to provide
$7.5 million in funding to Indian River County and Vero Beach last
year, state legislators are about to file a bill at the state's
capital that would allocate money for spring-training complexes,
and could keep the Dodgers' history with Vero Beach, which stands
at 52 years, intact for more years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is to be filed by Sen. Jack Latvala (R-Palm Harbor),
the Senate majority leader, and could provide as much as $7 million
to local municipalities to renovate or acquire a spring-training
site. The bill is also expected to be endorsed by Rep. Charles
Sembler (R-Indian River County) in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that could aid greatly in keeping the Dodgers
in Vero Beach,'' said David Cardwell, executive director and legal
counsel for the Grapefruit League Association. ``I think the
state's realized that losing a team to Arizona or Las Vegas is a
possibility, and I think they're going to take this serious. Sen.
Latvala wouldn't get involved in something like this if he didn't
think it would be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   City and county officials secured $12.5 million in funding last
year and that money is still available. The Dodgers had a deal
worked out with Vero Beach and Indian River County last year
contingent on Gov. Bush allocating funds, but when he pulled the
money back, the deal fell through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It passed through the House and Senate, but the Governor
wouldn't fund it,'' Dodgertown managing director Craig Callan said.
``He said it was because it was a deal that would benefit just one
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Latvala's bill would feed off that rejection, making a
similar outcome unlikely. It's designed to provide financial relief
to many areas of the state and could benefit the Dodgers, the
Philadelphia Phillies (Clearwater), the Toronto Blue Jays (Dunedin)
and the Baltimore Orioles (Fort Lauderdale). That would make it a
statewide proposition, Cardwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be interesting to see what goes on with that,'' Dodgers
president and COO Bob Graziano said. ``It's something we'll pay
close attention to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Latvala is working on the wording of the bill, which must
be filed by Feb. 18. Florida's legislative session begins March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are the only major-league club to own their spring
training complex, but they want to sell it to the city and/or
county and also have extensive renovations done to practice
facilities and Holman Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said the Dodgers haven't ruled out holding spring
training in Arizona in the future, but there isn't much movement on
that front.
</P>
<P>
   WAITING AND WAITING: The case was first brought to Major League
Baseball in mid-November, but the decision on the fate of Dodgers
third baseman Adrian Beltre appears to be far off. A hearing date
for Beltre's appeal to become a free agent hasn't been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, remains property of the Dodgers and he said he will
go to spring training on time. But with a decision weeks away, it
could leave the Dodgers in a difficult situation if the arbitrator
rules in favor of Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were unfortunate in regards to keeping Adrian, I don't
know if you can ever be totally prepared,'' Dodgers general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``You can't replace a young, athletic, talented
player.''
</P>
<P>
   TICKET TALK: Tickets for individual Dodgers games are
tentatively slated to go on sale March 10.... Devon White (shoulder
surgery) and Darren Dreifort (knee surgery) are expected to be
ready for the first day of spring training. &QL;

GRANVILLE STRUGGLING FOR USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Henry Bibby has attributed the Trojans'
two losses in a row to ``selfish play,'' and a specific area of
concern has been the inconsistent shooting of Brandon Granville.
The sophomore point guard made only 6 of 22 shots last weekend and
was 2 for 11 on 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a tendency to force it at times and a tendency to stand
around at times,'' Bibby said. ``I've given him the green light.
But the key is not to force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Granville said he isn't worried about his shooting slump, or
even taking too many shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned,'' Granville said. ``I know I need to shoot
the ball well for us to play as well as we can. Guys aren't leaving
me open as much and it makes it tougher to get a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bibby) hasn't said anything about forcing shots, but he gets
on me when I don't take open shots. Whenever I'm open, he wants me
to shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Granville's poor shooting comes just as USC (13-8, 6-3) plays
UCLA at Pauley Pavilion tonight, the site of his 0-for-10
performance last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually thought about it the other day. I don't know why,''
Granville said. ``But I'm not going to go in there stressing about
my shots.''
</P>
<P>
   CLANCY UPDATE: Forward Sam Clancy has progressed much faster
than expected from his broken foot and Bibby said he could return
to action within two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really healing quickly,'' Bibby said. ``Once he's ready
to practice, he's ready for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Jarvis Turner (broken ankle) is three to four weeks away
from returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we really miss Sam and Jarvis,'' Bibby said. ``I'm
looking at UCLA game tape now and we had Sam and Jarvis in that
game. We can still be in (tonight's) game ... but we definitely
miss them.''
</P>
<P>
   BEFORE AND AFTER: Since Clancy and Turner went down with
injuries, USC's team rebounding has dropped from 38.9 per game to
29.4. The Trojans' 3-point shooting has improved from 32 percent to
42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   STARTING LINEUP DILEMMA: Bibby said he was unsure whether to
start center Kostas Charissis or guard Nate Hair tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dilemma,'' Bibby said. ``I'm not sure yet what
I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby knows if he starts Hair, the Trojans will have five
offensive options, but he might need Charissis to combat UCLA post
players Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR SURGERY: Freshman center Luke Minor, who is redshirting
this season, had foot surgery that is expected to improve his
speed. Minor had several clawed toes, which meant doctors had to
break the toes nd insert pins to straighten them out.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he fully recovers, Minor is expected to have
increased mobility. Minor, 7-foot-3, has lost 30 pounds since the
fall and weighs 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   NO SIMILARITIES: Bibby was asked if tonight's game with UCLA
featured two teams in the same situation, fighting for an NCAA
Tournament bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 6-3. They're 3-6. We're not in the same boat,'' Bibby
said. ``We're not where they are. We've put together some solid
games. We haven't had too many letdown games.'' &QL;

<P>
   Shares in Reuters, the financial information and transaction
giant, soared 22 percent Tuesday to an all-time high after the
company moved to embrace the Internet and unveiled the biggest
reorganization in its 149-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The revamp, to cost (pounds sterling)300 million ($475 million)
over two years and result in annual savings of (pounds sterling)150
million ($240 million) thereafter, will see Reuters switch to
Internet protocol technology as well as offer its Instinet trading
platform to retail investors for the first time from midyear.
</P>
<P>
   The plans were unveiled as the company reported that 1999
pre-tax profit rose 9 percent to (pounds sterling)632 million (over
$1 billion).
</P>
<P>
   ``Reuters is no longer about the hundreds of thousands (of
market professionals), but the tens of millions (of retail
investors) in customer terms,'' said Peter Job, chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet opens up a new door for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Job said the company is considering floating Instinet and has
appointed advisers to prepare for an initial public offer of its
Greenhouse Fund, which has more than three dozen investments in Net
and technology companies such as Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   The Instinet IPO could value the unit at upwards of (pounds
sterling)4 billion ($6.4 billion), while the Greenhouse float could
achieve a valuation of (pounds sterling)1.5 billion ($2.5 billion),
according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Reuters' new structure will divide the company into three
divisions: Reuters Financial, comprising information, news and
professional trading solutions; Instinet and Reuterspace.
</P>
<P>
   The latter will group Internet media services, the Greenhouse
Fund, the Factiva online information joint venture with Dow Jones
and other ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the message, rather than the numbers,'' said Anthony de
Larrinaga, of SG Securities. ``It shows the measure of commitment
they're making to the consumer arena.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuters expects to invest (pounds sterling)200 million ($320
million) over four years to reposition the company for retail
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Aspects of its media and data content are available over 900 Web
sites and are being viewed by 40 million people a month, a figure
that Job said is growing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Two other ventures were also unveiled. Reuters and Multex.com,
an online intermediary for financial services, have formed Multex
Investor Europe to offer equities research, prices and news to
private investors.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal, the UK-based company will link with Aether
Systems of the U.S. to offer wireless financial transactions, which
will allow investors to trade shares over mobile phones later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Content, software and communications are indivisible,'' said
Job. ``That is the indivisible mix of convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Job forecast that the market for retail investor dealing and
information would be worth (pounds sterling)600 million ($950
million) in three years. In 1999, Reuters internet revenue was
(pounds sterling)15 million ($24 million), up 220 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company left its total dividend unchanged. Future dividends
will be based on the results of Reuters Financial with the
intention that payments will be covered at least 1.7 times by
underlying earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization sees Philip Green, chief executive of trading
solutions, join the main board. Andre Villeneuve will leave the
board immediately and remain chairman of Instinet, based in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   David Ure will leave the board in due course to focus on his
role as chairman of a communications networking technology venture
with Equant, announced last week. &QL;

   Shares in Reuters, the financial information and transaction
giant, soared 22 percent Tuesday to an all-time high after the
company moved to embrace the Internet and unveiled the biggest
reorganization in its 149-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The revamp, to cost (pounds sterling)300 million ($475 million)
over two years and result in annual savings of (pounds sterling)150
million ($240 million) thereafter, will see Reuters switch to
Internet protocol technology as well as offer its Instinet trading
platform to retail investors for the first time from midyear.
</P>
<P>
   The plans were unveiled as the company reported that 1999
pre-tax profit rose 9 percent to (pounds sterling)632 million (over
$1 billion).
</P>
<P>
   ``Reuters is no longer about the hundreds of thousands (of
market professionals), but the tens of millions (of retail
investors) in customer terms,'' said Peter Job, chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet opens up a new door for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Job said the company is considering floating Instinet and has
appointed advisers to prepare for an initial public offer of its

<P>
   PARIS _ A long-distance slugging match between Joerg Haider and
Jean-Marie Le Pen has upset efforts by the far-right in France to
take advantage of the rise to power of a ``sister'' party in
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen, president of the National Front, and Haider, president
of the Austrian Freedom Party, have exchanged belittling remarks
and outright insults in television and radio interviews this week.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen said that Haider had betrayed his principles by signing a
pro-EU blueprint for government, which ``submitted him to moral
control by the pedophile Socialists of Belgium and the crooked
Socialists of France, Germany and Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Haider was a ``young man at the head of a young
movement'' who had given ``hostages to conventional wisdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider, in an interview on French television, repeated his
admiration for British Prime Minister Tony Blair and refused all
comparison with Le Pen's National Front, which he had earlier
called a ``sect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian leader said that his party was an ``authentic
nationalist movement'' and implied that the French National Front _
and the breakaway National Movement _ were ``poor copies.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen had scheduled a radio interview and press conference to
try to bask in Haider's reflected glory. With his own party
plummeting in the polls, he said that the formation of the new
Austrian government proved that ``national parties'' could aspire
to power in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He also defended Haider, saying that he saw nothing in him that
was ``Nazi or neo-Nazi.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran NF leader, 72 this year, is said, however, to be
deeply irritated that Haider has snatched his mantle as the most
significant figure on the European far-right.
</P>
<P>
   Le Pen is wary of Haider for another reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian's policy of forming alliances with the
``traditional'' right is something Le Pen has always refused. This
was one of the issues on which he split last year with his former
lieutenant, Bruno Megret, who now heads a rival movement which is
actively seeking deals with mainstream parties.
</P>
<P>
   Megret called a demonstration of his troops outside the Austrian
embassy at the weekend, to show solidarity with Haider against the
``bullying'' tactics of the EU. The Austrian rewarded Megret on
French television by dismissing him in the same breath as Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
   The episode suggests that fears of a concerted rise by the
far-right in Europe may be exaggerated. Parties rooted in the
suspicion of foreigners have difficulty in cooperating with
``sister'' parties in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   The implosion of Le Pen's National Front in the last 14 months
also places in context the capacity of the far-right to maintain a
consistent challenge for power in modern, European democracies.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons between Austria and France are difficult; Le Pen,
even at the height of his popularity, was never invited to join a
government coalition at national level. (Alliances do exist between
the NF and the center-right at regional level.)
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as recently as two years ago the French National
Front was seen as a powerful and baleful presence in European
politics, which would not easily be dislodged and would help the
rise of the far-right elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since the party split in December 1998, both halves of the NF
have rapidly lost electoral strength. In a parliamentary
by-election in Paris in December, the NF candidate scored just over
five 5 percent, compared to 13.4 percent in the last general
election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the NF was partly caused by personal vanities and
ambitions and the internal contradictions of a party composed of
mutually-hating factions, from Catholic fundamentalists to pagans.
</P>
<P>
   However, the breakup was hastened by a strategic quarrel over
precisely the issue which now faces Haider. Can populist
ultra-right parties survive contact with the messy, real world of
government? &QL;

DUCKS KNOCK OFF KINGS, 5-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Mighty Ducks a one-line or two-man team?
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to the Kings, who were defeated 5-3 by the
Ducks as Anaheim extended its unbeaten streak to five games (3-0-2)
before 18,118 at Staples Center on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim scored five times on its first 13 shots even though Paul
Kariya and Teemu Selanne combined for just two shots in the first
two periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 3-1 lead thanks to the play of a promising
young center, a precocious 19-year old defenseman, a journeyman
forward, a winger picked up in the waiver draft and a defenseman
who is beginning to play like the star many expected him to become.
</P>
<P>
   And after those unlikely suspects threw the body shots, Steve
Rucchin, Kariya and Selanne delivered the knockout blows in a
victory that moved Anaheim into ninth place and within one point of
the eighth-place Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are two months away, but the Ducks know their
playoff hopes are on the line right now. And in their first-ever
game at Staples Center, they sent a strong message to a stunned
L.A. team that was booed off the ice after giving up four goals in
the last 10:09 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps symbolic of Anaheim's new commitment to excellence,
the Ducks weren't satisfied with the way they won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play a strong game and we know that,'' said Ducks
coach Craig Hartsburg. ''We can't expect to play 10 minutes and win
every night.... but we'll take it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Tverdovsky, who had a goal and an assist, said the Kings
dominated much of the game, but when the Ducks struck, they struck
hard. Anaheim scored four times in a eight-shot span of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   With the scored tied 1-1 midway through the second period, the
most unlikely Duck opened the floodgates for Anaheim. Rookie
defenseman Vitaly Vishnevski, playing in his seventh NHL game, made
the most of some rare power-play time ``everybody else was tired,''
said Hartsburg and scored on a point shot through a screen after
newcomer Kip Miller (two assists) kept the puck alive by knocking
it off the dasher with his glove and getting it to Cullen. The
Ducks second-line center, who also had a goal and an assist, sent
it back to Vishnevski, who scored at 9: 51. It was his first career
point and marked the fifth consecutive game the Ducks have scored a
power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Next it was Ladislav Kohn's turn to make a big play. The winger,
whom the Ducks acquired just before the season in the waiver draft,
bounced off a big hit by Sean O'Donnell and got the puck to Mike
Leclerc. Stephane Fiset stopped the winger's shot, but Tverdovsky
extended his point-scoring scoring streak to eight games when he
picked up the rebound and scored at 14:33.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect them to score as much as Paul and Teemu, but
they can contribute,'' said Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team needs goals from players other than the superstars,''
said Tverdovsky. ``Good teams like Detroit have third and fourth
lines that kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   With a two-goal cushion to work with, Anaheim's stars went to
work. From behind the net, Selanne extended his scoring streak to
eight games by setting up Rucchin for a one-timer from the slot at
16:09 that upped the lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The recently energized Ducks power play, ranked 24th in the
league, has scored nine goals in the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya was held without a shot for 39 minutes, but he made the
most of his first chance when he was set up on a breakaway by
Rucchi, who made the pass from his knees. Alone from the red line
in, Kariya put a shot through Fiset's legs at 19:00 for his 31st
goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who outshot the Ducks 34-21 in the game, got goals
from Glen Murray and Bryan Smolinski in the third, but thanks to
another strong effort from Hebert, the Ducks held on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We leave happy, but we didn't play a solid 60 minutes,'' said
Cullen. ``We know we can't count on that type of outburst every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressing the action much of the game, the Kings weren't
so happy as they left the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't do anything special,'' said Smolinski. ``It was
our mental breakdowns. We had a lapse in the second period and it
cost us dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first period was played in the Ducks end of the ice
and the Kings had a 11-5 advantage in shots, but Anaheim left the
ice tied 1-1 after 20 minutes and might have taken a lead to the
dressing room if not for an overaggressive hit by Pascal Trepanier
while the Ducks were attempting to kill off a penalty to Ted
Donato.
</P>
<P>
   Trepanier was in the penalty box when Gary Galley left a nice
drop pass for Jozef Stumpel and the center beat Hebert at 6:34 to
tie the game 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Even though neither Kariya nor Selanne managed a shot on goal in
the first period, the Ducks took a 1-0 lead at 2:49 when Cullen
scored on the Ducks' first shot of the game. The Anaheim center got
a pass from Miller at the right side of the net and scored his
ninth goal of the season on his second whack at the puck after
fanning on his first attempt. &QL;

   PARIS _ A long-distance slugging match between Joerg Haider and

precisely the issue which now faces Haider. Can populist
ultra-right parties survive contact with the messy, real world of
government? &QL;

   BAALBEK _ Lebanon was on the verge of all-out war with Israel
Tuesday night _ perhaps drawing in tens of thousands of Syrian
troops _ after Israel unilaterally withdrew from the 1996
cease-fire agreement and lost yet another of its soldiers to
Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's decision, which in effect converts the south of Lebanon
with its large civilian population into a free-fire zone, followed
a nightlong blitz by Israel of Lebanon's major power stations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite condemnation from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and
a warning from Syria that the air raids were striking at the heart
of the ``peace'' process, Israel seemed intent on a new military
adventure in southern Lebanon after suffering six fatalities among
its occupation force in the country within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli attacks wounded 17 civilians and targeted three
electricity switching stations outside Beirut, Tripoli and Baalbek.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 agreement, upon which Israel reneged Tuesday, created a
five-nation cease-fire monitoring group of the United States,
France, Syria, Israel and Lebanon following the Israeli massacre of
more than a hundred Lebanese civilians in the Lebanese village of
Qana. The agreement was specifically set up to safeguard civilian
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The nighttime Israeli assault early Tuesday morning was both a
demonstration of how grievously it could hurt the tiny country of
Lebanon and an Israeli admission of defeat at the hands of the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla movement.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is now cutting down Israeli occupation soldiers at the
rate of three a week.
</P>
<P>
   Destroying the infrastructure of Lebanon _ the country is likely
to suffer a year of power cuts as a result _ was a clear
acknowledgement that Israel cannot halt the attacks on its
occupation army by striking directly at the Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   And with Israel still demanding a peace treaty and security
guarantees from Syria before it hands back the occupied Syrian
Golan Heights, Damascus has little reason to urge the Hezbollah to
end its assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Israeli soldier to die in southern Lebanon was killed
by a handheld Saggar missile fired by a Hezbollah guerrilla at an
Israeli position inside the occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   The massive air raids a few hours earlier were supposed to have
taught Lebanon and Syria that such attacks must end _ a lesson
which the Hezbollah simply ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Israelis are threatening a further ``lesson'' to the
Lebanese. ``God help us tonight,'' a Lebanese journalist said
Tuesday evening as total darkness settled once more over the
Lebanese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Almost the entire country was without electricity throughout the
day while the Hezbollah said that it ``reserved the right to
retaliate at the appropriate time'' for the Israeli raids.
</P>
<P>
   Before the air attacks, Israel told its tens of thousands of
residents south of the Lebanese frontiers to stay in underground
shelters. But the Hezbollah have not so far fired a single rocket
in revenge across the border. Its statement, however, means that
Galilee residents will have to stay in their shelters indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   With at least 21,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon, any further
escalation in the war could easily involve Syrian President Hafez
Assad's army.
</P>
<P>
   Along the old Roman roads of the Bekaa Valley Tuesday, Syrian
troops in steel helmets manned checkpoints with bayonets fixed,
their antiaircraft guns dug into new revetments mounted with air
radar vans.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few short weeks ago, Assad was praising Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's courage and honesty. But Tuesday, one of
Syria's government-run newspapers was condemning Barak's ``racist
and criminal policies'' for attacks which ``have struck the last
nail into the coffin of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Most western nations moved through the familiar liturgy adopted
on such occasions _ by urging ``both sides to exercise restraint.''
But the French _ who had just finished rebuilding one of the
stricken power stations after its destruction by Israel last summer
_ vigorously condemned the raids.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian as well as Syrian ``peace'' talks with Israel are in
limbo with the Syrians refusing to continue the negotiations unless
Israel agrees to a total military withdrawal to the frontier-line
in existence at the start of the 1967 Middle East war _ and before
any peace treaty is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, war rather than peace now seems the immediate
agenda for the Middle East. &QL;

But new elections merely augmented the politician's support, and
eventually the state had to yield to the new force _ with tragic

that Haider has snatched his mantle as the most significant and
controversial figure on the European far-right.

   &UR; AUSTRIA'S UNCANNY HISTORY: HMM, BOTH SIX-LETTER `H' NAMES... &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Austria's head of state has been accused of overstepping his
authority by trying to thwart Joerg Haider's rise to power. Just
over 100 years ago, another head of state did resort to dictatorial
powers to keep a democratically elected demagogue out of office.
But new elections merely augmented the politician's support, and
eventually the state had to yield to the new force _ with tragic
consequences for mankind.

   When it comes to computers, I must admit I have a love-hate

I hate the inevitable problems that go with it. I am also a bit of
a Luddite when it comes to buying them. Why is it that computers
have that irritating ability to evolve to a more advanced stage the
second after you spend your life savings on one?

 &HT;    `You don't own a house like this... you get to live in it a
while and then pass it on.'
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ John and Kay Ziegler made Lucindia their
permanent home in 1997, almost three-quarters of a century from the
time William Carnegie _ nephew of steel tycoon Andrew Carnegie _
built the house on a 35-foot rise above the St. Lucie River in
1924.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Zieglers are only the home's sixth owners, they
view their time at Lucindia this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't own a house like this,'' says John Ziegler. ``You're
a trustee and you get to live in it awhile and then pass it on,
hopefully, to someone who'll appreciate the tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   And a grand tradition it is.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, their home was the crowning jewel of 50 acres of
prime Sewall's Point land that stretched from the St. Lucie River
to the Indian River (hence the name Lucindia, a hybrid of the
rivers' names). During the property's early years, William and
Alice Carnegie added 10-acre parcels here and there until they had
fashioned a grand estate, complete with a packinghouse, boathouse,
guest and caretakers' houses, a greenhouse, pool and poolhouse.
There was even a windmill.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing their own quarters was a little more complicated. Soon
after the Carnegies bought the first acres of land in 1923, they
built a grand, formal mansion. Almost immediately afterward, they
fell in love with what was to become known historically as
``Mizner-style'': Mediterranean-like stucco homes with barrel-tile
roofs, pecky cypress woodwork and wrought-iron hardware designed by
famed Palm Beacher Addison Mizner.
</P>
<P>
   So the Carnegies tore down their first home and commissioned
architect Jack Yates to design a new one. Yates included many
Mizneresque touches, from exposed pecky cypress ceiling beams to
odd-shaped windows and doors. All of the wrought ironwork in the
house was made in Mizner's own factory.
</P>
<P>
   Although subdivision of the estate began in the 1960s (Lucindia
is now a 3-acre parcel), that ironwork has survived, from sconces
and chandeliers to hinges and gates. So have the cypress beams of
the living room, the oak floors and a 40-foot gumbo limbo tree in
the back yard _ rare to see at that size.
</P>
<P>
   The Zieglers credit longtime Lucindia residents Marjorie and Bud
Jordan _ well-known champions of the St. Lucie River's fragile
ecosystem _ with maintaining the home's character while improving
its use. The Jordans lived in the home for nearly 20 years, just
prior to the man who sold it to the Zieglers after a brief stay.
They added a two-story, glassed-in sun porch that floods the
original living room with light. They turned two small, separate
kitchens into one big one with a built-in breakfast nook and a view
of the river, an ideal renovation for John Ziegler, who loves to
cook. And they turned two bedrooms into a master suite with a
whirlpool tub that overlooks the river.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Lucindia has become a tranquil retreat for the
Zieglers, who also maintain homes in New York, Michigan and London.
John Ziegler, president of the National Hockey League from 1977 to
1992, is semi-retired, but still works as a sports business
consultant. But he finds it harder and harder _ especially at this
time of year _ to visit his office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised by (this) lifestyle, in terms of the
tempo, coupled with the weather,'' he says. Lucindia allows him _
maybe even forces him _ to slow down and relax, slip on boat shoes
and putter around the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Lucindia also works its magic on Kay, an antiques appraiser who
spent 11 years as a flight attendant for Pan Am's presidential
charters. She worked on airplanes that ferried White House staff,
the Secret Service and press corps, a demanding job that took her
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   At Lucindia, life is quieter. She tends to roses beside the pool
and plays with the King Charles spaniels she breeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up here in the morning,'' she says, ``And you just
feel good.''

ARIAS SAW ALL THE SIGNS IN THE MARTINEZES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ You can take a remote
back road through the sugar-cane fields from the Red Sox academy
here to the Los Angeles Dodgers' academy in Guerra, a small town
about a half-hour away. But given the paucity of road signs, you'll
probably have to stop for directions.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, if you're lucky, you'll see a couple of men sitting in
the shade of a small house, horses grazing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senor, donde esta la calle por Guerra?'' a driver inquired the
other day, asking the whereabouts of the road to the Dodgers' camp.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men arose from his chair. ``You guys speak English?''
he asked with an unmistakable New England accent, eying the car's
pale-skinned occupants. He chuckled in disbelief when told the
car's passengers were from the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm James Riley,'' he said. ``A retired cop from Lynn
(Mass.).''
</P>
<P>
   Riley sent the car on its way to Guerra and a rendezvous with
Eliodoro Arias, the man who can make the claim of being the first
pitching coach the Martinez brothers, Ramon and Pedro, ever had
after turning professional. Arias was the coach of the Dominican
Republic national team in 1984, when Ramon Martinez pitched for his
country in Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him saying in Dodger Stadium, `Someday, I'm going
to pitch here again,' '' Arias said. ``He had so much confidence.
He was the door. He was the pitcher the others followed. Juan
Guzman. Pedro Astacio. And he was very good for Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Martinez, Arias said, was very skinny when a cousin first
brought him to the Dodgers' camp. But he had good extension on his
delivery, Arias said, and an outstanding curveball, and after
spending a few months bulking up in the Dodgers' academy, the
velocity increased on his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game he pitched here was in the winter against
Houston's academy,'' Arias said. ``He hadn't even signed yet, but
he did very well. Joaquin Andujar (the former Astros pitcher) was
there at the game, and said, `This guy is standing on a stairway,'
because he was so tall.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez weighed barely 135 pounds when he first came to
the Dodgers. ``I know Pedro better than anybody,'' Arias said. ``He
was practically born with me. The people who know Pedro best knew
that if there were limitations with his body, he would compensate
with his heart. There is a connection between the body, heart, and
determination that all came together in Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias still works with both Martinez brothers. Ramon Martinez
was working out here last winter, recovering from shoulder surgery,
when Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette personally came to scout
him before signing him as a free agent. Arias said Ramon Martinez
is close to being the pitcher he was before his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Ramon is here,'' he said. ``Ramon has come back. He
only needs to pitch. He's long-tossing much better than he was at
this time last year. Can he win 15 games? For me, 15 is a good
number, and if the team responds, I wouldn't be surprised if he
wins more than 15.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias said he was not surprised when Pedro Martinez pitched six
innings of no-hit ball against Cleveland in the deciding game of
their division series, despite an injury to the back of his
shoulder that supposedly had made him unavailable to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who had the doubts?'' he said. ``When the game started, I
could see Pedro in the dugout with Ramon. The TV cameras got a
closeup of them in the first two innings, and I was already
picturing him on the mound pitching. I knew, just by his facial
expression, he was in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when I'm watching some of Pedro's and Ramon's games
and they throw a certain pitch at a certain time, the hair on my
arm stands up on end because I would have thrown the same pitch,
and I can see they're doing what I taught them.''
</P>
<P>
   It pains Arias, of course, that the Martinezes are no longer
with the Dodgers. The same is true of Guzman and Astacio, other
pitchers Arias has sent to the big leagues. But he measures his
words, careful not to offend his organization. Is there another
Pedro Martinez on the way?
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to know,'' he said, ``is if another has
been born already. Maybe he's not even born yet. I think personally
that a pitcher with all the things Pedro has _ his heart and
determination and skills _ we will need time to discover him.''
</P>
<P>
   And not even a retired cop from Lynn can point the way there.

TRAINING IS LOW-PROFILE, HIGH-IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ Julio Santana takes off his
shirt, revealing a back as broad as a blacksmith's anvil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like training in the States,'' says Santana, a
pitcher who missed almost all of last season because of tendinitis
in his right shoulder but who recently signed a minor league
contract with the Red Sox. ``This is Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana is standing in the Estadio Centro Olimpico, where
extensive renovations are under way to replace the track on which
some of the Dominican Republic's top athletes hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Here, underneath the stands, Santana is awaiting the arrival of
Presinao Done _ or ``Nao'' _ a stocky Puerto Rican who once
competed in the decathlon and is the personal trainer of slugger
Juan Gonzalez, a two-time American League MVP, and Red Sox pitcher
Pedro Martinez, a two-time Cy Young Award winner. As an ad for
Presinao's services, those are two mighty big names to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is here this morning, in fact, having come from Puerto
Rico to train with Nao. So is Mariners relief pitcher Jose Mesa,
Sox rookie pitcher Juan Pena, Nelson Lara, the towering pitching
prospect for the Florida Marlins, and several dozen other players
prepared to work out for three hours in the morning, then another
session in the late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is not here, though when Nao arrives a few
minutes later, he says he expects to see him pull up any time in
his beige Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez does not show up this day. Nao makes a call on his
cellular phone and reports that he was told by Pedro's cousin that
the Sox pitcher is in Hato Mayor, a rural village about an hour
away, visiting his mother in the home he and his brother Ramon had
built for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I have to hide,'' Martinez said in Boston last
month, when he came to town for the team's annual publicity
caravan. ``Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to rehab my
shoulder. People wouldn't take no for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said that for all the speaking he did in schools and at
the charity dinners he attended, there were many more opportunities
he turned down. He said he refused all endorsement offers, too. The
only ad in which he pops up regularly is a spot he did for the
Dominican tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing anything whatsoever to mess up my time,'' he
said. ``I need to train.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez would prove this week that he had refined his
disappearing act. The newspapers were full of reports that he had
gone to Venezuela for the charity game staged by Cleveland
shortstop Omar Vizquel for flood victims there. There were even
stories after the fact stating that Martinez had attended, when in
fact he never went.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he go to Jaracaboa, a mountain village two hours north
of the capital city, Santo Domingo, for a promised appearance at a
camp for hemophiliacs sponsored by a Boston-based organization that
had put Martinez on its promotional brochures. He never called to
say he wasn't coming, either.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the next couple of days of training with Nao, who said
he wasn't sure but thought Martinez might have gone to one of the
island's beach resorts for a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, though, Martinez showed up on the beach at Boca
Chica, where he worked out with Nao, did an interview for Spanish
television, and posed for a photographer from Gear, the men's
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Nao said that because of the shoulder injury and a workload of
more than 200 innings, he advised Martinez to take off more than
two months before beginning his training program. But once Martinez
began working out, Nao said, he was as dedicated as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked out six days a week with me,'' Nao says. ``He
gives 100 percent above 100 percent, always. His condition is
magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   When Martinez hurt his shoulder after the All-Star Game last
July and went on the disabled list, he summoned Nao to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an excess of inflammation right behind his shoulder
blade,'' Nao says. ``There was a lot of black blood there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nao was deeply involved with Martinez's therapy as he recovered
from the injury. On the day Martinez showed up late at Fenway Park
and was scratched from his scheduled start by manager Jimy
Williams, he said he was being given a massage by Nao.
</P>
<P>
   Nao also took charge this winter of Martinez's rehabilitation
from the injury he suffered to the back of his shoulder during the
playoffs. His program consisted of a variety of stretching
exercises, a good deal of swimming, lots of running, and some
weight work.
</P>
<P>
   ``His condition is magnificent,'' says Nao, who also helped Pena
recover from a shoulder injury and believes that Pena has a great
shot at being Rookie of the Year this season. ``He is ahead of
where he was at this time last year.''
</P>
<P>
   At 181 pounds, Martinez says, he is 10 pounds heavier than he
was last year, which he thinks will help him withstand the grueling
demands of his third season with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Nao makes no promises that Martinez will duplicate what he did
in 1999, a season that ranks among the greatest ever by a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Nao says, ``he will be ready.''

   MANOGUAYABO, Dominican Republic _ Someplace more familiar, where
there aren't papaya and higuero trees growing outside, this would
be called a mom-and-pop store, the neighborhood 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it's known as a ``colmado,'' and Alejo Jaime Abreu, the
man in the T-shirt that has Pedro Martinez's likeness stamped over
the Dominican flag, figures he has been minding the store for the
past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the counter, there's a bag of red beans and containers filled
with sweet cloves and cinnamon. There's rice, of course; a freshly
baked poundcake; shelves that contain cough drops; and a wall of
bottled rum. Two little boys, both the color of mocha and
unencumbered by clothing, stroll in and reach into the huge icebox
plastered with the logo of El Presidente beer. In a tropical
country where refrigeration is in short supply, El Presidente buys
loyalty by offering iceboxes on a generous installment plan, as
long as the shopkeepers and bar owners sell that brand only. The
older of the boys places a couple of liter bottles on the counter,
gives Senor Abreu a fistful of pesos, and heads out to complete his
errand.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman enters, wearing a baseball cap that reads
``Amable con Balaguer.'' That's her way of expressing support for
Juan Balaguer, the 93-year-old blind dictator who recently
announced he is running again for president, one more absurdity in
a poor country that exports some of the best baseball players in
the world but has to import just about everything else.
</P>
<P>
   During election season, it's impossible to go more than a block
or two in the capital of Santo Domingo without seeing billboards
and banners extolling Hipolito or Danilo, the two leading
candidates for president. But what has Abreu offering a toothless
grin to his visitors is a survey that has nothing to do with the
politicians and everything to do with this island nation's favorite
sons.
</P>
<P>
   So, Senor Abreu, who's more popular, Sammy Sosa or Pedro
Martinez?
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is,'' he cackles. ``There it is. A gancha (fishhook).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to take the gancha,'' he says. ``Let somebody
else answer that one.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that on this particular ``calle de suenos''
(street of dreams), Pedro enjoys a home-field advantage over Sammy,
who grew up a shoeshine boy in San Pedro de Macoris, the mill town
almost an hour east of here. Alejo Jaime Abreu is the brother of
Paolino Jaime Abreu, the former semipro pitcher and father of the
famous Martinez brothers, who go by their mother's name, as is the
custom in these parts. His colmado fronts the family compound where
Paolino Abreu lives and the brothers Martinez still come for family
gatherings. The father's house, though modest, has been
dramatically upgraded from the ``arrancho'' (tin shack) that the
Martinez brothers once called home. And the ballfield where Ramon
and Pedro played as children?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone,'' says Rafael Gonzalez, who is carrying a Red Sox
equipment bag upon his return from the team's academy, where he is
training with the other Dominican players signed by the Sox.
``There's a juice factory where the field used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who lives just down the street from where the Martinez
boys grew up, is a pitcher. At 18, he already is much bigger than
his skinnier predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good fastball,'' says Gonzalez, who will be attending
his first spring training in the United States next month. ``I
throw around 94.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the block, on the wall of the photo-developing shop, a
poster commemorates Pedro winning his second Cy Young Award and
proclaims him to be the ``Orguell Dominicano'' (pride of the
Dominican). Take that, Gary Cooper. Another poster calls him ``the
most valioso Dominicano'' (most valuable Dominican).
</P>
<P>
   Juan Marichal, the Hall of Fame pitcher who now serves as the
country's minister of sport, dedicated his golf tournament last
weekend to Martinez. The Caribbean Series, which opened Wednesday
night and matches the winter league champions of Mexico, Venezuela,
Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, also was dedicated to
Martinez, with full-page ads in the newspapers trumpeting that
honor.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the ``salon de belleza'' (beauty salon), where Rosamaria
Jaime good-naturedly grumbles, ``I'm the slave here'' as she fusses
over the hair of a client, the women are attired in the fashion of
the day. They are wearing their Pedro T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always, his love is here,'' says Maria Herrera Jaime, who,
like fellow customers Lucita Jaime and Arletti Campusano, are part
of the Martinez clan, which might be proliferating faster than
Pedro's strikeout total, judging by all those who claim to be
family.
</P>
<P>
   But has Pedro met his love here? ``Ay-ay-ay,'' Maria says with a
laugh when asked if Manoguayabo's most eligible bachelor has any
plans to be married. ``There aren't even any rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Below the beauty salon, kids are playing baseball in a
washed-out gully, the one that doubles as a parking lot for the
cockfight arena next door. The tallest of the players is hedging
his bets. He is wearing a No. 45 jersey, but when he spots an
American with a camera, he pats his heart with two fingers, Sosa's
trademark gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro is a hero,'' says Kelvin de la Cruz, who fixes trucks
and tractors in a garage near the colmado. ``Here? No, everywhere.
The reality is, Sammy has more propaganda in the press; that's why
he may be more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   The night of the Martinez Milagro (miracle) _ when Pedro ignored
the pain in the back of his right shoulder and held the mighty
Cleveland Indians hitless for six innings in the deciding game of
the American League Division Series _ Alejo Jaime Abreu hauled his
small TV set from behind the counter of his colmado and onto the
street, where dozens gathered to watch the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were more than 35 people out in the streets screaming,''
the old man says. ``The police came, but they took care of the
people who were celebrating. The police said, `We're with you.'
There were people on their motorbikes dragging stuff down the
street _ beds, sofas.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Modesto Cruz Delgado shows up a few minutes later
on his Yamaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one pulling the sofa,'' he says. ``When he beat
Cleveland, it was heavy, hard, and good. I was afraid for him, but
I knew he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro and Ramon came back to the Dominican after the
playoffs, seven busloads of neighbors were at the airport to greet
them. It was to Manoguayabo they returned for a huge party in an
open field, where a cocoban played merengue and schoolchildren
spelled out Pedro's name with placards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anywhere you go in this country,'' says Juana Bienvenida de
Jaime Guzman, ``they talk about Pedro Martinez. This is where he
was born. We enjoy his triumphs, and we suffer his sorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman (the father of pitcher Juan Guzman is her cousin) is the
community coordinator for the Immaculada Concepcion church, the one
built as a gift from Pedro to the neighborhood after he signed his
six-year, $75 million contract with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``He personally made the promise to me in front of my door,''
she says. ``He said, `If I ever get to the major leagues, I promise
I will build a church,' and he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about Pedro is the simplicity of his heart, for
what he is. A lot of people who have reached his status might not
have come back here, but he came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The church is not a cathedral. It is built to scale in the
neighborhood. But with its walls painted in bold pastels, lime
green and peach, it is an inviting place. Inside, there are 28
wooden benches, 14 on either side of the aisle, and a bouquet of
bright yellow flowers adorning the simple altar. The church opened
two years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had a church here before,'' Guzman says. ``We used to
gather in a school.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro has been here on several occasions, including the baptism
of a child for whom he was named godfather. He doesn't live in the
neighborhood. He lives about 20 minutes away in Santo Domingo, the
capital, in a comfortable but hardly flashy condo complex, just
behind the $5 million mansion Sosa recently had built for himself,
the one with the gold No. 21 on the gates and a replica of the
spiral staircase from the Titanic inside.
</P>
<P>
   But while Martinez is not a regular at his church, there are
many times when his name is invoked within its walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he is playing and he feels bad,'' Guzman says, ``he calls
here, to Manoguayabo. Some of his friends, they'll come here and
make prayers for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, for all the charitable work he has done in his community,
including the hurricane relief efforts directed by his foundation,
has been criticized publicly this winter for not doing more with
his millions. Guzman shakes her head when asked if people expect
more from Pedro, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very grateful for Pedro,'' she says. ``He doesn't
realize what he's done for this community. We hope that God
preserves him, helps him, and keeps him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes from a very poor family, and there are a lot of
people who depend on him. We as a community are not unhappy with
him. He's just finished building two homes for people who really
needed homes. He gives to people who are really needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to build a school for the community. We already
have the grounds. We never had the land, and now we have the land
because he personally bought the land, just as he did for the
church. The plan is to build the school this year.''
</P>
<P>
   He is their neighbor, their son or cousin or nephew, their hero
and, yes, for some, their salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro doesn't like the cameras,'' Guzman says. ``He doesn't
like that people know what he has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the best government we've ever had here is Pedro
Martinez.''

<P>
   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ He is known by his
nickname, Titico, which roughly translated means ``Little One.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't his stature that sets apart Julian Camilo when he
makes his way through the villages and city neighborhoods of the
Dominican Republic _ an island nation roughly the size of West
Virginia _ in search of ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   There is, first, the Red Sox gym bag he carries, stuffed with
bats and balls and gloves so that no kid, regardless of how poor he
may be, is denied a fair shake at a tryout because he doesn't have
decent equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on closer inspection, there are his hands. On one, Camilo
wears the enormous, diamond-encrusted World Series ring that he was
awarded from the Florida Marlins, who won the Series in 1997 with
the help of two players signed by Camilo: speedy second baseman
Luis Castillo, who last season hit .302 and stole 50 bases for the
Marlins, and lefthanded relief pitcher Felix Heredia, who last
season appeared in 69 games for the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   On his other hand, Camilo wears a ring from the 1999 All-Star
Game, a gift from his current employer, the Boston Red Sox. Camilo
is one of two full-time scouts the Sox have in the Dominican
Republic; the other is Robinson Garcia, who had a hand in signing
two of the Sox' most promising prospects here, third baseman Tony
Blanco and shortstop Cesar Saba.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Camilo nor Garcia can claim he signed Julio
Guerrero, the kid with the highest profile _ not to mention largest
signing bonus ($755,000) _ of any Dominican player signed by the
Sox. General manager Dan Duquette was personally involved in the
signing of Guerrero, the younger brother of Vladimir Guerrero,
Montreal's star outfielder and close friend of Sox ace Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Pedro was Julio Guerrero's agent,'' Camilo says with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   On this Sunday morning, Camilo has left his home in Santo
Domingo, where he and his wife have four children, to come to a
small ballpark here. San Pedro de Macoris has exported dozens of
players to the United States, including 1987 American League MVP
George Bell, 1981 World Series MVP Pedro Guerrero, All-Star
outfielder Rico Carty, shortstops Alfredo Griffin, Tony Fernandez,
and Mariano Duncan, and current Sox star Jose Offerman, but it is
now known primarily as hometown to Cubs home run king Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Pedro,'' Camilo says, ``is a big factory for players.''
</P>
<P>
   A billboard in town proclaims, ``Welcome to San Pedro de
Macoris, The City Which Has Given the Most Major Leaguers to the
World.''
</P>
<P>
   Camilo, who plans to work out a couple of players to see if they
show enough promise to be invited to the Sox academy for a 30-day
tryout, says, ``I usually like to arrive as a surprise. Today, they
know I'm coming.''
</P>
<P>
   After a player has been in the Sox academy for 30 days, the team
must sign him or release him, though he can always agree to come
back for another 30-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Camilo had his own baseball radio show and was running a
baseball camp for kids when Jesus Alou, the former big leaguer who
was working for the Expos at the time, asked if he'd like a job in
pro ball. Camilo worked for eight years as an instructor in the
Expos' camp and as a scouting consultant. When Alou went to the
Marlins, Camilo followed, then joined the Red Sox a couple of years
ago after Danny Monzon, Boston's Dominican scout, was killed in an
automobile accident.
</P>
<P>
   Under Duquette, the Red Sox have increased their presence
significantly in the Dominican, operating an academy shared with a
Japanese team, the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, and investing far more
resources in Latin America. Kent Qualls, the team's vice president
of player development, makes at least three trips a year here. Levy
Ochoa, who signed shortstop Edgar Renteria out of Colombia when he
was working for the Marlins, is director of the team's Latin
American operations and also has scouts in Venezuela and Curacao.
Farm director Dave Jauss managed Licey to the Dominican winter
league championship a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Sox lagged badly behind other teams, especially
the Dodgers and Blue Jays, the first teams to establish academies
here. Years ago, former Sox scout Ramon Naranjo, after leaving to
join the Yankees, bitterly complained about the Sox not investing
in an academy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These complexes are the only places most of these kids get one
square meal _ let alone the three we give them,'' Naranjo told
baseball writer Peter Gammons in 1985. ``The big problem for years
was that teams signed kids and took them to the States totally
unprepared for that life . . . Remember, you're dealing with kids
who often don't know what a flush toilet is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a shame that some backward people are trying to keep
these kids from being helped. Yes, the Red Sox are one of those
teams. I told Eddie Kasko for years that we needed a complex, but
he didn't want to spend the money.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., there is a game in progress when Camilo arrives. The
player he wants to see is a 17-year-old third baseman with a
headline writer's dream for a name: Adonis Avila. Camilo decides it
best not to interrupt the game, so he tells the player to meet him
at another ballfield, on the campus of a nearby university.
</P>
<P>
   Avila hops on the back of a motor scooter driven by his
``buscon,'' which is what they call bird dogs here. The buscons
operate as a referral service for the big-league scouts,
recommending players they know and shepherding them to tryout camps
and academies.
</P>
<P>
   There's something in it for them, of course. If the Sox sign a
player for the going rate of between $12,000 and $20,000, they may
give a couple thousand to the buscon. The player may give part of
his bonus to the buscon, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an industry within an industry,'' Camilo says.
</P>
<P>
   A good scout develops close ties with the buscons so that his
team gets first crack at a player, but now American agents are
entering the field and have buscons bringing players to them, too.
The more talented Dominican players, with agents setting the market
value, are beginning to see the type of bonus Guerrero received
from the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Major league teams are allowed to sign a player at 16, provided
his 17th birthday occurs during his first season of professional
baseball, which is usually in the Dominican Summer League. There
has been controversy over clubs signing underage players, most
notably in the case of Adrian Beltre, the talented third baseman
whose birth certificate was altered by the Dodgers, allowing him to
sign at 15.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball fined the Dodgers $250,000 and barred them
from signing any Dominican players for a year; the Dodgers appealed
that decision. Camilo said that when he signs a player, he must go
to the Junta Central, the central registry, where birth
certificates are kept, to verify a player's age. The team must do
everything it can to verify a player's age and produce paperwork
supporting that claim, though Camilo admits that some players come
from villages that don't even have hospitals and were born with the
assistance of midwives, thus leading to an obvious shortage of
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Qualls said that the commissioner's office has not rejected any
players signed by the Sox because of questions regarding a player's
age.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time Camilo drives to the other field, there will be
several other players show up for the workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word gets around,'' Camilo says.
</P>
<P>
   One is an outfielder, Edison Sanchez, who comes from Hato Mayor,
the farm village in which Martinez's mother now lives. Sanchez
carries his glove and shoes in a laundry bag.
</P>
<P>
   He shows a strong arm and hits some line drives, but at 5 feet 9
inches, his size will probably keep the Red Sox from signing him,''
says Camilo. It is Sanchez's 17th birthday, and Camilo slips him a
20-peso note, the equivalent of just over a dollar, before he
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Camilo is impassive as he watches the players work out. There's
an expression for his poker face in the Dominican. It's ``cara de
hache,'' or hatchet face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important,'' he would say later, ``to look serious.''
</P>
<P>
   With all 30 big league teams represented here and with the
network of buscons, there are few secrets anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every village has one or two good players,'' Camilo says,
``and we all look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are players who get overlooked, whose skills don't
blossom until they come into an academy, have something substantial
to eat for the first time in their lives, and are given proper
training. Adonis Avila's hands are a little hard, Camilo says, but
he has shown enough power in his bat for a second look. He will
play the next day in a game organized by Camilo, who will be joined
by scouting boss Ochoa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do your own work,'' Camilo says, ``and you have to
go everywhere, because you don't want to overlook the next Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you also have to have some luck. Levy Ochoa and I have had
a lot of luck.''

<P>
   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic _ The beautifully
groomed ballfields are borrowed from the Japanese. The rifle-toting
guard at the gate is a local. So are the goats, wandering outside
the outfield walls. The camp director is a black Dominican who had
a previous gig in Macon, Ga., managing Atlanta Braves pitcher John
Rocker, whose mouth tended to flap even then, though the racist
poison that would invade his vocabulary later never was heard back
in his hometown. Nelson Norman swears it.
</P>
<P>
   And the ballplayers? They are teenagers as raw as the sugar cane
that is still cut by machete in the fields surrounding this city of
300,000, where donkey-drawn carts, ``gua-guas'' (small buses), and
hundreds of motor bikes jostle for room while trying to avoid
potholes the size of small lakes, not to mention the occasional
wandering pig.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three dozen strong, these players are attending the
academy run here by the Red Sox, who were latecomers in tapping
into the lode of baseball talent in this island nation but are
rapidly making up for lost time, aided in no small measure by
owning the bragging rights to Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also scout Colombia, Panama, Curacao, and Venezuela,'' said
Kent Qualls, who oversees the team's Latin American operation as
part of his duties as vice president of baseball operations. ``But
we do most of our damage here. This is where the talent pool is.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, more than a fifth (21.2 percent) of the players on
major league 25-man Opening Day rosters were born outside of the
United States, according to the commissioner's office. Of that
number, 66 were Dominicans, 31 were from Puerto Rico, 25 from
Venezuela, and 12 from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get six or seven players out of this bunch, we're doing
pretty well,'' said Norman, who once played for the Pirates and
worked for the Expos and Braves before becoming director of the Sox
academy four years ago. ``And it won't cost us a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   On these mostly unpaved city streets, Sammy Sosa once shined
shoes before turning into the stuff of myth. But while Sosa serves
as inspiration for any Dominican kid who ever has gone deep,
Martinez is the poster boy for every native kid who believes he
should be judged by his heart as much as by his undersized body.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where children are not required to go to school
beyond the sixth grade and most don't make it that far, few grow up
dreaming of becoming president. But ballplayers? In the end, the
fame attained by Sosa and Martinez will prove just as illusory for
the vast majority of these kids, but in a country where all 30 big
league teams now have a presence, this is an aristocracy that seems
within reach of even the poorest child.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Working agreement
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have a working agreement to use these facilities
with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, the first Japanese team to turn its
search for talent here. It's essentially a rent-free arrangement,
with the Sox providing players for Hiroshima in return for the use
of the premises, which rank among the finest academies in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Sox sent 15 players from their academy here to
the team's Florida Instructional League, which is held in the fall
for the organization's better prospects. Qualls, who has at his
disposal 34 visas for the team's foreign-born minor leaguers, said
there will be six Dominican players making their first visit to
spring training in Florida this year.
</P>
<P>
   Some Dominican players are rapidly making their way through the
Sox system. Third baseman Wilton Veras already made it to Boston,
making the jump from Double A Trenton to the Sox when John Valentin
was injured last season. The Sox have a young shortstop, Cesar
Saba, who played in Single A Lowell last summer. Saba's potential
was one reason Sox general manager Dan Duquette was willing to
include highly touted shortstop Adam Everett in the Carl Everett
deal with Houston in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saba is a pure natural hitter,'' Norman said. ``His bat's
going to take him a long way. Saba can face major league pitching
now and not look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Saba was not here this day among the kids playing a team from
Toronto's academy. He'd been sent to Fort Myers because of a
problem with bunions.
</P>
<P>
   But Norman and Qualls and Levy Ochoa, who has directed the
team's Latin American operations from his native Venezuela but soon
will move to Fort Myers, proudly point to several other prospects
with fine futures. There is Tony Blanco, a third baseman who
tripled over the head of the Toronto left fielder on his first
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne Britton (the Sox scouting director) saw Blanco, and he
thought that physically he was ahead of Veras at the same stage,''
Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Perez is a lefthanded pitcher with a sharp curveball who
led the league in strikeouts. Rafael Gonzalez, a righthanded
pitcher from Pedro Martinez's hometown of Manoguayabo, so impressed
Ralph Truell, the Sox' minor league pitching coordinator who
visited earlier this winter, that he won an invitation to spring
training. Edgar Martinez, a catcher, is one of seven Venezuelans
here in camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are not allowed to sign a player before his 16th
birthday, and when they do, it is often for signing bonuses that
range from $12,000 to $20,000, with an extra grand or two for the
village ``buscon,'' or bird dog, who brought a player to the Red
Sox' attention. Only a few years ago, Dominican players were
signing for as little as $3,000 or $4,000, but compared to the
millions given to top amateur draft picks in the States, they
remain a great bargain, even though agents are now swooping in to
represent the better talent, like Sox prospect Julio Guerrero,
whose bloodlines (he's the brother of Expos star Vladimir Guerrero)
helped him land a $755,000 signing bonus. Guerrero has been shifted
from shortstop to center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learning to hit to all fields,'' Norman said. ``Before,
he was a dead pull hitter. He's coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More to managing
</P>
<P>
   The Sox maintain two teams in a winter league in which they play
games against teams from other academies, and one team in the
Dominican Summer League, the first true professional experience
most of these kids receive. Norman is manager, but there is much
more than playing baseball going on here.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox keep their players in two boarding houses in town. ``We
feed them three meals a day,'' said Norman, noting that some
players have been known to come back 10 pounds lighter when they've
been away from camp for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   There are English classes, he said, five days a week. ``We also
have some meetings with them,'' Norman said, ``to go over the ways
to behave. We have rules. Like you have to shower before you eat,
and you don't eat in shorts. We try to teach them stuff so that
when they get to the States, there won't be a lot of bad things to
say about them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Manager'' is just part of Norman's job description.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of `father' work,'' Norman said. ``We sign kids who
never had a father, sign a kid off the street who shows raw talent.
Some of these kids have never been told what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman had some practice in that role before getting here. In
1995, he was manager of Macon, the Braves' Single A farm team in
the South Atlantic League. Rocker, a native of Macon, was on that
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a big surprise, what happened to Rocker,'' Norman
said. ``When I was his manager, he never talked back to me. I was
the first black manager ever in Macon, and he respected me all the
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andruw Jones, who is from Curacao, lived with Rocker, who had
a really good family. He kept an eye on Andruw. A lot of times I'd
call late at night to check on Andruw, to see if he was out after
12 o'clock. If he was out, Rocker's father would let me know, and
I'd call Andruw's father, Henry, and he'd phone right back to the
Rockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all types of cultures on that team, and with his
teammates, he helped out a lot. If we'd get back from a road trip
at 2 or 3 in the morning, the Latin guys would have trouble getting
home and he used to give them rides, if he had room.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said he did not encounter prejudice in Macon, but he said
some of his black players were subjected to petty harassment by the
police there. ``Good thing we had a doctor in our front office,''
he said. ``He took care of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was wild on the mound, and he also was a yeller. ``He's
always been a competitive kid,'' Norman said. ``Every time he
walked a guy, he'd use the F-word, loud. One day I told him,
`Rocker, you're pitching  &UR; today &LR; , and we've got a lot of kids here
in the park. Every F-word will cost you $10.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said he is at a loss to explain Rocker's multitargeted
diatribe in Sports Illustrated, which led last week to his
suspension until May 1. ``In some ways, it was a young guy from a
small town not knowing how to handle things,'' Norman said. ``Those
fans in Shea Stadium, they're the toughest anywhere. They get
personal. But I'm sure he wishes it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Norman is entrusted with preparing kids for a transition to
a life they can conceive only because they have glimpsed it on
television. It isn't easy. The Sox use staff psychiatrist Gary
Crist as well as a New York-based psychologist, Maria Ronda, to
help the Dominican players. Those who go to spring training go
through a two-day orientation program and continue their English
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from here to Yawkey Way. But the gate to the
academy here opens both ways. Many enter equipped with only a
dream. A lucky and talented few leave, the dream intact, armed with
a passport and the passion to follow where Sosa and Martinez and so
many of their countrymen already have succeeded.

 IN AMERICA 0210 &HT;    LIFE IN AMERICA 0211 _ Bowling by Zorn's rules
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZORN, Texas _ If you were born around here, there's a good
chance you are of Germanic stock. There's a good chance you were in
a bowling alley before you'd seen a month. A good chance you have
childhood memories of setting pins in an alley _ dodging flying
pins and balls for hours _ for two bits and maybe a nickel soda
water.
</P>
<P>
   You grow up and stay here and you find yourself at the other end
of the lane with a 16-pound ball in your hand and your kid setting
pins _ yourself from decades past looking right at the now you.
``Waltz Across Texas'' on the Rockola. Somebody trying to be a
millionaire on the TV behind the bar. Another Tuesday night at the
Zorn Bowling Club.
</P>
<P>
   You come to the same place you've been coming forever, and you
drink a Pearl Light and eat venison summer sausage and play a game
most of the world outside of Comal, Bexar or Guadalupe counties
knows nothing about: nine-pin bowling.
</P>
<P>
   About all that's left of Zorn is the club, a joint with four
lanes off Texas 123 between San Marcos and Seguin. You could
mistake it for a roadhouse, and in fact if you're thirsty the beer
slinger on duty will be happy to sell you a cold one. But bowling?
You need a membership. That'll be $5.35 a year. There's bowling at
least four nights a week, although they adjust the schedule to
accommodate football and hunting seasons. And a lot of the farmers
don't come during growing season.
</P>
<P>
   So you buy a membership. Now you need to totally rethink
whatever your conception of bowling is, because that's not the way
they play here. The rules haven't changed at the Zorn Bowling Club
since 1912. The building hasn't changed since 1947. There's an
ancient Rockola jukebox _ ``Stereophonic'' _ with not so much rock
on it. Mostly Texas country music and a peppering of polkas. Kids
play in the next room, improvising indoor basketball with a ball
and a milk crate on top of an old Frigidaire. Weeknights can be
relatively tame; sometimes the jukebox doesn't get going until the
third frame. Friday night? That's when people come to drink beer
and raise hell.
</P>
<P>
   Right up their alley
</P>
<P>
   But why bowling, and why this kind of bowling? And why here? The
history is murky. Some references say the game attracted gamblers
and other untoward types, and that the 10-pin game was invented to
get around bans in Europe and in the New World. Some confused folks
of Dutch extraction believe the game began in their homeland. This
notion, if you happen to be German, is intolerable. Their version
goes like this: German farmers brought the game and their accent
with them when they came to farm in this area. And though both the
game and the accent have faded, they linger in tiny towns like Zorn
and Uhland and Laubach.
</P>
<P>
   Basics of the game: Nine pins in a diamond shape. The one in the
middle with the red stripe is the one you want to leave. Do that
and you've got 12. Knock them all down _ a conventional strike _
and it's a ``ringer'' good for nine. But it's a team thing. You're
working the same lane with five other people, including a captain
who, in addition to playing, picks certain players to make certain
shots. So in any given frame, 12 balls are thrown. If you're really
good, you go to the tri-county tournament and win a trophy. Which
is not actually a trophy but a plaque.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best of the best bowling there,'' says Steve
Schuenemann, 31, who lives in nearby unincorporated Geronimo.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a kind of bowling that's far from the contemporary
corporate image where even the term ``bowling alley'' is something
the industry avoids (``center'' being the correct appellation),
connoting as it does images of fat guys spitting pieces of their
execrable cigars on the floor and cussing a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way back, there used to be nine-pin alleys like Mexican
restaurants,'' says member Rusty Reininger of Seguin. ``There was
one on every corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Way back, in fact, there used to be two nine-pin clubs in
metropolitan Zorn. Through some horrible architectural oversight,
one of them didn't have a bar, so you'd have to run across the
highway to the dance hall to get your drinks, then run back before
it was your turn to bowl. The bar in the current club came out of
that old dance hall. When they widened the highway in 1947 the old
Zorn Bowling Club had to go, so they salvaged as much of the place
as they could and moved a mile and a half down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Voss used to ride his bike down to the old place and
set pins as a boy. When he got out of the service in '49, the new
place was here, and he came home and has been bowling ever since.
All of Voss' kids, long since grown, set pins here, as he did in
the old place.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's the small issue of whether you'd want your
offspring anywhere in the vicinity of heavy flying projectiles. And
the kids who work as setters do sometimes get beaned. But this is
seen as something of a character-building lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they get hit once in a while,'' Voss says. ``If they're
careless.''
</P>
<P>
   Four kids work one lane each. They talk Pokemon and play word
games and avoid compound tibial fractures. They perch above the
lane when the ball gets thrown, their legs dangling beneath. They
jump down before the pins have stopped moving, heave the ball back,
set the pins quickly. The kids learn the game at the business end
of the alley, they graduate to the other end.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a social thing more than anything _ the fact that one
person's skill doesn't count for much keeps things from getting too
cutthroat. Unless you're Bernice Noble. Even in this crowd, Bernice
Noble is a character.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're bowlin' bad she'll fuss at you until you start
bowlin' right,'' says Garland ``G III'' Powers, one of Noble's
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The fussing is good-natured. Noble is 77, talks fast, moves slow
and seems to believe a little dance after the ball is released will
help it hit the necessary pins. And she's been at this how long?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God,'' she exclaims. ``Don't tell me. I can't remember!''
Then it's her turn to fling another one. Do another jig. Take
another swig. Get down tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Not that controversy doesn't occasionally visit this place where
people bowl their cares away. Some folks were a little bent when
they raised the price of play 50 whole cents a few years back. But
that was nothing like what happened when they jacked up beers from
a buck to $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   The Zorn Bowling Club will weather such storms, and people will
still come bowl in Flintstonian conditions. The knees of the old
will give out, but they'll still come to just watch their children
and grandchildren. They'll keep having kids, and they'll be here
the next time somebody from town drops in and thinks they've made
this incredible anthropological discovery. And more than likely the
poster from the Zorn Bowling Club Sausage Supper, held April 12,
1970, will still be on the corkboard in the next room. Besides
bowling and sausage, the event had other attractions: ``Fish pond &AMP;
cake &AMP; pie.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Zorn Bowling Club had an enemy, it'd be change.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Getting hit by balls is an occupational hazard for Ben Triesch,
9, and the other kids who set pins at the Zorn Bowling Club.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The kids set up the pins, the adults knock them down. They bowl,
therefore Zorn is.

least seven Latino and two Asian-American Greek organizations have

FORD TO OFFER EACH OF ITS 350,000 EMPLOYEES A HOME COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. announced on Thursday that each of its
350,000 employees worldwide, from factory workers in India to car
designers in Michigan, would be offered a high-speed desktop
computer, a color printer and unlimited Internet access for just $5
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Employees' families will be encouraged to use the equipment, and
will be given electronic mail accounts. The Ford offer, which
executives said was intended to promote computer literacy, includes
color monitors, speakers, technical support and ample capacity for
workers and their families to create their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Margevicius, a senior research analyst at the Gartner
Group, a computer consulting firm, said that Ford was the first big
company to try to make home computers available to all employees
around the globe. ``I have not even heard of anything like this
happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford executives portrayed Thursday's move mainly as an
example of corporate munificence, auto industry experts said that
it could carry several benefits for the company. Ford has had the
best labor relations in the domestic auto industry _ its last
strike was in 1986 _ but morale has been damaged by the company's
plans to spin off its auto parts division, Visteon Automotive
Systems, as an independent company later this year. Visteon workers
will be included in Thursday's program even after the two companies
separate, Ford officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and other auto makers have also invested heavily in
automation and need workers who are comfortable operating the
computers that control the equipment. Factory jobs like repairing
robots now require up to a year of training, some of which could be
done online at home.
</P>
<P>
   Envious of the high stock market valuations of computer and
Internet companies, Ford officials have begun a concerted effort in
the last year to portray their company not as a stodgy manufacturer
but as a consumer-products firm actively involved in electronic
commerce. The latest initiatives include using the Internet for
procuring auto parts, promoting new cars and keeping track of cars'
maintenance records.
</P>
<P>
   Ford executives have long admired the way General Motors' Saturn
division uses its corporate image to sell cars and have been trying
for several years to project a more progressive image of their own.
As part of this campaign, Ford already advertises that its
automobiles tend to get the highest scores on government crash
tests, and that its sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks
pollute far less than government regulations allow.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor also has a history of being a path-breaking employer.
Henry Ford, the great-grandfather of the current chairman, William
C. Ford Jr., infuriated other industrialists in 1913 when he
doubled his company's wage for an eight-hour day, to $5. But the
move paid off by reducing worker turnover and training costs when
workers were so scarce in Detroit and changing jobs so fast that
only one in 10 Ford employees stayed for more than a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Ford officials said that they did not know how many workers
would want the computers, but predicted that almost all would take
them. Delivery of the Hewlett-Packard computers and ink-jet
printers will start in the United States in April, and the price
might be pushed lower than $5 a month for workers in lower-wage
countries, said James Yost, Ford's chief information officer.
</P>
<P>
   Ford will offer Internet home pages in 14 languages for
employees and does not plan to pay for the program through on-line
advertising, although there will be home page links to Ford Web
sites. UUNet, a division of MCI Worldcom, will provide the Internet
service. Nearly 190,000 of Ford's 350,000 employees are outside the
United States, as the company assembles cars in countries like
Poland and India for sale to their growing middle classes.
</P>
<P>
   Yost and Ford's vendors refused to estimate the program's cost.
Nick Grouf, the chairman and chief executive of PeoplePC, which
will administer the program, said that for other customers, his
company distributed less-powerful computers with unlimited Internet
access but without printers for $24.95 a month. Given the discount
that Ford is offering, this suggests that the auto maker could
spend close to $100 million a year if most Ford employees
participate.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is earning record profits and has $23.6 billion in cash
reserves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The basic computer in Ford's program, the HP Pavilion, is
powerful, with a 500-Megaherz Intel Celeron computer chip. It has a
4.3-gigabyte hard disk, a CD-ROM drive, a 56K modem, speakers, a
15-inch color monitor and Microsoft software including word
processing and spread sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Employees will be eligible for computers, printers and Internet
access even if they already have them at home. They can lease
more-powerful models _ with Pentium III chips, laser printers, and
even DVD drives for playing movies _ at deep discounts if they are
not satisfied with the base model. Upgrade prices have not been
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard expects at least 300,000 orders, which would
equal 4 percent of its worldwide personal computer shipments last
year. PeoplePC will ship the computers and provide round-the-clock
technical support by telephone, including toll-free lines in many
countries. Ford will not monitor employees' Internet use of
electronic mail in any way, Yost said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford shares rose 1/8, to 48 3/4. Hewlett-Packard rose 3, to 113
9/16. MCI WorldCom fell 7/8, to 44 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   The program was discussed during Ford's negotiations last autumn
with the United Automobile Workers union, and was backed by Jacques
Nasser, Ford's chief executive. Ford is committed to leasing the
computers for at least three years, after which it will review the
program, Yost said.
</P>
<P>
   GM and DaimlerChrysler concluded their talks with the UAW before
the idea came up. Their spokesmen said on Thursday that they would
study Ford's move. Toyota, Nissan and Honda said they had no plans
to follow Ford's example.
</P>
<P>
   Ford factories in the United States already provide free
computer training labs for all workers to surf the Internet. Mark
Pudelek, a 34-year-old assembler of engine alternators in
Rawsonville, Mich., said that he had gone online at the factory but
would now get his first home computer for his wife and
five-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be a great learning tool for my
daughter, for the ABC's, counting and all,'' he said.

COLOR THIS MONITOR KAPUT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I have a color problem with my monitor. The
screen turns a medium shade of pink. Tech support suggested I use
the demagnetizer, which I dutifully did. The screen trembled for a
few seconds, but the problem is still there. I can occasionally
make it go away by whapping the monitor on the side. _ Pink Lady
</P>
<P>
   Dear Pink: At last! Somebody who understands the true nature of
computers. The only thing these little beasties understand is pure,
brute force. My own computer trembles in fear at the sight of a
clenched fist, and my monitor breaks out in a cold sweat if I so
much as frown in its general direction. They know from cruel
experience they'd better not fail me.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a poke at your monitor may be extremely satisfying, and
it may even appear to fix things for a while, but there's an
underlying problem that's not being addressed: There's an
electronic thingie deep inside that's either going bad or not
functioning the way it's supposed to.
</P>
<P>
   The ``demagnetizer'' _ actually a degausser _ is supposed to get
rid of any stray magnetic fields distorting the paths of electrons
on their merry way to lighting up screen phosphors in the right
combinations to make all those pretty colors. That sort of thing
usually shows up as random blotches of color on the screen. If
everything turns uniformly pink, that's not the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are the problem is with the guns that spit out those
electrons or the gadgets that control them, and that runs into
money.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you could put the thing in the shop, but get an
estimate, because you'll probably spend as much getting it fixed as
it would take to buy a new monitor. I think I'd start shopping for
a new one. Of course, I have virtually unlimited disposable income.
Or at least the credit card goons haven't caught up with me yet.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: We purchased the game .MDNM/Rogue Spear.MDNM/
and have found that our S3 Trio video card is not capable of
keeping up with the graphics, so the game crashes or freezes. What
would you suggest? _ Spearless
</P>
<P>
   Dear Spearless: How about going back to Pong? You won't like the
real answer.
</P>
<P>
   I'm assuming, of course, you've already checked for a software
patch or solution at www.redstorm.com, the publisher's site.
According to what I read there, the only S3 card that .MDNM/Rogue
Spear.MDNM/ supports is the Savage3D. You could always try
downloading the latest Trio drivers from www.s3.com to see if it
makes any difference. It probably won't.
</P>
<P>
   You have to read the fine print on game boxes very carefully
these days. Most new stuff requires 3D acceleration plus a ton of
memory to give you decent gameplay. Even the games that play under
DirectX, where software does some of the graphics and animation
work, may require a 3D video card to do the rest.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say which model Trio you have, but I'm guessing it's
a middle-of-the-road workhorse, not a gaming card. You could get an
inexpensive add-on accelerator, but it'll take up another slot in
your computer, and the 3D rendering may leave you wishing you
hadn't tried to solve the problem so cheaply. For a hundred bucks
or less, though, you can get something like a Voodoo 3 2000, which
will do an adequate job with most games. If you're a gaming maniac,
the best cards go for around $300, but try explaining that to your
spouse.
</P>
<P>

spouse, just several angry creditors. Send your Chapter 7 advice to

INTERNET IDENTITY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although computers are supposed to make it easier to manage
large quantities of information, lately I've been running into
problems because I am not very good at memorizing user-names and
passwords.
</P>
<P>
   This ironic little conundrum is the result of poor planning on
the part of the Internet's designers and the burgeoning world of
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to do just about anything interesting on the Internet
today, sooner or later some company is going to ask you to create a
user-name and a password. The user-name is supposed to identify
you. The password, meanwhile, is used for authentication.
</P>
<P>
   Using both an identifier and authenticator is a lot more secure
than just using an identifier. You can call my bank on Martha's
Vineyard, for example, and if you give them my Social Security
number, they will give you my account balance. If you know my
Social Security number, then you must be me. Unfortunately, having
just one layer of screening is one of the reasons there have been
so many cases of identity theft in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Things are considerably better on the Internet. User-names are
widely known _ they are part of e-mail addresses, after all _ so
the Internet's early designers realized that it would be a good
idea to give each user a password in addition. If you keep your
password secret, the theory goes, then nobody can use your account
or access your private data.
</P>
<P>
   Simple user-name and password security works pretty well. In
fact, it works so well that many people now have a plethora of
user-names and passwords that they need to recall on a daily basis.
For example, there is a user-name and password that I need to
access my Windows 98 laptop computer. My Internet service provider
also assigns me user-name and password. My AOL account has another
user-name and password, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Good passwords, we are told time and time again, should be hard
to guess. But they also should be easy to remember. One thing that
is particularly annoying about today's plethora of passwords is
that many companies use different rules for what makes an
acceptable password. Some require a combination of letters, digits
and symbols. Others require letters and digits, but prohibit the
use of symbols. Some particularly obnoxious Web sites require that
I use both upper-case and lower-case letters.
</P>
<P>
   Adding numbers and symbols makes a password harder to crack.
These days, bad guys don't actually guess passwords. Instead, they
use dictionary attacks _ that is, they try every word in the
dictionary, forward, backward, and with the digits 0 through 9
added at both the beginning and end. You actually can download
software from the Internet that will try to break into a Web-based
account using this approach. With a cable modem, you can try
perhaps 20 passwords a second; bad guys can try 12.1 million
passwords in a week. Words that aren't in the dictionary, multiple
digits, and symbols foil the attack.
</P>
<P>
   People use different strategies for coping with the large number
of user-names and passwords that they are forced to remember. Some
use the same user-name and password everywhere. This is generally a
mistake: if somebody untrustworthy discovers your user-name and
password, they can cause a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   Another common approach is to use the same user-name at every
site, but to use a password that depends on the site's Web address.
For example, a person might use the password ``yahoo4533'' at Yahoo
Calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another approach is to have a low-security password that's
used on most Internet sites, and then to have a series of
high-security passwords for the sites that actually involve money.
</P>
<P>
   A more secure approach is to use a different password at every
Web site, and to store the passwords themselves in an encrypted
vault. One of the very best Windows 95 programs in this category is
Counterpane System's Password Safe, which you can download for free
from the company's Web site,
http://www.counterpane.com/passsafe.html. Password Safe will
remember a different user-name/password combination for every
service you visit.
</P>
<P>
   When you first start up the program, you provide an encryption
pass-phrase that is used to scramble the passwords you save. After
you store a password, it will just show the services' names and
your user-name; double-click on the entry and it copies the
password to the clipboard. Once copied, you can paste the password
into a Web form or application program by simply typing control-V.
Even if somebody is sitting next to you, they won't see your
password. Password Safe hides the password, but if you need to see
it, you can make it appear by clicking another button.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Internet Explorer 5.0 also can store passwords in an
encrypted area called the Protected Storage System Provider. While
this system is convenient, it isn't as secure as Password Safe,
since it uses weak encryption.
</P>
<P>
   It's also easy to lose your password with Internet Explorer,
since you can't actually see the list of passwords that have been
memorized. For this reason, even if you have Internet Explorer
memorize your passwords, you still might want to use Password Safe
to store a second copy of your critical information.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, user-names and passwords might be replaced by
smart cards. Your personal information is stored on a credit card
with a tiny chip rather than on your desktop computer's hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   But since PCs today aren't being sold with smart-card readers,
widespread adoption of this technology is still years away. And
smart cards have competitors as well. One particularly intriguing
matchbook-sized device is sold by Rainbow Technologies. Called the
iKey, it works like a smart card but plugs into a computer's
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, port. You can find out more about it
at www.rainbow.com.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in the future, one thing is sure: we're going
to be stuck with user-names and passwords for a long time.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Men give minimal effort to unfavorable tasks
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a man's job, unless it's not. A man's gotta do what a man's
gotta do. On tasks that men take on, have you ever noticed that men
never become very good at the jobs they don't like to do in the
first place?
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, dressing small children. If Veronica is
wearing a pink shirt with red pants, a plaid blouse with a floral
skirt, or jeans so loose she looks like a 4-year-old hip-hop
artist, it's a good bet Jim dressed her that morning.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Michelle has noticed that her husband, a meticulous
dresser himself, is equally clueless when it comes to their girls:
``I deliberately send a note to all teachers when I'm going to be
out of town, as much to clue them into the fact that the children
will be 'attired by Dad' as it is to tune them into any other
issues while I'll be away. I've often thought of attaching a sign
to my kids on their particularly eccentric clothing days: 'This
clothing does not reflect the opinion of management.'''
</P>
<P>
   There's no hope for reform, so only one real question remains:
Do guys do this on purpose? Is there a top-secret school they
attend, with advanced courses on ``Hair-Combing and Other Optional
Grooming Tips for Children;'' ``Forgetting to Call the
Baby-sitter;'' ``How to Screw Up the Family Schedule Beyond
Repair;'' and ``How to Avoid Pre-Spotting the Laundry Every Single
Time While Making It Appear an Accidental Oversight.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm not being fair. Maybe I'm still mad about the time Jim
dressed Veronica for a school picnic. He rummaged through her
drawers, carefully tossing aside the the adorable Pooh sweats and
Madeline jumpers until he found the perfect outfit: frayed
mint-green sweat pants that ballooned at the ankles.
</P>
<P>
   At the picnic, I pointed Veronica out to an acquaintance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean the one dressed like a swabby?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't bother telling him, ``My husband dressed her.'' Guys
stick together, no matter what. Recently, for instance, Jim drove
to Cincinnati without me _ despite precise and repeated
instructions to pick me up at my mother's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is your fault,'' my brother informed me. ``You should
have left a note on the windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as one friend's husband actually suggested, we should
just pin to-do notes on their suits every morning, like
kindergartners on their first day of school. ``My biggest peeve,''
my friend added, ``is how they expect constant, continual praise if
they do manage to get the baby dressed, find a baby-sitter, make a
baseball game on time or do any of the other things we juggle
without a second thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong: Jim is no Ozzie Nelson. He's a great cook,
dish-washer, cleaner-upper, and a stand-up Dad. The tasks he likes
to do, he does extremely well.
</P>
<P>
   Which makes me all the more suspicious that it's part of some
grand male scheme. My friend Elissa thinks I am onto something:
``When MY Jim does agree to cook the occasional meal, it will be
riddled with too much pepper, a spice he loves to excess. The only
problem? He puts so much in even he can't stand it, and we're all
left with chicken nuggets or French Bread pizzas.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't get her started on cleaning: ``When he sets out to
clean something, anything, it must be done all the way. He can't
just clean up the dishes after dinner; he must clean the sink
thoroughly, as well as the surrounding areas, before a single plate
is rinsed. Bottom line? Allot at least one hour for cleaning up a
meal that took 15 minutes to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim has discovered, consciously or not, that if he takes long
enough to accomplish a task, I will invariably shoo him from it and
do it myself. Pretty clever, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Bet he got an A in that course on ``How to Aggravate Your Wives
Until They Beg To Do It Themselves.''

 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Between meetings at work, you steal a minute to check your
e-mail. Four unread messages pop up. One, marked urgent, is from
the payroll department. The second is from a colleague on deadline.
The third is from your husband. The fourth, from an acquaintance,
is marked ``hot gossip!'' Like a heat-seeking missile, your cursor
slides past issues involving money, career and marriage _ and
rockets to gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Why? At best, gossip is nonessential. At worst, it represents a
reprehensible human trait: the difficult-to-squash impulse to
betray our friends' trust, revel in others' misfortunes and judge
unsuspecting subjects' actions without fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sarah, for example. Sarah _ a bright, attractive woman in
her early 30s _ was satisfied with the progress she had made during
two years of psychotherapy: She felt confident in her career; she
communicated with greater ease; she felt loved and loving; and sex
was more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Something was troubling her, though, and after hesitating a bit,
she finally revealed to me the source of her anxiety. ``I'm a
vicious gossip,'' she confessed tearfully. ``I love to talk with my
friends about who's cheating on whom. I tell my colleagues about
which one is in trouble with the boss, and I love to hear the
private business of just about everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the goals of a psychotherapist is to help patients lessen
their feelings of guilt and increase their pleasure. Gossip,
obviously, provides an opportunity for both guilt and pleasure. The
resulting duality of strong emotions makes us uncomfortable and
confuses our perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to Sarah berate herself for her ``sins'' _
which, she felt, could ``destroy people'' _ I suggested that she
wasn't able to enjoy gossiping because she was equating talking
about someone with doing that person actual harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Sarah, you're treating yourself as a criminal just
because you are feeling snobbish and superior when you gossip,'' I
told her. ``You might wish to destroy some of your colleagues or
the boss, but they are still very much alive.''
</P>
<P>
   She was visibly relieved. Clearly, by understanding the kind of
gossip in which she was engaging _ and assessing the real effect it
had on her subjects' lives _ she began to put her behavior in
perspective.
 &UR; DEFINING GOSSIP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gossip rocks the very foundation of Judeo-Christian belief _ do
unto others _ and it throws a wrench at the monkey who would have
us speak no evil. Yet most of us privately enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky saga neatly
illustrates how polarized our society is on the subject: Despite
the fact that polls showed how badly a scandal-weary public wanted
the media to get on with more important issues, most Americans
avidly read about, talked about and listened to the minute and
lurid details of the couple's sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   From low to high, whether it's about your next-door neighbor or
a movie star, gossip sweeps into its whorl the issues of love, sex
and death _ no wonder it confuses. So a pause to define what I
consider harmless gossip is in order: The exchange of information
about the lives and loves of people we know or who are important in
our sphere of influence. According to this definition, Sarah's
cross-cubicle conversations qualify.
</P>
<P>
   I relied on what I learned from Sarah to counsel another
patient, Jack. He sensed, but couldn't bring himself to accept, the
bonding overtures extended to him by his associates, who gossiped
in the locker room about fellow health-club members _ particularly
the out-of-shape ones.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah also helped me empathize with a patient I'll call Judy,
who wasn't able to enjoy the gentle mocking banter about her
mother-in-law's hypochondria in which her sister-in-law loved to
engage.
</P>
<P>
   Were any of these communications generous and kindhearted in
spirit? Absolutely not _ let me make that very clear. Gossip, by
definition, is never about another's virtues.
</P>
<P>
   But harmless gossip is also not malicious. It's not passed along
with the express intention to injure. Yes, we are treading on gray
turf here.
</P>
<P>
   The best guide is your own personal radar: You'll feel it in
your gut when you hear gossip that has sprung from, and is spread
with, the desire to do harm.
 &UR; REVEALING EXCHANGES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In their book, ``Gossip: The Inside Scoop,'' sociologists Jack
Levin and Arnold Arluke point out that if you gossip repeatedly,
you become a ``yenta'' and lose your status in your social circle.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, if you find yourself gossiping excessively about
one particular person or situation, something is troubling you
about the target of your talk. That person or circumstance is
threatening to you in some way, and gossip is your psyche's way of
telling you to look within.
</P>
<P>
   An example from my personal experience: When I have gossiped
inordinately, about clinicians who I believe have performed poor
therapeutic work, I've inevitably discovered that I was trying to
ward off facing my own self-doubts and professional limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if we conjecture excessively about someone's sexual
difficulties or interpersonal struggles, it may be because we are
trying to deny our own. Psychologists term this phenomenon
``projection'' _ ascribing to others characteristics or problems
that we don't have the courage to face in ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   So the next time gossip threatens to overrun your better
judgment, proceed with caution: Pause, check your gut and analyze
your motives. Then, if it passes your litmus test, pass it along.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBAR: 6 WAYS GOSSIP CAN MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. GOSSIPING HELPS YOU FEEL CLOSER TO PEOPLE. &LR;  Gossiping often
binds individuals together. When you exchange information that is
exciting and private, warm feelings among participants increase.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. GOSSIPING ALLOWS YOU TO AIR NEGATIVE FEELINGS WITH
IMPUNITY. &LR;  When you gossip, you and your confreres tacitly give one
another permission to attack those whom you envy or dislike.
Gossiping is an accepted way of communicating negative information
about other people.
</P>
<P>
   You are allowed to talk about things you wouldn't dare bring up
in public. After all, you are only passing on what others have
said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. GOSSIPING CAN GRATIFY FORBIDDEN WISHES. &LR;  When you gossip,
you may have the opportunity to gain some vicarious sexual
satisfaction, for instance, as you become the bearer of tidings
regarding someone's illicit affair.
</P>
<P>
   As you listen to and/or tell someone about a colleague's,
friend's or famous person's immaturity, you may also gratify some
of your own childish wishes. In short, gossiping gives you a chance
to enjoy desires you usually repudiate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. GOSSIPING GIVES YOU HELPFUL ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO LEAD YOUR
LIFE. &LR;  When you hear how a friend is coping with a spouse's
infidelity, an illness or economic problems, you put yourself in
his or her position. In doing so, you may learn new coping skills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. GOSSIPING HELPS YOU ESCAPE YOUR TROUBLES. &LR;  Hearing the
details of another person's extraordinary lifestyle helps you
avoid, for a while at least, the difficulties you face in your own
life. When you hear about a friend's spending sprees, you can get
away from your financial concerns. When you gossip about a
colleague's love problems, you avoid feeling the pain of your
situation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. GOSSIPING PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REAFFIRM YOUR VALUES. &LR; 
Most gossip is concerned with the unusual, the unexpected and the
unforgivable. When you gossip about someone's dishonesty or
promiscuity, you tend to become more honest and faithful yourself. &QL;

 &HT;    Sensual fare that serves as the perfect prelude to a romantic
evening
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Breathless anticipation. Waves of pleasure. A flush of ecstasy
followed by a feeling of well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a reaction to a hot romantic encounter _ or a fabulous
meal?
</P>
<P>
   It could be either. Science tells us that many of the same parts
of the brain that are stimulated by passion are also ignited by
food. But science also pretty much debunks the idea that any
particular food in itself can light the fires of love.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, people in all cultures have happily
proclaimed the passion-inducing virtues of a long list of foods
from anchovies to truffles. Yet the Food and Drug Administration in
1989 declared that the reputed effects of aphrodisiacs are based in
folklore, not fact.
</P>
<P>
   So does this throw cold water on the theory that the right foods
can heat up a romance? Not really, according to Dr. E. Douglas
Whitehead, director of the Association of Male Sexual Dysfunction.
When it comes to revving up the old love machine, ``If you think
something is going to work, there is a 30 percent to 60 percent
chance that it will. So if you think raw oysters, or avocados, or
artichokes will get you in the mood, the odds are they just
might,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not specific foods do the trick Lynn Fischer cannot
say. But in her 1996 book, ``The Better Sex Diet,'' the national
cooking show host and low-cholesterol cooking specialist does
attest to the connection between ``good food and great loving.''
</P>
<P>
   She writes: ``I think it's because food and sex excite our
sensory faculties like nothing else on Earth. ... Complemented by
soft lighting and good music, a well-prepared and presented meal
can be the ideal overture to the sensual act of love.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing we do know for sure: It certainly can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD TO ENHANCE THE MOOD
</P>
<P>
   From dove brains to tiger whiskers, mankind has been known to
try just about anything through the centuries to lift the libido.
We give you a sampling of the reputed aphrodisiacs that have stood
the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   OYSTERS
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and namesake of
all aphrodisiacs, emerged from the sea on an oyster shell and
promptly gave birth to Eros, the randy little mollusks have been on
the top of nearly every culture's list of voluptuous vittles. Roman
emperors paid for their oysters with their weight in gold. Casanova
was known to slurp 50 of them each morning before setting out on
his conquests. In fact, oysters, which are low in fat and high in
minerals, are quite a healthy food. They contain phosphorus, iodine
and zinc, which is said to increase testosterone production.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICHOKES
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable's sexy rep dates back to Zeus, who turned one of
his favorite lovers into an artichoke so she wouldn't stray.
Slipping each butter-drenched petal one by one gently through the
teeth to get through to the delectable heart can be a sensual
experience in itself. So provocative is this ``thistle of love''
that the patricians of ancient Rome forbade its consumption by
commoners.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine de Medici caused a scandal by introducing them to the
French royal court. These days, artichokes come highly recommended
as a romantic food by Dr. Ruth, who suggests that lovers feed them
to each other.
</P>
<P>
   AVOCADOS
</P>
<P>
   The avocado probably got its sexy reputation on the basis of
looks. On one hand, the gently curving pear shape is feminine. The
Aztecs, however, called them ahuacatl, which means testicle.
Virginal Aztec maidens were forbidden to go outside when avocados
were being harvested. Archaeologists have reportedly found avocado
seeds buried with Peruvian mummies dating to 750 B.C., proving
perhaps that ancient Peruvians wanted to take the seeds with them
to the next life.
</P>
<P>
   ASPARAGUS
</P>
<P>
   Many cultures have, for centuries, held this member of the lily
family in high regard as an aid to passion. King Louis XIV of
France had special greenhouses built for his asparagus crop. An
early 19th-century medical text says that the vegetable is a
turn-on for males but may have the opposite effect on females,
possibly because of its diuretic effect.
</P>
<P>
   CHILES
</P>
<P>
   Besides adding that special zing to food, chile peppers are
guaranteed to get the blood pumping, the heart pounding, the face
flushing and the pores sweating. If that doesn't do the trick, we
don't know what will.
</P>
<P>
   CHOCOLATE
</P>
<P>
   It's so sexy that 17th-century church officials said it was a
sin to eat it. Montezuma swore by it to help keep his harem of 600
women happy. Actually, the case for chocolate as an aphrodisiac
does have some scientific backing. The so-called food of the gods
contains a chemical called phenylethylamine, a natural amphetamine
similar to and producing the same effect as the hormones that
course through our bodies when we are in love, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   FIGS
</P>
<P>
   Whether a fig was the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden is
debatable, but a fig tree did provide the world's first sexy
underwear: `` ... the eyes of both of them were opened, and they
knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and
made themselves aprons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roman writer Pliny (A.D. 52-113) said, ``Figs are
restorative. They increase the strength of young people, preserve
the elderly in better health and make them look younger, with fewer
wrinkles.''
</P>
<P>
   The prophet Mohammed once exclaimed: ``If I should wish a fruit
brought to Paradise, it would certainly be the fig.'' The fig is
reported to have been the favorite fruit of Cleopatra, with the asp
that ended her life being brought to her in a basket of figs.
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC
</P>
<P>
   Lots of folks claim that garlic is better than sex. The FDA
should have sauteed a little with some olive oil in its test tubes,
and it might have come to a different conclusion about
aphrodisiacs. Where would we be without garlic? Since Pharaonic
times, it has been touted as a cure for just about everything,
including a flagging love life. Its use as an aphrodisiac was
widespread, not only by Egyptians, but among Greeks, Romans,
Chinese and Japanese. Most of its effect is associated with the
fact that it makes food more appetizing, stimulates the secretion
of gastric juices, increases the appetite and generally contributes
to a feeling of well-being.
</P>
<P>
   PINE NUTS
</P>
<P>
   In ancient texts and poetry throughout the Mediterranean and in
the East, pine nuts are mentioned frequently for their
libido-enhancing powers. In ``Ars Amatoria'' (''The Art of Love''),
the Roman poet Ovid provides a list of aphrodisiacs that includes
pine nuts. Galen, a Greek of the second century A.D., indicates
that a mixture of pine nuts, honey and almonds taken before bedtime
three consecutive evenings might produce desirable effects. ``The
Perfumed Garden'' (A.D. 130-200) advises eating 100 of them before
going to bed to assure vigor.
</P>
<P>
   GRAPES
</P>
<P>
   The Greek god Dionysus was not only the god of wine but also the
god of fertility and procreation. Naturally, even unfermented
grapes were ascribed stimulating properties. Put succinctly by an
anonymous ancient Roman: ``Sine ceres et libero friget venus.''
Roughly: Without food and wine, there is no love.
</P>
<P>
   HONEY
</P>
<P>
   We don't say honeybunch, honeymoon, honey pot, honey pie and
just plain hon by accident, you know. From the Bible to the
``Kamasutra,'' honey conjures images of sweet, sweet love. And well
it should. Honey is the sweet nectar produced when a honeybee meets
the flower of its choice. It also provides a wonderfully usable
form of sugar that converts into fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ... AND A FEW SEXY
</P>
<P>
   SEASONINGS
</P>
<P>
   Besides chiles and garlic, here are a few other flavorings that
may spice more than just your cooking: cloves, coriander, fennel,
ginger, ginseng, mustard, nutmeg, oregano, horseradish, rosemary,
saffron, savory, thyme and vanilla.

 &HT;    A plan for love (and passion) at first bite
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flowers, candlelight and music are not just a cliche, but
important elements in any romantic meal. So don't hesitate to go
all out setting the mood.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone looks better by candlelight, writes Lynn Fischer in
``The Better Sex Diet.'' But make sure, she advises, to select
candles that are tall enough to cast a ``flattering downward glow''
rather than scattering low votive candles all over the table and
creating a ``Dracula's castle effect.''
</P>
<P>
   She also recommends avoiding large flower arrangements, which
might obscure your view of each other, in favor of something
simpler, like a single rose across each plate.
</P>
<P>
   Use electric lights only if they are on a dimmer. Turn the music
down low so as not to compete with conversation. Turn off the
phones and leave the dishes for the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes for a menu that's sensual and elegant, but not
too heavy and relatively quick to prepare.
</P>
<P>

   Steamed Artichoke
</P>
<P>
   With Mint Vinaigrette
</P>

   Makes 2 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Foods don't get much sexier than artichokes. Served in a
sprightly vinaigrette, it makes a provocative first course.
</P>
<P>
   1 large artichoke
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Rinse artichoke and cut sharp tips from leaves with kitchen
shears. Slice off the top inch of the artichoke with a large chef's
knife. Bring water to boil in a steamer and add the artichoke.
Steam about 45 minutes or until a toothpick can be inserted easily
in the bottom of the artichoke.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the artichoke in half and remove the choke (the fuzzy part
in the center) with a spoon or melon baller, being careful not to
pull the leaves apart. Rub the cut surface with some lemon juice to
keep it from discoloring. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice, mustard and sugar.
Whisk together to combine and continue to whisk while adding the
olive oil in a thin stream. When all the oil has been incorporated,
add mint, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, place the artichoke, cut side up, on a salad plate or
bowl. Drizzle oil over the surface of the artichoke and fill the
cavity left by the removal of the choke. To eat, peel off the
leaves and dip them into the vinaigrette.

<P>
   Makes 2 servings (about 1 1/2 cups)
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 6 to 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Seafood of all kinds is recommended as a romance enhancer. This
dish, from TV chef Bobby Flay, also contains other reputed
aphrodisiacs, such as garlic, saffron and honey. It's light,
delicious and stunning to look at. Leftover sauce can be used as a
salad dressing or on chicken, fish or pork.
</P>
<P>
   1 large yellow bell pepper, roasted and chopped (see note)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   3 large cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Pinch saffron threads, toasted in a dry skillet over high heat
for 1 minute
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons honey
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Scant 2/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 (6-ounce) salmon fillets, with skin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Ancho chili powder (or other chili powder)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 large yellow bell pepper, minced, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1/4 large red bell pepper, minced, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a blender or food processor, combine the roasted pepper,
vinegar, garlic, saffron, honey and mustard. Blend 30 seconds.
Slowly add the oil through the feeding tube until the sauce
emulsifies. Transfer to a bowl and season to taste with salt and
pepper. Cover and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place a grill pan over high heat until smoking. Brush the salmon
on both sides with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and chili
powder to taste. Grill, skin side down, until golden brown, 3 to 5
minutes. Turn over, lower heat to medium and cook 3 to 5 minutes
more, or until salmon is opaque throughout (do not overcook).
Transfer the salmon to a warm dinner plate and drizzle on the
sauce. Garnish with finely chopped red and yellow peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To roast peppers, prick all over with a fork. Set under a
broiler or over a gas flame, turning until blackened and charred.
Transfer to a paper bag; close and steam for about 5 minutes.
Remove from bag; peel off skins under cold running water. Remove
stem, core and seeds. Proceed with recipe.

   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Warm Chocolate Cakes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 3 to 5 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 8 to 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   These luxurious little cakes are deceptively easy to make. Serve
them warm, with the centers still soft and oozing, with a small
scoop of vanilla ice cream or raspberry sorbet, if you like.
(You'll want to have at least one more than you'll actually need to
test for doneness.)
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces Valrhona bittersweet chocolate, cut into 1/4-inch
pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   4 1/2 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3 to 5 ramekins or aluminum foil cupcake cases (4- to 6-ounce
size), buttered and floured
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Set a rack in the middle of the
oven. On the stovetop, fill a saucepan with water, bring to a boil
and turn off the heat. In a metal mixing bowl, combine the
chocolate and butter and place it over the water. Stir occasionally
until melted, about 8 minutes. Set the bowl aside to cool slightly.
</P>
<P>
   In a mixing bowl, beat the egg and egg yolk together until
frothy. Gradually add the sugar, and then the chocolate-and-butter
mixture. Fold in the flour gently. Fill the foil cases, leaving
only 1/4 inch at the top. (Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
for up to 5 hours, if necessary.)
</P>
<P>
   Bake on center rack for 8 to 10 minutes. Unmold a test cake to
see how liquid it is; it should be firm enough to hold its shape
but be soft and runny in the center. Touch the top lightly _ it
should jiggle a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Unmold the remaining cakes onto warm plates, top with a scoop of
vanilla ice cream, and serve at once.

   Strawberries in Champagne Jelly
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 minute
</P>
<P>
   Set time: 6-8 hours
</P>
<P>
   Stylist Mary Ann Clayton, who tested this recipe, found it a
pretty, refreshing and sexy dessert _ definitely worth making. She
noted that it was also delightful for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   4 1/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar (or 1/2 cup if using
grapefruit juice)
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle (3 1/2 cups) dry champagne (or pink grapefruit juice,
strained of pulp, plus a squirt of lemon juice)
</P>
<P>
   1 pint strawberries, rinsed, hulled and cut lengthwise into thin
slices
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the gelatin over the water in a medium saucepan and let
soften about 5 minutes. Put the pan over low heat and stir with a
wooden spoon just until the gelatin has dissolved; do not overcook.
Stir in all but 1 tablespoon of the sugar and remove from the heat.
Stir until the sugar has thoroughly dissolved, then stir in the
champagne. Pour the gelatin into a shallow bowl, cover and
refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours, or overnight. To assemble,
in a bowl toss the strawberries with the remaining 1 tablespoon of
sugar. ``Scramble'' the gelatin with a fork. Spoon a scant 3
tablespoons jelly into each of 6 wineglasses and top with a layer
of berries; repeat two more times. Drizzle a little juice from the
berries over the top and serve cold.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The original recipe called for only 3 1/4 teaspoons
gelatin, but the first time we made it, the mixture came out too
soft to ``scramble'' after 8 hours of chilling, although it tasted
fine. We made it again, using the grapefruit juice and 4 1/4
teaspoons gelatin, and it came out perfect _ thick enough to hold
its shape, but still a soft, lovely texture.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing we also realized was that, after sitting in the
refrigerator overnight, the champagne version thickened enough to
reach its desired consistency. Our conclusion is this: If you want
to serve it within 8 hours, use 4 1/4 teaspoons gelatin; if you
want to make it the day before, you can use only 3 1/4 teaspoons.

 &HT;    Banana bread billed as best of its kind
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Believe me, I've tried many,'' said Valerie Lee of
Snellville, Ga., when she responded to Judy Clark's request for
Banana Walnut Bread using brown sugar. ``This one fits the bill. It
is the best banana bread recipe I've ever made,'' she raved.
</P>
<P>
   Lower baking temperature and the combination of butter and brown
sugar create near perfection in texture and a deep golden brown
color, she said of the recipe from an old Mrs. Field's cookbook. In
case you won't be eating both loaves in a day or two, Lee notes
that it freezes well. Just wrap first in plastic wrap, then in
foil.
</P>
<P>
   Our tester's family liked it a lot, too.

 &HT;    Settng the mood
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are some tips for getting a romantic dinner off to a good
start and (hopefully) a spectacular finish. They are from Lynn
Fischer, author of ``The Better Sex Diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wine is fine ... but a little dab will do you. If you polish off
a whole bottle with dinner, you may get a good night's sleep, but
miss the encore. As a thirst quencher during the meal, try seltzer
or water with a sprig of mint or lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Keep it simple. Remember, the goal is romance. That perfectly
cooked salmon steak will hit closer to the mark than a boned and
rolled duck breast in a reduction sauce, stuffed with mango and
walnut pate delivered by a frazzled cook.
</P>
<P>
   Keep portions small. Serve a bacchanalian feast another time.
It's difficult to think about romance if you can hardly get up from
the table. Try serving several small courses instead of large
portions.
</P>
<P>
   Appeal to the senses. Pay attention to textures. Vary courses
with stimulating combinations of soft and crunchy, sweet and hot.
</P>
<P>
   Save that steak for a barbecue. Contrary to macho myth, a big
slab of red meat is not the ticket to after-dinner romance. Meat is
high in fat and takes a lot of energy to digest. Energy you can use
for other things. Besides avoiding high fat, avoid foods that
contain tryptophan, a natural snooze inducer found in turkey, cream
and cheese (watch those sauces).
</P>
<P>
   Fresh food is sexy. Be sure your meal includes lightly cooked,
fresh, pretty and brightly colored vegetables. Use fresh fruit and
greens as garnish.
</P>
<P>
   The spice of life. You can't go wrong with spices. Use them to
add flavor and interest rather than relying on heavy, fatty sauces
and dressings.
</P>
<P>
   Save cheesecake for another time. A heavy, sumptuous dessert is
the last thing you need at this crucial juncture of a
romance-oriented meal. You can hardly go wrong with a lovely tray
of fragrant fresh fruit such as grapes, figs, strawberries, mango
slices, pears and melon. Sorbets and ices can also add a nice
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee. The meal and the mood should be stimulating enough. But
just in case. ...

PRIME TIME FOR LINUX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are no live penguins at the Jacob Javits
Center. Not like the Linux trade show in San Jose last August,
where a hapless pair of flightless birds was forced to stroll among
badly dressed software developers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the big time _ the first LinuxWorld Expo ever held in
Manhattan. So there were a few more suits and ties, and a
statistically significant uptick in the number of spokesmodels on
the show floor. The sort of thing that happens in an industry that
has begun attracting investment dollars by the billions.
</P>
<P>
   LinuxWorld is still a small show, taking up only a fraction of
the Javits Center. But crammed into that space is just about every
major corporation in the computer industry, except Microsoft Corp.
And nobody seems to miss it _ quite the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   There's vehement anti-Microsoft sentiment here; even users of
Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh machines aren't quite so hostile.
No surprise, really. For all its recent success, Apple is still a
niche player with designs on a mere sliver of the computer market.
But as for the goals of the Linux boosters _ well, one of the
booths here sells T-shirts with the motto, ``Total World
Domination.'' These guys figure there's only one company on earth
with the power and the desire to thwart that ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The federal antitrust suit against Microsoft has bought the
Linux loyalists some time. When the Linux boom began in earnest
last year, Microsoft was sweltering under the spotlight. The
company didn't dare crush Linux, as it probably could have. And
judging from the products on display here at Javits, Microsoft will
never have that opportunity again.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at IBM Corp. Here's the world's biggest computer
company, a firm that has made Internet commerce the core of its
business strategy. And now they've put the guy who led the charge,
Irving Wladawsky-Berger, in charge of IBM's Linux strategy. You
think the company's serious about Linux? Me too.
</P>
<P>
   And to prove it, IBM announced a flurry of significant moves. It
has ported its ViaVoice speech recognition software to Linux, so
users will be able to talk to IBM machines. It's giving away Linux
versions of its DB2 database software and Lotus Domino server
software to programmers, so they can use it as a basis for new
Linux applications. IBM's also setting up collaboration with
independent Linux programmers to create software that'll let Linux
run better on laptop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel Corp., along with IBM and computer hardware
makers like VA Linux Systems, are hard at work making sure that
Linux will run on the next generation of Intel processors, due out
later this year. The chips have a ridiculous name _ Itanium _ but
they're expected to offer a major step up in performance from
today's Pentiums.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Intel officials would be sharing Itanium design
secrets only with Microsoft, and perhaps a few hardware vendors
like Compaq and Hewlett-Packard. But there they were at LinuxWorld,
briefing any geek who cared to listen, and passing out free copies
of Linux software tuned to run on Itanium, so programmers could
start learning how to write code for the new chip.
</P>
<P>
   A delightful theme underlies all this activity. Suddenly, the
world's biggest computer firms are desperate to make nice with a
feisty international community of independent programmers. Linus
Torvalds, who founded the community by writing the Linux software
kernel, marvels at the spectacle. ``It's funny to see how worried
some of these big companies are about being viewed badly by the
community,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, perhaps, but eminently sensible. The rise of Linux has
taught the industry titans that thousands of people will cheerfully
write world-class software for free. Many do it because they need
to solve some problem on their company's computer system. Others
just do it because they want to. Both these groups of benign
hackers will share their genius with the world, at no charge. They
don't even mind when Linux companies like Red Hat Software Inc. run
up a $16 billion market capitalization by reselling the work they
did for free.
</P>
<P>
   No, all the geeks want is to write good code, and to be treated
with respect. Microsoft has a problem in both departments. So the
geeks have gravitated to Linux, and now most of the Fortune 500 is
joining them. Will Microsoft see the light? Frankly, at this point,
it doesn't matter.

MP3.COM'S COOL NEW SERVICE THREATENS MUSIC INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Michael Robertson. With his prep-school sartorial style and
his eager aura, he looks like he's selling chances for the senior
class raffle at, say, Deerfield Academy. But Robertson is pitching
something else entirely. The CEO of the Internet start-up MP3.com
is promising to drag the music business _ and anyone who will hear
his spiel _ into the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so cool,'' he begins, ``it's going to blow you away.''
He borrows a CD (the Foo Fighters's ``The Color and the Shape'')
and pops it into my computer. One click of the mouse and _ voila! _
the music is instantly available in his on-line music account at
MP3.com. He can listen to it on any computer with Internet access,
any time, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's very cool, much faster and more readily accessible
than other systems that allow you to store digital music files
(called MP3s) on line. You can also purchase CDs from on-line music
vendors and receive a virtual copy in your MP3.com account days
before the CD itself actually arrives on your doorstep. Here's how
it works: MP3.com has compiled a library of 45,000 CDs; when you
purchase a CD or place your own CD into the system, it gives you
access to their digital copies.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one little problem with the Foo Fighters episode.
And what would that be, Mr. Robertson? ``It is piracy,'' Robertson,
32, says, his usually determined voice rising to an almost
evangelical roar. ``People are copying CDs like crazy out there.
The question is: How do you create a system that is as secure as
possible?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is the question (no doubt the Foo Fighters would
agree). It's also the focus of a copyright infringement lawsuit
filed against MP3.com last week by the Recording Industry
Association of America and the major record labels. For the past
year, the association has had litigation fever, trying to use the
courts to stop the inevitable spread of digital music distribution
over the Internet. It hasn't had much luck, and legal experts
contend that the music industry group doesn't have much chance of
winning this latest lawsuit, either.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't just a case of the musclebound music industry
behemoths taking on the scrawny techno-geeks. (MP3.com went public
last year, and despite losses of $36 million in 1999, the company
is worth almost $2 billion on the stock exchange.) The MP3.com
situation is brewing as the $40 billion music business is
struggling to redefine itself in the midst of unprecedented change.
Upstarts like MP3.com are using new technologies to market and
distribute music on the Internet, tapping into territory recently
controlled by the major record companies. At first, the majors
attempted to stop the rate of change by suing these new start-ups,
but that hasn't worked. Now in addition to filing suit, the big
guys are running around playing catchup, trying to figure out how
to adapt to the technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, in fact, is the driving force behind the recent
merger mania in the music business. The America Online-Time Warner
marriage is a no-brainer for the entertainment conglomerate, which
was flailing about trying to create a presence in cyberspace. Time
Warner _ and its subsidiary, Warner Music _ can provide what's
called ``content'' for AOL's subscription base. Likewise, Time
Warner's recent marriage with EMI Group gives the combined company
a gigantic music catalogue _ as in, Madonna meets the Beach Boys.
Internet companies are starving for content, and the two struggling
companies are aiming to gain more clout by joining forces.
</P>
<P>
   One former industry insider isn't impressed. ``They're just
circling their wagons,'' says Al Teller, a former record company
executive who is founder of the Internet music start-up, Atomic
Pop. ``They can all combine into one big major, but this revolution
is going to happen and they're not going to be able to control it.
They may control a huge catalogue, but they're never going to
control the individual artist.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they're not ready to join the revolution, they can still
try to postpone it. ``There is a legitimate fear of piracy, but
there is also a fear of being rendered obsolete,'' says Mark
Lemley, a law professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``They're afraid of being left out of the loop, and what
they should really be doing is coming up with their own ways of
distributing music on line.''
</P>
<P>
   And MP3.com's ``very cool'' service may foreshadow be the future
of the music industry. It's free  &UR; today &LR; , but Robertson is hoping
to turn it into a subscription service some day. Consumers will pay
for music the same way they pay for cable television, and as the
technology develops, it will be ubiquitious. `` &UR; Today &LR;  it's the PC,
but  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  it's your Palm Pilot, your cell phone, your watch,''
he says, holding his wristwatch to his ear like a digital Dick
Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Robertson is a visionary: Former industry insiders
who have launched Internet music ventures agree that the old ways
of music distribution (as in record stores) are doomed to become
obsolete. But there's that little piracy problem. Marc Geiger, a
founder of Lollapalooza who is now CEO of the Internet start-up
Artistdirect.com, has long championed the concept of a subscription
service like the one Robertson is offering. ``It's an exciting
idea, but you can't just screw the artist. You can't just screw the
industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But MP3.com has, in fact, taken some steps to prevent piracy.
Users can only listen to the music on a computer; they can't
download it to a portable MP3 player. Also, all user accounts are
protected by passwords; no two users can listen to the same account
at the same time. And you must either purchase a new CD or have an
actual physical copy of one (as opposed to a computer file) to add
the music to your account. But we saw what happened with the Foo
Fighters CD, didn't we? What's to stop the kids in the dorm from
passing one CD around to every room on the hall?
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, answers Robertson. That's not his problem. ``Piracy
happens all the time.'' And he operates at Internet speed: He's not
about to wait for the plodding recording industry to come up with
some failproof security system to protect artists. ``We are
building the railroad system to run the music,'' he says. ``We
don't own the music. We don't own the rights.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely the recording industry's point. But legal
experts contend that the industry would have to sue all the
individuals who violate the copyright law, not the company that
provides the conduit to make it possible. ``These lawsuits are
futile,'' says Lemley. ``They're not going to stop the music from
going on line.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the dilemma. Everybody's right, and everybody's
wrong. Companies like MP3.com (and another fledgling start-up
called Napster.com) are forcing change by launching music
distribution systems that challenge the status quo, yet they're not
exactly protecting artists' rights, despite their protestations to
the contrary. And the record industry folks say they are the
champions of artists' rights, even as they use whatever means
possible to protect the power that enables them to milk profits out
of the artists they represent.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like an industry in need of an overhaul? You
bet. But the only thing certain is that change is inevitable.
``There will be events that push this revolution forward, and some
of them of them are going to be ugly,'' says Geiger. So what's the
motto of this revolution? Liberty, egality, piracy? Or give MP3 a
chance?

NEW WEB SITE TO OFFER KIDS CAREER HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DIANE E. LEWIS   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it dot-com passion.
</P>
<P>
   First, Microsoft's Bill Gates pledges $1 billion to educate
20,000 minority scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jim Barksdale, former chief executive of Netscape
Communications Corp. and a well-known venture capitalist, donates
$100 million to the University of Mississippi to develop an
institute to improve children's reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   Now, five-year-old Monster.com, an international on-line career
site, says it will spend $1 million to underwrite the launch of a
virtual job-shadowing Web site to help high school students learn
about careers. Through the program (www.jobshadow.org), students
can communicate with chefs, computer programmers, scientists, and
chief executives via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Maynard, Mass., Monster.com was also a sponsor of
Wednesday's national Job Shadow Day. The program is a year-long
endeavor that pairs high school students with working men and women
who act as advisers and mentors. This year, about a million
students are expected to participate.
</P>
<P>
   In greater Boston and New Hampshire, more than 50 companies
hosted 12,000 students from high schools and vocational technical
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Other national sponsors include Junior Achievement; America's
Promise, a nonprofit organization led by Colin Powell; the American
Society of Association Executives; and School-to-Work
Opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With high-tech positions increasingly difficult to fill, both
Gates and Jeff Taylor, who is the chief executive of Monster.com,
are banking on philanthropy as a means of promoting education and,
if all goes well, preparing Echo boomers to fill future job
vacancies as the labor shortage deepens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Career development is a lifelong process that begins years
before young adults set out to find their first jobs,'' said
Taylor, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Added James B. Hayes, president and chief executive of Junior
Achievement, ``Job Shadow Day gives kids an opportunity to
experience, firsthand, the many career opportunities that are now
available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Take 17-year-old Charlene Wesley. She was among 25 students from
two neighboring high schools who spent the morning and early
afternoon shadowing employees at Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley, a Maynard (Mass.) High School student who with a friend
co-founded a Web site called Candy Child Web Design
(www.come.to/candychildcq), plans to continue her studies in
college but wanted to see firsthand how Web developers and
designers do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Tucker, 18, a senior at Maynard High School, wants to be
an accountant and own her own firm. She shadowed Monster.com's
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to work in a place like this,'' Tucker said.
``The people are nice. It's more interesting than a regular office.
It doesn't look as boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker was among more than two dozen youths who gathered in an
open area that serves as cafeteria, rec hall, and meeting room _ in
a building that has housed an old mill, Digital Equipment Corp.,
and now the digerati. The furniture is portable, the walls range
from exposed brick to deep purple, and the halls are wide, giving
the interior a spacious, open feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker, whose parents own an auto parts store, spent the day
watching Taylor give interviews, talk to employees, and meet with
clients. She said he offered her a summer internship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me how he got started, and it seemed easy,'' she said.
``He just sat down at his dining room table and sketched out a
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the story is a bit more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Taylor created Monster Board, the first Internet job
site. The idea was simple enough: Job candidates could log on, post
their resumes for employers to view, and search a database for
jobs, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Employers, by contrast, would pay a fee to tap into the resume
database and post job vacancies. By 1995, 20,000 people per day
were visiting the site. Last year, it was expected to take in well
over $100 million in revenue. It has 520 employees and plans to add
500 by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   The company was bought in 1995 by TMP Worldwide Inc., owner of
several executive search firms.

   Monster.com is not alone, of course. These days, it competes
neck and neck with such Web sites as HotJobs.com, CareerPath.com,
and Boston.com, which help users find jobs, list resumes, learn
more about various employers, or locate information on how to
upgrade their skills.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is the first to admit that finding skilled workers is not
easy. But, he said, television advertising and other strategies
have helped. In the past, the firm scrambled to attract top talent.
Today, it hires about 10 employees per week, many of whom are
experienced people looking for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This generation is all about work,'' Taylor said. ``The kids
are latchkey kids, and all they know or hear about is work. The
issues of layoffs, downsizing, rightsizing, and going out on your
own to start a business are all issues they are familiar with.''

WEBSITE OFFERS TUITION MONEY FOR PERSONAL FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATTHEW BRELIS   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest effort to entice Web surfers to spend time _ and
share information that marketers covet _ a Website scheduled to
launch Thursday will give away $10,000 every day for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   freescholarships.com (cq lowercase f) hopes to lure the vast
majority of high school and college-age students who are not
national merit scholars or promising athletes _ as well as their
Baby Boom parents who are worried about paying for college.
</P>
<P>
   Freesholarships.com, the Internet venture of software company
Mathsoft Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., plans to award another $25,000
monthly and $50,000 each quarter, or more than $4.1 million
annually in scholarships that can be used to pay tuition from
pre-school through graduate school, and even be used to pay off
student loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation Y and baby boomers are both the most lucrative
market. And this site is unique because it will not just attract
college and high school students, but their parents as well,'' said
Charles Digate, the company's founder, chairman and chief
executive. Digate is also chairman and CEO of Mathsoft, which
provided free scholarships with its initial funding of $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The site will help visitors research financing a college
education, provide advice on how to choose a school and on the
application process.
</P>
<P>
   Those who visit the site and participate in surveys, play games,
enter contests, and purchase items ranging from books to music at
the company store, will receive points or ``schollars'' which can
be used to bid on planned auctions on the site for items _
including scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   By participating in activities on the site, individuals increase
their chance of winning the daily scholarship. Also, by referring
friends and relatives to the site (they must register), individuals
can also earn points and increase their chances of winning
scholarship money.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone 13 years old or older is eligible to win, but adults can
win scholarship money for children in private elementary school,
even preschool.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of winning depend on the number of people who visit the
site each day. Digate would not say how many visitors he expects,
but said the number should grow rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Some education officials reacted coolly to the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice that I could give any family about financial
aid is to ask at a college near you,'' said Terry Hartle, senior
vice president of the American Council on Education, a trade
association representing 1,800 two-year and four-year private and
public colleges. ``Colleges are selling a product and in order to
help people buy it, they need to help them with financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Digate said funding for the site could come from other
investors, or from a three-prong revenue stream from the site
itself _ advertising on the site or through e-mail to participants;
the ability of companies to sponsor scholarships as a form of
advertising; and commerce through the planned company store and
developing relationships with existing online merchants including
banks and online brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't this be an obvious place for people to save money?''
Digate asked.

PRESARIO IS SNAZZY AND DESKPRO SOLID
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In an attempt to jump-start its business and restore
its design edge, Compaq Computer Corp. has been chasing the mantra
of ``cool products.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston PC maker, which built its early reputation on
engineering and design skills, has shaken off the doldrums and
begun to churn out some unusual machines.
</P>
<P>
   But the company can still make plain vanilla when it wants to _
and when customers, particularly in the business sector, demand it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two different Compaqs _ one consumer system,
another for business _ that are typical of this yin and yang.
</P>
<P>
   _ Presario EZ 2200, $1,400: Let's get this out of the way first:
This is the coolest-looking consumer PC you can buy. This is the
way industrial designers of the 1930s and 1940s thought machines of
the future would appear _ streamlined, with neat visual touches
that also serve a useful function.
</P>
<P>
   The EZ 2200 comes in a rounded, purplish-blue case. Its two CD
drives _ one read-only, the other rewriteable _ and a floppy disk
drive are hidden behind a door on the front. The door also covers a
pair of Universal Serial Bus ports and an IEEE 1394 (a.k.a.
FireWire or iLink) port.
</P>
<P>
   Above the door is an oval LCD display panel called the Digital
Dashboard. Below the display is an on-off button. Above it is a
light indicating whether you have e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the computer has a panel that pops off to allow
access to a pair of USB ports, an IEEE 1394 port, a monitor port,
speaker and microphone connections, the power plug and modem jacks.
Conspicuously absent are parallel, serial and PS/2 ports, making
this a ``legacy-free'' PC.
</P>
<P>
   The EZ 2000 comes with a 500-megahertz Intel Celeron processor,
64 megabytes of memory, a 17-gigabyte hard drive, a 56K fax modem
and the pair of CD drives. It borrows from the standard memory for
its video memory, between one and eight MB, depending on what's
needed. It also comes with an Internet keyboard bristling with
buttons. The model I tried included a 17-inch monitor and JBL Pro
Audio speakers.
</P>
<P>
   How all this comes together is what makes the system unique.
That on-off button works just as you always wanted an on-off button
to work on a PC _ it first shuts Windows down, then powers off the
computer ... sometimes. More on this in a moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Dashboard displays a clock most of the time when the
PC is on. But it will also alert you to what the computer is doing.
For example, if you add hardware, it displays ``Device Added'' when
the installation is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The side panels pop off to make the system easy to upgrade. You
can quickly get to the Presario's expansion slots, memory and hard
drive this way.
</P>
<P>
   While all this sounds cool, there are drawbacks. First, sharing
video memory with main system memory is bad news, particularly if
you play graphically demanding games. When it needs the full eight
MB, the system itself is left with only 56 MB to work with. This
can result in sluggish performance.
</P>
<P>
   I also had a problem with the shutdown feature. After the PC ran
for a while, it would either lock up at shutdown or restart
instead. Turning off all the background programs, fiddling with the
hardware settings and even installing a newer version of the
operating system didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   I also saw this happen on another EZ 2200 at a demonstration on
Compaq's Houston campus. A Compaq spokeswoman said this was not a
problem with every computer, but only with a certain production
lot.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you're interested in buying one of these, you may
want to pay close attention to how it behaves when you try to turn
it off. Ask for a new unit if it starts misbehaving in this way.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deskpro EN Series Small Form Factor, $2,577: While this system
lacks the flash and dash of the EZ 2000, it's got to warm the
cockles of a system administrator's heart. It's lean, simple and
easy to open and upgrade _ despite the clunky name _ and blazingly
fast. It's also ready for Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For those not schooled in the maddening jargon of the tech
world, ``small form factor'' means it comes in a small case. It
takes up about two-thirds the space of a standard desktop unit, but
still has adequate expansion capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried had a 733-MHz Pentium III chip, 128 MB of
memory, a 20-GB hard drive, a 10/100-megabit Ethernet card, 16-bit
sound and a built-in speaker, a Matrox Millennium G400 graphics
adapter with 16 MB of video memory and a 6X DVD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a legacy-free system, so it has parallel and serial
ports, as well as a pair of USB connections.
</P>
<P>
   The computer came with Windows 98, although Window 95, NT 4.0
and Windows 2000 _ the next version of NT _ are available. I
installed Windows 2000, and it was nearly painless. The new
operating system didn't have drivers for this Millennium card,
which I had to grab from Matrox's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the small case is a snap. A simple set of latches
allows you to pull the case off the main chassis. The drive cage
tilts out, making it easy to replace the drives. The main system
board slides easily out of the chassis.
</P>
<P>
   The small case, though, does have its drawbacks. It has just two
expansion slots _ one PCI and one PCI/ISA combination. Depending on
how you configure a system, though, either or both could be in use.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the Deskpro EN was excellent, with either
Windows 98 or 2000. It's aimed at businesses, so it's available
mainly through Compaq's reseller. That's too bad, because I suspect
there are quite a few savvy home users who'd love to get their
hands on a system like this one.

USING TWO CD-ROMS REQUIRES SOUND CARD WITH AUXILIARY PLUG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN  
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I recently added a rewriteable CD-ROM drive to my computer.
This gives me two CD-ROM drives. The salesman who sold it to me
told me I could use it the same way I use my current CD-ROM drive,
but I've run into two problems. First, I can't play music CDs in
it. No sound! Then, I installed some software that came on CD in
that drive, and now I find I must use that drive whenever I use
that particular program. It won't work if the disc is in the other
drive. Why am I having these problems? Did the salesman lie to me?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, the salesman didn't lie. But he didn't tell you
everything, either.
</P>
<P>
   When you install a regular CD-ROM drive, there are usually three
cables you must connect. The first is a wide, flat ribbon cable
that carries data from the drive to the rest of the computer. Next
is the power cable. The third is a narrow cable with small
connectors that also plugs into your sound card. It is used
exclusively to get sound from music CDs _ called red book audio _
to the sound card.
</P>
<P>
   (Note that if your audio adapter is built into the computer's
system board, this small cable will plug into there instead.)
</P>
<P>
   When you install a second CD-ROM drive, you must also install
the sound card cable, or you won't be able to hear music CDs, or
the audio on some older multimedia titles that used red book audio.
The problem is that many audio cards have only one place to plug in
these cables. Unless you upgrade to a card with an auxiliary plug,
or can find or build some kind of adapter cable, you'll have to
make do with just one drive that can play music CDs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue with the software is a different problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some software titles install components on your hard drive, but
still need information from a CD to run. When you install one of
these programs to your drive, it makes a note in its settings which
CD-ROM drive was used in the installation process and presumes that
is where it can look for the data it needs when launched. If you
put the disk into the other drive, the program can't find it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son sends me pictures of our grandchildren all the time,
and when I click on them in Windows 98 they launch either the Web
browser or some kind of viewer program. This takes a long time. Is
there some other way I can look at these pictures that's faster?
</P>
<P>
   A: Provided the files are simple JPG or GIF format images, there
are two ways you can see them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The first is to set up the Windows 98 folders to be viewed as
Web pages. Save the attachments to a specific folder, then use My
Computer to get to it. If you've got Windows 98 set up so
double-clicking launches programs, then click once on the file and
a thumbnail version of it will appear in a pane on the left of the
folder. If you have Windows 98 set up to launch with single clicks,
simply hold the mouse cursor over the file for a second or two to
make the thumbnail appear.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use a feature called QuickView to get a better look
at the file. Right-click on the picture you want to look at and
choose QuickView from the menu that appears.
</P>
<P>
   If QuickView is not in the menu, you'll need to install it. Go
to Add/Remove Programs in the Windows control panel and click on
the Windows Setup tab. Click on Accessories, then the Details
button. Click QuickView so its box is checked, then click OK. You
may need your Windows 98 disk, or you may need to point to Windows
98 setup files that reside in the windowsoptions folder on some
PCs.

GET READY FOR WINDOWS 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With 2000 here, can Windows 2000 be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. will release its new version of the Windows
operating system for businesses on Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As a home user, you probably won't rush right out and buy it.
The estimated retail price is about three shares of Microsoft stock
at Friday's prices ($102 a share) for an outright purchase. If
upgrading from Windows 95 or Windows 98, it's still roughly two
MSFT shares ($219). Users of Windows NT can upgrade for $149.
</P>
<P>
   The official launch will be at the IDG Windows 2000 Conference
and Expo in San Francisco, which will be keyed to 70 simultaneous
events in cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Bill Gates has invited only a few of his close
personal friends: about 1,500 people are expected in each city.
There will be vendor exhibits and sessions for business owners and
technology professionals on how to use Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The events are free, but registration is required. A list of
venues and registration information is available at, of course,
www.microsoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 2000 is basically the upgrade for Microsoft's Windows
NT, the business version of Windows 98. It comes in three versions,
ranging from the entry-level Professional for business desktops and
notebooks, to Advanced Service for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The two server programs carry a business-like price, too: $999
for a server version and $3,999 for an advanced server version
(half that if upgrading to either program from Windows NT).
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft bills the operating system as the ``most reliable
operating system in the Windows family.'' Microsoft Corp. has been
running on it exclusively for many months, even before the product
went out to major clients. More than 500 person-years and $162
million has been spent on testing.
</P>
<P>
   It supports more than 11,000 hardware devices ranging from
printers to digital cameras. It automatically installs and
configures itself _ a plus for system administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice networking feature: the system administrator can
install software to individual desktop machines on the system from
the server, rather than visiting each workstation. Microsoft said
that could save hundreds, if not thousands, of hours in a large
enterprise.

PROGRAM SEEKS TO END TECHNOLOGY GAP BETWEEN RICH, POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT BEER   
 c.2000 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Julie Henderson is a true believer in the push
to close the digital divide between needy and more affluent
families.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the Marcus Foster Institute, a
nonprofit organization that helps the poor learn job skills, smiles
broadly as she remembers the 21 mothers and fathers walking out the
institute's door two weeks ago, carrying their new computers.
</P>
<P>
   It was like ``giving candy to a baby,'' Henderson said of the
computer giveaway, the first test of ClickStart, a new federally
funded program aimed at providing Internet access to the poor. ``It
was an incredible moment in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of American households have computers. But
according to the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, 8 percent of American households earning under
$10,000 have computers, and only 3 percent of those homes have
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration wants to provide a $50 million
subsidy so poor families can buy computers and get Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ClickStart is the brainchild of Silicon Valley executives Wade
Randlett, co-founder of TechNet, a political lobbying organization
for the technology industry, and Garrett Gruener, a venture
capitalist and the founder of Ask Jeeves, the Internet search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the U.S. Department of Commerce will issue
monthly vouchers, worth $10 each, to households that meet the
requirements for receiving food stamps. These qualifying households
must provide $5. The $15 is then paid to a company to provide a
low-cost computer and basic Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ClickStart is aimed at reaching 300,000 households initially.
Its founders hope to get computers and Internet accounts into most
of the 9 million poor households that lack computers or Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still work to be done on this,'' Randlett said, adding
that some details have to worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a debate about the effectiveness of providing
computers to people for whom food, employment, housing and
education are a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Stoll, the author of ``High Tech Heretic: Why Computers
Don't Belong in Schools,'' called the ClickStart program ``bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What poor families and their children need are better schools,
more teachers and good books. They don't need to be sitting in
front of glowing screens.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Silicon Valley executives like Randlett and Garrett,
there is no argument over the benefits of bridging a digital
divide. They believe that giving these tools to the disadvantaged
will help enrich the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Access to computers and the Internet ``opens the doors to the
wonder world'' Garrett said Wednesday. A family without the
Internet, he declared, is ``fundamentally disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is echoed by Henderson, who sees computers and
the on-line world as a virtual bootstrap for the poor, helping them
look for jobs, seek health care information and begin home-grown
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first words I heard from someone in our program was
that she was going to sell her T-shirts on the Internet,'' said
Henderson. ``That's empowerment.''

<P>
   The demand for Arthur C. Clarke's science fiction novel about a
malevolent computer named HAL has endured for three decades, but
interest was rather tepid for the author's six-page, double-spaced
essay about ``TV's Time-Travel Future.''
</P>
<P>
   So last month the British author of ``2001 _ A Space Odyssey''
plunged into the infant market for electronic books _ ignoring the
risk to his prestige. He posted his November speech to a U.N.
conference for a four-figure advance paid by an Internet newcomer
with an irreverent name and approach, Fatbrain.com.
</P>
<P>
   The essay was too brief for conventional book or magazine
publishers, but not so for one of the new houses of virtual
publishing that eagerly accepts just about any words that move in
bytes. Clarke's observations about television and the ``Global
family'' were transformed into a $2 electronic title instantly
available for downloading, reading online or sputtering out on the
pages of a printer.
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain is an online computer bookstore turned digital
publisher at the vanguard of a new electronic book market that has
spawned other players like 1stBooks and iUniverse.com, which entice
writers with the editorial equivalent of: Who Wants to Be an
Author?
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain has sold more than 10,000 titles since November with
its titles tilting to the popular side; more than 60 percent of the
books explore consumer themes, Chris MacAskill, the company's chief
executive and owner of the original cramped Silicon alley garage
office. Customers are still drawn to books about computers and
business, with more than 50 percent of sales in the professional
category. And the average price of the e-books sold is about $3.47.

   Financial analysts are optimistic about Fatbrain's core online
bookselling business _ mail order computer and technical titles _
although the company has yet to turn a profit. But they do not know
whether ``e-matter'' will gain popularity. ``I like their base
business, which is really a business to business supplier of
technical information and training materials,'' said Dalton L.
Chandler, an analyst with Needham &AMP; Co. ``They've built a really
blue-chip clientele. Their e-matter is potentially a huge idea, but
it's still very early to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the notion of virtual titles by virtually anybody
captured the imagination of venture capitalists even though some
top publishers scoffed that this highly democratic system would
evolve into a vanity press profoundly flawed by the absence of
professional vetting and high quality writing.
</P>
<P>
   But lately there are signs emerging that the traditional
literary community is warming to a new alien form; Time Warner
Trade Publishing wants to post chapters or excerpts from coming
books on the Fatbrain site and the company's chief executive,
Laurence J. Kirshbaum, calls the concept ``brilliant.'' And some
prominent authors and agents are beginning to place short works or
out-of-print books on the site, which is already a literary refuge
for amateur writers yearning to share their oeuvres _ ``Psoriasis _
My 35-Year-Itch That Vanished'' or ``Did Russia Send Us AIDS?''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Lanigan and Richard Bach _ novelists whose books have
been transformed into films or occupied the rarified real estate of
The New York Times best-seller list _ are posting electronic titles
scorned by traditional publishers for reasons that range from
brevity to quirky themes. Clarke published his speech with Fatbrain
because there was no other forum, said his agent, Russell Galen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to be seen,'' Galen said. ``He wants to be read. If I
had a young author whose career I was trying to build I'd rather
have a hundred dollars from The New Yorker than a thousand from
Fatbrain. But with my 82-year-old author, my concern is reaching
readers. He doesn't need money. He doesn't need prestige. He just
wants to change lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely literary patrons of this publishing effort are
investors like Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft, and
Highland Capital Partners, who have backed Fatbrain with more than
$35 million to nurture the market for what the company calls
``e-matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatbrain's roots are as deep as the cold cement of the Mountain
View, Calif., garage where it was founded in the summer of 1995
with the more sober name of Cbooks Express.
</P>
<P>
   Its existing list of some 6,000 titles is so varied that there
is room for the musings of Clarke and the lifework of Matthew J.
Burtless, 5, a San Diego kindergartener whose forte is coloring an
adventure series about a wandering monkey named ``Tyco.'' (His
older siblings take care of the writing.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is no surprise that some top publishing executives do
judge the books by the lack of a cover _ and editing. But Fatbrain
also has its defenders in mainstream publishing who say the concept
has the potential to create a market for short, immediate
literature that can be constantly updated or revised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a revolution,'' said Joni Evans, a literary agent at
the William Morris Agency, who is publishing the work of some of
her writers like William L. Ury, a co-author of the best-selling
book ``Getting to Yes.'' ``I think democracy is going to come to
book publishing in an interesting way where anybody can have a book
available.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fatbrain created its e-matter publishing program, it
expected unglamorous and dutiful offerings _ titles top heavy with
professional and technical themes that reflect the specialty of its
thriving online bookstore, which caters to computer professionals
and corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has drawn amateur novelists struggling to find
readers and willing to pay Fatbrain a $1 monthly storage fee for
posting manuscripts online. To nurture the infant electronic book
market, Fatbrain is paying some professional writers advances of
about $10,000 to post shorter pieces or excerpts of coming books.
In addition, the professional writers get a generous 60 percent
split of the royalty on the price of a book while self-published
writers get half.
</P>
<P>
   The kicker is that somebody has to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we didn't expect is all the fiction,'' said MacAskill.
``Our model does have the potential of ushering a whole new
distribution channel for things that never had an economic model
before. What about short stories and speeches and white papers and
things that are in depth?''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the electronic books should not run higher than 100
pages. But authors follow their own muses, setting prices and page
counts that sometimes reflect no particular logic.
</P>
<P>
   Ten dollars buys three pages of advice exploring Gary Kelly's
solution for psoriasis. The free-lance writer Marla Hoover Doty
offers a staggering deal _ $150 for a one-page short story on
menopausal misery called ``Wake Up and Smell the Birthday Cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Kelly is not impressed with the reception for his
breathlessly written psoriasis cure; many Fatbrain titles are
simply ignored, but readers have vigorously attacked his remedies
as quackery. ``I've had very little success with my material,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some established writers contend that virtual publishing is
appealing because it offers an opportunity to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Lanigan, the author of almost 20 books including ``Romancing the
Stone,'' said she was typecast in the romantic suspense genre. She
could not find a publisher for her ``Miracles Are Golden,'' a
61-page Christmas novella about a little boy who is reincarnated as
a golden retriever to comfort a dying child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers tell me that we don't do children's books and we're
certainly not going to publish one for you _ you're niched,'' she
said. ``There's a lot of writers who would like to do something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Lanigan also posted more than 15 of her books,
including out-of-print titles that she has priced at $6 or less. It
is too early to evaluate sales, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other writers are ``so paranoid about e-publishing,'' Lanigan
said. ``They're afraid of it and fear that someone is going to take
all their money. And there are others that think that it doesn't
have any respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of literary regard stems from an obvious weakness:
There is no software for fixing dangling modifiers or slashing
purple prose.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Romanos, president and chief operating officer of Viacom's
Simon &AMP; Schuster, said that he does not understand the logic behind
a ``slush pile'' business model that invites any writer to publish
without benefit of an editor or a staff to promote the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seems to be missing from the Fatbrain model is any
semblance of publishing,'' Romanos said. ``Publishing is everything
from perfecting a work to the creation of a market for that work.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Fatbrain has tried to address the issue by
hiring a small staff of editors that is expected to grow. But the
priority is name authors. ``I must admit that when a top author
submits something, we have stepped in and done some editing,''
MacAskill said. ``We're not trying to get into that business, but
we felt it would reflect poorly on e-matter if we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one major publisher, Warner Books, is talking with
Fatbrain about posting chapters from seven coming books. Kensington
Books, the romance publisher, is also posting installments of a new
Kate Austen mystery by Jonnie Jacobs at $2 for 65 pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that inside every nonfiction book is a much smaller
book with the core information that many readers are seeking,''
said Kirshbaum of Time Warner Trade publishing, a Time Warner unit
that includes Warner Books and Little Brown &AMP; Co. ``Inside every
health book is theory and practice. Some people just want the
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic chapters may also create excitement in the lull
before the print version is published, Kirshbaum said. To test
these theories, Warner Books has come up with a list of titles for
e-matter that range from a self-help book about breast-feeding to a
chapter from a James Patterson novel.
</P>
<P>
   The last book on Warner's list should be required reading for
the investors in Fatbrain, which has yet to turn a profit _
``Confessions of a Venture Capitalist: Inside the High-Stakes World
of Start-Up Financing.''

REPORT RINGS ALARM BELLS ABOUT PRIVACY ON THE INTERNET

 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A report last week that most health-related Web
sites were not honoring their promises to keep personal information
about visitors private offered a somewhat alarming snapshot of the
state of privacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The group that conducted the survey from which the report was
drawn, the California HealthCare Foundation, said its intent was to
help health sites live up to their promises and win the trust of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But it caught government officials and privacy enforcement
groups off guard with disclosures that confidential information was
being disseminated through banner ads and third-party service
providers. And it underscored the growing policy debate over
whether federal officials and private groups can adequately police
such a fast-growing and constantly changing new medium as the Net.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since the Federal Trade Commission began
monitoring electronic commerce, few privacy violations have come to
light. And none of the major groups formed to certify and oversee
privacy practices has ever pulled a seal of approval from a member
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   So when the California foundation said its study had determined
that all but three of 19 sites surveyed were violating their own
stated practices, privacy advocates held up the results as proof of
their longtime assertions that self-regulation of online privacy,
as promoted by the FTC and the Clinton administration, defies
effective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not keeping pace with the Internet explosion,'' said
Jason Catlett, president of Junkbusters Corp., a privacy consulting
concern based in New Jersey. ``If you count the number of people in
charge of enforcement and look at the growth of e-commerce sites,
any way you measure it you'd come to the conclusion that protection
is not keeping up _ if indeed it ever was adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The California study said the problems stemmed mostly from new
technology that enables some banner advertisers to pick up any
personal information a customer enters on the page where an ad is
displayed. In addition, the study's Internet security consultant,
Richard M. Smith, said he found a leakage of information between
Web sites that promise to keep information confidential and
third-party companies that gain access to that information while
running services on the sites.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe, one of the first and largest privacy certification
programs, acknowledged on Friday that it was surprised and alarmed
to read the study, which identified potential violations by seven
members of TRUSTe.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Steer, a spokesman for TRUSTe, said it was investigating
the sites identified in the study and was doing random audits of
other members to see if they were disclosing information to
advertisers and other third parties without saying so in their
posted privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe said last week that it would alert all 1,300 of its
members that they must include in their posted privacy policies
disclosures of any contracts with third parties that could track
the members or gain access to their personal data.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC declined to comment on the health survey. But an agency
employee who spoke on condition of anonymity said the agency was
``taking these concerns very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a special 40-member advisory committee held its first
meeting at the FTC. It will help write a report to Congress on what
steps companies should take to keep their databases secure and how
much access consumers should have to the data collected about them.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the commission announced that it was planning a third
annual Internet sweep to survey privacy practices on the Web. But
as with past studies, the FTC's announcement indicated that the
agency would analyze only stated policies, not the actual practices
that the California HealthCare Foundation examined.
</P>
<P>
   Though the California study looked only at health sites, Catlett
and Smith both said it begged the question of whether privacy
problems on the Internet were widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similar problems on other sites,'' Smith said.
``When you have one company working with another, that's when
privacy tends to fall by the wayside.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the troubling indicators, Steer of TRUSTe said the
government should maintain its hands-off approach to the Internet
since laws can be quickly outdated by new technologies. In
contrast, he said, TRUSTe requires its members to undergo annual
reviews, a process that allows TRUSTe to educate sites about
challenges posed by new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett, however, said baseline laws were needed to spell out
for companies what they can and cannot do with private information
they collect online and to allow consumers to take civil action
when they think their rights have been violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, with the Clinton administration saying
self-regulation is the way we are going to go, that basically says,
`Do whatever you want or do as little as you want,''' Catlett said.
``That's exactly the wrong message to send to companies that have
strong economic incentives to collect and use personal
information.''

<P>
   Just how smart are the designers of ``smart'' appliances, when
it comes to meeting the needs of modern people like me _
technically inclined, but harboring no dreams of connecting their
coffee pots to the Internet or having live stock quotes scroll
across a liquid crystal display on their refrigerators?
</P>
<P>
   Whether we like it or not, home appliances are the latest to
fall under the ``just add Internet'' spell. And if manufacturers
have their way, the appliances heading your way later this year
will make today's automatic ice maker and microwave oven as
last-century as a wringer washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Housewares 2000 trade show in Chicago, ``smart''
was the watchword, as a new generation of thinking appliances was
introduced.
</P>
<P>
   There was an intelligent microwave oven from Sharp that can go
online, download a recipe and program itself to cook the meal at
just the right temperature. General Electric demonstrated a
so-called WebPad that can be clipped to the front of the family
refrigerator and serve as an electronic memo board for scheduling
activities, ordering products or retrieving and storing recipes.
And Sunbeam announced an entire line of smart products under a new
and separate company called Thalia Products (Thalia being an
acronym for ``thinking and linking intelligent appliances).
</P>
<P>
   This coming generation of smart machines is not limited to the
kitchen. Electrolux is working on a robotic vacuum that can rove
over any floor plan without assistance, and on an automatic mower
that will someday mow the lawn while the owner lounges in a nearby
hammock. An inventor named Albert Montague has on the drawing board
a smarter auto alarm that is capable of distinguishing between a
car accidentally tapping your bumper and a thief jimmying the door
lock, saving the neighborhood-rousing alarm for serious break-in
attempts only.
</P>
<P>
   As exciting and futuristic as it all may seem, though, these
marvels will almost certainly fight an uphill battle for consumer
acceptance. For every intelligent dishwasher coming off the
assembly line, there is a blinking videocassette recorder clock to
remind us that the consumer may have little time or patience for
learning to operate new devices _ whether microwave ovens that
connect to the Net or refrigerators that automatically order milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was possible to add sophisticated features quite some time
back,'' said Dr. Micheal Parten, a professor of electrical
engineering at Texas Tech and specialist in the field of appliance
design. ``But think about digital watches. You had every kind of
feature, but who used them? People just wanted to know what time it
was. There was even a smart tennis shoe not long ago. It could
calculate your heart rate and the distance you ran, but nobody
cared. Most people could do those things easily in some other way.
For a product to succeed, it has to offer real value to the
consumer. It must be useful and solve a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain why a refrigerator would need Internet
access, even some of the industry experts driving this push toward
smarter, more high-technology appliances had to laugh and admit
that most of these early products are more dazzling than useful.
One of them was Jerry Fiddler, chairman and co-founder of Wind
River Systems, which provides the operating software for the the
tiny processors embedded in the majority of these new devices.
</P>
<P>
   The point, Fiddler said, is not whether this first round of
smarter appliances will succeed, but that this first wave is the
start of a new generation of machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that a microwave connecting to the Internet
will ever be useful, but we're at Generation Zero right now,'' he
said. ``There are combinations that are yet to be discovered. But
we're going to see a lot of interesting devices by Christmas, and
even more right after that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Fiddler, a rapid evolution for machines that
previously progressed at glacial speed is now possible, thanks to
advances in embedded chips and software. ``The technology is there
now,'' he said. ``The cost is incredibly low and the added
connectivity means you can connect things to the real world. The
problem is figuring out what is useful and what will make the
consumer say `This will make my life better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some manufacturers feel that they are already there.
``I don't think anyone would imagine a meaningful connection
between a smoke alarm and an alarm clock, but that's how we see
things getting smarter,'' said Jon Hamann, president and chief
executive of Thalia Products.
</P>
<P>
   Thalia's offerings, expected to reach stores late this year, are
based on what the company calls intelligent linking technology.
Using this technology, a Thalia smoke alarm can ring a bedside
alarm clock in case of a fire. A Thalia coffee pot can set its time
from the same alarm clock and even send a message that will flash
on the clock's display screen that you forgot to add water. The
goal with each of the products is simplicity. You plug in the
coffee maker, and it sets its own clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average home has over 23 appliances,'' Hamann said. ``That
is a lot of stuff to manage. If overcoming physical burdens was key
in the 20th century, we think that overcoming mental burdens is key
to the 21st century. We feel that most consumers want basic
functions, fewer buttons, lower costs and simple benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would disagree that everyday machines should become smarter
and make lives easier. But not every machine will be made smarter
with such noble intentions. No wonder that when Coke announced a
new smart vending machine that would raise its own prices when the
temperature rose, consumers reacted with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Minsky, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology known for his work spanning electrical engineering,
computer science, new media and artificial intelligence, takes an
ironist's view to consumer hesitancy to embrace smart appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it is good that new ideas are unwelcome to almost
everyone,'' Minsky said. ``That's partly why we have semistable
cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   If Minsky is right, the smart machine may be a long time coming,
no matter how many rollouts and trade shows there are. Until then,
we can always get Cokes from our own refrigerators and freshly made
ice. No one, not even the refrigerator, will be the wiser.

DO VIEWERS EVEN WANT TO INTERACT WITH TV?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The companies working to bring interactive television to the
United States are endlessly optimistic that the big breakthrough
for their industry is just around the corner, despite nearly 50
years of miscast experimentation and failure.
</P>
<P>
   But at a large conference at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel in New
York last week, where several hundred industry executives gathered
to promote their industry and learn from one another, the
boosterism was tempered by frequent discordant notes and the
grudging consensus that nobody really knows what, if anything, the
public may want.
</P>
<P>
   And then, late in the day, a broadcaster offered the group the
verity he said they all would have to accept: people watch
television to be entertained, and anything that pulls them away
from that entertainment is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think people will want to stop and buy something in
the middle of that entertainment programming,'' said James M.
Moroney, an executive with Belo Corp., owner of 16 television
stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive television is the catch-all term that applies to
numerous initiatives, both grand and modest, that allow viewers to
interact with their TV programming _ to order products during
commercials or television shows, participate in game shows, change
the programming to better suit the viewers' individual interests or
visit a Web site to view information related to the TV show.
Microsoft's WebTV system is one approach, and the company
demonstrated the system at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1950s, companies have been trying to find the
approach that would kick-start the industry. But for one reason or
another most of the efforts have sputtered or failed, like the
Teletext electronic publishing trials by Time Inc., NBC, CBS and
others in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, millions of Americans are likely to be given another
opportunity to sample updated interactive trials in the next year
or so, as cable networks continue rolling out new digital services
that come with advanced cable boxes. The companies showing their
products at last week's convention, and others not in attendance,
are busily striking deals with cable networks to include their
products among the cable services' new digital programming options.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new interactive services take different
approaches; some stress easy access to movies and music, while
others take viewers to customized Web sites. So it is not clear
which, if any, will succeed. But for any of them to make it, said
Michael Collette, a senior vice president for ICTV, one of the
contenders, ``they are going to have to have a big, mass market.''
But he cited signs of a fractured marketing, noting that ``about
nine digital set-top boxes are about to ship into the U.S. market,
and they are all very different.''
</P>
<P>
   John Carey, a consultant who spoke to the group in the morning,
offered the rallying cry that has kept the industry's enthusiasm
alive, despite the stumbles. ``When you read that consumers have
rejected interactive television,'' he said, ``it's simply not
true.'' All of the failures, he contends, have been the result of
poor implementation or marketing.
</P>
<P>
   He offered as an example the first attempt, the early 1950s
Saturday morning children's show ``Winky Dink and You,'' which sent
children clear plastic sheets they were to stick on the TV screen.
When the show's cartoon character was about to fall off a cliff, as
an example, the viewer would stick the sheet over the screen, use a
crayon to draw a bridge and watch the character cross it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kids didn't use the plastic screen,'' Carey said.
``They drew directly on the TV screen. Parents were furious, and
service was canceled.'' That was interactive television's first
implementation error. Many more followed, including a Time Warner
trial in Orlando, Fla., in the mid 1990s. The system cost so much
to operate that it almost didn't matter whether viewers liked it.
Time Warner shut it down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only modest forms of interactivity seem to have won over
enough consumers to remain viable, and generally they do not pull
viewers out of the programs. Most are simply sophisticated ways to
order programming.
</P>
<P>
   On-screen program guides have proved popular. They come with
satellite television and some cable systems and provide a TV-guide
grid on the screen. A viewer scrolls through the guide and clicks
on the program he wants to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a big winner,'' said Robert Rosenthal, director of new
media projects for the Cablevision cable company. ``And there's
tremendous interest in video on demand'' _ the ability to order a
movie or other program at any time.
</P>
<P>
   But companies showing their wares at the conference,
orchestrated by Myers Forums, a research firm that puts on business
conventions, were promoting more ambitious services.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Wink, has enjoyed more success than most of the
others. The company has struck deals with the major television
networks and cable companies. Subscribers to the service, which is
free to the consumer, must have an advanced digital cable box. When
a small logo pops onto the screen, pressing a button on the remote
control calls up more information about a show that runs on the
bottom of the screen, or orders a sample product or brochure during
a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already deployed in 10 cable markets in the U.S.,'' said
Allan Thygesen, a senior vice president for Wink.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Intertainer, Inc., of Frederick, Md., offers a
system with a full suite of services, from ordering movies to
games, news, information and more. But the company is not content
to wait until interactive television takes off. Already it is
offering the service over the Internet to people who have high
speed, broadband connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big play is traditional TV,'' said Brendan Carney, a
company officer. But the PC version ``is being offered right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Lauder, a venture capital investor who has put money into
several companies in this field, including ICTV, thinks part of the
problem is that not every one still takes the industry seriously.
``The over promises have resulted in a loss of credibility,'' he
told the group.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem might be a shortage of new ideas. At the end of
the day, after dozens of speeches and demonstrations, a moderator
asked the group if anyone had heard or seen anything during the day
that they had not seen before. Not one person raised a hand.

KOCH FINDS A NEW CALLING IN A CONSUMER LEGAL SITE 
JERRY SPRINGER SOUNDS OFF ON THE INTERNET, PEOPLE AND CHEWING GUM

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Koch was sitting in his 30th-floor law office in Rockefeller
Center one day last fall when he got a phone call from a
28-year-old lawyer who wanted to start a legal Web site for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The timing was auspicious. The feisty former mayor of New York
had just finished ``I'm Not Done Yet!'' _ his memoir of staying
active and in the public eye past 70. And now, the dot-com world
beckoned. ``Ah,'' he recalled thinking at the time, ``to be 75 and
still relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of that phone conversation, TheLaw.com, is to appear
on the Web Monday. Koch's co-founder of the site is that young
lawyer, David Polinsky, who is the chief executive of the venture.
Robert Kinelski, who has an M.B.A. from the Wharton School and is a
former marketing executive at Colgate Palmolive, is the chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   In a first round of financing, TheLaw.com attracted roughly $2
million from Israel Seed Partners, a venture fund in Israel, and
this week, Koch said, he and the other executive team members plan
to be in California seeking a ``substantial second round'' of
venture capital. TheLaw.com is also set to appear this week at
Demo, a technology conference in Indian Wells, Calif., where 80
companies, selected from 1,000 applicants, will show off new
products and services. Hundreds of venture capitalists attend,
browsing for promising investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The founding team is passionate about the law, and they see
law as entertainment, as well,'' said Chris Shipley, the editor of
the DemoLetter who runs the conference. ``And I was impressed by Ed
Koch, who understands both those things.''
</P>
<P>
   TheLaw.com joins a handful of other legal sites, including
USLaw.com and Findlaw.com. But Kinelski insists that TheLaw.com
will be the first ``truly consumer law site.'' It is intended, he
said, to ``translate legal complexity into plain English and
empower people so they don't feel intimidated by lawyers when a
life event involves an encounter with the legal system, like
divorce, bankruptcy, a real estate contract or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The site will sell ads and directory listings for law firms.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, TheLaw.com will offer 25 legal topics, with plans to
expand to more than three dozen soon. Law school professors from
around the country are being signed up to contribute online
commentary and advice in their areas of specialty. Its contributors
will weigh in with ``legal reality checks'' on movies, television
programs and novels in which lawyers are prominent characters. And
Koch plans to do online chat sessions for an hour or two each week.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hizzoner a hacker? ``No,'' Koch said, adding that he farms
out most computing chores to three assistants in his law office.
``But it's my intention to become computer literate.''

   Jerry Springer on the Internet, People and Chewing Gum
</P>
<P>
   To hear Jerry Springer talk about the impact of the Internet,
you would think the future was already here. And the future looks a
lot like Springer's television show.
</P>
<P>
   ``With television, we've always had celebrities talking to us,''
Springer said after appearing as the featured speaker at an
Internet conference called Shout 2000 last Thursday in Redwood
City, Calif. ``With the Internet, we won't have just actors, but
real people playing themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Real people, of course, is what ``The Jerry Springer Show'' is
all about. The program, the most widely watched talk show on
daytime television, is notorious for highlighting people in
extraordinary, and sometimes disturbing, situations. Teen-age
prostitutes, bizarre love triangles and kinky extramarital affairs
have been among the subjects, some of which have led to on-air
brawls among the adversarial guests. The show that Springer calls
his favorite was one featuring a man who said he had married his
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Even Springer acknowledges that his program is rarely about
anything important. ``It's stupid _ it's chewing gum,'' he said in
his Shout 2000 presentation. ``My job is to let people have their
moment,'' he said. ``My primary motivation in my show is to make
sure I don't get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shout 2000 conference, with about 350 people in attendance,
was sponsored by HearMe.com, an Internet company whose voice
technology enables groups of people to talk online. Springer, a
lawyer who has been the mayor of Cincinnati, a civil rights
activist, a news anchor and a foreign news reporter in Ethiopia,
was asked to give the keynote address not because he knows much
about the Internet _ he rarely uses it _ but because his TV show
makes stars out of real people in just the same way the Internet
supposedly can.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever someone who knows about the everyperson
getting their 15 minutes of fame, it's Jerry Springer,'' said Paul
Matteucci, chief executive of HearMe.com.
</P>
<P>
   Springer said he had no current plans to move his show to the
Internet, but he said that day would come. In fact, he predicts
that within 10 years most households will get all their
entertainment and information from a single screen-based device.
</P>
<P>
   But even then, he says, there will still be a role for talk show
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it personally affect me in my job _ probably not,''
Springer said. ``We'll still need to produce a show.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the Internet, at least, there is less chance that he will
get hurt.

BRILL EDITOR IS WEARING TWO HATS, ONE ELECTRONIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Nonsubscribers

<P>
   His new job was only hours old, but already the editor in chief
of Brill's Content was promising ``evolution, not revolution'' at
the magazine that offers a sober leveling gaze at the media
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Just how David Kuhn will achieve this is evolving, given his
transformation into a one-man executive conglomerate whose task it
is to fuse a watchdog and a Web site _ leading Brill's Content and
its baby-sister Internet company, Contentville.com.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Steven T. Brill stepped down as editor in chief of
the magazine in the same week he announced that his company, Brill
Media Holdings, would form a partnership with media giants like
NBC, CBS, Primedia and the Ingram Book Group. The partnership plans
to create Contentville, which will provide magazine subscriptions,
books, reviews and columns. Brill remains chairman and chief
executive of his holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's announcement immediately raised questions about
whether the venture could compromise the magazine's independence
because of alliances with broadcast networks that are subject to
the scrutiny of Brill's Content. But Brill said the executive
changes were not a result of criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to take credit for thinking that through so
logically,'' he said. ``That really wasn't on my mind. I think if
there's a conflict, it would still be there. And if there's an
appearance of a conflict, it would still be there. I think, though,
that in some sense it makes some of these issues a little cleaner
in the sense that I'm not going to be involved day to day with the
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill added that he waited to announce Kuhn's appointment as
executive editor to avoid ``stepping on'' the story about the
Contentville partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn is a Harvard graduate with a background in art and history
who has never worked as a writer or reporter. For almost a dozen
years, Kuhn was a deputy of the editor Tina Brown, following her
from Vanity Fair to The New Yorker and Talk magazine, where he was
executive editor for about a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really tireless in scouting out stories,'' said Henry
Finder, the New Yorker's editorial director. ``He was probably
responsible for most of the story ideas in some of the special
issues he put together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the magazine industry, Kuhn is regarded as an editor whose
strengths are his ideas, connections and packaging skills with a
bent toward celebrity articles.
</P>
<P>
   At Brill's Content, there has been constant staff turnover,
although several writers said there was guarded optimism about
Kuhn's arrival because of the potential that he might bring some
electricity to the magazine. It has been criticized in some
quarters as dull and preachy.
</P>
<P>
   Kuhn said that hiring will increase for the Internet company and
Brill's Content, which will share stories, ideas and space on the
same floor. ``Right now, the people that I've hired on the
editorial side of Contentville are going to be primarily focused on
that,'' he said, ``but by being the editor in chief of the
magazine, I'm going to know how to use their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a memo to the staff, Brill predicted that the magazine staff
was bound to face questions about whether an e-commerce site had
taken over Brill's Content. But he said that the ``whole idea of
this consolidation is to put the most trailblazing editorial
content of the e-commerce site under the control of the magazine's
editorial staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill will remain actively involved with the magazine,
continuing to write and review articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``it is literally the truth that I read
everything that goes into the magazine at least three times and now
that is certainly not going to be the case. Two months from now, I
might be reading everything that goes into the magazine once. And
six months from now, when it's clear that David and I are on the
same wave length, I may not read anything at all.''

CRITICS ATTACK DOUBLECLICK'S WEB TRACKING AS INTRUSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DoubleClick, a company that tracks consumers as they make their
way around the Web, has never been popular with privacy advocates.
In recent weeks, though, mere tension has grown into all-out war
with the announcement that the company has begun adding information
about consumers' offline behavior to its vast database.
</P>
<P>
   One advocacy group, the Electronic Privacy Information Center,
said last week that it was preparing a complaint to the Federal
Trade Commission about DoubleClick's tracking practices. Another,
the Center for Democracy and Technology, announced a campaign to
persuade consumers to opt out of DoubleClick's tracking system.
</P>
<P>
   Even industry analysts have criticized the company, saying
consumers should be able to block DoubleClick's system more easily.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick has grown rapidly into an Internet advertising
powerhouse over the last few years with two business strategies.
First, it licenses to 11,000 clients software that places
advertisements on Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   But its far more controversial business is a service it provides
to its advertising network, the 1,500 companies that receive their
advertisements directly from DoubleClick: monitoring the behavior
of individual consumers as they move around the Internet sites that
Doubleclick is affiliated with. The information it gathers is
aggregated in a huge database, which enables the company to
personalize the ads people see when they visit its network's Web
sites _ ads that play directly to an individual consumer's
interests and buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers love the advantages this gives them in focusing on
precisely the right buyers. Privacy advocates, though, have never
been comfortable with the fact that few consumers realize they are
being monitored, and that when they do realize it, they often find
it difficult to opt out _ that is, to instruct DoubleClick not to
track their online activities.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy concerns are increasing because DoubleClick's new Abacus
Alliance service, created after DoubleClick bought the database
company Abacus Direct last year, has begun combining its online
data with information gleaned from consumers' offline purchases
from major retailers, catalog companies and publishers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an alliance member who sells printer cartridges
could get a list of 1,000 people who have bought computer printers
from retail stores in the last six months. When those people are
surfing other alliance sites in search of information on
replacement cartridges, DoubleClick could show them an ad for one
that matches their computer.
</P>
<P>
   Not all 1,500 members of the DoubleClick network will get the
extra data, however, only those that join the Abacus Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick argues that such behavioral monitoring helps
consumers, and the company stresses that Internet users will be
notified of the tracking and given the opportunity to opt out of
the program.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick also pledges that the alliance will not collect
information on medical, financial or sexual behavior, or on
children's surfing habits.
</P>
<P>
   Such statements have done little to mollify privacy groups,
however. For one thing, the company is under no legal obligation to
live by those restrictions and is free to change its policy
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   If the criticisms of privacy advocates fail to generate much
alarm among the majority of Internet users, the company says, it
might be because they view such advertising methods as a service.
On the other hand, privacy advocates say, it could simply be that
few consumers know what DoubleClick is, much less what it does.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say most Internet users are not aware that Web-site
publishers often do not have full control over the ads they display
because they rely on third parties to place those ads _ and to
determine which consumers see which ads. The portal AltaVista, for
example, uses such an approach to avoid the cost of developing and
maintaining in-house computer systems for placing ads.
</P>
<P>
   Though advertising networks like DoubleClick collect fees for
placing ads on their clients' Web pages, they stand to benefit even
more, perhaps, from the data they collect.
</P>
<P>
   When a computer user views an ad on a DoubleClick network site
for the first time, DoubleClick assigns an identifying number to
the user's hard drive in a file known as a cookie. Each subsequent
time that computer shows up on another DoubleClick network Web
site, the network recognizes the visitor and notes his activities,
including what type of content he is viewing.
</P>
<P>
   So, for example, if one or more users at the same computer visit
a particular car maker's pages on automobile Web sites affiliated
with DoubleClick, DoubleClick can recognize that computer when a
user shows up on any of its 1,500 affiliated sites and display the
ad of the automaker _ or an ad for another car maker who has paid
DoubleClick (handsomely in most cases).
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of consumers want targeted ads,'' said Jonathan
Shapiro, DoubleClick's senior vice president. While acknowledging
that 50,000 people had opted out of DoubleClick's tracking system
in the last four years, most do not, he said, because the ads they
end up receiving are ``much more relevant'' to their interests and
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the tracking phenomenon was gaining momentum, as
advertisers demand greater results for their ad dollars. It is
natural, they said, to try to improve the potency of the tracking
systems by integrating data from online and offline sources.
</P>
<P>
   Not all advertising networks agree, though. Some, in fact, are
looking to gain market share as privacy concerns grow. Real Media,
for example, is building a business model on technologies that
attempt to protect consumer privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the expectations of our business was that consumer
information would become very valuable,'' said Dave Morgan, Real
Media's chairman and founder. ``We expected that consumers would
not be comfortable trusting their private information to parties
with whom they have no relationship. But they would entrust that
information to a limited number of sites they'd built a
relationship with.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he said, Real Media's software enables a site to
track a visitor's movements and to use that information to place
ads that are better targeted. But it also allows Web sites to
prevent the sharing of that information with other advertisers,
marketers and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   (Real Media licenses its ad-serving technology to Times Company
Digital, which publishes The New York Times on the Web. Times
Company Digital also accepts advertisements delivered by any of the
companies that license ad placement software, including
DoubleClick. It is not part of those networks, however, and Times
Company Digital says it does not share data about individual users'
behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said he expected this approach would give Real Media a
competitive advantage in markets outside the United States,
especially in Europe, where users and governments are more vigilant
about privacy. ``And ultimately, we think it'll give us an
advantage in the U.S., as well,'' he said, given what he called
``the privacy backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel MacKeigan, an analyst with the investment firm Friedman
Billings Ramsay, said that neither Real Media nor DoubleClick had
necessarily struck the perfect balance. ``There's definitely a
changing tide when it comes to privacy,'' he said. ``But
advertisers like data, and by not using it, Real Media's missing a
large opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   But MacKeigan also said that if the vast majority of consumers
are to accept the DoubleClick model, the company ``will have to
give them a viable economic reason to be tracked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance,'' he said, ``give me a discount on something I'd
been checking out, and do it in a subtle way.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``DoubleClick has to give consumers a better way
to opt out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry want ad networks to adopt an ``opt-in''
model, whereby people must request to be included in the program
before they can be tracked, while others prefer the idea of a
single Web site that users could visit to opt out of all such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry debates, however, the prospects for government
regulation _ and consumer enmity _ grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, how far can you take this?'' MacKeigan said.
``Is this a new medium that has less of a tolerance for tracking? A
privacy cloud looms on the horizon, and DoubleClick has to heed the
warnings.''

VENTURE CAPITAL MOVES EAST TO SILICON ALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was the sort of ``elevator pitch'' that Timothy C.
Draper listens to every day _ a business plan breathlessly
delivered to an impatient listener.
</P>
<P>
   Four entrepreneurs _ three in their 30s and the obligatory
gray-haired chief financial officer _ were rushing last Tuesday to
describe a business they hoped would be the next big thing on the
Internet. In this case, it was a service called Sticky Networks,
which hopes to let people search the Web using pictures rather than
words.
</P>
<P>
   They knew that Draper's venture capital firm, Draper Fisher
Jurvetson, based in Redwood City, Calif., could help finance their
business and, more important, open doors with its prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Draper peppered them with his usual questions: Where did you go
to school? What have you done before? What is the business model?
What's to stop anyone else from doing the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   But there was one thing that was quite different from Draper's
routine. This pitch was not in the conference room of his office in
Silicon Valley, but in a 39th-floor suite of the New York Palace
Hotel, overlooking Rockefeller Center and the heart of New York's
corporate life.
</P>
<P>
   Attention New York entrepreneurs: The checkbooks have landed.
</P>
<P>
   When the first people tried to start Internet companies here in
the mid-'90s, they had to scrounge to raise money. To their
chagrin, the big Silicon Valley venture capital firms like Draper
largely shunned New York as a backwater with no history of
entrepreneurship or technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But now with the success of a wide range of Internet and
new-media companies in and around New York City, including the
stock market darlings DoubleClick and StarMedia Network, there are
an abundance of new and newly expanded venture capital funds in New
York, with many hundreds of millions of fresh dollars looking for
young Internet businesses to invest in _ in hopes of a big payoff
when the company eventually goes public or gets acquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vacuum of venture capital on the East Coast has been
filled,'' said Alexander D. Lynch, a partner at Brobeck Phleger &AMP;
Harrison, a law firm that represents a number of Internet
start-ups. ``There is so much money chasing deals from the existing
funds and the new funds. This is now a very good market to raise
money if you are an entrepreneur.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some investors have begun to wonder whether there may
soon be too much money chasing too few marketable business plans in
Silicon Alley _ a label that once denoted the new-media scene in
downtown Manhattan but now refers loosely to Internet-related
activities throughout the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that some Wall Street powerhouses that used to
ignore deals that could not be measured in the billions _ including
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buyout tycoons _ now deign
to put mere millions into digital start-ups. Established New York
venture capital firms _ like Venrock Associates, the Rockefeller
family's venture investing arm _ are embracing the sort of Internet
deals they would have snubbed even a year ago. And the few firms
that did invest early in Silicon Alley are growing much larger.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns' Constellation Ventures and Wit Capital's
Dawntreader fund, for example, are both said to be in the process
of raising new funds of more than $200 million each.
</P>
<P>
   And Flatiron Partners, perhaps the most prominent New York
Internet fund, is investing money on behalf of Chase Manhattan at
an accelerating pace.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many more people with money and rich friends are for
the first time putting together funds to seek their fortunes as
venture capitalists. One of these is I-Hatch Ventures, a new fund
started by Chip Austin, former head of Bertelsmann's online
bookstore; Derek Reisfield, who once ran CBS' Internet unit; and
Brad Farkas, a former venture capitalist at Lazard Freres. I-Hatch
expects to raise $150 million, an unusually large amount for a
first-time fund.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, a number of Silicon Valley venture
capitalists are expanding into New York. Draper, for example, hired
two former Wall Street executives who had been trying to start
their own fund _ Dan Schultz and Ross Goldstein _ to open a New
York affiliate, Draper Fisher Gotham, which had an elaborate debut
party last Wednesday at which Draper appeared in a Batman costume.
It also made its first investment last week: Mimeo.com, a sort of
Internet Kinko's that plans to offer express shipment of copied
documents; Draper has not yet decided whether to invest in Sticky
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   And Adam Dell, who late last year left Crosspoint Venture
Partners, a Silicon Valley firm where he was a partner, has started
Impact Venture Partners, a $100 million fund in New York devoted to
business-to-business Internet investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great opportunity here because there are so many
old-line companies that will be reinvented on the Internet and so
many great operations people,'' said Dell, who is the younger
brother of the computer mogul Michael S. Dell. ``And on the East
Coast there just aren't the sheer number of investment firms that
exist on the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the $760 million in venture capital investments in
New York during the first nine months of 1999 was dwarfed by the
$8.1 billion invested in Bay Area start-ups during the same period,
according to Venture One, a San Francisco market research firm. But
New York venture investments were increasing at an annual rate of
205 percent from a year earlier, compared with a 145 percent
increase in Silicon Valley.

<P>
   New York is growing as an Internet center because most of its
traditional industries _ finance, retailing, broadcasting,
publishing, advertising and the rest _ are becoming more involved
than ever in the Internet and the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West Coast creates technology and the East Coast creates
brands,'' said Robert H. Lessin, chairman of Wit Capital. ``Now
that technology is becoming off the shelf, companies need media
companies as partners to build their brands. And every media
company other than Disney is here.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to investing in Internet start-ups, Wit has helped
companies trade equity for promotion. Wit, for example, last year
helped Iwon.com, a Web site that offers its users chances to win
cash prizes, obtain broadcast advertising time on CBS in exchange
for CBS's acquiring a stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, venture capitalists in New York are now looking to
invest much earlier in a company's life cycle than venture
investors did in the past. That is because the stock market
nowadays is willing to embrace initial public stock offerings from
companies so young they barely have any revenue _ let alone
profits. So companies do not need to go back and raise the
traditional second or third rounds of financing that venture
capitalists previously specialized in.
</P>
<P>
   Few venture funds want to wait that long, given the buoyant
market for the stocks of Internet companies, which have made
astounding profits for the earliest investors in such companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen fewer opportunities to invest at later stages, so
we have refocused our energy on earlier-stage investments,'' said
William E. Ford, a managing partner with General Atlantic Partners,
a $2 billion, 20-year-old venture fund in Greenwich, Conn. General
Atlantic, for example, invested in Priceline.com before it even
opened for business _ something Ford's firm would never have
considered in the pre-Web days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the smaller funds are moving to compete with the
so-called ``angel investors'' _ wealthy individuals who
traditionally provided initial grubstakes to companies too young to
seek financing from the venture funds, which are run by
professional money managers and which pool the resources of many
investors.
</P>
<P>
   New venture funds, like I-Hatch, now play the role of an angel
investor. ``We want to find the guy as he is just looking for the
cocktail napkin to write his idea on,'' Austin of I-Hatch said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like all venture capital firms, I-Hatch hopes to attract
companies with its advice and business contacts as well as its
cash. I-Hatch, in other words, helps do much of the work that the
entrepreneurs themselves formerly had to do before daring to ask
anyone for funding. ``We help people refine their fuzzy ideas and
get to the next level,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to advice, investors like I-Hatch and Rare Medium _
a Web development firm with a venture capital arm _ are setting up
``incubators'' where very young companies can receive office space
and technical services in return for equity stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Draper's new New York affiliate will not go as far as providing
office space, but Draper says the companies it backs receive
something even more useful: invitations to the firm's frequent
cocktail receptions, where the 200 other companies backed by Draper
affiliates in Silicon Valley, Los Angeles and Virginia can flirt
with each other and form alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Internet company is only as valuable as the deals it has
made,'' Draper said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, determining the value of an Internet company can be a
conundrum for venture capitalists these days, especially when the
company is at the ``pre-revenue'' or even ``pre-cocktail-napkin''
stage. The frenzied competition among venture firms, and among the
firms and angel investors, is causing some qualms in the investment
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see a company with great prospects, but it is
overpriced,'' said Clifford H. Friedman, managing partner of
Constellation Ventures. ``The angels invested at a $25 million
valuation, and we think it's worth only $15 million or $20 million.
That's not a comfortable situation and we've lost some deals
because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Fred Wilson of Flatiron Partners _ which was an early player
in Silicon Alley, having been formed way back in 1996 _ this surge
in investment at ever higher values is a sign that there is in fact
too much venture capital in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of company creation going on is unsustainable,''
Wilson said. ``I would not be surprised if there were 20 or 30 new
Internet companies a day being formed in New York. That's scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are forming companies for the wrong reasons,'' he
added. ``They aren't passionate about their ideas. They just want
to be millionaires like all their friends, and there is so much
capital in New York that anybody can start a company today.''

 &HT;    Smut in the office?
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier

<P>
   ATLANTA _ First John Rocker, now this.
</P>
<P>
   A study by NetPulse shows that Southerners are more likely than
people from any other region to download pornography at work while
on break.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent peek into the mind of the Atlanta Braves relief
pitcher didn't make Southerners look bad enough, this might.
</P>
<P>
   The Web study was paid for by the folks at Pogo.com, a Web site
devoted to online versions of offline games like backgammon, euchre
and poker.
</P>
<P>
   But a solid 2 percent of the polled _ roughly 20 people _ were
bold enough to download porn on the boss's bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners were three times as likely to download porn as folks
from the East Coast, and apparently it would be twice as easy to
find a porn-looker at a workplace in the South than it would on the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to hunt for online pictures of naked people is
found most often in white-collar workers, defined as people earning
more than $75,000 a year, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Unmarried employees were four times as likely as their
spoken-for co-workers to enjoy looking for X-rated material while
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, male porn fans outnumbered females 20 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   NetPulse is a weekly survey that polls a panel of 1,000 people
who are weighted by age, gender and region to represent Internet
users.
</P>
<P>
   JOINING TV, NET
</P>
<P>
   You might have seen the ads during the Super Bowl in which ABC
was trying to steer viewers toward its ``enhanced TV'' function,
which blends television show with Web site. But is anyone really
sitting there, mouse in one hand, clicker in the other?
</P>
<P>
   According to Cyber Dialogue, some are.
</P>
<P>
   The Web research firm found that 10 million people visit Web
sites and watch TV at the same time. Of those, one of every four is
doing it during a sporting event. The next most commonly watched
and surfed events are situation comedies and news magazines, each
of which attracted 13 percent of those polled. General news, games
and product information sites also attracted visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people polled, 66 percent, were not taking full
advantage of enhanced television's features. About two-thirds of
the people polled were online and just had the television on in the
background, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Dialogue's survey included interviews with 1,000 Internet
users and 1,000 nonusers. The survey has been conducted every three
months since 1994. Cyber Dialogue is an Internet customer
relationship management company that offers data and services that
help businesses target online consumers.

   HOT DOG SITE A REAL WIENER
</P>
<P>
   The hot dog is the cockroach of foods. Upton Sinclair couldn't
kill it early last century with his literary expose on the
meat-packing industry.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of jokes about what exactly goes in them has not
dampened people's taste buds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, we ate 20 billion hot dogs, 7 billion between
Memorial Day and Labor Day. That's roughly 73 hot dogs for every
American. A new Web site is devoted to the study and appreciation
of our love of encased pork and beef byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.hot-dog.org/, is sponsored by the National Hot Dog
and Sausage Council and the American Meat Institute. It is
apparently designed to counter negative perceptions about wieners.
The material sounds a little defensive. For example, the site
includes ``the real story'' of how hot dogs are made:
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of hot dogs and sausages consist of the same
high-quality meats that shoppers buy straight out of their grocer's
meat case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confused about what goes into processed meat products like
sausage and hot dogs? You are probably not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``For literally centuries, hot dogs and sausages have suffered
from more than their fair share of misperceptions about their
content and manufacture.''
</P>
<P>
   The site includes recipes for such things as sausage pancake
puffs, sausage stir-fry and sausage pie.

Speakers no longer have to be massive and expensive to get the job
done &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter how much you invest in receivers, DVD
machines or digital recordings, nothing enhances the sound better
than choice speakers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when the speakers, collectively, amounted to
the lion's share of the cost of a good sound system. Today,
speakers that make a true difference are cheaper proportionally
than they were many years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, experts say they last longer, because they are
manufactured from materials like polypropylene rather than the
fiber likely to be found in vintage speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The really good news is that the efficiency of speakers _ their
ability to work well with less raw power from the amplifiers _ has
improved, making speakers today smaller.
</P>
<P>
   That means speakers are more easily movable and can be located
in spots unthinkable just several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers that perform like the familiar towers of blessed memory
now can be mounted on bookshelves, on pedestals, or even hung from
ceilings and walls, leaving more space for the growing number of
machines for sound and video.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, it means that speakers can be used in ensembles
or systems _ not just the familiar enthusiast's setup with two
mountainous $2,000 Klipsch speakers, weighing about 50 pounds
apiece, topped off with a cute little tweeter horn atop each.
</P>
<P>
   Now the new standard, for music and so-called home theater,
involves five or six speakers. Manufacturers as diverse as Boston
Acoustic, JBL, Klipsch and others are producing such ``matched''
sets of speakers for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrangement usually features three speakers across the
front and two rear speakers, with a powered subwoofer tucked away
almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The subwoofer is run by its own electrical power source and is
not a ``slave'' like the other speakers, which draw their power
directly from the amplifier. Because low frequencies are not
directional, the subwoofer can be put in a corner. It has always
taken more electrical power to produce the ground-shaking bass
notes than others, and that's why a separate power supply is used.
And that's also why the remaining speakers, mostly not bearing so
much of the bass responsibility, can be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the apportioning of the sound production among the
six speakers means that each can carry out specific assignments,
behaving more like a team or an audio chorus surrounding the
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, where DVD is concerned, the system has to reproduce a
huge range of sounds ranging from crashes and crunches to whispers
and the tinkling of glasses. The speaking voices come from the very
important center channel speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, that speaker should have broad tonal range, but it
does not have great responsibility for bass.
</P>
<P>
   In one nice touch, a Bose center channel speaker, the VCS 10 for
$199 at Circuit City, looks terrific. It's has a long, low
silhouette that turns the head. It reminds us, especially the
old-timers, of the days when speakers were furniture, meant to
enhance the room. Now, function's mostly the thing.
</P>
<P>
   The two rear speakers and the front corner speakers should be
lively, eloquent in producing high notes and discerning in
separating the other sounds, giving what audio lovers call a
transparent sound.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIFICATIONS SIMILAR
</P>
<P>
   The odd thing about speakers is that they all tend to have
nearly the same numerical specifications, the numbers that show how
many cycles per second the speaker can reproduce. A zillion
kilohertz or cycles represent the high notes, and a kilohertz range
under 100, sometimes in the 25 to 30 range, represents the lows.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers aside, how do they sound?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is they sound different. Some speakers, like the old
reliable DCM TimeWindows and the newer JBL and Boston Acoustic
speakers, can produce a mellow sound that seems especially suited
to subtle music, like jazz and classical music, and crooning _
either in solos and in choruses.
</P>
<P>
   But the vibrant modern sounds, including movie soundtracks, come
across dramatically in speakers like the Klipsch set that I enjoyed
one day.
</P>
<P>
   The Klipsch Micro Quintet gets by with four speakers no larger
than alarm clocks, combined with a center channel speaker not much
larger, and a hefty subwoofer. But the little package fills a room
as home theater.
</P>
<P>
   There are other systems I like better for straight music, but
it's a matter of taste _ and you have to listen and compare.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that given the double mission of producing
home theater and the best in serious musical sounds, the priority
should be to plunk down the lion's share of investment across the
front with emphasis on the two front side speakers.
</P>
<P>
   When the theater is closed at the end of the day, and you want
to spend another mellow hour with Grieg, or Robert Shaw's
choristers or Sinatra or Miles Davis' ``Kinda Blue,'' the two
classically situated dual stereo speakers must keep the candle
glowing.
</P>
<P>
   That means speakers with good range and accurate but not
overbearing playback. What we used to call high fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   In this area, you get what you pay for, and few are better than
the Boston Acoustics floor standing towers with built-in powered
woofers, and similar machines by Mirage, JBL, Klipsch and others,
mostly in the range of $1,500 to $3,500 a pair.

 &HT;    Custom CDs, easy as pie
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The idea of mixing pizza and pop music is a
no-brainer. College students, the cooking-impaired and the just
plain lazy have kept takeout pizza joints in business for decades.
</P>
<P>
   So the promotional offline/online marriage of Pizza Hut and
CDNow draws attention not just to CDNow, an online purveyor of
music and music-related products, but to the world of custom CDs.
Everyone knows what pizza is, but this promotion just might send a
few pizza lovers online to make their own personalized CDs, which
is one of the cooler things you can do on the Web. It's 100 percent
legal and a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The deal works like this: If you buy a certain type of pizza
from Pizza Hut, you get a code number to access a special area on
CDNow. Within that area, you'll be able to put together your own CD
that can include tracks from some pretty big stars including the
Red Hot Chili Peppers, Britney Spears, B.B. King and Dave Matthews
to name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Pizza Hut clearly see this as an opportunity to get
people to buy the pizza it sells instead of pizza from Domino's or
Papa John's. They know the young, hungry and wired crowd is
probably eating pizza while listening to CDs in their CD-ROM drives
while surfing the Web anyway. It's a stroke of marketing genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most exciting promotions Pizza Hut has ever
undertaken,'' Pizza Hut President Randy Gier said in a statement
that really isn't hype. ``Because it combines our national reach
and marketing power with CDNow's revolutionary custom music
technology to create a unique reason to bring new customers into
our restaurants. This promotion is also a great way for us to
provide our customers with a fun and free way to experience some of
the coolest, most advanced online music technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Gier has it exactly right. It is exciting, and it will bring
customers into Pizza Hut through the end of February to buy pizza
just so they can make a free CD.
</P>
<P>
   For CDNow, it's an opportunity to draw people to the site. Even
though CDNow was one of the first music sites on the Web, it now
faces stiff competition from a variety of sources, including
Amazon.com, various record stores and even the record labels
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   CDNow isn't the only Web site that offers users the opportunity
to make custom CDs, but the current promotion offers the best
selection of big-time artists. While the promotion offers you the
opportunity to make a free CD, if you happen to be a music fan who
doesn't like pizza, you can still go online and make your own
personalized CD.
</P>
<P>
   Custom CDs have been around on the Web for a while. Along with
CDNow and Tower Records' Web site, there are two sites,
Musicmaker.com and Customdisc.com, that let users choose from a
selection of songs from a variety of artists ranging from Frank
Sinatra to Nirvana. You can fill up your disc with at least 70
minutes of music for a manufacturing fee plus a charge (usually
under a dollar) for each song you select. You also get to play
record producer by arranging the order of the songs and then giving
your CD a title _ and in some cases you even get to pick out what
kind of cover design you'd like. The sound quality is also good.
</P>
<P>
   The other cool thing about building your own custom CD is you
can listen to each song before you decide to add it to your disc.
It's possible to sit and listen to music all day long and not buy a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to make a custom CD, the cost is usually about
$25.99 _ more than you'd probably pay for a CD on sale at the mall,
but then again it isn't customized to suit you and only you.
</P>
<P>
   Custom discs are compact discs that you can play on any CD
player in your home, car or office. They have nothing to do with
MP3, Liquid Audio or any other type of digital download technology.
Your disc comes in the mail several weeks after you place your
order, ready to play. Way back in the '80s, retail stores tried
offering consumers the opportunity to mix their own cassette tapes,
but it was far too labor-intensive for employees, and users would
spend hours in front of the machines sampling songs.
</P>
<P>
   There are some companies that want to bring the custom CD
concept to bricks-and-mortar record stores, but right now the Web
is the only place where music fans can compile their own CDs from a
variety of artists and songs for a pretty reasonable price. For
music lovers who want to make their dream desert island disc,
custom CD sites are definitely worth a visit, whether or not you
buy a pizza.

 &HT;    Overhauling operating system an ambitious move for Apple
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple is preparing to embark on its most ambitious new
product since the introduction of the original Mac 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's called OS X (pronounced ``ten''), and this operating system
software introduces technologies that change not only the look but
the way your Mac will work.
</P>
<P>
   The change is a huge gamble for Apple. The company is moving
from a proven system, beloved by millions, to an unknown
replacement that will require Mac users to relearn much of how they
use their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Why take such a risk? In part, the answer is that Apple has no
choice. While it remains the easiest computer system to use, the
Mac OS is dated. Windows has not only incorporated most of the
Mac's original innovations but has added significant ones of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish itself as the Windows alternative and retain its
mantle as the innovator, Apple has to make a big move.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: The Mac has lost a lot of its stability through
years of tinkering. Now many of the features cobbled onto the
original system will become an integrated part of OS X.
</P>
<P>
   So what is new in OS X? For starters, the system introduces
something called memory protection. What it does is put every
running application in a box. If one goes down, it doesn't take
everything else down with it. That new scheme should help Macs'
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Macs are crash-prone is that the current
operating system can't effectively handle the big memory
requirements of graphic programs such as Photoshop. Apple believes
it has licked this problem in OS X.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the current operating system, OS X automatically
allocates the right amount of memory needed by every application,
which should prevent the snafus that caused the previous system
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   While important, advanced memory management and protection are
invisible to most Mac users. What they'll notice is the zoomy new
look of their Macs, which some have likened to colorful bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still find the Mac's familiar motif of windows, menus,
buttons and icons. But they won't look much like what they used to.
</P>
<P>
   Icons will have the sharpness of photos. Menus are transparent
and cast shadows. Windows have rounded corners, and the buttons are
colorful little bubbles that resemble drops of water.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be something called the dock running along the bottom
of the screen. Think of it as a Windows start menu on steroids. It
will display sharply rendered icons that represent documents and
applications. These icons shrink proportionally as new items are
added to the dock, so that it always fits along the bottom of the
screen. Pass the mouse over an small icon, and it magnifies to a
preset size for legibility.
</P>
<P>
   These a just a few of the many design changes. I'll discuss
these changes at more length in future columns. For information and
snapshots of OS X, check out Apple's promotion Web site at
www.apple.com/macosx.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was one of the hottest toys of the Christmas
season and now it takes its place as the Annoying Gadget of the
Week. It's Hasbro's Interactive Pikachu Plush. If you haven't
experienced this toy, consider yourself lucky. If you have
experienced this toy, you know how cute it is at first. The rotund
yellow toy's cheeks glow red and it coos Pika, Pika ... chuuuuuu!
or Pikachu! or Pika?Chu? Pikachu! This continues until you go
insane or rip the stuffing out of everyone's favorite Pokemon
character. You can find the Interactive Pikachu Plush in little
children's hands all across America. The critters have been seen in
restaurants, on buses and in movie theaters. My advice to anyone
who sees those little red, glowing cheeks or hears the cursed
Pikachu!: Run, run for your life.

MAJOR E-COMMERCE WEB SITES ARE ATTACKED BY HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL with SARA ROBINSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hackers mounted what appeared to be coordinated
attacks on the world's largest electronic commerce sites Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, which opened a window on the widespread
vulnerability of the Internet, began Monday with a three-hour
assault on Yahoo.com, one of the world's most popular Web sites,
and continued Tuesday, temporarily crippling at least four other
major sites, including Amazon.com, eBay.com and Buy.com. By Tuesday
night it had spread to a leading media site, CNN.com.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Buy.com, an online retailer, and the popular
auction site eBay.com said they could not determine for certain
whether all the attacks were related or were by the same person or
persons.
</P>
<P>
   George Grotz, a spokesman for the San Francisco office of the
FBI, said: ``We are still in dialogue with Yahoo. We are aware of
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether the attacks had been by the same people, Grotz
said, ``I think it would be premature at this point to say anything
along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But security experts and the companies themselves said the
nature of the attacks seemed too similar to be coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Elias Levy, chief technology officer for SecurityFocus.com,
which researches computer security issues, said the scope of the
attacks was rare, if not unprecedented. He said the attackers had
managed to assault and take down some of the world's most heavily
enforced sites.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said the evidence suggested the attacks were related.
Significantly, he said given how many resources were required to
take down these sites, it would have been difficult for a copycat
who witnessed Monday's attack on Yahoo to have instantly have
followed suit in such similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt these are coming from the same individual or
group,'' echoed John Vranesevich, the founder of antionline.com, a
Web site focusing on computer security and hacking issues.
</P>
<P>
   It ``is unthinkable'' that several groups of hackers would have
access to this many computers used to direct the attack, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said he expected to see a substantial response from the FBI
in the coming days. ``We're going to see some very busy law
enforcement tomorrow,'' he said. ``I picture planes full of FBI
agents heading to San Jose right now.''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the attackers used what is known as distributed
denial of service, a technique that basically hijacks dozens or
even hundreds or computers around the Internet and instructs each
of the hijacked computers to bombard the target site with
meaningless data.
</P>
<P>
   As the site's server tries to accommodate all the phony data, it
soon runs out of memory and other resources. As a result, its
responses to real customers slows to a crawl or ceases altogether.
</P>
<P>
   However, while it cripples the servers ability to deliver Web
pages to customers, it does not violate the integrity of the
system, nor does it allow access to data stored on the server. So
while such attacks are an expensive form of vandalism, they do not
threaten sensitive data like credit card numbers or other consumer
information.
</P>
<P>
   While such attacks are not unusual, the intensity of the recent
attacks, as measured by the sheer number of computers thought to
have been hijacked for the effort, was virulent enough to bring
down e-commerce sites that are typically fortified enough to fend
off these kinds of assaults.
</P>
<P>
   An eBay spokesman, Kevin Pursglove, said the auction site became
inaccessible to some customers around 3:20 p.m. Pacific Standard
Time, and it was still struggling to thwart the attack two hours
later. He said the company had contacted Yahoo and Buy.com to seek
advice and assistance in defending its servers.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg News reported Amazon.com was slowed for an hour by a
deluge of junk traffic that started at about 5 p.m. Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour assault on Buy.com started at 10:50 a.m. Pacific
time and, unfortunately for the company, the timing coincided with
the company's initial public offering of stock. In the first day of
trading, its shares closed at $25.125 each.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it was getting hit with data from ``more than 50''
computers on the Internet. The company said it was contacted this
morning by the FBI in connection with the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Hawkins, chief executive of Buy.com, said the timing of the
attack on the day of the IPO was ``completely out of control,
needless to say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some people get in, '' he said, ``but in most cases,
people couldn't get into the site.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the site ``clearly lost revenue'' though he did not know
how much. ``We were hoping to see an increase in traffic because of
the IPO.'' The stock opened at $27 and traded as high as $35.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich said the preliminary evidence suggested that the
same hackers were responsible for each attack.
</P>
<P>
   In a denial of service attack, hackers hijack computers not
their own and use them to direct random streams of data at the
target, essentially causing the target machine to become paralyzed.

   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF 175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,150) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can eventually send the child off to college with a new
laptop, with three years of cheap computer experience behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And a lesson in saving money. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (HELPFUL 500-WORD SIDEBAR FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the

telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL;

   The Internet is indeed available for free. Several companies,
such as NetZero (888-433-3363), AltaVista Free Access
(877-584-5551), and WorldSpy (877-779-3425), are giving away Net
access with no contractual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   With each of the first two, you're deluged with ads and links to
E-commerce sites with which the company has relationships.
</P>
<P>
   With NetZero, almost 8 percent of your screen is taken up by
ads, and these ads change every 30 seconds, based on the
information you provide about your lifestyle, hobbies, and
interests. There are also other types of ads _ ads that appear when
you hit the browse button, ads that appear while you're exiting the
service, and sponsorships of on-screen buttons.
</P>
<P>
   WorldSpy operates a bit differently. There are ads only on the
home page. WorldSpy's hope is simply that you will buy from its
E-commerce partners (it gets a cut when you do) and that it will
come to be known as a site to be reckoned with in the E-shopping
world. &QL;

   What is the future of the ``free'' model? Villarosa predicts
that bundling will become increasingly sophisticated as time goes
on. Eventually, it won't be just a computer and Internet access
that are bundled. Your long-distance phone company, utilities,
bank, broker, and other service providers could be in on the
package, offering their own benefits and discounts _ all in the
name of acquiring large packaged groups of consumers at a
relatively low cost.
</P>
<P>
   Free computers don't make sense just for newbies such as Alida
Murphy. Parents might consider these offers as a way to get an
inexpensive computer for the kids, especially if they don't already
have Internet access.

<P>
   HERE ARE SOME POINTS TO CONSIDER BEFORE YOU SIGN ANYTHING: &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOME PROGRAMS HAVE EXTRA FEES, such as InterSquid's $60 shipping
and $40 application (payable only if you're accepted) fees, or
Gobi's $60 shipping fee, and $29.99 processing fee. There may be a
security deposit. You may also have to pay a fee for a credit
check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMER SERVICE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ALL THE TIME. Many of
these companies haven't been prepared for the huge consumer demand
and for newbie computer users' lack of technical knowledge.
InterSquid admits it has experienced customer-service delays.
``Those back-end operations that you thought would take care of
themselves start to be the reason why consumers are dissatisfied,''
says Meehan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOU MAY HAVE TO SIGN UP FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES. FreeMac.com,
for example, requires you to apply for and receive a
FreeMac-branded First USA credit card. A company may also try to
sell you longer warranties on the hardware. In some cases you may
have to pay for technical support, particularly if you want help by
phone instead of by E-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE COMPUTERS MAY BE USED OR REFURBISHED, and may not have
everything needed to operate them _ a monitor, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHIPPING COULD TAKE A WHILE. The average shipping time for Gobi
is two to four weeks. It may also take a long time for your rebate
check to arrive; the CompuServe rebate takes eight to 12 weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW THE LENGTH OF THE INTERNET CONTRACT and the cancellation
penalties, which usually depend on how long you've held the
contract. Know how much time, if any at all, you have to change
your mind. With Gobi, if you cancel within ten days of ordering,
you'll pay $29.99 for order processing, $60 for shipping, $100 for
restocking, and return-shipping fees, even if you haven't yet
received your computer. Once ten days have passed, you must keep
the computer and pay $699 if you cancel within the first year, $499
within the second year, and $249 within the third year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KNOW WHETHER YOU HAVE TO RETURN THE COMPUTER at the end of the
contract. With Gobi, for example, you can keep the computer if you
pay a fee of $50 at the end of the contract. However, Gobi
encourages you to renew your contract, receive a new computer, and
donate the old system to charity _ in that case, the $50 fee does
not apply. To save $150 on the Gobi package, you can pre-pay for
the Internet access. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHEN INTERNET ACCESS IS INVOLVED, either paid or free, you may
be asked to give detailed information about yourself, so that ads
can be targeted to you. This information could be sold to other
companies. Your online activities could also be monitored. Do you
really want someone knowing which words and phrases you're typing
into the search engine? &QL;

   There are parts of your body in high demand these days.
Strangers are out there plotting strategies to woo them. They know
the standard seductions won't work this time. So they are ready to
ply you with something much more enticing, much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The body parts in question: your eyeballs. The lure that
high-tech companies are hoping will trap your gaze: free computers
and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PC used to be a profit-making thing, but now it's just a
commodity,'' says Joseph Villarosa, an independent technology
analyst. Now ``the PC is the enabler of a communication service or
set of services.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, a scramble of companies _ manufacturers,
Internet-service providers, marketing outfits, E-commerce
retailers, and start-ups _ have formed partnerships to offer deals
that make getting wired much more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   There's a dizzying range of offers _ from rebated computers to
free ones, from Internet access bundled with computers to access
that doesn't cost a cent. Most have multiple strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're at all like Alida Murphy, those strings might
actually serve to connect rather than to constrict.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, 40, is a sales assistant for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
in New York. Her household income is on the sunny side of a hundred
grand. She was, until recently, a holdout _ one of the 54 percent
who didn't have a home computer and one of the 64 percent without
Web access.
</P>
<P>
   She had never bought a computer. Never had Internet access at
home. When she got married last February, she decided it would be
nice to be able to do some spreadsheet work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy heard about InterSquid.com (877-724-3733), which offers a
free PC in exchange for a 30-month commitment for Internet service,
at $29.99 a month.
</P>
<P>
   She figured if she ever bought a home computer, she would want
to get Internet access anyway, so the bundled offer seemed like a
good deal. At the end of the two and a half years, she gets to keep
the computer, but if she tries to cancel before then, big-time
penalties apply.
</P>
<P>
   The computer is not exactly cutting-edge: a 400-MHz Intel chip,
64 megs a memory, a 6.4-gig hard drive, a 56k V.90 modem, a 15-inch
color monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, speakers, and Windows 98 _ all
worth about $600 to $800 retail. But it's plenty strong enough to
run spreadsheets, surf the Net, and play computer games.
</P>
<P>
   Over 30 months, she'll pay $1,000: $900 for the Internet
connection, $60 for shipping the computer, and $40 for her
application, which included a credit check.
</P>
<P>
   InterSquid is just one of many new players that have cropped up
on the bundling scene in the past year. Gobi (888-937-4624)
provides a computer when you pay $25.99 a month for three years of
Internet service ($935.64).
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com delivers an Apple iMac in exchange for a three-year,
$19.95-a-month Internet contract ($718.20), available only from the
site.
</P>
<P>
   FreeMac.com also generates revenue from advertising, but it says
its ads are permission-based _ meaning you get them only if you
agree to get them.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular deal is the rebate. Computer manufacturers such
as eMachines are teaming up with ISPs such as CompuServe to offer
rebates in retail stores. You pick one of the many eligible
machines in a store and get a $100 or $400 rebate, depending on
whether you sign up for a one- or three-year contract, at $21.95
per month.
</P>
<P>
   If the machine costs $400, as some do, and you get a $400
rebate, you're essentially getting a free computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you cancel the CompuServe contract, you have to return the
prorated rebate and pay a cancellation free of $25 or $50.
</P>
<P>
   This deal differs from the type InterSquid offers in that you
have more of a choice in computers and contract length. The rebate
is actually paid to you by the Internet-service provider, not the
computer manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   ISPs are thrilled to participate because they're locking in
hordes of customers without the typical hurdles and costs, and
these customers can be groomed to do business online.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a ferocious customer-acquisition landgrab right now to
get the two-thirds of households that are not online onto the
Internet, and companies are doing anything they can to get in front
of them,'' says Emily Meehan, Internet analyst with the Yankee
Group, a research and consulting firm for Internet technology and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Alida Murphy isn't fazed by InterSquid's cancellation penalty _
$400 within the first year, $200 afterward _ because she has no
intention of canceling. For now, she says, InterSquid is getting a
good deal out of her and she's getting a good deal out of
InterSquid.
</P>
<P>
   If she renews her contract, she'll also get a new, upgraded
machine. But Murphy doubts she'll renew. ``The Internet is
available for free now,'' she says. ``How are they gonna match
free?'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   A cork in the ocean, that has been New Zealand during the past
few years, bobbing around on the waves that rebound from Australia
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand dollar has tumbled, the electorate has thrown
out its conservative government, and the stock market is becalmed
as the mania for global investing sails by.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealanders have actually lost money in their market over the
past three years, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index has
surged almost 90 percent since December 1996. Even neighboring
Australia's stock index has climbed 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As buyers snapped up telephone stocks around the world, Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand (which trades as an ADR on the NYSE) managed
only a 1.2 percent gain in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Investors aren't discriminating against small countries here.
Enough Portugal Telecom stock has been bought to drive up its ADR
by 17 percent this past year.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's decision on Nov. 27 to vote in a new, left-center
government, led by Prime Minister Helen Clark, hasn't helped
matters. The currency lost more ground against both the yen and the
dollar, and foreign investors began demanding higher interest rates
from New Zealand borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Left-center governments such as those led by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have presided over
prosperity, and even Canada's Liberal Party, which has driven the
Tories nearly to extinction, enjoys a nice economy, so what gives?
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, not all left-center governments are the same,
especially in their relations with central banks. Independent
central banks are more trustworthy, and this calms inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prudently followed former Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin's advice to ``shut up'' and let Alan Greenspan do what he
wants. (The latter's success has been so grand that presidential
candidate John McCain suggests that if Greenspan dies we put
sunglasses on him, prop him up, and let him continue to run the
Federal Reserve!)
</P>
<P>
   Blair's first important official act was to grant the Bank of
England independence, so it could raise interest rates without
first begging politicians for permission.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder's left-center German government, on the other
hand, hasn't been so wise, often butting into the European Central
Bank's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For this, and other sins, the market knocked down the value of
the euro by about 15 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clark's new government in New Zealand resembles
Schroeder's more than Clinton's or Blair's. The Labor Party and its
coalition partner (the Alliance) slammed the New Zealand central
bank during the election campaign, suggesting that money policy is
the root of all evil.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's first official act was to send her new finance minister
to persuade the excellent central-bank chief Donald Brash to loosen
up his policies.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended with a wishy-washy agreement to ``seek to
avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates, and the
exchange rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly dangerous words, for the market would rather the
government keep out and let Brash do his job. Additional worries
about regulatory and tax policies add to the market's doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any good news? Well, New Zealand is hosting the
America's Cup this month. Also, the economy is actually recovering
nicely from the Asian flu it caught in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Growth should reach almost 3 percent this year, led by exporters
who look forward to shipping more lamb chops, lumber, and fish all
over the world. A cheaper currency should make such goods more
attractive to foreigners and spur the economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   If only the government would shut up, 2000 could be a pretty
good year. &QL;

   A cork in the ocean, that has been New Zealand during the past
few years, bobbing around on the waves that rebound from Australia
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand dollar has tumbled, the electorate has thrown
out its conservative government, and the stock market is becalmed
as the mania for global investing sails by.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealanders have actually lost money in their market over the
past three years, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index has
surged almost 90 percent since December 1996. Even neighboring
Australia's stock index has climbed 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As buyers snapped up telephone stocks around the world, Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand (which trades as an ADR on the NYSE) managed
only a 1.2 percent gain in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Investors aren't discriminating against small countries here.
Enough Portugal Telecom stock has been bought to drive up its ADR
by 17 percent this past year.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's decision on Nov. 27 to vote in a new, left-center
government, led by Prime Minister Helen Clark, hasn't helped
matters. The currency lost more ground against both the yen and the
dollar, and foreign investors began demanding higher interest rates
from New Zealand borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Left-center governments such as those led by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have presided over
prosperity, and even Canada's Liberal Party, which has driven the
Tories nearly to extinction, enjoys a nice economy, so what gives?
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, not all left-center governments are the same,
especially in their relations with central banks. Independent
central banks are more trustworthy, and this calms inflation fears.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton prudently followed former Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin's advice to ``shut up'' and let Alan Greenspan do what he
wants. (The latter's success has been so grand that presidential
candidate John McCain suggests that if Greenspan dies we put
sunglasses on him, prop him up, and let him continue to run the
Federal Reserve!)
</P>
<P>
   Blair's first important official act was to grant the Bank of
England independence, so it could raise interest rates without
first begging politicians for permission.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Schroeder's left-center German government, on the other
hand, hasn't been so wise, often butting into the European Central
Bank's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   For this, and other sins, the market knocked down the value of
the euro by about 15 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clark's new government in New Zealand resembles
Schroeder's more than Clinton's or Blair's. The Labor Party and its
coalition partner (the Alliance) slammed the New Zealand central
bank during the election campaign, suggesting that money policy is
the root of all evil.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's first official act was to send her new finance minister
to persuade the excellent central-bank chief Donald Brash to loosen
up his policies.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting ended with a wishy-washy agreement to ``seek to
avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates, and the
exchange rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly dangerous words, for the market would rather the
government keep out and let Brash do his job. Additional worries
about regulatory and tax policies add to the market's doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any good news? Well, New Zealand is hosting the
America's Cup this month. Also, the economy is actually recovering
nicely from the Asian flu it caught in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Growth should reach almost 3 percent this year, led by exporters
who look forward to shipping more lamb chops, lumber, and fish all
over the world. A cheaper currency should make such goods more
attractive to foreigners and spur the economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   If only the government would shut up, 2000 could be a pretty
good year. &QL;

GRANT FACING A TALL ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lennox Lewis went to Madison Square Garden with four
belts (not counting the one he was wearing) and left with five.
When he returns in 2 1/2 months, Michael Grant intends to make sure
he leaves needing suspenders.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was awarded the Ring magazine ``undisputed champion's
belt'' Tuesday, signifying that there are no other claim holders to
the heavyweight title, during a press conference to announce
Grant's April 29 title challenge at the venerable old boxing barn
on Seventh Avenue and 33rd, a fight that is being ballyhooed as the
first mega-bout of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be all that in the end, but no matter how you slice
it, it's certainly a ``big'' fight. The combatants stand a combined
13 feet tall, which makes them heavyweights of the tallest order.
Whether that makes their confrontation a big fight in the classic
sense will be decided by the two men themselves and the public's
reaction to them, but for this day at least it was as big as it
gets in boxing these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a belt you can only win in the ring, not in
courtrooms, boardrooms, or smoke-filled rooms,'' said Ring editor
Nigel Collins as he presented Lewis with a replica of the old-time
belts the magazine used to hand out in the days when Nat Fleischer
crowned champions all by himself. ``Lennox is the linear champion,
and this is a belt that can't be stripped away or vacated. It's the
hardest belt to get.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hype is to be believed, Lewis is risking those belts
against the staunchest opponent he could find, the undefeated
Grant. At 6 feet 7 inches, Grant is 2 inches taller than the
champion, who has towered over all of his 37 opponents. At 31-0,
Grant also is undefeated, a boast Lewis (35-1-1) could no longer
make after being put to sleep by Oliver McCall in a stunning upset
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The way Grant sees it, he is a larger, more athletic version of
Lewis. Bigger, stronger, quicker, and a harder puncher, better in
every way but big-fight experience, he says. Lewis, naturally, is
not in agreement with that assessment, but his trainer did concede
that his fighter will not have the obvious physical advantages he
has had in other fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fight, to be honest with you, that I'm a little nervous
about,'' Emanuel Steward said. ``Don Turner (Grant's trainer) tells
me my fighter got no heart. I know he has no great advantage in
this fight, except he has more experience in big fights and he
always did well in the amateurs with tall fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant's dangerous. We know that. Lennox has had a habit of
getting lackadaisical in the late rounds in his last few fights and
Grant doesn't get tired like a lot of big men. He punches good with
the right hand late. Most guys punch good early, like (Mike) Tyson,
but he can hurt you late. If Grant catches Lennox late, he's big
enough to throw him around. He's much more dangerous than Holyfield
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Grant has only six years of professional experience
and does not boast an impressive resume. Although he has beaten
everyone who has been put in front of him, more than a few
opponents had to be held up by props, and his most recent fights
have been struggles when they were intended to be coronations.
</P>
<P>
   That was especially true of the fight against Andrew Golota, in
which Grant was dropped twice in the first round and ended up with
a face that resembled a topographical map of the Alps by the time
he finally convinced Golota to quit on his feet in the 10th round.
Grant absorbed fearful punishment that night from an opponent Lewis
destroyed in less than one round three years ago, yet here was the
young challenger, resplendent in a pinstripe suit and diamond
earring, cocksure of soon having five new belts to add to his
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, brother,'' Grant said to Lewis. ``You ain't gotta get
scared, but I had a vision you got knocked out. It was a while ago,
when I fought Jose Luis Gonzalez (1997). But it's cool. It's cool.
I feel great. Damn, I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   Having just signed a deal worth nearly $4 million for this
fight, Grant had ample reason to feel great, especially since Lewis
was not in position yet to dent his face, as Golota had. As his
challenger talked, the champion calmly took it all in, convinced
that Grant would soon enough have a different vision. Double
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant grew a lot in the Golota fight but I saw a little panic
on his face,'' said Lewis (37-1-1), his voice flat and his eyes
menacing. ``You'll see more against me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good fighter but he's never been in the ring with
someone like me. He hasn't been through what I've been through. He
can't do the things I can do. He can't move as quick as me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good athlete who learns fast. He's worked his way up.
But I repeat myself: He ain't seen a boxer like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he hasn't seen one with so many choices of belts.
Lewis holds the World Boxing Council, World Boxing Association,
International Boxing Federation, and Ring belts as well as one from
one of the more innocuous alphabetized organizations. It's
difficult to remember whether it's the IBA, IBC, or WBU, but it's
meaningless anyway because they're all the WDIT (what does it
matter?) belts.
</P>
<P>
   All that matters now is that the undisputed heavyweight
championship traces all the way back to the great John L. Sullivan
more than 100 years ago, and the man who owns it is putting it on
the line April 29 against a guy who is considered the world's No. 1
contender almost by acclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Where they go from there is up to them, but for boxing in the
new millennium, at least it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   And for one of these guys, maybe the end.

MAKING BUCKS BY APPEARING TO BE GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right-thinking people everywhere are appalled _ appalled! _ that
warm and fuzzy ice cream purveyors Ben &AMP; Jerry's might be taken
over by a large, evil multinational corporation. In fact, not one
but two large, evil corporations _ Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc.
and Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate Unilever NV _ have made
unsolicited takeover bids for the ice cream that made Vermont
famous, simply because it tastes so good.
</P>
<P>
   It does taste good, but Ben &AMP; Jerry's is probably better known
for its vaunted do-goodism _ it donates 7.5 percent of its pretax
profits to causes it deems worthy _ than for its heart-stoppingly
rich premium desserts. Every goo-goo in Vermont, from the governor
to the faux socialist congressman Bernie Sanders wants Ben &AMP;
Jerry's to remain independent. The legislature has even enacted a
``Ben &AMP; Jerry's law,'' doubtless unconstitutional, that would allow
the ice cream maker's directors to consider factors other than
profit when entertaining bids for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Now the San Francisco-based Social Venture Network, a coterie of
``socially reponsible'' investors, may enter the takeover battle as
a ``white knight'' and rescue our heroes from corporate domination.
``It's all quite ironical,'' muses Michael Colby, a Vermont social
activist and frequent critic of the ice cream duo. ``The only big,
horrible corporation that Ben &AMP; Jerry's needs to be rescued from is
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield have always been heroes to the
flatlanders (Green Mountain code for rich New Yorkers) who buy into
their hippie-dippy save-the-world shtick. And they remain very
popular in Vermont; Colby admits he made plenty of enemies when he
published advertisements condemning Ben &AMP; Jerry's dairy farmers for
using ``thousands of pounds of the carcinogenic herbicide atrazine
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's not winning friends and influencing people when he
points out that several of the nonprofit corporations staging
``grass roots'' rallies to save B&AMP;J slurp up plenty of money from
the Ben &AMP; Jerry's Foundation each year. Cohen and Greenfield now
pose as Our Beleaguered Heroes. Our Beleaguered Hypocrites would be
more like it. To quote another longtime Ben &AMP; Jerry's watcher:
``That social mission stuff is more about their image than it is
about reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember Rainforest Crunch, the product that was supposedly
concocted from nuts purchased from native cooperatives in the
Amazon basin? (Typical media swoon: ``Rainforest Crunch: a Sweet
Way to Help Environment'' _ Orange County Register.) That was a
nifty idea, until it turned out that the shipments of Brazil nuts
delivered by the native co-ops contained glass shards, hair, rocks,
insects, and high levels of coliform bacteria. ``As a result of
quality problems with the nuts . . . only 5 percent of the nuts
(Ben &AMP; Jerry's) used from 1989 to 1994 came from native
cooperatives,'' writes Ed Welles of Inc. magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Check out Welles's September 1998 article
(www.inc.com/incmagazine/) for more info on the questionable
debenture swap, the repetitive stress problems at the Rainforest
Crunch plant, the tax fiddling, and Ben Cohen's refusal to bail out
his ``socially responsible'' partners when the rainforest venture
went bankrupt. Don't worry about Ben, by the way; unlike the little
people who lost their shirts, he was a secured creditor.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone remember Robert Holland, the former McKinsey &AMP; Co.
partner brought on as B&AMP;J's chief executive in 1995? The company
had been running a jivey ``nationwide search'' for a business
leader on its ice cream lids, called ``Yo! I Want to Be CEO!''
Twenty-two thousand suckers applied, but Holland got his job
through an executive headhunter. At the time, B&AMP;J had a
much-trumpeted policy that no executive would earn more than seven
times the salary of its lowest-paid worker _ a policy that melted
away when Holland came on board.
</P>
<P>
   Holland's successor, the current chief executive officer Perry
Odak, came to Ben &AMP; Jerry's after a stint at the US Repeating Arms
Co., which makes Winchester rifles. Maybe it's time for him to work
for a corporation with a social conscience, like Unilever or
Dreyer's.

BRIDGE NAMING REVIVES CRISPUS ATTUCKS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRAMINGHAM, Mass. _ Bridge-naming is not normally a
controversial activity. But the Framingham Historical Commission,
which proposes naming a small bridge after Crispus Attucks, the
runaway slave killed by British troops during the Boston Massacre,
has unwittingly landed on a political land mine.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has ignited a campaign by a local amateur historian
to block the dedication, generated accusations of racism, and
reopened a debate nearly two centuries old: Was Attucks a
Revolutionary martyr worthy of public veneration or a ruffian
leading a thuggish mob?
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming this bridge after Crispus Attucks is like naming it
after John Gotti,'' said Framingham resident Joe Rizoli, a bus
driver and former host of a local history show on cable television.
``What Attucks did would be like going to the Salvation Army and
rounding up all the drunks and saying, hey, let's go protest at the
town hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizoli's blunt words about the Framingham-born Revolutionary
figure prompted the leader of the bridge-naming effort to suggest
he holds racist feelings. But they also echo this country's
conflicted views toward Attucks and others slain in 1770 by British
troops who claimed self-defense as a hostile crowd surrounded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These old historical conflicts never die,'' said Arthur Young,
a historian and author of ``The Shoemaker and the Tea Party,''
which examines how Bostonians view their Revolutionary heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The facts regarding Attucks' involvement in the Massacre are not
widely disputed.
</P>
<P>
   British soldiers garrisoned in Boston and townspeople had been
baiting one another for months. Both sides were itching for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of March 5, Attucks led a group of men who joined
a throng of locals protesting continued British occupation of
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The civilians, most of them unarmed, threw icy snowballs and
insults at a small detachment of British soldiers, and looked,
generally, menacing. Attucks probably held a club and stood near
the front of the crowd, and when the soldiers started firing he was
the first to fall. Nine soldiers were indicted for murder. A
Colonial jury later found all nine not guilty, though two were
convicted of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how to interpret the incident, however, has
sustained an impassioned scholarly debate ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, beginning in the 1850s, the African-American
community pressed to get a monument to Crispus Attucks raised on
the Common. By 1887, the Legislature agreed to erect the statue
commemorating Attucks and four other men killed that night by the
British.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision was not reached without much controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Historical Association, which at that time was
basically a small group of Boston Brahmins who called themselves
`the saints,' devoted a whole meeting to denouncing the statue. One
of the members called Attucks a `vulgar ruffian' at that meeting,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Edwina Weston-Dyer, the descendant of a slave and the chair of
the Framingham Historical Society's African-American Heritage
Committee, said Rizoli's position, which cites that 1888 meeting of
the Boston Historical Society, is historically ill-informed and
borders on racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should go back to the books,'' Weston-Dyer said.
``He's obviously not read them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizoli said the bridge should be named instead for Peter Salem,
a black Framingham native who fought for the Continental Army
throughout the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Attucks and the nature of crowd violence during
the Colonial period has potent implications for the way Americans
think about the Revolution, historians say.
</P>
<P>
   Historians such as Pauline Maier of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology believe Attucks and the mob's other leaders were
thugs looking for a fight, and weren't much interested in political
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attucks is said to have gone out into the street waving a
cordwood stick about the thickness of a man's wrist, leading a
crowd of about 20 or 30 soldiers. Sounds like a thug to me,'' said
Maier, William P. Kenan professor of history at MIT. ``The massacre
wasn't led by the patriots. . . Attucks was of a different crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   But historians such as Young say that Attucks, the man Joe
Rizoli calls ``a troublemaker who would probably be in jail if he
was alive today,'' can be seen as a political protestor with a
genuine grievance _ the continued occupation of Boston by foreign
troops _ and can be fairly described as a Revolutionary hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans like the result of the Revolution, but we often
don't like to acknowledge the radicals like Attucks who brought it
about,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge the Framingham Historical Commission wants to
dedicate is, by all accounts, a small and unimpressive structure
significant only because it is built over Cochituate Brook, a
stream of water that once powered a grist mill where Attucks worked
when he was a slave.
</P>
<P>
   Weston-Dyer said the bridge will serve as an important reminder
not only of the value of the cause for which Attucks died but also
of the region's intimate relationship with slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ceremony is going to happen,'' Weston-Dyer said. ``We're
going to have March 5 announced as Crispus Attucks Day in
Framingham. It's going to be a grand day, and a beautiful
ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Rizoli's protest has had little effect. The Board of
Selectmen has backed the memorial plan, which is also supported by
the town historian.

PGA RECORD-HOLDER NELSON BACKS WOODS ALL THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ From his farm in Roanoke, Texas, he watched
the drama unfold Monday and never once felt a twinge of bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``More power to him. I'm happy to see what he's doing,'' said
Byron Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is 88, but his character is ageless. He doesn't ``chase
around the golf ball'' anymore, but he pays attention to the game
that has been his life. When Tiger Woods pulled off his dramatics
Monday _ coming from seven shots down with seven holes to play to
win the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am _ Nelson was as amazed as
anyone. And perhaps happier than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is his record of 11 straight PGA Tour victories that
the magical Woods, now at six, may approach, Nelson isn't clinging
to nostalgia; like many others, he is caught up in the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pulling for him,'' said Nelson. ``I'm proud of him, and
when he breaks it, whether he wins 12 or 15 or whatever, I'll
congratulate him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson didn't request a mulligan on that statement; he said
``when he breaks it,'' not ``if he breaks it,'' perhaps because,
like most witnesses to Monday's performance at the edge of the
Pacific, Nelson has seen all he needs to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going out and doing what he has to do to win golf
tournaments,'' said Nelson. ``People say someone gave him the
tournament, but no one gives you a tournament _ you win it by
playing better golf.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1945 when Nelson ruled the world of professional golf in
a manner that was unheard of. He reeled off his 11 straight wins,
settled for a few top 10s, then caught fire again later in the
year. In all, he put up 18 victories that year and was top 10 in 25
of the 30 tournaments in which he played.
</P>
<P>
   A special year authored by a special man, say Nelson's admirers.
Their love of Nelson, however, does not slant their take on what
Woods is accomplishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a shot at anything,'' Ken Venturi said to a reporter
who must have felt as if he had asked a silly question in the
aftermath of Monday's Miracle In Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Venturi thinks Woods has a chance to actually win 11 straight,
or more?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure he does. No question,'' said the 1964 US Open champion,
who genuflects at the mere mention of Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson.
He watched both players in their prime, took lessons from them, and
became friends with them. But on Monday, after he wrapped up his TV
duties with CBS, Venturi shook his head and said, ``I thought I had
seen everything in golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Jack Burke Jr., who in 1952 won four straight
tournaments. ``Consecutively, too,'' said Burke, part of that Texas
crowd (Hogan, Nelson, Jimmy Demaret, Lloyd Mangrum) that was so
much a part of the picture in the '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Burke points out that Woods's streak of six is not consecutive,
but he is not taking anything away from the 24-year-old who is
dominating not only the golf picture but the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got five loaves and a fish,'' said Burke. ``It's a
miracle a week.''
</P>
<P>
   But luck, said Burke, has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really does have a good swing, but there's more,'' he said.
``He's plays real smart. He tries harder and works harder than the
rest of them. He's out there working, and the rest of them are
reading The Wall Street Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke said the best players on Tour, whether they admit it or
not, are living a comfortable life, and a good paycheck is not
contingent on beating Woods. Which is a good thing, said Burke,
because Woods is playing with a fury that he has not seen for a
long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nelson had that going for him,'' said Burke. ``Hogan had that
going for him. (Sam) Snead had that going for him. They knew they
couldn't be beaten. He is like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he would tune in this week as Woods pursues his
seventh straight win at the Buick Invitational here, just north of
San Diego. It is a tournament that has been played annually since
1952, and Arnold Palmer twice has been king here. But never has
Torrey Pines been in the middle of anything like this. In the hours
after the Pebble Beach drama, media credentials soared from 20 to
well over 100 and hotels in the area filled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Every time he tees it up, Woods is the man to beat, but his
track record on this public facility is especially intimidating. He
won the World Juniors here in 1981, and after finishing second to
Scott Simpson in the Buick in 1998, he put up a 62-65 weekend
finish a year ago for the first of his eight victories in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the whispers of what transpired during a practice round
bright and early Tuesday _ an eagle 3 on Woods's first practice
hole _ and you have the ingredients for an omen. Which is OK with
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you hold a record for 55 years,'' said Lord Byron,
``it's quite an honor. I'll watch with pride.''

WEISS, KWAN FACE STIFF COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Not so long ago, they were kids chasing Nancy
Kerrigan and Todd Eldredge. Now, Michelle Kwan is taking midterms
at UCLA and being stalked by a couple of 14-year-olds. Michael
Weiss, the father of two, has been nursing a stress fracture while
19-year-old Tim Goebel lands quadruple jumps in triplicate. Uneasy
lie the crowns at the US Figure Skating Championships inside Gund
Arena this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``says Weiss, who's looking to defend the title he inherited
from the abdicating Eldredge last year.
</P>
<P>
   No men's champion has been overturned since hometowner Rudy
Galindo shocked Eldredge four years ago in San Jose. But Goebel,
who trains in nearby Lakewood, has the goods. He hit three quads in
the long program at last autumn's Skate America and he'll go for
them again here.
</P>
<P>
   ``In skating, you can't defend the castle,'' says Goebel, who
was third last year. ``You have to attack it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who's looking for her fourth title in five years, has been
juggling her freshman studies with a full competitive schedule that
took her to Japan and France in the last month. Though she's
vulnerable at the world level (Irina Slutskaya outskated her at the
recent Grand Prix final), Kwan still rules the domestic castle. But
the ninth-graders are closing in on her.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Hughes, who was afraid to skate near Kwan in last year's
warmups for fear of bumping her, is now going right at her. She'll
try a couple of triple-triple combinations here and dare Kwan, who
does only one, to match her. Ice kings and queens aren't as sacred
as they once were. The ramparts are under assault.
</P>
<P>
   A preview of the week's events:
</P>
<P>
   MEN: Hobbled by a high ankle fracture, Weiss struggled through
the fall season and didn't qualify for the Grand Prix final. Goebel
did, and ended up with a bronze medal. He has the program to beat
the rusty Weiss, who hasn't competed since November. The question
is whether Goebel can land it Saturday with thousands of his
friends and neighbors screeching his name. If he does, he could
lift Weiss's crown. Either way, both should make the team for next
month's world championships in France. Trifun Zivanovic, last
year's surprise runner-up, will wrangle with Matt Savoie and hardy
perennial Shepherd Clark of the Skating Club of Boston for third
place.
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN: Even if the precocious Hughes outleaps her, the
19-year-old Kwan has the artistic polish to outpoint Hughes. The
scramble should be for second and third among Hughes, returning
14-year-old runner-up Naomi Nari Nam, world team member Angela
Nikodinov, Amber Corwin, and newbies Sasha Cohen, Sara Wheat, and
Deanna Stellato.
</P>
<P>
   PAIRS: With last year's gold (Danielle-Steve Hartsell) and
bronze (Laura Handy-Paul Binnebose) medalists down for the season,
it could be a walkover for Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, last
year's runner-up. Ina won two titles and placed fourth in the
Olympics with old partner Jason Dungjen. She and the younger
Zimmerman haven't meshed as well but they're still the class of a
diminished field. Tiffany and Johnnie Stiegler, who just missed the
world team last year, should make it this time. Tiffany Scott of
Hanson, Mass., and partner Philip Dulebohn should grab the third
podium spot.
</P>
<P>
   DANCE: Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev breezed in Tuesday's
compulsories and should defend their title easily. With Eve Chalom
and Mathew Gates, last year's runners-up, now split, the scramble
for the other spot on the world team is between medalists Debbie
Koegel-Oleg Fediukov and Jamie Silverstein-Justin Pekarek, last
year's junior victors. Also in the chase are Beata Handra and
Charles Sinek of Lexington, Mass., and Alison Newman and Dmitri
Boundoukin of the New England FSC.

 RESHAPING LINGERIE FOR FULL FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 888-346-9867 or (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a full-figured lingerie model, Diana Chibas enjoyed success
in the '90s posing for brands like Playtex, Bali, and Just My Size.
But after appearing on the cover of Mode magazine in 1998, the
Warwick, R.I., resident retired, fed up with the fashion industry.
</P>
<P>
   Her frustration? Hair stylists and makeup artists always made
her look ``gorgeous'' at photo shoots, she says, but then fashion
houses would dress her in ``ugly suit-of-armor-'' style bras, giant
girdles, and tentlike nightgowns. ``It was just outrageous,'' says
Chibas, 35. ``I understand some people wear this stuff, but there's
just no fashion in it, no style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full-figured women are the same as all women. We love to look
beautiful, but for some reason the fashion industry isn't
recognizing us. They want to keep their image of the skinny
woman,'' she says. ``There's a lot of prejudice against the
full-figured market.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Diana Chibas Shapely Intimates, a lingerie brand geared
for women size 10 to 24. Its eight product styles, including a
leopard-print short nightie and a stretch-lace spaghetti-strapped
number, are saucy but tasteful, fashionable and generous in all the
right places.
</P>
<P>
   The sleepwear, which ranges from about $40 to $89, is available
via a bilingual catalog or a bilingual Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Chibas, a Cuban-American, is targeting women of color in
particular because, she says, ``A lot of Latinos and
African-Americans are hourglass shaped. We tend to hold our weight
in our hips. In the mainstream market, everything is very boxy,
which isn't flattering for our bodies. . . . It's so much more
flattering to the body when things are tailored and tighter in the
waist, instead of being shaped like a big tent.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Chibas _ who launched her company Sirens Worldwide LLC
in September with partner and former full-figure model Suzanne
Donovan _ has advertised in such magazines as Essence, Spanish
Glamour, Spanish Vogue, Mode, and Playboy, with positive response.
While Sirens is not yet profitable, she says the company is ``on
target'' for first-year sales of $800,000 to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a need,'' says Chibas. ``Women are e-mailing
us: `Can you please make loungewear, evening gowns, swimwear?' They
understand that we have the right vision.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Shapely Intimates isn't the only company selling
larger-sized sleepwear. Filene's offers nightgowns up to size 3X
and lingerie (teddies and other garments) up to size 18. And just
this week, Lane Bryant launched a new line of ``sexy'' lingerie
(bras, panties, sleepwear, and more) for women size 14 to 28 called
Cacique. The ``seductive'' sleepwear will include satin, lace, and
chiffon nightgowns. ``Cacique was born out of the fact that our
customer does not want to wear her grandmother's underwear,'' says
Chris Hansen, a Lane Bryant spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Competition aside, Chibas and Donovan say they offer something
unique _ an insider's perspective on fashion. As former models,
they know how clothing should fit. Even better, as long-time
consumers (Chibas is a size 12, Donovan a size 14-16), they know
which style of lingerie is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Chibas, who grew up in New York City, started her career as a
makeup artist after studying the art at the Berger Institute of
Production Technology in Miami. After graduation in 1985, she moved
to Los Angeles where she did makeup for TV commercials, magazine
shoots, and even a horror film. ``Every day was different,'' she
says. ``That's what I loved about the business.''
</P>
<P>
   But photographers kept asking Chibas _ a 5-foot-10 brunette _
why she was working behind the camera, rather than in front of it.
In 1989, a ``photographer said, `Let me help you,' '' she says. ``
`I can get you an agent in a second.' He made a phone call, and I
literally had a (modeling) job the next day. I figured I could use
the extra income, and I worked steadily. All of a sudden, the
makeup took a back seat, which was hard because I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, 32, also fell into modeling. After growing up in
Medway, she trained horses in Revere before attending American
College of London as a merchandising major. ``I used to always get
that `you have a pretty face, why don't you lose weight?' thing. I
was like yeah, yeah,' '' says Donovan, a 5-foot-8 blond. After a
friend submitted her photo to a magazine in 1988, she landed her
first gig _ as the cover girl for BBW (a lifestyle and fashion
magazine devoted to plus-size women). ``I couldn't believe it,''
she says. ``I didn't have any experience but I guess I had the
attitude. They kept booking me after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan moved to New York and spent the next nine years modeling
for campaigns such as Hanes pantyhose, Liz Claiborne, and
Bloomingdale's. She met Chibas in 1990 at a fashion show in Las
Vegas. ``I introduced myself,'' recalls Chibas. ``I was just
starting out. (Suzanne's) personality was `let me teach you the
ropes.' We became good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Chibas asked Donovan for help in creating Sirens
Worldwide. Chibas had already developed a business plan and a
mock-up of a catalog using former colleagues as models. Living off
savings and working first out of Donovan's apartment in New
Rochelle, N.Y., and later in an office there, the duo created
sketches they took to a patternmaker in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably had 25 options originally,'' says Chibas. ``We
were our own models. It was like a beauty pageant. If we felt like
dancing around (after trying something on), we ordered it. It was a
fun process.''
</P>
<P>
   Then they went searching for investors. Says Chibas, ``In the
beginning, it was a struggle. It was hard work.'' Says Donovan,
``We went to tons of consultants. Everybody loved it. Finally, one
group thought enough of it to sign up.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chibas's brother and sister, who own an advertising
agency in Caracas, Venezuela, helped the pair develop an unusual ad
campaign revolving around famous Renaissance and neoclassical
imagery. One page in the catalog, for example, shows a 1901
painting by English artist Sir John Collier of a man in an armored
suit kneeling before a throne. Instead of the original nude woman
standing on the throne, a curvy Chibas in Shapely Intimates
lingerie stands in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Says Chibas in the catalog, ``Designers often forget what was
once considered a perfectly shaped beauty. Renaissance and
neoclassic paintings depict voluptuous women as graceful goddesses,
strong yet ultrafeminine. As far as I'm concerned, we still are.''
</P>
<P>
   With the ads ready and the Web site in place, Chibas and Donovan
mailed out 25,000 catalogs to names purchased from Mode magazine
and to people who requested it on the Web site and via telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Corridan, of Marstons Mills, was thrilled to receive hers.
``Their lingerie is beautiful,'' she says. ``It's so difficult,
being a large-size person, to go into a store and find any kind of
selection. . . . This lingerie is flattering and I'm surprised you
can get something like it for under $100.''
</P>
<P>
   With five staffers, including co-CEOs Chibas and Donovan, Sirens
Worldwide is ``small but hopeful,'' says Donovan. ``I'm hoping that
with our participation in this marketplace, people will start to
treat the full-figured woman with more respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope happens in the next 10 years is that the whole
focus of the fashion industry flips to women who are larger. I
don't care if you're Japanese or Italian or whatever, there are
large women everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they want to look good.''

SING WITH MARIA AND MARIAH, AD NAUSEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many, ``The Sound of Music'' is one of their favorite
things, a sacred, nostalgic trip right up there with ``Mary
Poppins,'' ``Funny Girl,'' and, of course, ``The Wizard of Oz.'' So
we have to wonder how the Edelweiss-heads and Fraulein Maria
maniacs of America will greet the new campification of their
beloved musical, due to arrive in the states in April. Called
``Singalong-a-Sound-of-Music,'' it's a British phenomenon that
basically gives Robert Wise's 1965 movie the
audience-participation, ``Rocky Horror Show'' treatment. Imagine
fans pilgrimaging to the theater to sing ``(How Do You Solve a
Problem Like) Maria'' costumed in nun's outfits, German soldier
suits, lonely goatherd drag, and, believe it or not, brown paper
packages tied up with string. Imagine subtitles (``So long,
farewell, auf Wiedersehen, adieu, / Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu
and yieu'') and jokes yelled at the screen with Gospel fervor.
Imagine public irony, sentimental bonding, and, of course, gay
must-see status.
</P>
<P>
   In The New Yorker for Feb. 14, Anthony Lane has a funny preview
of this ``Singalong-a-Sound-of-Music.'' And as he notes, the
phenomenon doesn't exactly coincide with our ongoing perfection of
stay-at-home cinema: ``The bloodless interaction of DVD technology,
for instance, in which the lone viewer can pause `The Matrix' to
command a reverse view of Keanu Reeves' butt, cannot hold a candle
to the sight of two hundred people whistling at Christopher Plummer
when he enters with a riding crop, and waving their lighters above
their heads, like a rock crowd, during his rendition of
`Edelweiss.' '' Rock on, Maria.
</P>
<P>
   Also in this week's New Yorker: a unique and edgy homage to
``Peanuts'' and the work of Charles Schulz by Art Spiegelman.

</P>
<P>
   If you find yourself reading the cover story in the Rolling
Stone for Feb. 17, try to hold on to your cookies. The interview
with Mariah Carey is quite pukerific, sounding more like a parody
than a straight profile of the diva who has had more No. 1 hits
than anyone except the Beatles and Elvis Presley. Carey just
blathers on and on about her boyfriend, Latin American singer Luis
Miguel, and her glamorous travels. The quotes are interminable, and
insufferable, from her purchase of Marilyn Monroe's white piano for
$662,000 to Miguel's attempt to send her 10 dozen roses (alas,
there were only seven dozen available in all of Las Vegas!). At one
point, writer Mim Udovitch gives Carey a full RS column to natter
on about her recent promotional efforts, of which I quote only a
small piece: ``I think what happened after Capri is, I went to New
York . . . No! First I went to Tenerife (Spain), where Luis was
giving a concert, and I thought that was going to be my little
vacation time, but it wasn't as stellar a place as I thought it was
going to be. But still it was nice to be with him, so I begged and
pleaded with him to go to Capri with me before I went back and
started my schedule. And that's not exactly a short jaunt. So,
let's see . . . then I went from Capri _ are you cold? _ from Capri
to New York.'' Asked about rumors that Miguel gave her a diamond
necklace, Carey says, ``It was not like a big, elaborate diamond
necklace; it's a nice Bulgari diamond necklace, and it was
Christmas Eve, so it was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Udovitch tells us that Carey, snacking on carrot and celery
sticks, wants us to know that Joan Rivers has ``caused her to have
an eating disorder by saying she looked fat at last year's Academy
Awards.'' Based on the RS cover photo, it looks like she can now
win both Rivers' approval and the 
I-may-be-29-but-I-can-still-look-remarkably-like-18-year-old-sensati
on-Britney-Spears award. Just compare RS and this week's People
cover, which is a profile of Spears. Of course, it won't be long
before Spears is working to look as fresh as the next upcoming
15-year-old supernova . . .
</P>
<P>
   Amid photos of Spears, Farrah Fawcett in a grand 'do of Big Bird
proportions, and Renee Zellwegger in a wavy cut that recalls a
golden couch after a cat attack, People catches up with Robert
Downey Jr., who is six months into his three-year prison sentence.
The distinctive thing about the article is that, instead of only
People-styled rehash and ``friend'' commentary, it features a very
brief phone interview with the actor himself from jail. About the
California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility, where he shares a
cell with three to five other men, Downey says, ``I try to embrace
it, but it's prison _ it's miserable.'' And about his continued
efforts to get out based on errors made during his sentencing, he
says, ``I see myself _ and a lot of my issues _ as being stuck in
the '80s a little bit. So I want to quote Donna Summer: `Enough is
enough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Downey should be reaching back to the 1950s to find his
consolation: ``When the dog bites / When the bee stings / When I'm
feeling sad / I simply remember my favorite things / and then I
don't feel so bad.''

ROELLINGER COOKS TO TELL A STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON ARNETT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paris, they tell us, is rediscovering ``la cuisine grandmere.''
Coq au vin, pates _ the bistro and brasserie staples of long ago
are au courant right now. We're looking back, cooking only ``du
terroir,'' sticking to the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Roellinger smiles at this. Chef and proprietor of Maison
de Bricourt in a village in Brittany, he finds ``looking in a
rear-view mirror'' counterproductive. ``Look around you,'' he says.
``All the cuisines, all the spices are all around: Asian, African _
it's all out there.''
</P>
<P>
   So Roellinger takes perfect John Dory and blends 14 spices to
make a sauce for the fish, pointing out that those spices first
came to Brittany with 18th-century explorers.
</P>
<P>
   Roellinger believes he cooks to tell a story. ``You need this
expression _ to tell a story _ because you have something to
explain.''
</P>
<P>
   His story started when he was badly injured at age 21. ``It was
not an accident,'' explains the 44-year-old Roellinger, his
handsome face still showing distress. Several young men ``beat me
and left me for dead.'' He refers to the book and film ``A
Clockwork Orange'' to describe the beating, which broke both his
legs and scarred his face. ``After eight days, I could recognize my
mother,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Roellinger, at that time studying to be a chemist, spent months
in a wheelchair and began to cook with his mother. ``I find cooking
to express the happiness of every day.''
</P>
<P>
   His metier is the seafood and produce of his native Brittany.
``Translating the natural on the plate'' is his goal, Roellinger
says, adding he rarely works with ingredients like caviar. ``I have
no story with caviar. With seaweed, I have a large story.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittany's ties to the sea have made it open to adventure,
Roellinger says, to the cultures of Asia and Africa, explored
centuries ago by European sailors. He sees his use of spices and
flavorings not endemic to France as expressing the contemporary
spirit of his region. Many of the ingredients that French cooks
take for granted aren't originally native anyway, he says,
mentioning the beans in cassoulet, strawberries, potatoes,
tomatoes, and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   At Maison de Bricourt in Cancale, the chef works with two
gardeners, who tend the vegetables on his property and also travel
every morning to markets in different towns. He has a 20-year
relationship with some of the purveyors. ``A cook is not a
magician,'' he says, emphasizing that the natural product is the
first step to great cuisine. Then he embellishes. ``When you work
with spices, it's like when a writer uses punctuation. First, find
the best flavor of halibut. The spices are not to hide that
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Roellinger doesn't describe his cuisine as fusion. Instead, he
says, ``it's today,'' what one can find on any street _ Mexican,
African, Asian, as well as European flavors. ``Restaurants should
not be a museum,'' he says, despite some chefs' feeling that French
food should stay very French.
</P>
<P>
   Maison de Bricourt, which closes for a brief period in the
winter, attracts many Americans in the spring and the autumn, he
says. Like any high-level establishment in France, the restaurant,
which has two stars in the Michelin guide, is labor-intensive. It
has 15 cooks and about 15 wait staff and management to serve 50
diners, who will have five to seven courses and will keep their
table for the night. Labor costs have gone up from 30 percent of
the cost of doing business to 45 percent, Roellinger says, because
of France's limits on working hours. His role, he says, is to give
to his customers. ``All the time you cook, you do it for your
mother and for your children'' _ to make your mother proud and to
nourish your children.
</P>
<P>
   Roellinger's reaction to a question about genetically modified
foods is a frown and words of exasperation. ``It's not natural,''
he says, not cheaper or better and, as far as he can see, only
designed to make money for a few. How do we know, he continues,
what will happen in 10 or 20 years? ``A baby now who eats soyabean
with modification'' may not show any effects now, but what about
later? ``It's too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   His views on some foods are more surprising. Although
Roellinger's restaurant serves meat, most significantly lamb grown
in the salt marshes of Brittany, he prefers ``to work with the food
of the sea.'' Roellinger and his wife, Jane, who accompanied him to
Boston and New York City, say they eat less and less meat. He
foresees a time, ``in 20 years,'' when meat might be eaten rarely;
a younger generation, like his children, Matilda, 15, and Hugo, 11,
won't eat it. ``The relationship with meat is very delicate,'' he
says. ``The next generation, they know that they are what they
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   To him, the relationship with fish is not as close since they're
cold-blooded. Nevertheless, he recalls with a smile how he reacted
when a patron at his restaurant repeatedly questioned the freshness
of a fish. Roellinger finally strode to the dining room carrying a
large live turbot and smacked it on the table. ``Respect the death
of this animal,'' he yelled at the man.
</P>
<P>
   Roellinger, who has written an extensive cookbook, ``Le livre
d'Olivier Roellinger,'' last year published a second book,
``Couleurs de Bretagne,'' about seeing his native region through
the colors of the land, the sea, and its foods. Both books are in
French.
</P>
<P>
   The current ``evolution'' of cooking in America is very
exciting, he says. ``I can't believe it.'' Roellinger is proud of
Ambrose, who trained with him at the Meridien's Julien, saying that
Ambrose has found his style, the most important thing for a chef. A
style, a sense of adventure _ these things he likes in American
chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Because, in the end, Roellinger muses, ``There are only two
cuisines _ good and bad.''

<P>
   I must confess that I started but did not finish Heat-Moon's
best-known work, ``Blue Highways,'' and thus began his latest tale
with some apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I was immediately taken in by this travel adventure as
Heat-Moon and a companion he calls Pilotus spend four months on an
amazing voyage, crossing the United States from the Atlantic at New
York Harbor to the Pacific near Astoria, Ore., _ using either
rivers or lakes or canals for all but some 70 miles of their
5,200-mile-plus journey.
</P>
<P>
   Though the two wanderers survive a number of perilous moments,
the particulars of Heat-Moon's river log are less fascinating than
his historical stories and insights into how the rivers have been a
powerful force in the development of this country. His perspective
is sharp, his voice strong without being overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   There are gaps in this abridgement that make me want to seek out
the hardcover version and learn how Heat-Moon was able to finance
this 1995 journey.

   (``Ahab's Wife, or, the Star-Gazer,'' by Sena Jeter Naslund.
Read by Maryann Plunkett. Abridged, approximately 6 hours. Simon &AMP;
Schuster Audio. $25.)
</P>
<P>
   Naslund begins this compelling historical fiction with the
following first sentence: ``Captain Ahab was neither my first
husband nor my last.'' Inspired by a brief passage in the
masterpiece ``Moby Dick,'' Naslund has developed a memorable
character in Una Spenser, a fearless woman whose life is dominated
by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Naslund, who is on the faculty of Vermont College, convincingly
captures the tenor of 19th-century literature as well as the spirit
of Herman Melville, creator of Ahab. Her voice is sure and eloquent
and a delight to spend time with.
</P>
<P>
   Spenser does indeed marry Ahab before the White Whale takes his
leg and sends him into madness, and together they have a son.
Spenser also helps a runaway slave find freedom, and as Ahab's
widow, she spends time in the company of Frederick Douglas and
Ralph Waldo Emerson, among others.

   (``When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi,'' by
David Maraniss. Read by the author. Abridged, approximately 6
hours. Simon &AMP; Schuster Audio. $25.)
</P>
<P>
   The legendary coach of the Green Bay Packers, champions in the
first two Super Bowls, seems an odd choice for Maraniss, best known
as a tireless Bill Clinton scholar at the Washington Post, where
his articles earned a Pulitzer Prize and became the basis for his
book, ``First in His Class.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is somewhat baffling that this book is enjoying such a
long run on the best-seller lists. After listening to the author
for six hours that seemed more like a dozen, I didn't feel I knew
the late Lombardi all that well. He wasn't an open, sharing man,
and few people Maraniss interviewed offer much insight into the
Brooklyn native's character.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Maraniss provides meticulously researched sidebars on
scandals that occurred at West Point, but not at the time when
Lombardi was in charge of coaching there, as well as the history of
the NFL. This best-seller needed an editor who could convince
Maraniss that a meat sandwich dominated by bread and condiments is
not particularly fulfilling.

&HT;     DEATH IS A TWO-WAY STREET IN THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN LYNCH  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Monday morning marked the fifth day that Kadiatou
Diallo, a woman more accustomed to the sun-splashed warmth of West
Africa than to the snow-shrouded gloom of Albany in February,
climbed the steps of the Albany County Courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   There she sat all day in a white-walled courtroom while four New
York City police officers explained how and why they gunned down
her innocent son, Amadou, a little more than a year ago. She is a
serene and gracious woman, the very image of maternal dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Her son was 22, slim and smiling, living life in the full,
golden glow of early manhood. Then he was gone, only a memory, in a
storm of police bullets. Kadiatou Diallo wants to understand how
such a horrible thing could happen. She needs to know who, if
anyone, is to blame for the ragged, gaping hole in her heart.
</P>
<P>
   The day in that courtroom, another woman also sat listening to
the testimony. She was brought to Albany by the New York City
police union in what has become not just a court proceeding but
also a public relations war between the police and political forces
that fear police power run amok.
</P>
<P>
   That other woman's name is Terri Gillespie. She, too, lost a son
to gunfire in the Bronx. Her son, Kevin, was a cop, a member of the
same Street Crime Unit that killed Amadou Diallo in what
prosecutors charge was murder and what police explain as a tragic
accident. The cops say they had thought Diallo had pulled out a
pistol. But all they had found near his bullet-riddled corpse had
been a beeper and a wallet. Gillespie had died not quite two years
earlier when he had hesitated a heartbeat to see if one Angel Diaz,
thief and killer, really had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened five days before Kevin's 34th birthday,` Terri
Gillespie said after that day in court. ``It was five days after
his oldest boy's seventh birthday. ... It happened in the Bronx, on
the Grand Concourse. I was born there ...
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was having Kevin, he wasn't expected to live. It was a
very troubled pregnancy, during which the doctors didn't give him
much chance of survival. I knew he was a boy, and I said, `You
fight, son. It'll be you and me.' And he was born, and he had two
or three incidents in his life in which we almost lost him. He
always came through. I always thought that he was the miracle that
God sent me. But I knew in my secret heart that I would outlive
him. When he was in the Marines, I was a nervous wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie was a good Marine, though. Later, as a uniformed cop
patrolling the Brooklyn projects, he made many collars and ended up
in this unit, the department's elite crime-busting corps that roams
four of the five boroughs in plainclothes.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz had stolen a BMW and some jewelry. Gillespie was in one of
the three Street Crime cars that ran him down. As the cops
approached the Beemer on foot, Diaz jumped out. His shot hit
Gillespie's collarbone, above his Kevlar vest. The slug bounced
downward, ripping through the officer's abdominal organs. Like
Diallo, he died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   At Gillespie's funeral, people from the Brooklyn projects, where
he'd made both so many collars and so many friends, came to mourn.
Like Kadiatou Diallo, Terri Gillespie carries inside her a huge,
hollow, aching wound. She also grasps a harsh reality that mothers
of civilians never confront.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't understand,'' Terri Gillespie said, ``is
that you either end up with a dead son or a son that somebody wants
to indict.''

THE BEATING OF BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a puppyish naivete that would be endearing in a fraternity
pledge but is embarrassing for a presidential candidate, George W.
Bush retooled himself in Texas over the weekend to emerge as: ``The
Outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   One week after luring 2,000 shivering New Hampshire Republicans
to an outdoor rally in Milford where the seminal event was Governor
Bush introducing his mother, his father, and assorted kin down to
the level of third cousins, Bush licked his wounds in Austin and
came up with his ``I'm a reformer with results . . . somebody who
comes from outside the system.'' Is he serious?
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised more money _ $70 million last year _ than Al Gore,
Bill Bradley, and Senator John McCain combined. He has the
endorsements of 28 or 29 Republican governors, the vast majority of
Republican senators, and enough GOP congressmen that if they were
laid end to end, they'd span the Potomac. There are more lobbyists
and government fixers on his contributors list than fleas on a St.
Bernard. Yo, Dubbaya: You are the system!
</P>
<P>
   But he has to say something different after the sandblasting he
absorbed in New Hampshire took his bandwagon down to the primer
paint. You've heard of Miller Time? This is Bush Time _ time to
trash McCain. The Arizona Straight Arrow, hero of the Hanoi Hilton,
is really a sneaky Washington grafter in the new party line from
Bush's designated bashers like Haley Barbour, the burly good-ol'
boy from Yazoo City, Miss., a former GOP national chairman who has
his own history of corralling Hong Kong soft money for the Gingrich
Revolution that captured Congress in '94.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush Boyz will go negative, because negative is all that's
left. His pie-in-the-sky tax cut is a no-go in this, the most
prosperous period in American history. The
McCain-is-not-a-real-conservative argument does not fly either. The
McCain's-a-turncoat-who-betrayed-us-veterans by a Bush introducer
backfired badly. The dirty little
let's-conspire-to-keep-McCain-off-the-ballot-in-New-York ploy blew
up in the former front-runner's boyish kisser. Nor did it help when
Daddy Bush referred to number one son as ``the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   So just as Bill Bradley started hollering that Al Gore is a
lying crook, a deceitful prevaricator who doesn't have the truth in
him, the guy who fell behind in New Hampshire in the other race
went negative just a tad later. Was it only Jan. 5 that I loftily
opined here ``the biggest surprise in the most important month of
campaigning is the virtual absence of campaign nastiness''?
</P>
<P>
   The Marquis of Queensberry expired in New Hampshire when Bradley
choked on a 12-point tracking poll deficit, and started shouting
``liar, liar, pants on fire!'' at Gore. Bush's negativity came
later, after he dug out from under the avalanche of independent
votes for McCain, who also edged him among registered Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a politics-as-usual year. So please stow the lament,
the `Why can't we ever get any good candidates to vote for?' groans
that recur, like the Olympic rings, every presidential season. You
have four clear and distinct choices this time, spirited races on
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain's grassroots rebellion takes hold in South Carolina,
if his prairie fire devours the Bush ''firewall'' in the Palmetto
State, the Navy jet jockey comes winging into the March 7 primaries
with a legitimate shot at winning it all.

FORBES'S MONEY WON'T BUY HIM THE WHITE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. &UR;  &LR; -- In the 1980s, a hotshot executive at
Warner Brothers began a meeting with a director by breezily saying,
``So, Fred, tell me about yourself.'' Fred Zinnemann, possibly
thinking about his three Academy Awards (for ``High Noon,'' ``From
Here to Eternity,'' and ``A Man for All Seasons''), smiled and said
to his young interrogator, ``You first.''
</P>
<P>
   In this campaign season, when biography counts, Steve Forbes
might cop an Oscar for most-improved orator, but the script of his
biography declines after the opening credits. The most notable day
in his life was July 18, 1947, the day he was born into a large
fortune, the fortune that sustains his presidential campaign and
freaks out his party's establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is not the only candidate born lucky. George W. Bush, Al
Gore, and John McCain are all sons of famous fathers. Bill Bradley
inherited his tallness. But the Forbes fortune promises unseemly
havoc in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived for a weekend parley of the California Republican
Party having won only two elections in his life: the 1996
presidential primaries in Arizona and Delaware. That total,
although two more than G. W. Bush has won, still does not prove
that he offers anything more than a will with a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes can credibly claim that he is ``the new leader of
America's conservative movement.'' He is less preposterous than
Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, or the Reform Party's Pat Buchanan, Donald
Trump, and Ross Perot. But Forbes shares the slapstick troupe's odd
notion that the presidency is an entry-level job. He is also a
history buff. I asked him to name a role model, any president with
no major public-sector experience, or, except for Wendell Willkie
in 1940, any nominee who had never been on a public payroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no correlation between the extent of your
experience and the performance in office,'' he said. ``A classic
case is James Buchanan, our 15th president, who had a fantastically
long resume and who in the eyes of most historians was the worst
president we ever had. By contrast, his successor, Lincoln, our
16th president, had only two years a decade before in Congress and
a few years before that in the Illinois Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   But other good presidents had long public careers, including
Jefferson, Polk, Cleveland, two Adamses, and two Roosevelts. Forbes
countered with one from his own state, ``one who had one of the
least was Wilson. He had just one year as governor.'' Yet Forbes
has ignored his party's pleas to run for governor or US senator
from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes strategy depends on an early KO of Bush or McCain,
leaving the magazine heir and his bankroll ready for a showdown.
``This is now a wide-open race. There is no front-runner anymore.
The field is open,'' he told reporters here. ``We are in for the
duration. We're going to have a real contest, and I'm the one true
conservative in this race. I've got to get that message across. . .
. This is going to be fought week by week and state by state.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to him resembles the plot of a Jane Austen novel.
Like anxious aunts worried about an inheritance, the Bush camp
clucks, not for attribution, about his family. You have delighted
us long enough, Steve, the sources suggest, hinting that he has
stiffed his five daughters by squandering $28 million so far on
political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, meanwhile, oozes senatorial courtesy, saying: ``My
relations with Steve Forbes throughout this cammpaign have been
excellent. Our involvement in the debate has been honorable and at
a level I think most Republicans would be pleased with.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has a clear message (a flat tax) and a strong belief in
it, but he will inevitably revisit truths from the New Testament
and the old Beatles. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye
of a needle than for a rich man with no experience to buy the White
House. Also, money can't buy you love.

THIS ELKS LODGE IS OUT OF ORDER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; No one objected when Beverly Gaw turned up on the volunteer
crew that wallpapered the couples lounge at the North Attleborough
Elks Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   No one protested when she showed up like clockwork to serve hors
d'oeuvres at lodge social functions.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years, no one at the Massachusetts lodge complained when
she pitched in to sell raffle tickets, or to make a contribution to
a pot-luck supper, or to scrub the lodge floors before a ceremonial
installation of a new exalted ruler.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Beverly Gaw applied to become an Elk, herself,
that the lodge suddenly took exception to having a woman in its
midst.
</P>
<P>
   No one was more surprised by her summary rejection for
membership than Beverly Gaw. Her husband, Peter, is a past exalted
ruler of the lodge; her son, Keith, is the current exalted ruler.
They all attend the state Elks convention every year and the
national one when they can. Her 13-year-old's Boy Scout troop holds
its meetings at the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The Elks is pretty much the Gaws' home away from home. ``It's a
very family-oriented place,'' she says. ``I was always setting up
for a dance or waitressing at a social function. I was there so
much, I thought it was time I started paying dues.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew, of course, that the North Attleborough Elks had never
admitted a woman but, surely, she thought, the fellows would not
turn down an applicant who had worked as tirelessly for the lodge
as she, a woman whose application had been approved by the lodge's
own screening committee.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by the vote against her, Gaw asked the national
headquarters of the 132-year-old fraternal organization to urge the
lodge to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was because I was a woman. I've wanted to be a
member for years, but my husband had told me before to wait, that
they weren't ready,'' she says. ``After the first vote, I wanted to
give them a chance to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't take it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a reminder from the Massachusetts Elks and the
Chicago-based Grand Lodge that the constitution of the Elks _ to
say nothing of the Constitution of the United States _ expressly
prohibits discrimination against women, the North Attleborough
lodge notified Gaw last month that her reapplication for membership
had been rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with regret that I have to inform you that the vote of
the membership did not elect you as a member,'' read the letter
from Michael Araujo, the lodge secretary. Araujo offered Gaw no
explanation. He could not be reached to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ``What choice do I have?'' asks Gaw, who has hired an attorney
and filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against
Discrimination. ``I can't let them do this; it's wrong. I don't
think they really believed I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The complainant in this case is a reluctant crusader. The
decision to ask the MCAD to order the North Attleborough lodge to
admit her or face revocation of its liquor license and its right to
hold public functions was not an easy one. That Beverly Gaw made it
is a measure of how far women have come, how few will be relegated
any longer to the women's ``auxiliary'' or, as a similar complaint
against Haverhill Golf and Country Club makes clear, to ``ladies
tee times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Elks. I only can do this because I have the support
of the state Elks and the national Elks. I wouldn't do anything to
hurt an organization that is so fantastic. The Elks do so much good
in the community. Do you know how much money we raise for college
scholarships?'' she asks, her pride as evident as her pique. ``The
way I look at it, the North Attleborough lodge really shouldn't be
calling themselves Elks, the way they are acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly Gaw's family supports her efforts to drag the North
Attleborough Elks Lodge into the new century, despite the
discomfort for her son Keith, 25, who now has the distinction of
heading a fraternal organization being sued by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal is to be an Elk,'' says Gaw, who has received
invitations from several sympathetic lodges to apply for
membership. ``We have friends in Elk lodges all over Massachusetts.
I could go somewhere else, but why should I have to? I have lived
in North Attleborough for 20 years. My husband and I got involved
at the lodge as a couple. I've given them my time. Why shouldn't I
be able to give them my money and be a member just like anyone
else?''
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed.

BUSH FOLLOWS REAGAN ON TREATMENT OF MINORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, in a graduation ceremony mysteriously underplayed by
the white press, George W. Bush earned his master's degree from the
Ronald Reagan Institute of Race Policy and Management.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan established the institute in 1980 by kicking off his
presidential campaign at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia,
Miss. The Neshoba County Fair for decades had been the legendary
gathering spot of segregationists and near the site of grisly
murders of three civil rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan took the microphone and, to the roar of thousands of
white fairgoers, said, ``I believe in states' rights.'' Anyone who
knows southern race policy and management knows that saying
``states' rights'' is like waving a Confederate flag, telling
racists they can do whatever they want to black folks.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan was never hounded by the press as to how he could make
such a statement and expect to be elected as president. Reagan's
handlers slyly scheduled a speech two days later before the Urban
League. At the Urban League speech, Reagan said:
</P>
<P>
   ``For too many people, conservative has come to mean antipoor,
antiblack, and antidisadvantaged. Perhaps some of you question
whether a conservative really feels sympathy and compassion for the
victims of social and economic misfortune and of racial
discrimination. . . . If you think of me as the caricatured
conservative, then I ask you to listen carefully and maybe you'll
be surprised by our broad areas of agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   History showed that the real Reagan was the one who spoke at the
Neshoba County Fair and not the one at the Urban League. His
presidency quickly became the most antipoor, antiblack, and
antidisadvantaged in the last half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, here comes George W. Bush. Stung by his
defeat in the New Hampshire primary, Bush needed a trump card in
the South Carolina Republican primary. This was a problem since he
and John McCain are running neck and redneck on issues dear to
racists. Both have chickened out on saying it was time to stop
flying the Confederate flag over the state capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Bush may have found his ace. He kicked off his homestretch drive
in South Carolina by speaking at Bob Jones University. Bob Jones
represents one of Reagan's early signs of being antiblack. Reagan
fought to revoke the Internal Revenue Service's authority to deny
charitable tax exemptions to the school. The denial was over the
school's racist ban on interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in an 8-1 decision, rebuked Reagan, saying
schools that practice racial segregation can indeed be denied tax
exemptions. In no small footnote, Reagan would later appoint the
lone dissenter, William Rehnquist, to chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones University still bans interracial dating. George W.'s
brother Jeb, the Florida governor who is married to a Latina, could
not have attended. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who has a
white wife and who was appointed to the court by George W.'s
father, could not have attended.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones also practices homophobia. Two years ago, when a gay,
60-year-old alum asked if he could come back to visit the school,
the dean of students wrote back, ``With grief we must tell you that
as long as you are living as a homosexual, you, of course, would
not be welcome on the campus and would be arrested for trespassing
if you did. We take no delight in that action. Our greatest delight
would be in your return to the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. took delight in validating this perverted version of
Christianity, telling 6,000 students, almost all white, ``I look
forward to publicly defending our conservative philosophy.'' He
said he would seek ``compassionate results.'' But compassion could
not have been foremost on Bush's mind since it was only after the
speech that he criticized the school's racial policies, not during
it and not directly to the students.
</P>
<P>
   His compassion is irrelevant when out of all the colleges in
South Carolina, he chose the most racist and homophobic, a venue
more discriminatory on paper than even the Neshoba County Fair.
Speaking of papers, Bush's appearance was so outrageous, newspaper
and television reporters should hound him as to how he deserves the
White House when he panders to such base politics.
</P>
<P>
   But while many editorials have dutifully questioned the
appearance, subsequent news coverage has made little mention of Bob
Jones and certainly not enough to suggest this was a deep,
permanent stain. Like Reagan and the Urban League, Bush is smart
enough to sprinkle just enough pepper in his white sauce, such as
photo-ops with black children, to keep the hounds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan told the Urban League he was not a caricatured
conservative. In the end, he became the caricature of modern
racism. Today, we have Bush, who coined the term ``compassionate
conservatism.'' By going to Bob Jones, it was another sign that
Bush will be so compassionate to conservatives, he will be every
much as antipoor, antiblack, and antidisadvantaged as Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Having earned his masters in Reagan race policy, by speaking at
Bob Jones University George W. Bush is well on his way to his PhD:
Philosopher of Demagoguery.

CASE SPARKS PARENT-CHILD CONFIDENTIALITY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What parent didn't shudder at the photographs of Monica
Lewinsky's distraught mother, her eyes teary and swollen, emerging
from the grand jury investigating her daughter's infamous liaison
with the president?
</P>
<P>
   The scene, aired on television and published in newspapers
nationwide, sparked an impassioned debate about the legality, and
morality, of forcing parents to testify against their children.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is about to shift to Massachusetts, which, like most
states, does not have a special privilege that cloaks the
conversations between parent and child in secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is to be filed the week of Feb. 6 that would give
private talks between mothers, fathers, and their children the same
sacrosanct confidentiality long granted to conversations between
priests and penitents, lawyers and clients, doctors and patients,
and husbands and wives.
</P>
<P>
   If adopted, it would end a controversial, though infrequently
used, tactic that pits the sanctity of the family against the needs
of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a child is accused of a crime, the one person he would
really turn to for help is a parent, and that parent should never
in any circumstance be compelled to testify against their child,''
said a Boston lawyer, Joseph J. Brodigan Sr., who is representing a
Braintree couple subpoenaed in a criminal case involving their two
14-year-old sons, who have been charged with rape. ``It goes to the
essence of the preservation of the American family,'' Brodigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   So-called parent-child privilege, also known as parent-child
immunity and parent-child confidentiality, is grounded in the
belief that the bond between parent and child is so sacred it must
be protected from government interference. By enabling children to
confide in their parents without worrying that their privacy will
be compromised, it is designed to foster openness and candor in
family relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask family members to look out for one another,'' said
Holly Maguigan, a law professor at New York University who studies
the criminal prosecution of domestic violence. ``So the idea that
we would then yank parents into court to testify against their
children is really quite shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in the Braintree case, the state Supreme Judicial
Court tossed the issue to the Legislature, saying any move to
establish a parent-child privilege should come from lawmakers, not
the court. But the SJC did grant a temporary reprieve to the boys'
parents who had been subpoenaed by the Norfolk County district
attorney's office to testify before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Senator Cynthia S. Creem, a Newton Democrat who is
Senate chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Criminal Justice,
intends to file a bill this week that would protect Massachusetts
parents from testifying against their children.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation will need to address several complex
questions, Creem noted, including whether foster and adoptive
parents should be covered, and whether the privilege should be
extended to adult children as well as minors.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions could also be included, as is the case with other
privileges. A wife, for instance, cannot claim spousal privilege
and refuse to testify against a husband charged with abusing their
child. And lawyers, doctors, and priests may disclose confidential
conversations if remaining silent could result in a crime, fraud,
or violence.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have been reluctant to subpoena
parents to testify against their children for fear of alienating
the communities they work in, according to Martha Minow, a Harvard
Law School professor who teaches family law.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have also held back out of concern that parents may
not be reliable witnesses, even under oath, when their children's
liberty is at stake, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But a nationwide crackdown on juvenile crime has changed that.
With growing numbers of children being hauled into court on
criminal charges, parents more frequently find themselves called to
testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``In balancing many different privileges and rights, it's
important to remain aware of the victims also,'' said William
Keating, the Norfolk County district attorney. ``There's an
obligation to the victims to be able to seek redress in the court
systems . . . and you want to be careful when you're proposing
legislation that you don't completely tie the hands of law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the thought of a mother or father being interrogated by
an aggressive prosecutor about private discussions they had with
their daughter or son, chills many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants this country to become Nazi Germany or a
totalitarian state that encourages people in intimate relationships
to rat on each other,'' said Minow.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many law enforcement officials argue that their obligation
to protect society must sometimes trump family privacy. For
example, if a son tells his mother that he stole a car, and there
are no witnesses to the crime, prosecutors contend that justice
would suffer if the mother is able to avoid testifying by invoking
parent-child privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many legal experts are uncomfortable with the prospect of
a court system that pits mother against daughter, father against
son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart really goes out to a parent whose child went to
them in confidence to bear their soul,'' said Boston lawyer Gary
Owen Todd, a family law practitioner. ``The last thing on a
parent's mind is, `Jeez, I may be subpoenaed.' Your first reaction
is, `How can I help this child that I love?' ''

FACING MURDER CHARGE, STUDENT SEEKS A SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine _ The new kid at Cape Elizabeth High
School is Seiha Srey, a 17-year-old from Cambodia who speaks shyly,
smiles sweetly, and walks with a little swagger.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eyes of the school officials who have barred Srey
from their classrooms, the fact about him that matters is this: He
has been indicted on a murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   When Srey showed up at the high school's front door two Mondays
ago, brand-new binders and mechanical pencils tucked into his
backpack, it was his first normal school day since the night in
1998 when Robert Joyal was stabbed to death in a crowd of brawling
teenagers. A month after Joyal's killing, the 15-year-old Srey was
arrested and charged with the crime, but since then the state's
case against him has stalled for so long that a judge two months
ago released him on personal recognizance, free to mix with the
public until his trial in March.
</P>
<P>
   Srey left jail a handsome 17-year-old _ 5 inches taller than he
had arrived, 45 pounds heavier, and neither cleared nor convicted
in the eyes of society. His current status is one of limbo: On that
Monday morning at Cape Elizabeth High School, the superintendent of
schools declared him a disruption to his classmates and ordered him
out of the building; then the student body, overwhelmingly, tried
to invite him back in.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the school committee prepares to decide Tuesday night
whether to enroll him, parents and students throughout the Portland
area are weighing in on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's a story about fear,'' said Anne Cranshaw,
whose son is a senior at the high school and who has publicly
backed Srey's attendance. ``I think some parents just can't get
past the fact that he's an alleged murderer, even though he has not
gone to trial and even though the judge released him. They just
can't get past that he himself might be a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The soul-searching over Srey's status in Cape Elizabeth
represents the crossing of a number of social circles in Portland.
Srey's defense attorney, Daniel G. Lilley, has framed the wealthy
school's decision as a civil rights issue, likening it to the 1957
morning when nine African-American students were escorted by
National Guardsmen into Little Rock Central High School. Srey
himself grew up in a housing project, and says the high-achieving,
college-bound students from Cape Elizabeth are less likely to lead
him into trouble than his old classmates at Deering High. And in
Cape Elizabeth, town officials and parents who sought to keep Srey
out of the school suspect that Lilley _ ``the Johnnie Cochran of
greater Portland,'' according to town manager Mike McGovern _ of
using the town's turmoil over the issue to attract favorable
attention to his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lilley is a very effective attorney, and there are some
that think this is a ploy for sympathy,'' said McGovern. ``People
like to pick on Cape Elizabeth, . . . (but) any town would have
difficulty dealing with the issue of taking an accused, indicted
murderer into its school system.''
</P>
<P>
   At the root of this controversy is a crime that occurred at 1
a.m. on a spring night, in a tangle of 30 or 40 young people, and
prompted grave announcements that gang violence had finally arrived
in Maine. On Dec. 1, Superior Court Justice Roland Cole imposed a
gag order on both the defense and prosecution, but the case has
been reported throughout in the Portland Press-Herald: After
quarreling with an acquaintance of Srey's at a Portland dance club,
Joyal, 18, met up with the youths again in the parking lot of an
all-night Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   In the brawl that followed, Joyal was stabbed three times in the
back with a foot-long knife that punctured his spinal cord. Srey
was arrested and charged with the crime a month later and held
without bail for 18 months. As recently as September, Superior
Court Justice Stephen Perkins ruled that the state had reason to
continue to hold him without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Faith Joyal Myers, the victim's mother, remains convinced of
Srey's guilt and said the state's case against him remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as our witnesses, they're not falling apart,'' she told
The Boston Globe. ``It's never been an easy case because of the
gang affiliation. They are close-mouthed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilley maintains that Srey was not in a gang.
</P>
<P>
   But Cole's decision on Dec. 1 to postpone the trial and release
Srey has cast doubt on the prosecution's case. From the beginning,
the case against Srey relied heavily on the testimony of witnesses
_ one who said he saw Srey commit the murder, and one girl who said
he had told her he committed the murder. But six days before the
trial, prosecutors produced a note stating that the eyewitness,
Janna Ork of Lowell, Mass., had accused another boy before he
informed on Srey. Moreover, two more witnesses, both in jail, have
said they know the identity of Joyal's killer, and that Srey is the
wrong man.
</P>
<P>
   So on Dec. 2, Srey was free _ sort of. The judge has barred him
from interacting with witnesses in the case, so he cannot return to
Portland High School or Deering High, the school he attended at the
time of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The solution came from Nance Monaghan, a private investigator
who had done research on Srey's case for his first defense
attorney: He would live with her as her legal ward and go to school
in Cape Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   It was a plan she and Srey had been talking about for almost a
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``His teacher (in jail) and I used to fight over him _ `I'm
going to take him home.' `No, I'm going to take him home, and he'll
go to school with me,' '' Monaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   And at first, Cape Elizabeth seemed to open its arms. On Jan.
13, according to students, high school Principal Peter Dawson,
presented the issue at an assembly, encouraged students to accept
Srey, and sent a letter to parents saying that ``Seiha's attendance
at CEHS does not in any way place the safety of our students in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But amid complaints from parents, a letter issued one week later
by Superintendent Thomas Forcella announced a new decision _ that
with the aim of ``minimizing possible disruptions to our program,''
the school district would provide tutoring for Srey at a separate
location. Forcella said he had changed his mind after reading new
information about Srey's case in court records.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Brewster, the parent of a kindergartner who goes to school
in the same building as the high school, said the judge's decision
to release Srey until trial was not enough to convince him that
Srey's presence did not pose a danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school system doesn't operate in a criminal justice
system, it's a civil justice system,'' said Brewster, an attorney.
``In a criminal justice system, the rights of the individual are so
supreme that there is such a high standard of proof. In a civil
justice system, you're accommodating many different individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the students of Cape Elizabeth High School are
circulating petitions, doing legal research, and trying to convince
the parents who complained about Srey that he poses no threat to
the kindergartners or anyone else. And in Cape Elizabeth High
School, a chasm is opening between students and school officials,
said Cranshaw, the parent who has backed Srey's attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel betrayed,'' she said. ``They felt, here they had a
chance to shine and then it was snatched away from them. They'd
been asked to trust the adults, and it's like the rug was pulled
out from under them.''
</P>
<P>
   Forcella says he is proud of them. ``I think it's a positive
trait that they're not rejecting this student regardless of what
he's been accused of,'' Forcella said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he disagrees.

<P>
   (``Land of Little Rivers: A Story in Photos of Catskill Fly
Fishing,'' By Austin McK. Francis, Beaverkill Press, New York, 280
pages. $100.)
</P>
<P>
   Except for the maniacal few inclined to slog waist deep in slush
after steelhead or the merely touched who spend long hours over a
hole in the ice on some forgotten pond waiting for nothing in
particular, fishermen this time of year live mostly in their heads
and are happy enough for it.
</P>
<P>
   Typically they'll get out some piece of gear and stare at it,
and then be hypnotized in no time into the deepest most satisfying
reverie. The oldest memories are the best ones, and truthfully the
caught fish or the missed opportunity plays out with equal value
through the telescope of time. Those of us who are fly-fishers
sometimes do this sort of religious observance over the fly-tying
vice, which might make for scanty production by the end of the
afternoon. But what fun.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you cast a fly, a spinner or a gob of worm, the common
thread in the mind's eye is imagining yourself in, on or around
water.
</P>
<P>
   Since I was brought up in the Catskills, my memory banks are
chock-full of encounters and misadventures on the Schoharie, the
Esopus, Little Beaverkill, and to a lesser degree the big
Beaverkill, Willowemoc and more recently, the branches of the
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally, I fell in love with Austin McK. Francis' latest
book, ``Land of Little Rivers,'' a stunning pictorial of Catskill
streams and the characters and places associated with the region's
rich fishing history. It's an art book. It's a history and
reference work, but most of all for anyone who's fished any of
these ``little rivers,'' or even just thought about doing so, the
artwork jumps at you and startles you into seeing and dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   Photographer and committed fly-fisherman Enrico Ferorelli took
13,000 images for this book, and Francis, who is both author and
publisher supplemented with the work of 12 other photographers.
Every major Catskill stream associated with the birth and early
years of American fly-fishing are gorgeously represented, from
quiet scenes on Art Flick's Little Westkill to the brawny world of
guide boats on Delaware's main stem.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who is in business in Manhattan, not surprisingly is a
nut-case fly-fisherman in his own right with a home on the
Beaverkill. Who else would risk a $500,000 investment on this
venture, and take no pay for the two years it has taken to
assemble. He's already spent 25 years researching the region and is
familiar to many as the principal author of Harry Darbee's book on
Catskill fly-tying, and as the sole author of the still benchmark
work, ``Catskill Rivers'' (Winchester Press, 1973).
</P>
<P>
   Francis is a little sensitive to the suggestion that the text of
``Land of Little Rivers'' is deeply reminiscent of the earlier
book. He insists that more than half the material is entirely new,
and on actual inspection that proves to be true. Besides, what has
been borrowed from the past book is well worth including anyway.
There is new material on the private clubs associated with these
rivers, and tons of photos of gear and outings and flies. The
project that became this book, Francis says, originated as an
off-shoot of his deep involvement with Joan Wulff and others in
founding and nurturing the Catskill Fly-Fishing Center on the
Beaverkill.
</P>
<P>
   As interesting, even absorbing as some of the history and
stories are, what makes this a must-have for fly-fishermen are
those vivid, sharp color photos.
</P>
<P>
   As with the earlier Francis book on these streams, there are
large, elaborate map illustrations of each river system by artist
John Manikowski, of the ``Wild Fish and Cookbook'' fame (Artisan,
1997).
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a hundred bucks. But frankly, given the coffee-table
size, heavy stock paper and brilliant printing in Italy by
Stamperia Valdonega, it's a flat-out bargain. Consider it a
religious contribution.

CONSCIENCE PAYS OFF FOR 401(K) PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Domini and corporate America might qualify as the ultimate
odd couple.
</P>
<P>
   But Domini, the Cambridge, Mass. pioneer of socially responsible
investing, must thank two things, above all else, for the explosive
growth of her Domini Social Equity Fund: strong performance over
the last three years and demand from big companies that want to
include it on their menu of retirement fund investment options.
</P>
<P>
   Big companies like Hewlett-Packard Co. and The Gap have added
the $1.3 billion fund, which has grown nearly fourfold in the last
two years, to the investment options in their 401(k) plans. More
than 75 retirement plans have added the Domini fund since the start
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Even Domini herself can't resist the irony of the fund's latest
retirement plan coup, its scheduled April 1 addition to the giant
General Motors 401(k) menu. ``We wouldn't own General Motors in our
fund,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Domini's fund is not is not alone in the world of socially
responsbile investing, which typically screens stocks based on
social and environmental track records.
</P>
<P>
   Many other socially reponsible mutual funds report rapid growth
and attribute much of the demand to corporate 401(k) plans, by far
the leading source of new money being invested in all types of
mutual funds today.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, socially responsible funds were
nonstarters in the world of corporate retirement plans. Most of the
funds relied almost exclusively on press coverage and word of mouth
to win business from retail investors.
</P>
<P>
   One key turning point: Calvert Group Ltd. of Bethesda, Md.,
which manages about $2.2 billion in eight socially responsible
funds, requested and received an advisory letter from the US
Department of Labor in 1998 on how federal pension laws affected
those investment alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The government's answer: Socially responsible funds were
acceptable options as long as their track records were comparable
with other investments carrying similar levels of risk.
</P>
<P>
   That created breathing room for some corporate plan sponsors,
who had worried they could be sued if the socially responsible fund
investments they made available to employees turned sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed a lot of things,'' said Charles Ruffel, editor of
Plan Sponsor, a pension industry magazine in Greenwich, Conn.
``It's significantly more common (for plans to include a socially
repsonsible option) than it was a year ago. It's now clearly not a
breach of the `prudent man' law, and some of these funds have
proven they can perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is that the list of funds available in retirement
plans at big companies is typically getting longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've only got six choices, it's unlikley one can be
socially responsible,'' Ruffel said. ``But if you've got 15, it's a
different story.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's largest administrators of retirement plans,
such as Fidelity Investments, American Express, Putnam Investments,
and Charles Schwab, began to add more socially responsible funds
managed by other investment firms to their 401(k) ``platforms,''
selections that can easily be plugged into any plan they operate
for corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, which included five socially responsbile funds in its
FundsNet platform in 1996, added five more in 1998. That's 10 out
of a total of 97 non-Fidelity funds on the FundsNet platform.
</P>
<P>
   Domini counts her fund's inclusion in the Fidelity 401(k)
platform in January 1998 and in a similar list at Manulife
Financial three months earlier as watershed events.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some large fund companies are developing their own
socially responsible funds. Vanguard Group, for instance, has
announced plans to offer a fund based on a social index under
development at Calvert.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to retirement plans, securing a place on the
menu and actually being selected by individual investors are two
very different things.
</P>
<P>
   Many socially responsible funds, once viewed as poor investment
performers, have turned in impressive numbers for at least the last
five years. The Domini Social Index fund has outperformed the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index in each of the last three years and
just barely slipped below the benchmark in the previous two years.
Another index-driven socially reponsible investment, the Citizens
Index Fund, has turned in similar numbers over a shorter existance.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Stocks that socially responsible funds tend to
avoid, such as big oil and cigarette producers, have been big
investment losers in the '90s. At the same time, socially
responsible funds have tended to bulk up on younger technology
stocks, which roared through the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   That produces a Domini Social Equity portfolio heavy on
Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp., and Cisco Systme Inc. One big stock
market winner of the 1990s that doesn't make the Domini social cut:
General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have the old labor and environmental issues in the
newer companies,'' Domini said. ``We are more biased toward newer,
faster-growing companies.'' It has been the ultimate win-win
situtation, so far at least.
</P>
<P>
   The socially responsible money managers have won an important
foothold in America's vast corporate retirement system. But they
will have to continue to perform to make the most of that
opportunity.

SERIES OF BAD MOVES BLAMED FOR SPIKE IN OIL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As a search for villains intensifies in New England's
worst heating oil crisis since the 1980s, energy analysts say the
real culprit may be ``a classic case of market failure'' in which
just about everything that could go wrong did go wrong in the
region's shaky oil distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   From the OPEC ministers who slashed the world oil supply to
refiners who cut back on heating oil reserves just as winter
approached, the Northeast simply wasn't prepared for a sudden cold
spell, according to federal assessments. When the mercury plummeted
in January, there wasn't enough heating oil to go around, nearly
doubling the price in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thousands of vulnerable people are struggling to stay
warm, especially in Boston where Citizens Energy Corp. was forced
to stop accepting applications for fuel aid to the poor and elderly
last week. One New Hampshire oil company left its customers out in
the cold altogether, stopping all deliveries because it couldn't
afford the escalating wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, attorneys general across the region are looking for
evidence that oil dealers may have gouged their customers, and US
Energy Secretary William Richardson is scheduled to come to Boston
next week for a strategy session on how to deal with the home
heating oil crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, meanwhile, called on state and federal
officials Tuesday to put major oil companies on the hot seat,
charging that their lack of foresight hurt thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``American oil refiners have a lot of questions to answer,''
said Larry Chretien, executive director of the Boston Oil Consumers
Alliance, which provides discount oil to more than 6,000 members.
``They were making a whole bunch of gasoline for sport utility
vehicles, but they weren't making any (heating) oil.''
</P>
<P>
   But it may already be too late to change the course of the
current price panic, which appeared to ease Tuesday as the price of
newly delivered oil in New York Harbor fell sharply. Even if
Richardson releases federally-owned oil to be processed into
heating oil, it wouldn't be available for up to a month.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, federal and state investigators may have to concentrate
on figuring out how to avoid the next crisis, something that may be
hard to do as long as New England relies on such an unstable
commodity as heating oil to warm homes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Vermont Representative Bernard Sanders has filed a bill
in Congress that would set up a reserve supply in New York Harbor
to avoid future shortages. Others have suggested that wholesale oil
companies be required to keep a larger reserve.
</P>
<P>
   However, the idea of a fuel reserve has run into a thresher of
opposition in the past because of the cost to maintain it, which
Sanders estimated at $225 million over the next 20 years. Some
critics say the reserve system would drive up oil prices all the
time, rather than only during periodic shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bad as this (oil price escalation) has been, I'm not sure
it's worse than under some of the alternatives,'' said
Massachusetts Energy Resources Commissioner David O'Connor, noting
that this is the first sudden price increase since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the current crisis go back to last year when, faced
with the lowest inflation-adjusted crude oil prices since the Great
Depression, the Oil Producing and Exporting Countries (OPEC)
finally convinced members to reduce worldwide production. The
supply cut, coupled with rising energy demand in Asia, caused an
increase in the price for all petroleum products from propane to
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Up until that time, New England had been blessed with remarkably
low and stable heating oil prices. Last year, for example, the
price of a gallon of heating oil never topped 80 cents, compared to
the $2 a gallon that some customers were paying earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   But the rising world oil prices had a particular effect on home
heating oil, unusual among petroleum products in that it is used
only in cold weather months and mainly in the Northeastern states,
from Maryland north. Most of the rest of the country relies on
natural gas for heat.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the limited market for home heating oil, refiners are
loath to produce too much for fear of winding up with unused
product in the spring. With crude oil prices running high, refiners
cut back on their heating oil stocks, causing US reserves to drop
by more than 10 percent in November, when supplies normally rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far and away the most important decision was made last fall by
refiners to limit the amount of home heating oil that they would
refine,'' said O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   Oil industry officials dispute that they cut back on
home-heating oil production, noting that overall production for
this winter is slightly above last year. While reserves did drop,
John Felmy of the American Petroleum Institute argues that the drop
reflected the industry's concern about having too much oil in
storage on New Year's Eve, when Y2K problems had been feared.
</P>
<P>
   But Alice Lippert, a home heating oil analyst at the US Energy
Information Administration, said the refiners' low reserves suggest
they were expecting a mild winter, an expectation reinforced by the
warm temperatures of the last two winters.
</P>
<P>
   At the agency's annual home heating oil conference in October,
said Lippert, ``We couldn't get anybody to predict that it was
going to be a normal or a colder than normal winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if refiners were unprepared for a cold winter, so
were New Englanders. After several years of relatively low heating
oil prices, few were willing to pay a few dollars extra in exchange
for a guarantee from their oil delivery company to keep prices
stable throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when the temperature began to drop right after
Christmas, the entire Northeast was vulnerable to a sudden shortage
that invites spiralling prices. In early January, the price of oil
delivered to New York Harbor began to soar, sending a chain
reaction through wholesalers and retail distributors and finally to
customers. From Jan17-24 alone, retail heating oil prices in
Massachusetts jumped from $1.17 a gallon to $1.74.
</P>
<P>
   The price jump immediately clobbered customers of J.L. Oliver in
Berlin, N.H., which had promised to deliver oil for as little as 55
cents a gallon even if the wholesale price jumped. The company
stopped making deliveries altogether, forcing the state Office of
Energy and Community Services to find new oil suppliers for about
2,500 households.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Citizens Energy, a non-profit organization run by
former Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, suspended applications
for an emergency fuel aid program for the poor and elderly, largely
because Citizens was paying almost $2 a gallon for oil that it
turned around and offered at 40 cents for people in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the heating oil crisis swept the region, at least two
other factors made the problem even worse.
</P>
<P>
   First, natural gas companies up and down the Eastern seaboard,
also facing demand increases, began switching certain major
customers from gas to oil service. These customers, who received a
discount on their gas bills in exchange for agreeing to switch to
oil occasionally, increased demand for heating oil just as prices
were rising.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, these factories and power plants switching to
oil boosted oil demand by only about 2 percent, but oil industry
officials said the increase was much greater in New York, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the cold weather also brought ice and rough weather to
ports throughout the region, making deliveries of oil that could
ease the crisis more difficult, according to Lippert of the Energy
Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and Rhode
Island have launched investigations into whether oil wholesalers or
even individual home delivery companies may have illegally jacked
up prices to take advantage of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reviews of price increases in Massachusetts show that
home delivery companies may have actually lost money, as wholesale
prices jumped 58 percent while their prices to consumers went up
only 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rhode Island Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse is
zeroing in on the nine biggest wholesale companies that provide the
oil to the home delivery companies. Tuesday was the deadline for
these companies _ including Mobil Oil, Sprague Energy and others _
to provide financial information that could show whether they
profiteered or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to determine whether legitimate market forces are
driving this increase, what they are, whether anyone is taking
unfair or deceptive advantage, and what we can do to prevent such
steep price hikes in the future,'' said Whitehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Even if no ``gougers'' are caught, however, Massachusetts Energy
Commissioner O'Connor said the current crisis is a wakeup call for
the oil industry to plan better for winter heating season. Already,
momentum is building for some sort of government-mandated oil
reserve, and pressure is likely to build when Energy Secretary
Richardson visits Boston next week.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the oil industry may pay in another way: natural gas
suppliers are expecting a rush of home heating oil customers to
switch to them once the ground is thawed enough to bury new gas
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Chretien, director of the Boston Oil Consumers
Alliance, agrees that there is plenty of blame to go around for the
oil price fiasco, from OPEC to consumers who had grown to expect
low oil prices indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Though Chretien wants more accountability for the major
businesses in the oil supply chain, he concludes, ``We have met the
enemy and he is us.''

TRUCKERS HIT BY HIKE IN FUEL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Winter heating bills generally hit those with fixed or
low incomes the hardest. But this year's cold snap, combined with
spiking oil prices, has hit two more groups: middle-class
Bostonians, some of whom are having trouble paying fuel bills, and
independent truck drivers, many of whom have had to stop driving
their rigs because they can't afford fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contract with about 75 independent owner-operators, and
almost every one of those guys has called me to say that if the
fuel prices keep going up, they're going to have to shut down,''
said Jim Morse, vice president of Refrigerated Express in Acton.
``Because of the fuel costs, they're losing money every time they
take the truck out of the lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent truckers say that if prices remain high, they'll go
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a number of single-operator guys calling up,'' said
Bob Sculley, president of the New Hampshire Motor Transport
Association. ``The cost is just too high for them to justify
operating. I've been in the industry over 25 years, and I've never
seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Truckers say their rigs require five or six gallons of fuel to
move just one mile _ and with current prices at $2.12 a gallon,
that means more than $400 a week for the 200 gallons required to
fill their tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Natoli, a 68-year-old widow from Hyde Park, got half a
tank of oil from a heating assistance group a couple of weeks ago,
but worries that it won't be enough to last the winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very careful and frugal; I'm not a woman who uses heat to
excess. I put on all the storm windows; I clog up the spaces under
and over the doors to prevent drafts. . . . I even put a piece of
foam in the mail slot,'' Natoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Natoli says she wears a sweatsuit all day and tries to jump
around as much as possible inside her home in order to keep warm.
``I figure the more body heat I have, the less oil heat I need,''
Natoli laughed, trying to downplay the seriousness of her
situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy-family run Citizens Energy Corp., whose Oil
Assistance Program has provided subsidized fuel to more than 8,300
needy families this winter, announced last week that it had to
temporarily suspend its program, saying it was unable to keep up
with current levels of demand.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem that administrators at other fuel-assistance
programs say they too have seen. As fuel prices continue to spike,
increasing numbers of people, particularly the working poor and
middle-class families, are being forced to rely on charitable
programs in order to heat their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's in a crisis situation right now,'' said Kathy
Tobin, who directs the fuel assistance program for ABCD, a
charitable group in Boston. ``Some have gone for days without heat
as they try to scrape some funds together, from family or friends
or the program. Way back in the 70s, during the energy crisis, it
may have been bad, but I've certainly never seen it this bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin says that her organization has had to turn away hundreds
of needy people because their incomes are too high to meet ABCD's
standards for eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Local advocates say the elderly are at greatest risk, because
many are in frail health and are more vulnerable to hypothermia.
Keeping warm can sometimes mean the difference between life and
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had two people come in today, saying they can't heat
their homes, and saying `what can we do?' They're at a loss,'' said
Marion Whiting, director of the Wakefield Council on Aging. ``We're
seeing people having to choose for the first time in their lives
between eating and paying their heating bills. It's a scary
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Tuesday to spend $10 million to help low-income
families pay heating bills. Lawmakers said the measure, which still
has to pass the House, is the fastest way to bring relief to people
who can't afford the high cost of oil.

DOWNSIZING: IT HASN'T LET UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When future generations peruse the history books, it's likely
they will read that 1999 was a stellar year, the capstone of a
gilded age. The year the Dow Jones industrial average surged past
10,000. The year the economy eluded dire predictions of a severe
slowdown and continued humming as we entered the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But history books will also record that the downsizings
continued and, in some cases, there was a resurgence due to plant
closings, megamergers, and restructurings.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the findings of the Corporation for Business, Work and
Learning, a quasi-public entity whose rapid response team helps the
commonwealth's pink-slipped legions regain their footing, remake
their lives, and find new work.
</P>
<P>
   The team reports that 22,970 workers were downsized in fiscal
year 1999, up approximately 3,400 over the previous fiscal year.
And if the latest figures hold true, there are apt to be even more
layoffs in fiscal 2000: Already, 12,289 Massachusetts workers have
been laid off, and the fiscal year is not over.
</P>
<P>
   One key factor behind the layoffs: efficiency drives at some of
the nation's big computer companies, some of them the result of
merger fever.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, about 850 people lost jobs at Intel in
Massachusetts. The layoffs, which officially went into effect April
15, were part of a national effort to streamline, reduce costs, and
improve productivity in a period of lower computer prices and
increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Massachusetts was not the only place that got hit.
The previous year, 1,100 workers were laid off at Intel's chip
factory in Arizona, and 600 more at its computer manufacturing
plant in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, LTX Corp. of Westwood, Teradyne Corp. in
Boston, and PRI Automatic Inc. in Billerica also announced layoffs,
as a result of Asia's economic crisis and a worldwide downturn in
the semiconductor industry. The problem stemmed, in part, from too
many memory chips in the market and deep price discounts by the
makers of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Corporation for Business, Work and Learning in
Charlestown noted that, of the 252 Massachusetts employers who laid
off workers in fiscal 1999, about 8 percent said foreign trade was
a key reason for the decision to downsize, including the Asian
crisis and the lure of lower manufacturing and labor costs in
Mexico and other developing countries.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Workplace romance is a critical issue for many companies, but
only 72 percent have written policies addressing it. Fourteen
percent have an unwritten yet widely understood policy, reports the
Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Of those companies with policies that govern the do's and don'ts
of dating in the workplace, 55 percent say the policy permits but
discourages romance. Seven percent prohibit such relationships. The
report is based on a poll of 617 human resource professionals.

AFTER MONTHS OF HYPE, REALITY SETS IN FOR E-COMMERCE FIRMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In glasses and flowing white garb, an actress portraying
Mother Nature sashayed to a funky beat while encouraging television
viewers to shop her Web site, MotherNature.com.
</P>
<P>
   But the earthy mom will be dancing less often on the airwaves.
In future advertising campaigns for the on-line seller of vitamins
and herbal remedies, she will be used ``more strategically,'' said
a company official, choosing her words carefully.
</P>
<P>
   For many e-commerce companies, Christmas 1999 was a big turning
point as sales took off and Internet shopping started going
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after months of on-line hype _ including a barrage of
Christmas dot-com ads, free gifts, and shipping giveaways _ it's
beginning to look like the party is over.
</P>
<P>
   Software e-tailer Beyond.com Corp. plans to lay off 20 percent
of its work force. Value America Inc., which sells a variety of
consumer products on line, halved its work force in December. Web
giant Amazon.com Inc. recently said it will trim 150 jobs, or 2
percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Other e-commerce players, such as Concord-based MotherNature.com
Inc., are starting to rein in their marketing budgets, searching
for a less expensive way of luring new shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors are clearly growing impatient with on-line
retailers' ballooning losses. E-commerce stocks have been spiraling
downward. And in some investment circles, purse strings are
starting to tighten.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crazy days of investing in Internet retailers are over,''
said Dan Nova, managing general partner of the Boston venture
capital firm Highland Capital Partners. ``I think investors will be
looking to back the number one player in a category. They'll think
about number two and forget about investing in number three.''
</P>
<P>
   The cyber-crunch has nothing to do with consumer spending. On
line and off line, many of America's merchants have been ringing up
record sales. For the second year in a row, on-line retail revenue
soared during the Christmas shopping season, more than doubling to
$7 billion during the last two months of 1999, compared with the
same period a year earlier, according to the Internet research firm
Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   But on-line retailers are discovering that the emerging
marketplace in cyberspace isn't so different from traditional
retailing after all. Too many new players means there is bound to
be a shakeout, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see a lot of consolidation,'' said Mike May, a Jupiter
analyst. ``The market isn't big enough for all of these''
retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, shoppers are flocking to names they know. The top 10
Web sites, for instance, account for 60 percent of all customer
traffic, according to the Internet consulting firm Nexgenix Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible concentration of traffic on a
relatively small number of sites,'' said James Tenser, a retail
strategist with Irvine, Calif.-based Nexgenix. ``Everybody in the
market understands that this has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, winners are emerging, and, in some cases, they are
established bricks-and-mortar retailers who have leveraged their
strong brand names on line, May said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pets.com's aggressive TV campaign, starring a tenacious
hand-puppet dog, the e-tailer has been outsmarted on line by
superstore chain Petsmart, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co. has been driving
crowds of shoppers to its Web site, May said. And even though it
had problems delivering on time before Christmas, Toysrus.com has
been staying close to toy category leader eToys Inc., he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional merchants and catalog companies have several
advantages over so-called pure-play on-line retailers that exist
only in cyberspace. Experienced retailers like Nordstrom Inc. know
how to target their customers. And by integrating their on-line and
off-line stores, they can offer shoppers more choices and grab more
marketing opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of building brand and awareness,'' said Marie
Toulantis, chief financial officer of on-line bookseller
barnesandnoble.com Inc. ``We have the advantage of the Barnes &AMP;
Noble name.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Web stores struggled to deliver gifts before
Christmas, catalog merchants like L.L. Bean, J. Crew, and Eddie
Bauer emerged among the top performers because of their experience
in filling and shipping orders.
</P>
<P>
   Some pure-play on-line retailers are moving in the same
direction. Both eToys and Amazon.com are building their own
warehouses to get more control over their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Other e-tailers, like toysmart
</P>
<P>
   .com of Waltham, say they are working with package delivery
companies to deliver even faster than before to retain shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you deliver within seven days, your loyalty rate might be
20 percent,'' said David N. Lord, chief executive of toysmart.com.
Within ``five days, your customer loyalty rate might be 50
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the mood on Wall Street is different. Although
investors were willing to accept on-line retailers' huge start-up
costs in 1999, they are now asking whether fledgling on-line
retailers can deliver the goods and make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the market sentiment is they need to show a path to
profitability,'' said Scott Van Winkle, an analyst with the Boston
investment firm Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill.
</P>
<P>
   That message is becoming clear to Internet retailers. Facing
mounting losses, Beyond.com of Santa Clara, Calif., announced last
month that it had cut its work force and that its chief executive
had resigned. Its stock price nose-dived.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond.com isn't alone. Shares of Virginia-based Value America
have traded as high as 74 1/4. But after its management turmoil and
disappointing sales became public knowledge after Christmas, the
company's share price fell dramatically. On Feb. 4 it closed at 5
1/4 on the Nasdaq stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Though not immune to the backlash, Amazon.com has fared slightly
better on Wall Street. Some financial analysts are pleased with the
company's powerful presence on line and the recent layoffs, which
they view as a sign that the retailer is taking a more cautious
approach to spending.
</P>
<P>
   EToys's stock has been hammered even though it met analysts'
expectations. But many investors were spooked by the firm's fiscal
third-quarter results. Sales soared to $106.8 million in the
quarter ended Dec. 31 from just $22.9 million in the year-earlier
period. But the company lost $75.5 million, exluding non-cash
charges, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $9.8 million in
the previous year's quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl ads haven't helped Internet retailers, industry
observers said. E-commerce companies bombarded viewers with TV
commercials. But in living rooms across America, the reaction of
many people was, ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a ton of money wasted on the Super Bowl,'' said
James Gregory, chief executive of the consulting firm Corporate
Branding LLC. ``I don't know what the hell is the matter with these
folks. They think they're creating a brand. And they leave you with
no consistency in their message, no core thought. It's really
bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   The continuing ad campaigns have left some analysts wondering
whether on-line retailers understand that the party really is
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have dot-coms spending millions of dollars. It hasn't
really sunk in yet,'' said Joe Sawyer, an analyst with Forrester
Research in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is spending money like it's 1999. At
MotherNature.com, executives recently opted to drop some new TV
advertisements as it moves toward less-expensive marketing, such as
affiliations with health plans. It also is trying to renegotiate or
steer away from costly advertising deals with Internet portals such
as America Online and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a single CEO who believes that any of the
portal deals they're doing is economically viable for the long
term,'' MotherNature chief executive Michael Barach said.
</P>
<P>
   Even large and established companies are grimacing at the high
costs of promoting their sites on the gateways to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Bean, for example, is ``stuck'' with several expensive
portal agreements that are ``not great deals,'' said Shawn Gorman,
the company's e-commerce marketing manager. The catalog and on-line
retailer has little choice, however. For now, it must advertise
with certain gateways so consumers can access its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   This won't last, he added. ``We cannot afford to lose money.''

SAVINGS PLAN REQUIRES LONG-TERM DISCIPLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 26 years old and have spoken with various financial
advisors at various investment companies. I'm fed up with them
because they are not really concerned about me as an investor, only
my money. I would like to know what you would do if you were me. I
have no kids or wife and I have just been hired at a job and I want
to be financially secure when I retire. I like what I hear about
the Roth IRA, tax-free municipal bonds, and mutual funds. Of
greatest importance to me when investing is tax deferral and safety
of principal. I'd like something for retirement about 40 years from
now and something I can reclaim earlier -- five to 10 years earlier
if desired.
</P>
<P>
   D.D., Calabasas Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the place I would begin is to decide on a percentage
of your earnings that is to be saved for retirement, using this as
the basis to establish a long-term savings discipline for yourself.
To start with, if you fully funded a Roth IRA, that would represent
7.15 percent of the lower end of the salary range you provided. If
you can afford it, I'd like to see you go a little higher, saving
at least 8 percent of your earnings for retirement. That extra
boost beyond the $166 a month needed to max out a Roth IRA would
work out to $240 a year, or $20 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Since you supply a salary range, I'm guessing that the $2,600
difference between the low and high end of the range is an estimate
of a possible bonus or commission earnings. If you can feel you can
afford it, I'd like to see you apply a heftier percentage to that
money when it comes to retirement savings -- something in the area
of 25 percent to 50 percent. This may seem like a tough goal now,
but it would make a lot of difference in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, I think youre being much too cautious, given
your situation. While I understand your concern over safety of
principal, the fact is that you'll likely be able to amass a
significant nestegg only if you assume the risks that are inherent
in investing in stocks. Instruments such as CDs and municipal bonds
are great for people who are 30 to 40 years older than you are, but
you are now at the beginning of a long stage of accumulation, and
if you stay within the cautious world of fixed-income investments,
you are likely to see returns at about half of what it is
reasonable to expect from a stock portfolio. You just cant afford
to take that cautious route.
</P>
<P>
   Let me give an example. If you opened a Roth IRA right now with
$2,000 and added no more money, and if it grew at a 5 percent rate
for 40 years, it would be worth $14,679. If you went with a stock
portfolio in which the average annual growth was 10 percent, the
pool would be $90,518. That is a lot of extra reward for riding out
the risks that go along with the higher long-term growth from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I would begin simply, with a Roth IRA in the Vanguard Index 500
fund. Then, if you go along with my idea of saving an additional
$20 a month to get your savings to 8 percent, you can begin
building savings for taxable mutual fund holdings that would
complement the core position in Index 500. You might begin with
Vanguard's Mid-Cap Index fund, then go to its Small-Cap Index fund,
and, if it has reopened by that time, to its Health Care fund.
</P>
<P>
   For these taxable accounts, you will have to begin saving with a
bank until you have amassed enough for the minimum initial deposit
in the mutual funds, which is usually considerable higher for
taxable accounts than for IRAs -- $3,000 versus $1,000 in the case
of Vanguard. These savings, augmented by whatever you add from
bonuses or commissions, would provide money which would be
available to you in that five-to-10-year period before your
expected retirement.
</P>
<P>
   A Roth IRA will provide you with tax-free money in retirement.
If your company has a 401(k) or similar program that becomes
available to you, once you're eligible you can debate whether the
tax-deferral and short-term tax break of 401(k) savings is more
attractive to you than the tax-free withdrawals of the Roth. If all
things are even, I generally favor the Roth, but 401(k) plans have
much higher annual savings limits. Moreover, if a company offers
matching funds to 401(k) participants, all things are no longer
equal and the 401(k) usually comes out as the more attractive
option.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the most important part of this approach is to stick to
your discipline. Every time you get a raise, boost the dollar
amount of your savings to hold to whatever savings formula you have
decided on.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 53 and own two homes, residing in one and renting the
other. My primary residence has an outstanding mortgage that will
be paid off in 10 more years. My rental property is in a depressed
area. I am concerned that the rental is declining in value due to
the depressed area and am considering selling. Which option should
I choose -- continue renting, sell and use the proceeds to pay off
my primary mortgage, or sell and invest in another property, or
sell and invest in a diversified portfolio. If the last, what
should I be looking at?
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, on the face of it, selling appears to be a pretty
attractive option. I'm not sure from what you wrote whether that
$800 a month from the property is a gross figure, or the net after
paying the taxes, insurance, and other costs associated with the
property. If it's the latter, you are getting a return of 7.68
percent on the value of the property. That does not seem to me to
be a handsome level of return given the facts you outline -- if the
house is in a depressed area and there seems little prospect that
it will do anything but get worse, you'd have to view it as a
sufficiently risky investment that a 7.68 percent isn't enough
reward. So I would reject the first option and sell.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether buying another rental in a more desirable area is
attractive, I'll have to leave that up to you. But I can supply you
with a sense of what kind of money you would have to generate from
another property for that move to be competitive with either
putting the proceeds against the mortgage or investing the money in
a diversified portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on, it seems to me that the option of paying off your 6
percent mortgage is silly in the current interest rate climate. For
example, entering this week the best rate offered on a jumbo
($100,000 or more) five-year CD was 7.7 percent. With such an
investment, you would have a yield of $9,625, or $802 a month,
enough to pay nearly 80 percent of your current mortgage payment.
</P>
<P>
   If you went into a diversified portfolio of bond funds, putting
half of the money in a solid GNMA fund and a quarter each into a
short-term corporate bond fund and a high-yield corporate bond
fund, you would get fairly similar results. Using Vanguard's funds,
the GNMA offering now has a 6.89 percent yield, the short-term
corporate fund yields 7.19 percent, and the high-yield (or junk)
fund pays 9.54 percent. Based on these figures, you would achieve a
yield of $9,534 a year, or a portfolio average of 7.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
   You would also have more risk than with the CD. I would view
that risk in two ways -- first the likelihood that you would see
some poor short-term returns based on the poor current
interest-rate climate, and second the strong prospect that bond
funds will eventually regain much of the ground that they have lost
in the last year or so. I would like the odds of a portfolio such
as I describe over locking yourself into a five-year 7.7 percent
CD, although both courses are attractive compared to paying off
your 6 percent mortgage.

and wanted a puppy. He was retired, and was realizing his life's
ambition to be a gentleman farmer. Looking ironically at his herd
of Black Angus cattle, he told me, ``Never buy anything that
eats.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Hair today, grown tomorrow
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I finally got a haircut yesterday. It took me
three weeks to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, there's such a narrow window of opportunity. My
barber, being two-thirds retired, works only twice a week, which
makes it hard on everybody but him.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm too old to break in a new barber. I've been going to
Nick since I was in high school. Back then I wore a flattop, and
Nick the Barber was the local flattop king.
</P>
<P>
   I always ask him what folks are talking about. The barbershop is
still as good a barometer as any of the concerns of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Nick said people are talking about presidential politics, Bush
and McCain, Gore and Bradley. I'll tell you in one sentence what I
think. Quoting the title of the new book by that crusty old Texas
populist Jim Hightower:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote, They'd Have Given Us
Candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead we talked about hair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lady barbers was sweeping up the hair around the
chairs, sweeping it up into a big pile and sweeping it into the
back room.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with all that hair, Nick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it out with the trash,'' Nick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like it'd be good for something,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is,'' Nick said. ``It's good for your garden.''
</P>
<P>
   And he told me this story:
</P>
<P>
   Billy the Barber, who cuts hair a couple of chairs down from
Nick, used to have his own shop, just a small building on the edge
of town, and he'd sweep the hair out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the owner, along with cutting hair he also had to
cut the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he got to noticing,'' Nick said, ``how much thicker and
greener the grass was around the back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it was _ the hair mixing with the soil. Hair's
just full of nitrogen, don't you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for a fact, I didn't. But who's going to argue with a
barber named Nick when he's snipping around your ears with a pair
of scissors?
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``How much hair are you throwing away each week?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know. A couple of garbage sacks full, I'd guess,''
Nick said. ``There have been times when some customers asked us to
save it for them. That's what they did with it, fertilized their
gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder why an entrepreneur isn't trying to market
hair as a gardening supply.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the promotion: ``A Hair-Raising Experience ... Nothing's
As Good For The Old Sod As Something From The Old Nog ... Hair
Today, Grown Tomorrow ...''
</P>
<P>
   Here I was, getting my hair cut in a small window of
opportunity, and opportunity was knocking.
</P>
<P>
   Nick and I could go in as partners. With what they're sweeping
up, we could clean up, enriching ourselves along with the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if we got too rich, Nick probably would want to
totally retire from cutting hair ...
</P>
<P>
   Nah, it's not worth it. I'm too old to break in a new barber. It
was probably a hairbrained idea anyway.

 &HT;    BILLS WOULD RESTORE PROMISED VETERAN BENEFIT
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After several years of lobbying and fighting the
government in courts, thousands of retired veterans appeared closer
Wednesday to collecting on a decades-old promise of free medical
care for life.
</P>
<P>
   A ``keep-the-promise'' bill has 290 co-sponsors in the House,
more than enough to pass it, said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who
authored the bill along with Rep. Ronnie Shows, D-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before one nickel of the federal budget surplus is spent for
new federal programs, Congress should first ensure that the
existing health care promises to America's military retirees are
met,'' Norwood at a press conference heavily attended by
representatives of veterans organizations.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Sens. Paul
Coverdell, D-Ga., Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Tim Johnson, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans who went on active duty prior to June 1956 were
promised by military recruiters that if they remained in the
service for 20 years, they and their families would be guaranteed
lifetime medical care.
</P>
<P>
   All they had to do was report to the nearest military hospital
and, provided the country was not at war, they would receive free
care.
</P>
<P>
   But with the military downsizing and scores of Army, Navy and
Air Force hospitals closing, many live too far from the nearest
base hospital. After serving in World War II, Korea and Vietnam,
many say they have found themselves with no reliable government
health benefit.
</P>
<P>
   And all of them are shifted to Medicare when they reach 65, a
move requiring them to shoulder a portion of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The law was changed in 1956 to provide retirees coverage under
the Defense Department's Tricare system until they reach 65 and
move to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Class Act Group'' headed by retired Marine Corps Medal of
Honor winner Bud Day of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., has taken the
government to court to hold it to its pre-1956 promises.
</P>
<P>
   However, federal courts have ruled that even though the Pentagon
acknowledges the promises were made, the veterans do not have valid
``contracts'' with the government.
</P>
<P>
   The two bills would enroll the pre-1956 veterans in the federal
government employee health plan at the Pentagon's expense. Those
who entered after 1956 would be allowed to enroll in the program
with the government paying the same portion of premiums it now pays
for federal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees would not be required to shift to Medicare when they
become 65.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States of America has said to thousands and
thousands of men and women across this country that if you make
this commitment (to military careers), we won't pay you very much
and we'll send you all over the world, so you won't have a very
good family life, and you will stand an excellent probability of
getting killed or losing a limb, but we'll take care of you and
your family for the rest of your life,'' Norwood said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen that promise gutted,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows precisely how many retirees and dependents would be
affected by the bill. An estimated 4.3 million military retirees
and their dependents or survivors are eligible for military health
care, either under the pre-1956 promise or through Tricare.
</P>
<P>
   However, many have private or government health coverage from
second careers as civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people saying, 'Well, my goodness, this will cost so
much,' `` Norwood said. ``That absolutely means nothing to me
because we haven't kept our promise.''

&HT;     ARE YOU INCOMPETENT? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When I read a story on incompetence in the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the first person I
thought of was comedian Jeff Foxworthy. And yes, I realize that
means the rational part of my brain is either incompetent or
vacationing in Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that people who are incompetent at certain
tasks often think they're doing just as well as everyone else.
That's because _ you guessed it _ they're incompetent at
recognizing their own incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   Foxworthy is the comedian whose most famous routine is ``... you
just might be a redneck.'' He would begin dozens of sentences in
different ways, but they would always end with ``you just might be
a redneck.''
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to Foxworthy (and the entire human race), here
are some signs you should watch for:
</P>
<P>
   _ If you don't think you're incompetent at anything, you just
might be incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Face it: We're all incompetent at something. If I bought a
fixer-upper home, I could quickly turn it into a condemned
building.
</P>
<P>
   If you've chosen the right career, you might be competent at all
the tasks, but you have strengths and weaknesses. Sure, everybody
knows you're supposed to tiptoe around the ``What's your biggest
weakness?'' job interview question, but you ought to know the
honest answer _ even if you would never say it to the interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Before writing the psychology journal story, Justin Kruger and
David Dunning of Cornell University tested groups of students in
three categories: sense of humor, logical reasoning and grammar. In
each test, students _ even the incompetent ones _ generally felt
they had done better than about two-thirds of their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   In many jobs, confidence is crucial, so it's understandable that
people have an inflated opinion of themselves. But if you can't
identify your weaknesses, you're dramatically limiting your
potential.
</P>
<P>
   Look at each of your co-workers. What skill does he have that
you don't? Why is she moving up and you aren't? Which co-worker is
the most respected? Why? If you still can't figure out your
weaknesses, ask a mentor or colleague. Whenever you have a
performance evaluation, ask your boss how you can do better. If you
don't have performance evaluations, ask your boss anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Once you figure out your weaknesses, deal with them. This does
not necessarily mean you should spend hours and hours working on
those weaknesses to strengthen yourself. Sometimes the best way is
to work around them, so you spend more hours on those things you're
already good at.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a different job out there that uses more of your
strengths? Can you restructure your job to take better advantage of
your talents? Could an assistant or co-worker take over those tasks
that cause you the most trouble?
</P>
<P>
   _ If your main source of professional guidance is Dilbert, you
just might be incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of workers will go to conferences and workshops when
they're young, then get bored because they're not learning much
after a couple of years, so they stop. Forever.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Two serious pitfalls for people once they get established are
that they stop learning and they let their network disintegrate.
Except in an extremely fast-changing field, it's fine to ease off
for a year or two, but it's easy to start going through the motions
if you don't find people to challenge, stimulate and encourage you.
</P>
<P>
   Most jobs are not an exact science, with only one right answer.
Everybody from artists to auto mechanics to software designers
needs to keep evolving if they want to stay on top, and sometimes
that means changing companies. It is entirely possible to be
competent one year and incompetent the next.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you work hard but never get any recognition, you just might
be incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Big promotions and healthy pay raises are signs that you're more
than competent, of course, but sometimes good companies have tight
budgets and little turnover, so those are not the only ways you
should measure success.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly you shouldn't define your career based on what awards
you do or don't receive, but recognition from your colleagues is
one way to tell if you have talent. If you work in a field that
hands out lots of awards and you've never received one, figure out
why.
</P>
<P>
   If you can, look at the work of the people who were honored. See
what they did that you didn't do, or what strategies they tried
that you didn't. If you can't see how their work was any better
than yours, get opinions from colleagues you respect. It's a lot
easier to learn from other people's successes, and failures, than
from your own.
</P>
<P>
   There are other kinds of useful recognition. Does your company
adopt your suggestions? Have competitors _ or bosses, for that
matter _ ever stolen ideas from you? Those aren't exactly Oscars,
but they are a form of respect.
</P>
<P>
   Do you get singled out for praise from your bosses? As long as
these are not people who praise every worker every day, that's
meaningful recognition, especially if it comes with cash or time
off.
</P>
<P>
   If you know that you're talented and hardworking, but you're
still not getting recognized, consider yourself trapped in a
paradox of incompetence. The better you are as a worker, the worse
you are at choosing an employer.
</P>
<P>
   After all, during the greatest economic boom in U.S. history,
why would a terrific employee with a great work ethic go for years
without promotions, pay raises or praise? Sorry to say it, but when
it comes to choosing an employer, you just might be incompetent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What will happen when the spigot gets turned off? You have to
ask, because it has been wide open, and it can't stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   The money spigot was opened last year because of Y2K. To make
sure that there was enough cash to sustain any run on the banking
system caused by millennial fears, the Federal Reserve flooded the
economy with cash and credit in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alan Greenspan and company have to figure out a way to
quickly cut back on the flow and sop up the excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Move too slowly and the central bankers could create the
inflation they so want to avoid. Move too quickly and the economy,
which is already absorbing a series of interest-rate hikes from
1999, might stall.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how wide did the Federal Reserve open the spigot? In the
last three months of 1999, it increased its assets by about 30
percent. The Fed adds to its assets by buying Treasury bonds in the
open market. The dollars the central bank uses to pay for those
bonds add to the amount of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Measures of the U.S. money supply are notoriously inexact, but
it is clear that the Fed's actions have increased the amount of
cash in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In November alone, M-3, the broadest measure of the amount of
money in the economy, grew by about 18 percent on an annualized
basis. The annualized rate of growth in the first six months of the
year? Less than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such a large increase in the money supply would push
interest rates down as more money chased a limited supply of bonds.
(That would make the price of a bond go up _ and the yield on the
bond go down as a percentage of the price.)
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans would become cheaper, leading to an additional
expansion of credit. Consumers would spend more, since interest
rates would be low and credit easy to get. Stock prices would soar
as investors found themselves able to take out larger margin loans
on easier terms.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no one knows exactly which change in money supply
will produce which effects in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked as though the money flowing out of the Federal
Reserve and the associated easier credit for buying financial
assets played a role _ perhaps the largest role _ in driving the
major stock-market indexes to record highs in December.
</P>
<P>
   And the easy availability of money could be part of what fueled
consumer spending in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Or these effects could just be coincidence. The Fed doesn't
really know, and now it has to make further adjustments. That's why
it now seems that the Fed, which has been so deft at doing neither
too much nor too little over the past few years, may be in real
danger of hitting either the gas or the brake too hard, and sending
the economy spinning off the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed only slowly closes the money spigot and cautiously
decided to let the rate hikes of 1999 work, rather than hiking
again when the board of governors meets this month, the stock
market could climb even higher and the economy could turn even
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   That's surely troubling to a Fed that has repeatedly called
recent stock prices irrational and that considers economic growth
above 3 percent a year inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Fed dries up the river of cash too rapidly, by
selling bonds in order to take dollars out of circulation and by
raising interest rates in February, it could slow the economy too
quickly, too dramatically. That would be particularly damaging if
the economy is already slowing because of past rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the stock market into a correction poses its own danger.
Pricking the market bubble could set up a negative feedback loop.
Falling stock prices could undermine consumer confidence and
spending, slowing the economy and depressing stocks even more.
</P>
<P>
   The months ahead are shaping up as the biggest challenge the Fed
has faced since the global financial crises of August and September
1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the world's financial markets almost reached
meltdown, but the Fed took decisive action to head off that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing the Fed right now might be tougher than that
one. In 1997, it had a good blueprint for heading off a financial
crisis. In 2000, it isn't clear what the bankers should do.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, should be able to track the response to the
Federal Reserve's action or inaction very precisely. From last May
through December, the bond market was stuck in a trading range:
Whenever bond investors got nervous about inflation or the dollar,
they would send bond prices down far enough to take yields up to
about 6.3 percent on the 30-year U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   That yield was always attractive enough to bring new buyers into
the market _ and their money would drive the yield back to about 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks of the year, though, bond yields pushed
through the previous top and reached 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If, in 2000, bond yields move up but establish a new trading
range not too far above the one of 1999, investors can then
conclude that the Fed's policy is draining money out of the economy
at a rate that's neither too fast nor too slow.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the bond market hasn't settled into a trading range
in January _ or if it shoots up before showing signs of settling _
then the danger that the Fed has overreacted one way or another has
increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, running the world's most powerful central bank is
really no fun at all. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With time running out before the Microsoft Corp.
antitrust trial resumes, company officials and the U.S. Justice
Department are under pressure to reach a settlement on the software
behemoth's future, according to experts on technology and the law.
</P>
<P>
   Just what that future would look like remains unclear as the two
sides continue their mediation efforts in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain, according to economists and antitrust lawyers,
is that there are strong reasons for Microsoft and the Justice
Department _ and the 19 states that have joined in the antitrust
complaint _ to reach a settlement before the Feb. 22 resumption of
the trial before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides have something to lose by letting this trial go on
and allowing Jackson to rule on the case,'' says William Kovacic,
an antitrust expert at George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   In his ``findings of fact'' issued Nov. 5, Jackson said the
company had used its monopoly power to stifle innovation, reduce
competition and hurt consumers by bundling its Internet Explorer
browser with its Windows operating system. A computer's operating
system is the core program that allows other programs, such as word
processing applications, to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Because Windows runs 95 percent of all computers, Jackson said,
Microsoft's bundling, or tying together, of its operating system
and its browser means that browser competitors _ such as Netscape _
would be at a severe disadvantage when it comes to selling and
marketing their own browsers. This led to less competition and less
innovation, which hurt consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contends that the browser, which allows users access
to the World Wide Web, is not a separate product but an
``integrated feature'' of Windows.The findings are the judge's
conclusions about which side presented the most compelling and
believable case during the yearlong hearing that opened in his
court on Oct. 19, 1998. As such, the findings clearly signal how
Jackson is likely to rule in his final decision on whether those
facts adds up to violations of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most harmful of all is the message that Microsoft's actions
have conveyed to every enterprise with the potential to innovate in
the computer industry,'' Jackson wrote in his 207-page findings of
fact. ``Through its conduct,'' he continued, ``Microsoft has
demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and
immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing
initiatives that could intensify competition against one of
Microsoft's core products.''Antitrust law forbids companies that
hold a controlling share of a market from engaging in conduct that
is an `unreasonable restraint on competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jackson's finding of facts would seem to favor the
Justice Department, antitrust experts familiar with the case say
that both the government and Microsoft have reasons to want to
settle out of court _ something Jackson has made abundantly clear
he also wants.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, Jackson's appointment last November of Judge
Richard Posner to mediate a settlement was seen by many as a prod
for both sides to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Posner, the chief judge of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago, is a respected jurist who is regarded as an economic
conservative who traditionally has been suspicious of government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment comforted many Microsoft supporters who hoped
that he would lean in the company's direction by suggesting a
relatively mild remedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department officials can take comfort in Posner's
support for the break-up of AT&AMP;T in 1984, and unlike many economic
conservatives, Posner has recognized the general role of antitrust
law in helping to ensure a free market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Posner was a great choice because each side has something to
fear and something to like about him,'' says Edward Brunet, an
antitrust expert at Lewis and Clark Law School in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also have something to fear in letting the case be
decided by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, Jackson's findings of fact clearly showed that he
found the government's case against the company credible and that
he rejected as ``specious,'' as he stated in one part, virtually
all the arguments Microsoft put up in its defense. As a result, the
company can reasonably fear that Jackson's final verdict would find
Microsoft guilty of maintaining its monopoly by unlawful means.With
a half-dozen private antitrust suits now filed against Microsoft,
Gates has additional incentive to strike a deal soon. Otherwise,
plaintiffs' lawyers will be able to use any negative ruling by
Jackson as a potent weapon in their civil suits against the
company. Microsoft also understands, says Brunet, that every day
this case stays in court is another day that Gates and Microsoft's
top management are distracted from their ``real job'' of running a
software firm in an increasingly competitive industry.
</P>
<P>
   For the Justice Department and its antitrust chief Joel Klein,
the prospect of letting the case go forward through the courts also
presents drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Justice Department can be sure that Microsoft would
appeal any adverse ruling by Jackson. This could mean years of
legal wrangling as the case moved through an appeals court and
possibly the U.S. Supreme Court, with no guarantee that Jackson's
ruling wouldn't get reversed and both sides ordered to start over
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settlement avoids the risk of letting other judges look at the
case _ and it would put a solution in place by the end of the
year,'' Kovacic says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with Klein and other top Justice Department
officials likely to depart the government with the Clinton
administration next year, they may not relish the prospect of
another team of lawyers overseeing the end of the Microsoft case in
2002 or 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's clear that momentum is building for a settlement
before Feb. 22, it's less apparent what a deal would like. Both
Microsoft and the Justice Department have kept a tight lid on their
settlement negotiations before Posner.
</P>
<P>
   But according to antitrust experts familiar with case, the two
sides might agree on one of three possible settlements:
</P>
<P>
   1) Divide Microft along operating lines on the model of AT&AMP;T,
which was broken up in 1984, giving rise to separate companies for
operating systems, applications software and Internet business.
Gates would be allowed to run only one of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this punishment is that, if the AT&AMP;T precedent
prevailed, the separate parts could eventually be worth more than
the whole, so Gates, along with the other stockholders, would end
up with even more wealth.
</P>
<P>
   2) A less drastic remedy would allow other companies to produce
their own versions of Windows, either by having Microsoft auction
off the rights to produce Windows or by publishing Windows' secret
application program interfaces, or APIs, which run the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring Microsoft to publish these interfaces and explain how
they work would help quell much of the criticism logged against the
company from its competitors. APIs are the software hooks that
enable other companies' programs, from word processors to games, to
run on Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   Some software developers contend that Microsoft has ``hidden
APIs'' in Windows that give a leg up to its own applications and
favored partners. Microsoft dismisses that accusation as untrue.
Other software developers alleged that the real problem is that the
API documentation from Microsoft is often misleading or erroneous.
</P>
<P>
   3) Finally, the Justice Department could leave Microsoft and its
monopoly status intact but impose specific rules on its behavior
toward customers and competitors _ although many experts say that
this type of arrangement might require a huge Justice Department
effort to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Hal R. Varian, an economist at the University of California at
Berkeley, says any deal will likely be some version of option two,
since Microsoft has repeatedly stated that it will not willingly
submit to the break-up of the company and the Justice Department
has said it will not allow Microsoft to keep its monopoly intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's for sure is that Microsoft is going to
swallow some tough medicine,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What will happen when the spigot gets turned off? You have to
ask, because it has been wide open, and it can't stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   The money spigot was opened last year because of Y2K. To make
sure that there was enough cash to sustain any run on the banking
system caused by millennial fears, the Federal Reserve flooded the
economy with cash and credit in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alan Greenspan and company have to figure out a way to
quickly cut back on the flow and sop up the excess liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Move too slowly and the central bankers could create the
inflation they so want to avoid. Move too quickly and the economy,
which is already absorbing a series of interest-rate hikes from
1999, might stall.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how wide did the Federal Reserve open the spigot? In the
last three months of 1999, it increased its assets by about 30
percent. The Fed adds to its assets by buying Treasury bonds in the
open market. The dollars the central bank uses to pay for those
bonds add to the amount of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Measures of the U.S. money supply are notoriously inexact, but
it is clear that the Fed's actions have increased the amount of
cash in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In November alone, M-3, the broadest measure of the amount of
money in the economy, grew by about 18 percent on an annualized
basis. The annualized rate of growth in the first six months of the
year? Less than 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, such a large increase in the money supply would push
interest rates down as more money chased a limited supply of bonds.
(That would make the price of a bond go up _ and the yield on the
bond go down as a percentage of the price.)
</P>
<P>
   Bank loans would become cheaper, leading to an additional
expansion of credit. Consumers would spend more, since interest
rates would be low and credit easy to get. Stock prices would soar
as investors found themselves able to take out larger margin loans
on easier terms.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, no one knows exactly which change in money supply
will produce which effects in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It sure looked as though the money flowing out of the Federal
Reserve and the associated easier credit for buying financial
assets played a role _ perhaps the largest role _ in driving the
major stock-market indexes to record highs in December.
</P>
<P>
   And the easy availability of money could be part of what fueled
consumer spending in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Or these effects could just be coincidence. The Fed doesn't
really know, and now it has to make further adjustments. That's why
it now seems that the Fed, which has been so deft at doing neither
too much nor too little over the past few years, may be in real
danger of hitting either the gas or the brake too hard, and sending
the economy spinning off the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Fed only slowly closes the money spigot and cautiously
decided to let the rate hikes of 1999 work, rather than hiking
again when the board of governors meets this month, the stock
market could climb even higher and the economy could turn even
hotter.
</P>
<P>
   That's surely troubling to a Fed that has repeatedly called
recent stock prices irrational and that considers economic growth
above 3 percent a year inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Fed dries up the river of cash too rapidly, by
selling bonds in order to take dollars out of circulation and by
raising interest rates in February, it could slow the economy too
quickly, too dramatically. That would be particularly damaging if
the economy is already slowing because of past rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the stock market into a correction poses its own danger.
Pricking the market bubble could set up a negative feedback loop.
Falling stock prices could undermine consumer confidence and
spending, slowing the economy and depressing stocks even more.
</P>
<P>
   The months ahead are shaping up as the biggest challenge the Fed
has faced since the global financial crises of August and September
1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the world's financial markets almost reached
meltdown, but the Fed took decisive action to head off that
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The problem facing the Fed right now might be tougher than that
one. In 1997, it had a good blueprint for heading off a financial
crisis. In 2000, it isn't clear what the bankers should do.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, should be able to track the response to the
Federal Reserve's action or inaction very precisely. From last May
through December, the bond market was stuck in a trading range:
Whenever bond investors got nervous about inflation or the dollar,
they would send bond prices down far enough to take yields up to
about 6.3 percent on the 30-year U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   That yield was always attractive enough to bring new buyers into
the market _ and their money would drive the yield back to about 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks of the year, though, bond yields pushed
through the previous top and reached 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If, in 2000, bond yields move up but establish a new trading
range not too far above the one of 1999, investors can then
conclude that the Fed's policy is draining money out of the economy
at a rate that's neither too fast nor too slow.
</P>
<P>
   If, however, the bond market hasn't settled into a trading range
in January _ or if it shoots up before showing signs of settling _
then the danger that the Fed has overreacted one way or another has
increased significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, running the world's most powerful central bank is
really no fun at all. &QL;

   RAIL-MERGER () _ For much of the last century, the Canadian
National railroad helped define Canada. But now Canadian National
plans to merge with a giant American railroad, the Burlington
Northern and Santa Fe, and its focus has shifted to the south. The
merger underscores how far the formation of a true North American
economy has developed in the six years since the North American
Free Trade Agreement went into effect. Although they are less
visible that the railroads, the auto, banking, and
telecommunications industries already operate on a north-south axis
and pay hardly any attention to continental borders. But not
everyone accepts the vision of the new railroad or the changes it
represents. By Anthony DePalma.

   2ND-ACT-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ F. Scott Fitzgerald said there are
no second acts in American lives. But he never heard of the new
Volkswagen Beetle or the Apple iMac. Today, second acts are as
popular in the world of consumer marketing as they are in the
entertainment business. Just in the last year or so, Maxwell House
coffee, American Greetings cards, Volvo cars, the New York Stock
Exchange and even the Navy have new advertising that recasts their
image as hip and contemporary. Whether it is by creating a new
image, a new package, a new product benefit _ or a mix of it all _
long-established brand names are finding it necessary to capture
new audiences _ and keep old ones _ with updated acts, a reflection
of the rapid changes in society. By Patricia Winters Lauro.

The Dow Jones industrial average was down 31 points, the S&AMP;P 500
down 18 points and the Nasdaq composite index was down 33 points.
Treasury prices are little changed. European markets were slightly
higher: London was up 0.58 percent and Frankfurt was up 0.56
percent. In Asia, the Nikkei closed up 0.70 percent, while Hong
Kong, after a 3-day holiday, ended up 3.64 percent. Gold was at

a new president for it. By Constance L. Hays.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING-STRIKE (Undated) _ Boeing's engineers union says it will
strike at noon, after talks with a federal mediator broke down. It
is unclear whether a strike will have much of an impact: while the
union represents 22,000 engineers and technical workers, only 60
percent are dues-paying union members. The union has walked out
only once before: a one-day strike in 1992. The company says the
strike will not affect production, as it will shift nonunion
workers to critical jobs.

   EUROPE-OIL (Paris) _ Eni of Italy and Repsol-YPF of Spain say

company. By John Tagliabue.

a bowling alley before you'd seen a month. A good chance you have
childhood memories of setting pins in an alley _ dodging flying
pins and balls for hours _ for two bits and maybe a nickel soda
water. You grow up and stay here and you find yourself at the other
end of the lane with a 16-pound ball in your hand and your kid
setting pins _ yourself from decades past looking right at the now

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    EDITORS: THIS IS FILE 1 OF 2
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: After John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crash last July, it was
reported that tests would be done on the remains of the aircraft to
determine what happened, and those findings would be announced in
six months. Has that information been released yet?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. A spokesman at the National Transportation Safety Board
in Washington said he wasn't sure when a final report would be
available, but he hoped it would be within the next several months.
Authorities previously acknowledged that they may never find the
reason for the crash that killed Kennedy, his wife, and her sister.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the NTSB Web site _
www.ntsb.gov/aviation/NYC/99A178.htm _ has a preliminary report. It
says the aircraft's engine, propellor hub and blades, entire tail
section, entire span of both main wings' spars, 75 percent of the
fuselage/cabin area, 80 percent of the left wing structure, and 60
percent of the right wing structure were recovered from a depth of
116 feet at the Atlantic crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of
an in-flight structural failure or fire, the report shows. It goes
on to say that the pilot _ never identified by name _ received his
private pilot certificate in April 1998, and did not possess an
instrument rating.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The obituary for former Speaker of the House Carl Albert said
he was next in line to the presidency twice. One time would have
been in 1974, when Gerald Ford took over from Richard Nixon, before
Nelson Rockefeller was named vice president. When was the other
time?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in the previous year, 1973, when Vice President Spiro
Agnew resigned in Albert's office after pleading no contest to
accusations that he took kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Sen. John McCain had been married more than one
time. Is that true? Has there ever been a U.S. president who has
been divorced?
</P>
<P>
   A: McCain and his first wife, Carol, were divorced in 1980.
Later that same year, he married Cindy Hensley.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan was divorced long before he got to the White
House. He and Jane Wyman were married Jan. 24, 1940; they were
divorced in 1948. Reagan married Nancy Davis in 1952. He was
elected president in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the new Delaware commemorative quarter, who is depicted on
horseback?
</P>
<P>
   A: The figure is Caesar Rodney. He is so honored for his
historic 80-mile horseback ride on July 1-2, 1776. He made it to a
meeting of the Continental Congress just in time to cast his vote,
breaking a tie between Delaware's delegates in favor of the
Declaration of Independence. The ride made him the hero of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that someone bought O.J. Simpson's house and tore it
down. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As reported in 1998, the 6,000-square-foot home, at 360
N. Rockingham Ave. in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, was
sold in foreclosure and torn down by the buyer, Kenneth Abdalla,
president of the L.A.-based Jerry's Famous Deli chain and co-owner
of the investment firm Waterton Management.
</P>
<P>
   Abdalla and his wife, Kay Stoneburner, were said to be
unimpressed by the 57-year-old Tudor-style mansion, but wanted the
prime corner lot in Brentwood. According to property records, they
paid $3.95 million for the house. If any replacement house has been
built on the lot, nothing has been reported about it.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, meanwhile, is said to be renting a home in Pacific
Palisades, a Los Angeles suburb, for $6,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can O.J. Simpson afford $6,000 a month rent on that house
in Pacific Palisades, a Los Angeles suburb?
</P>
<P>
   A: Simpson lives on a hefty pension plan he set up when he was
earning millions from endorsements, commercials and movies he made
before the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and
Ronald Goldman. The pension is said to be valued at $4 million,
from which Simpson reportedly is drawing $25,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Judgments against Simpson amounting to $33.5 million were won in
1997 in civil court by the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Goldman. Afterward, Simpson successfully challenged paying the
award, and the verdict at last report was still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Such pensions as Simpson's are exempt from civil court
judgments, although any new money he might earn could be seized by
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between dew point and humidity? The TV
forecasters always mention both, but never explain.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Weather Almanac explains that dew point is the
temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated by the
water vapor already present in the air. When related to air
temperature, it reveals qualitatively how close the air is to
saturation.
</P>
<P>
   Relative humidity expresses the degree of saturation and is
expressed routinely as a percentage. Air with 100 percent relative
humidity is saturated; less than 100 percent is unsaturated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently answered a question from a reader asking if the
cost of nonwinning lottery tickets could be claimed as a deduction
on income taxes to offset any lottery winnings in that same year. I
believe the IRS spokesman you quoted may have given you some
erroneous information. Can you check into it again?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right. The facts are that while you can deduct
gambling losses on Schedule A (1040) in the year they're incurred,
you cannot deduct losses that are more than your winnings. The
deductions are not subject to the 2 percent limitation, as the
spokesman previously said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that an explanation of the treatment of gambling losses
can be found on page A-6 of the IRS Form 1040 Forms and Instruction
Booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Commentators use the term ``lame duck'' when referring to
President Clinton. I know what it means, but what is the origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one is sure how the term originated, but several resources
say it has been in use as far back as the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says it seems
to have come from the old hunter's maxim, ``Never waste powder on a
dead duck.'' The political context is traced to the 1930s and the
adoption in 1933 of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. Before
that amendment was adopted, any president or member of Congress who
was defeated in November elections still could hold office until
the following March 4. These elected officials were called ``lame
ducks'' because they were mostly ineffectual, although they could
help pass legislation embarrassing to an incoming administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins offers
a different explanation, saying the term may have been suggested by
an identical British expression which meant a person who has lost
all his money, or who has been financially crippled on the stock
exchange. But that doesn't clarify how the word ``duck'' figures
into it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A couple of years ago, Roberto Alomar of the Baltimore
Orioles spit in an umpire's face. How was he disciplined?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alomar, who spit in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck on
Sept. 27, 1996, in Toronto, was suspended by the American League
for five games at the beginning of the 1997 season. He had done the
deed after being ejected for arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Orioles owner Peter Angelos said he wanted
Hirschbeck to apologize to Alomar for swearing at the second
baseman, an act he said prompted the spitting incident. Hirschbeck
responded by saying he wouldn't apologize, because he was not to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, 1997, the first time Alomar and Hirschbeck were on
the same field after the incident, Alomar veered out of his way
into short right field to shake hands and say a few words to
Hirschbeck before taking his position at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My grandmother insists that John F. Kennedy was married to
someone else before he married Jackie. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recurring rumors of a previous marriage appear to have been
sparked in the '60s by writers Joan and Clay Blair Jr., whose book
``Search for JFK'' had a chapter titled ``A Secret Marriage?'' Note
the question mark, which tells you something. It speculated about
an earlier wedding, naming Durie Defloge as the purported wife. But
a researcher at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston
it's a ``falsehood.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the formula for converting Fahrenheit temperatures to
Celsius?
</P>
<P>
   A: Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature; divide the
answer by 9; and multiply that number by 5. For example, let's
change 95 degrees F to Celsius. 95 minus 32 is 63. Divide 63 by 9,
and you get 7. Multiply 7 by 5 and you get 35 (degrees Celsius).
</P>
<P>
   To convert Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit, begin by
multiplying the Celsius temperature by 9. Divide the answer by 5.
Now add 32. You've got it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is The Weather Channel headquarters situated? Are
studio tours offered to the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: The headquarters is just outside Atlanta. Tours aren't
available to the public, but Weather Channel spokeswoman Kathy Lane
said that's a popular request, ``and we're going to have to
consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Channel is a national network with frequent
forecasts tailored to wherever a viewer might be. It uses a
WeatherSTAR (Weather Satellite Transponder Addressible Receiver) in
each cable system to deliver such local forecasts. So a viewer in
Austin, Texas, might see images from the campus at the University
of Texas, while at the same time a viewer in New York is seeing
something from LaGuardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During the Super Bowl, one of the Tennessee players was
injured and the game was delayed for about 10 minutes for him to be
brought to the point where he could be carried off the field. What
is his status? Nothing has been reported since the game.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a scary moment, but as it turns out, Titans safety
Blaine Bishop wasn't seriously injured. ``He is fine and just has a
sore neck,'' said team spokesman Tony Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get a copy of the ``Green Scissors Report,'' which
deals with cuts in spending that would benefit environmental
programs?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to an annual report put out by Friends of
the Earth. Check its Web site _ www.foe.org/ _ for information. Or
order by credit card from 1-877-843-8687, extension 210. Or send a
check for $15 to Friends of the Earth, 1025 Vermont Ave. NW, 3rd
Floor, Washington, DC 20005. There's no additional fee for shipping
and handling.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: As a youngster growing up in the North and attending an
all-black school, we were taught the song/poem ``Lift Every Voice
and Sing.'' At the time, it was referred to as the Negro national
anthem. Can you print the words, so I can share this inspiration
with my grandchildren and others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lift every voice and sing, till earth and heaven ring,/ Ring
with the harmonies of liberty; Let our rejoicing rise/ High as the
listening skies,/ Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,/
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;/
facing the rising sun of our new day begun,/ let us march on till
victory is won.
</P>
<P>
   Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod,/ felt in the
days when hope unborn had died; yet with a steady beat,/ have not
our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
</P>
<P>
   We have come over a way that with tears have been watered,/ We
have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,/
out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last/ where the
white gleam of our bright star is cast.
</P>
<P>
   God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,/ thou who hast
brought us thus far on the way;/ thou who hast by thy might led us
into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray.
</P>
<P>
   Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met
thee;/ lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget
thee,/ shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand, true to our
God, true to our native land.
</P>
<P>
   The words to ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' were written by James
Weldon Johnson; the music by J. Rosamond Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton has just been nominated for the Nobel Peace
Prize. Who nominated him? Who nominates anyone for this prize?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Associated Press reports that Clinton was nominated by
two Norwegian parliamentarians, Vidar Kleppe and Steinar Bastesen.
``Clinton is president of the world's most powerful nation and
throughout his presidential term has been a guarantor and friend of
peace,'' a news release from the legislators said. The two added
that Clinton was a key player in ending war and conflicts in the
former Yugoslavia, and he defends human rights worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive five-member Nobel Peace Committee never releases
the names of candidates. However, those making nominations often
announce their pick. The awards committee is flooded each year by
nominations, many of them invalid because they were made by people
without nominating rights. Those with nominating rights include
members of national legislatures and governments, past laureates,
some university professors and peace groups, and awards committee
members.
</P>
<P>
   American peace envoy George Mitchell also was nominated for this
year's prize. The Norwegian news agency NTB said Mitchell was
nominated for his peace efforts in Northern Ireland by an unnamed
American congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To whom can we complain about the severity of the treatment
of Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker? Whoever took that action
needs to know that Rocker's fans support him.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rocker's $20,000 fine and 24-game suspension, along with his
banishment from spring training with his teammates, were handed
down by Major League Baseball. Comments can be addressed to: Office
of the Commissioner of Baseball, 245 Park Ave., 31st floor, New
York, NY 10167. If you want to attach some names, Bud Selig is the
commissioner and Paul Beeston is president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was mentioned on the TV show ``Greed'' that Miss Jane
Pittman was a fictional character. I thought she was a real person.
Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The title character in the book (and subsequent movie) ``The
Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman'' is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do winter cold spells help lower the bug population in the
summer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Periods of cold weather do reduce populations of some
insects, but this reduction is usually short-term, said University
of Georgia entomologist Beverly Sparks. Populations of soft-bodied
insects, such as aphids, flea larvae and caterpillars, often are
reduced by freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   However, most insects have a mechanism to survive cold weather.
Some escape these temperatures by moving deeper into the soil or
inside structures, which offer protection. Others survive the
freezing temperatures in a stage of their growth called the egg or
pupal stage; it isn't susceptible to low temperatures, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   So the bad news (for humans) is that while cold weather does
have an effect on insect populations, the reduction most likely
will go unnoticed by the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Favorable reviews have appeared recently in national
magazines and newspapers about ``My Dog Skip,'' a movie rated PG
and highly recommended for families. I can't find it listed at any
theater near me. With so few movies suitable for children, why is
it not being shown everywhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``My Dog Skip'' opened first in New York and Los Angeles.
Look for it to open in your city in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Willie Morris' memoir of his childhood, ``My Dog Skip''
is about the relationship of a young boy with his Jack Russell
terrier in Mississippi in 1942. It features Frankie Muniz, Diane
Lane, Luke Wilson and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a TV reporter say consumers can kill E. coli bacteria
in meat if it is properly cooked or frozen. I had not heard before
that freezing meat would kill the bacteria. Can you confirm this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not true, said Chris Rosenbloom, a professor in the
nutrition department at Georgia State University and a
representative of the American Dietetic Association. Freezing meat
is totally ineffective in this regard. The best way to kill E. coli
is to cook the meat to a proper temperature, using a meat
thermometer, Rosenbloom said. For example, hamburgers should be
cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit;
roasts, anywhere from 145 to 170, depending on the degree of
doneness preferred; and poultry, such as chicken breast or turkey
breast, 170.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Census Bureau is said to be hiring more than 500,000
temporary workers for the 2000 census. Where can one apply for such
a job?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census 2000 Jobs Line number is 1-888-325-7733. It will
direct callers to the office handling their location.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We were discussing the term ``yellow dog Democrat,'' which is
used to describe certain Southern Democrats. What is the origin and
meaning?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's used to describe a ``straight ticket man,'' one who
would vote even for a yellow dog if the dog were a Democrat. In
general, it's a compliment for an unswerving party loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to date to 1928, when Sen. Tom Heflin of Alabama
refused to support fellow Democrat Al Smith and bolted to Herbert
Hoover. When that happened, other Alabama voters who disagreed with
Heflin popularized the line, ``I'd vote for a yellow dog if he ran
on the Democratic ticket.'' The expression isn't heard much outside
the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Charles Brewer, Internet service provider
MindSpring's founder, president and CEO, mentioned his ``core
values,'' one of them being frugal. What are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are 10: (1) We respect the individual, and believe that
individuals who are treated with respect and given responsibility
respond by giving their best. (2) We require complete honesty and
integrity in everything we do. (3) We make commitments with care,
and then live up to them. In all things, we do what we say we are
going to do. (4) Work is an important part of life, and it should
be fun. Being a good businessperson does not mean being stuffy and
boring. (5) We love to compete, and we believe that competition
brings out the best in us. (6) We are frugal. We guard and conserve
the company's resources with at least the same vigilance that we
would use to guard and conserve our own personal resources. (7) We
insist on giving our best effort in everything we undertake.
Furthermore, we see a huge difference between ``good mistakes''
(best effort, bad result) and ``bad mistakes'' (sloppiness or lack
of effort). (8) Clarity in understanding our mission, our goals,
and what we expect from each other is critical to our success. (9)
We are believers in the Golden Rule. In all our dealings we will
strive to be friendly and courteous, as well as fair and
compassionate. (10) We feel a sense of urgency on any matters
related to our customers. We own problems and we are always
responsive. We are customer-driven.
</P>
<P>
   The core values and beliefs have been ``central to our
success,'' said MindSpring spokeswoman Tish Spearman. They will
continue to be the guiding principles of the new company known as
EarthLink Inc., she added. MindSpring Enterprises and EarthLink
Network finalized their merger Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months back, Q&AMP;A mentioned the names of several famous
actors, including Harold Lloyd. When I was in my teens, before
``talkies,'' I thought he was very funny. I never saw or heard of
him since the late '20s. What became of him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lloyd, who was born in 1893 or 1894 (sources differ), died of
cancer in 1971. He had a multifaceted career as a stage and movie
actor, screenwriter, and film director.
</P>
<P>
   He entered films in 1912 and during his career had an enormous
body of film work, ranging from ``From Italy's Shore'' in 1914 to
``Funny Side of Life'' in 1964. He was in at least 100 one-reel
shorts in which he portrayed Lonesome Luke. As reported in Current
Biography, Lloyd said all these one-reelers ended in a Keystone
Cops-style huge chase in which he was pursued by dogs, sheriffs,
angry housewives, wild bulls, locomotives and legions of police.
</P>
<P>
   He was married to actress Mildred Davis, who died in 1969. He
was the brother of actor Gaylord E. Lloyd, who died in 1943, and
the father of Harold Lloyd Jr., who also was an actor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Lloyd Sr. received a special Academy Award as ``Master
Comedian and Good Citizen.''

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: After John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane crash last July, it was
reported that tests would be done on the remains of the aircraft to
determine what happened, and those findings would be announced in
six months. Has that information been released yet?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. A spokesman at the National Transportation Safety Board
in Washington said he wasn't sure when a final report would be
available, but he hoped it would be within the next several months.
Authorities previously acknowledged that they may never find the
reason for the crash that killed Kennedy, his wife, and her sister.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the NTSB Web site _
www.ntsb.gov/aviation/NYC/99A178.htm _ has a preliminary report. It
says the aircraft's engine, propellor hub and blades, entire tail
section, entire span of both main wings' spars, 75 percent of the
fuselage/cabin area, 80 percent of the left wing structure, and 60
percent of the right wing structure were recovered from a depth of
116 feet at the Atlantic crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of
an in-flight structural failure or fire, the report shows. It goes
on to say that the pilot _ never identified by name _ received his
private pilot certificate in April 1998, and did not possess an
instrument rating.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The obituary for former Speaker of the House Carl Albert said
he was next in line to the presidency twice. One time would have
been in 1974, when Gerald Ford took over from Richard Nixon, before
Nelson Rockefeller was named vice president. When was the other
time?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in the previous year, 1973, when Vice President Spiro
Agnew resigned in Albert's office after pleading no contest to
accusations that he took kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Sen. John McCain had been married more than one
time. Is that true? Has there ever been a U.S. president who has
been divorced?
</P>
<P>
   A: McCain and his first wife, Carol, were divorced in 1980.
Later that same year, he married Cindy Hensley.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan was divorced long before he got to the White
House. He and Jane Wyman were married Jan. 24, 1940; they were
divorced in 1948. Reagan married Nancy Davis in 1952. He was
elected president in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the new Delaware commemorative quarter, who is depicted on
horseback?
</P>
<P>
   A: The figure is Caesar Rodney. He is so honored for his
historic 80-mile horseback ride on July 1-2, 1776. He made it to a
meeting of the Continental Congress just in time to cast his vote,
breaking a tie between Delaware's delegates in favor of the
Declaration of Independence. The ride made him the hero of
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that someone bought O.J. Simpson's house and tore it
down. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. As reported in 1998, the 6,000-square-foot home, at 360
N. Rockingham Ave. in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles, was
sold in foreclosure and torn down by the buyer, Kenneth Abdalla,
president of the L.A.-based Jerry's Famous Deli chain and co-owner
of the investment firm Waterton Management.
</P>
<P>
   Abdalla and his wife, Kay Stoneburner, were said to be
unimpressed by the 57-year-old Tudor-style mansion, but wanted the
prime corner lot in Brentwood. According to property records, they
paid $3.95 million for the house. If any replacement house has been
built on the lot, nothing has been reported about it.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, meanwhile, is said to be renting a home in Pacific
Palisades, a Los Angeles suburb, for $6,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can O.J. Simpson afford $6,000 a month rent on that house
in Pacific Palisades, a Los Angeles suburb?
</P>
<P>
   A: Simpson lives on a hefty pension plan he set up when he was
earning millions from endorsements, commercials and movies he made
before the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and
Ronald Goldman. The pension is said to be valued at $4 million,
from which Simpson reportedly is drawing $25,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Judgments against Simpson amounting to $33.5 million were won in
1997 in civil court by the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and
Goldman. Afterward, Simpson successfully challenged paying the
award, and the verdict at last report was still on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Such pensions as Simpson's are exempt from civil court
judgments, although any new money he might earn could be seized by
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between dew point and humidity? The TV
forecasters always mention both, but never explain.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Weather Almanac explains that dew point is the
temperature to which air must be cooled to become saturated by the
water vapor already present in the air. When related to air
temperature, it reveals qualitatively how close the air is to
saturation.
</P>
<P>
   Relative humidity expresses the degree of saturation and is
expressed routinely as a percentage. Air with 100 percent relative
humidity is saturated; less than 100 percent is unsaturated.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently answered a question from a reader asking if the
cost of nonwinning lottery tickets could be claimed as a deduction
on income taxes to offset any lottery winnings in that same year. I
believe the IRS spokesman you quoted may have given you some
erroneous information. Can you check into it again?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right. The facts are that while you can deduct
gambling losses on Schedule A (1040) in the year they're incurred,
you cannot deduct losses that are more than your winnings. The
deductions are not subject to the 2 percent limitation, as the
spokesman previously said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that an explanation of the treatment of gambling losses
can be found on page A-6 of the IRS Form 1040 Forms and Instruction
Booklet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Commentators use the term ``lame duck'' when referring to
President Clinton. I know what it means, but what is the origin?
</P>
<P>
   A: No one is sure how the term originated, but several resources
say it has been in use as far back as the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says it seems
to have come from the old hunter's maxim, ``Never waste powder on a
dead duck.'' The political context is traced to the 1930s and the
adoption in 1933 of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. Before
that amendment was adopted, any president or member of Congress who
was defeated in November elections still could hold office until
the following March 4. These elected officials were called ``lame
ducks'' because they were mostly ineffectual, although they could
help pass legislation embarrassing to an incoming administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins offers
a different explanation, saying the term may have been suggested by
an identical British expression which meant a person who has lost
all his money, or who has been financially crippled on the stock
exchange. But that doesn't clarify how the word ``duck'' figures
into it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A couple of years ago, Roberto Alomar of the Baltimore
Orioles spit in an umpire's face. How was he disciplined?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alomar, who spit in the face of umpire John Hirschbeck on
Sept. 27, 1996, in Toronto, was suspended by the American League
for five games at the beginning of the 1997 season. He had done the
deed after being ejected for arguing a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Orioles owner Peter Angelos said he wanted
Hirschbeck to apologize to Alomar for swearing at the second
baseman, an act he said prompted the spitting incident. Hirschbeck
responded by saying he wouldn't apologize, because he was not to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, 1997, the first time Alomar and Hirschbeck were on
the same field after the incident, Alomar veered out of his way
into short right field to shake hands and say a few words to
Hirschbeck before taking his position at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My grandmother insists that John F. Kennedy was married to
someone else before he married Jackie. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Recurring rumors of a previous marriage appear to have been
sparked in the '60s by writers Joan and Clay Blair Jr., whose book
``Search for JFK'' had a chapter titled ``A Secret Marriage?'' Note
the question mark, which tells you something. It speculated about
an earlier wedding, naming Durie Defloge as the purported wife. But
a researcher at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston
it's a ``falsehood.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the formula for converting Fahrenheit temperatures to
Celsius?
</P>
<P>
   A: Subtract 32 from the Fahrenheit temperature; divide the
answer by 9; and multiply that number by 5. For example, let's
change 95 degrees F to Celsius. 95 minus 32 is 63. Divide 63 by 9,
and you get 7. Multiply 7 by 5 and you get 35 (degrees Celsius).
</P>

   Q: Where is The Weather Channel headquarters situated? Are
studio tours offered to the public?
</P>
<P>
   A: The headquarters is just outside Atlanta. Tours aren't
available to the public, but Weather Channel spokeswoman Kathy Lane
said that's a popular request, ``and we're going to have to
consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Weather Channel is a national network with frequent
forecasts tailored to wherever a viewer might be. It uses a
WeatherSTAR (Weather Satellite Transponder Addressible Receiver) in
each cable system to deliver such local forecasts. So a viewer in
Austin, Texas, might see images from the campus at the University
of Texas, while at the same time a viewer in New York is seeing
something from LaGuardia Airport.

   Q: During the Super Bowl, one of the Tennessee players was
injured and the game was delayed for about 10 minutes for him to be
brought to the point where he could be carried off the field. What
is his status? Nothing has been reported since the game.
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a scary moment, but as it turns out, Titans safety
Blaine Bishop wasn't seriously injured. ``He is fine and just has a
sore neck,'' said team spokesman Tony Wiley.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I get a copy of the ``Green Scissors Report,'' which
deals with cuts in spending that would benefit environmental
programs?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to an annual report put out by Friends of
the Earth. Check its Web site _ www.foe.org/ _ for information. Or
order by credit card from 1-877-843-8687, extension 210. Or send a
check for $15 to Friends of the Earth, 1025 Vermont Ave. NW, 3rd
Floor, Washington, DC 20005. There's no additional fee for shipping
and handling.

&HT;     STUDY RAISES NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT HORMONE SUPPLEMENT FOR
ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A study released Wednesday showing that
androstenedione can raise testosterone levels in men may prompt
Major League Baseball to reconsider its acceptance of the
supplement used by Mark McGwire during his record-breaking home run
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the hormone soared 1,000 percent in 1998 after McGwire
acknowledged taking it as part of his training regimen. He says he
no longer uses it.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is already banned by the National Football
League, the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the
International Olympic Committee, but not by baseball. Until
McGwire's revelation spurred sales, there had been very little
research into the over-the-counter supplement.
</P>
<P>
   Now studies launched in the midst of all the publicity in 1998
are beginning to yield results. The latest, paid for by Major
League Baseball and the players' union, was published Wednesday in
the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In it, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital said they
found higher levels of testosterone among 14 young men who took 300
mg of androstenedione once a day. No such results were found in
another group that took 100 mg.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern, however, is that both groups saw a significant
rise in the levels of estrogen, the female sex hormone. Other
recent studies showed no effect on testosterone in young men, but
have demonstrated a rise in estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent increase in estrogen levels has raised concerns
that young male athletes taking it hoping to build muscle are
ending up with a very unwanted side effect: male breasts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some plastic surgeons have reported seeing young men
coming in wanting breast reduction surgery following use of the
supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ``More patients are acknowledging taking it,'' said Dr. Josh
Korman, a plastic surgeon who practices in San Francisco. ``I work
out a lot and just talking to people in the gym, it's a very common
component'' of people's training regimens.
</P>
<P>
   Korman said it is often hard to know for sure if a patient with
enlarged breasts took androstenedione or illegal anabolic steroids,
or both, because many patients don't want to reveal that they are
using an outlawed substance. But at least one patient, an
18-year-old surfer from Santa Cruz, had no other risk factors than
androstenedione use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, two makers of androstenedione settled a charge
filed by the Federal Trade Commission by agreeing to disclose
potential health risks on the labels and in advertisements. Those
include breast enlargement, testicle shrinkage and infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Manfred, executive vice president of labor and human
resources for the baseball owners, said Tuesday there are no
immediate plans for a policy change. ``We've had the results for a
very short period of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Players' union official Gene Orza had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is a steroid hormone produced by both men and
women which is converted into testosterone and estrogen. It is
marketed to athletes and bodybuilders as a way to build muscle.
</P>
<P>
   But the two studies to date on its effects have failed to show
any positive results. One study, published last month, found no
differences in the synthesis of muscle protein in young men who
took it.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, under review at the Archives of Internal
Medicine, gave androstenedione to men aged 35 to 65 for 12 weeks.
It found no changes in body composition, mood or sexual function,
but did find that it led to higher cholesterol levels and more
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not find a single positive result,'' said Conrad
Earnest, an exercise physiologist with IMAGINutrition, an
California company that helps supplement makers do research on
their products.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    EDITORS: THIS IS FILE 2 OF 2
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: As a youngster growing up in the North and attending an
all-black school, we were taught the song/poem ``Lift Every Voice
and Sing.'' At the time, it was referred to as the Negro national
anthem. Can you print the words, so I can share this inspiration
with my grandchildren and others?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lift every voice and sing, till earth and heaven ring,/ Ring
with the harmonies of liberty; Let our rejoicing rise/ High as the
listening skies,/ Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
</P>
<P>
   Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,/
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us;/
facing the rising sun of our new day begun,/ let us march on till
victory is won.
</P>
<P>
   Stony the road we trod, bitter the chastening rod,/ felt in the
days when hope unborn had died; yet with a steady beat,/ have not
our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
</P>
<P>
   We have come over a way that with tears have been watered,/ We
have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,/
out from the gloomy past, till now we stand at last/ where the
white gleam of our bright star is cast.
</P>
<P>
   God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,/ thou who hast
brought us thus far on the way;/ thou who hast by thy might led us
into the light, keep us forever in the path, we pray.
</P>
<P>
   Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met
thee;/ lest our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget
thee,/ shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand, true to our
God, true to our native land.
</P>
<P>
   The words to ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' were written by James
Weldon Johnson; the music by J. Rosamond Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton has just been nominated for the Nobel Peace
Prize. Who nominated him? Who nominates anyone for this prize?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Associated Press reports that Clinton was nominated by
two Norwegian parliamentarians, Vidar Kleppe and Steinar Bastesen.
``Clinton is president of the world's most powerful nation and
throughout his presidential term has been a guarantor and friend of
peace,'' a news release from the legislators said. The two added
that Clinton was a key player in ending war and conflicts in the
former Yugoslavia, and he defends human rights worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive five-member Nobel Peace Committee never releases
the names of candidates. However, those making nominations often
announce their pick. The awards committee is flooded each year by
nominations, many of them invalid because they were made by people
without nominating rights. Those with nominating rights include
members of national legislatures and governments, past laureates,
some university professors and peace groups, and awards committee
members.
</P>
<P>
   American peace envoy George Mitchell also was nominated for this
year's prize. The Norwegian news agency NTB said Mitchell was
nominated for his peace efforts in Northern Ireland by an unnamed
American congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: To whom can we complain about the severity of the treatment
of Atlanta Braves reliever John Rocker? Whoever took that action
needs to know that Rocker's fans support him.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rocker's $20,000 fine and 24-game suspension, along with his
banishment from spring training with his teammates, were handed
down by Major League Baseball. Comments can be addressed to: Office
of the Commissioner of Baseball, 245 Park Ave., 31st floor, New
York, NY 10167. If you want to attach some names, Bud Selig is the
commissioner and Paul Beeston is president and chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was mentioned on the TV show ``Greed'' that Miss Jane
Pittman was a fictional character. I thought she was a real person.
Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: The title character in the book (and subsequent movie) ``The
Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman'' is fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do winter cold spells help lower the bug population in the
summer?
</P>
<P>
   A: Periods of cold weather do reduce populations of some
insects, but this reduction is usually short-term, said University
of Georgia entomologist Beverly Sparks. Populations of soft-bodied
insects, such as aphids, flea larvae and caterpillars, often are
reduced by freezing temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   However, most insects have a mechanism to survive cold weather.
Some escape these temperatures by moving deeper into the soil or
inside structures, which offer protection. Others survive the
freezing temperatures in a stage of their growth called the egg or
pupal stage; it isn't susceptible to low temperatures, Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   So the bad news (for humans) is that while cold weather does
have an effect on insect populations, the reduction most likely
will go unnoticed by the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Favorable reviews have appeared recently in national
magazines and newspapers about ``My Dog Skip,'' a movie rated PG
and highly recommended for families. I can't find it listed at any
theater near me. With so few movies suitable for children, why is
it not being shown everywhere?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``My Dog Skip'' opened first in New York and Los Angeles.
Look for it to open in your city in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Willie Morris' memoir of his childhood, ``My Dog Skip''
is about the relationship of a young boy with his Jack Russell
terrier in Mississippi in 1942. It features Frankie Muniz, Diane
Lane, Luke Wilson and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a TV reporter say consumers can kill E. coli bacteria
in meat if it is properly cooked or frozen. I had not heard before
that freezing meat would kill the bacteria. Can you confirm this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not true, said Chris Rosenbloom, a professor in the
nutrition department at Georgia State University and a
representative of the American Dietetic Association. Freezing meat
is totally ineffective in this regard. The best way to kill E. coli
is to cook the meat to a proper temperature, using a meat
thermometer, Rosenbloom said. For example, hamburgers should be
cooked to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit;
roasts, anywhere from 145 to 170, depending on the degree of
doneness preferred; and poultry, such as chicken breast or turkey
breast, 170.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Census Bureau is said to be hiring more than 500,000
temporary workers for the 2000 census. Where can one apply for such
a job?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census 2000 Jobs Line number is 1-888-325-7733. It will
direct callers to the office handling their location.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We were discussing the term ``yellow dog Democrat,'' which is
used to describe certain Southern Democrats. What is the origin and
meaning?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's used to describe a ``straight ticket man,'' one who
would vote even for a yellow dog if the dog were a Democrat. In
general, it's a compliment for an unswerving party loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to date to 1928, when Sen. Tom Heflin of Alabama
refused to support fellow Democrat Al Smith and bolted to Herbert
Hoover. When that happened, other Alabama voters who disagreed with
Heflin popularized the line, ``I'd vote for a yellow dog if he ran
on the Democratic ticket.'' The expression isn't heard much outside
the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about Charles Brewer, Internet service provider
MindSpring's founder, president and CEO, mentioned his ``core
values,'' one of them being frugal. What are the others?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are 10: (1) We respect the individual, and believe that
individuals who are treated with respect and given responsibility
respond by giving their best. (2) We require complete honesty and
integrity in everything we do. (3) We make commitments with care,
and then live up to them. In all things, we do what we say we are
going to do. (4) Work is an important part of life, and it should
be fun. Being a good businessperson does not mean being stuffy and
boring. (5) We love to compete, and we believe that competition
brings out the best in us. (6) We are frugal. We guard and conserve
the company's resources with at least the same vigilance that we
would use to guard and conserve our own personal resources. (7) We
insist on giving our best effort in everything we undertake.
Furthermore, we see a huge difference between ``good mistakes''
(best effort, bad result) and ``bad mistakes'' (sloppiness or lack
of effort). (8) Clarity in understanding our mission, our goals,
and what we expect from each other is critical to our success. (9)
We are believers in the Golden Rule. In all our dealings we will
strive to be friendly and courteous, as well as fair and
compassionate. (10) We feel a sense of urgency on any matters
related to our customers. We own problems and we are always
responsive. We are customer-driven.
</P>
<P>
   The core values and beliefs have been ``central to our
success,'' said MindSpring spokeswoman Tish Spearman. They will
continue to be the guiding principles of the new company known as
EarthLink Inc., she added. MindSpring Enterprises and EarthLink
Network finalized their merger Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some months back, Q&AMP;A mentioned the names of several famous
actors, including Harold Lloyd. When I was in my teens, before
``talkies,'' I thought he was very funny. I never saw or heard of
him since the late '20s. What became of him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Lloyd, who was born in 1893 or 1894 (sources differ), died of
cancer in 1971. He had a multifaceted career as a stage and movie
actor, screenwriter, and film director.
</P>
<P>
   He entered films in 1912 and during his career had an enormous
body of film work, ranging from ``From Italy's Shore'' in 1914 to
``Funny Side of Life'' in 1964. He was in at least 100 one-reel
shorts in which he portrayed Lonesome Luke. As reported in Current
Biography, Lloyd said all these one-reelers ended in a Keystone
Cops-style huge chase in which he was pursued by dogs, sheriffs,
angry housewives, wild bulls, locomotives and legions of police.
</P>
<P>
   He was married to actress Mildred Davis, who died in 1969. He
was the brother of actor Gaylord E. Lloyd, who died in 1943, and
the father of Harold Lloyd Jr., who also was an actor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Lloyd Sr. received a special Academy Award as ``Master
Comedian and Good Citizen.''

   PRETZELS : Lively and energetic, those who prefer pretzels crave
novelty and easily become bored by the usual routine. They are
excited by the challenge _ whether it be at work, sports or home.
They thrive in the world of abstract concepts and tend to lose
interest in the mundane day-to-day world. There is a tendency to
initiate new projects without having completed the last, and to
overcommit to work or family chores.
</P>
<P>
   Happy in the role as a ``flirt,'' pretzel lovers are comfortable
dressed in an attractive manner. . . . The pretzel lover will be on
top of the latest craze _ having accumulated a herd of ``Beanie
Babies,'' they are ready to conquer the next fad.
</P>
<P>
   Pretzel lovers make decisions based on intuition and emotion. At
times, they are overly trusting, especially in romantic
relationships. One pretzel lover is a welcome addition to any
grouping _ they are ``the life of the party, lively, enthusiastic
and fun to be with!''
</P>
<P>
   SNACK CRACKERS : Contemplative, thoughtful . . . rather than
intuitively oriented, decisions are reasoned and not based on
emotions. Shy and introspective, (snack cracker eaters) avoid
confrontation so as not to hurt the feelings of others. They have
many diverse interests and are involved in a multitude of projects
simultaneously, all competing for their time and attention. They
value their private time and are most creative when allowed to be
alone, free from their daily responsibilities and interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Those who prefer crackers may easily find themselves
romantically involved in an Internet relationship.
</P>

   PRETZELS : Lively and energetic, those who prefer pretzels crave
novelty and easily become bored by the usual routine. They are
excited by the challenge _ whether it be at work, sports or home.
They thrive in the world of abstract concepts and tend to lose
interest in the mundane day-to-day world. There is a tendency to
initiate new projects without having completed the last, and to
overcommit to work or family chores.
</P>
<P>
   Happy in the role as a ``flirt,'' pretzel lovers are comfortable
dressed in an attractive manner. . . . The pretzel lover will be on
top of the latest craze _ having accumulated a herd of ``Beanie
Babies,'' they are ready to conquer the next fad.
</P>
<P>
   Pretzel lovers make decisions based on intuition and emotion. At
times, they are overly trusting, especially in romantic
relationships. One pretzel lover is a welcome addition to any
grouping _ they are ``the life of the party, lively, enthusiastic
and fun to be with!''
</P>
<P>
   SNACK CRACKERS : Contemplative, thoughtful . . . rather than
intuitively oriented, decisions are reasoned and not based on
emotions. Shy and introspective, (snack cracker eaters) avoid
confrontation so as not to hurt the feelings of others. They have
many diverse interests and are involved in a multitude of projects
simultaneously, all competing for their time and attention. They
value their private time and are most creative when allowed to be
alone, free from their daily responsibilities and interruptions.

   STAGING-HOUSES (San Francisco) _ There are times _ confronting a
sherbet-green entryway in a house for sale, or a globe light
fixture from the ``Brady Bunch'' era _ when Ken Fulk thinks of
himself as a pair of glasses, correcting people's vision. ``You
don't want to walk into a house and say, `Oh my god, the carpet,'''
said Fulk, 34, one of a growing band of decorators specializing in
the fine art of ``staging,'' or professionally propping a house for
sale, a phenomenon that has reached epic proportions. ``My job is
to help create a frenzy.'' By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   LATZ-DESIGN (Undated) _ Peter Latz grew up playing in the bombed
ruins and abandoned quarries of Germany's industrial Ruhr district
after World War II. ``I have no trouble with rubble,'' he likes to
say. So it makes perfect sense that 500 acres of old blast
furnaces, elevated rails, slag heaps and a river that was nothing
but a waste water ditch would become his master work. This vast
landscape park, Duisburg Nord, is at the northern tip of Emscher
Park, a nice name for the industrial wasteland that stretches 434
miles along the Emscher River. In 1989 this part of the river was
offered up for a competition by the International Building
Exhibition. Latz won the competition for Duisburg Nord, and began a
10-year construction project that will be largely completed this
year. By Ann Raver.

   GREEN-HIGH-RISES (New York) _ In a crowded conference room last
month, Timothy S. Carey, the president of Battery Park City
Authority, talked about plans for a ``green'' apartment building to
developers who usually associate green with the color of money. The
audience was briefly stunned to silence as they heard the
minutely-detailed guidelines for what is being billed as the first
green (that is, environmentally sensitive) residential high-rise in
the country. The impetus for this ambitious, politically correct
plan came from Governor George E. Pataki, who has made
environmental issues a cause and is soon expected to propose a tax
break for builders who use environmentally beneficial technologies.

   ELECTRIC-CARS (Undated) _ ``Where are you planning to drive this
weekend?'' asked the man at the Budget rent-a-car counter in L.A.
He wasn't being nosy. I was about to rent an electric car, which
can cover about 120 miles before its nickel-hydride battery needs
to be recharged. And so I'd have to plan my itinerary around
charging stations _ giant electric outlets scattered in shopping
center parking lots and municipal garages. Death Valley wasn't a
sensible destination. By Fred Bernstein.

&HT;     EXPERT SAYS BROKEN TAIL WING WOULD HAVE DOOMED FLIGHT 261 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RAY DELGADO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If a piece that appears to have broken off
Alaska Airlines Flight 261 just before it plunged into the Pacific
Ocean came from the aircraft's tail wing, there would have been
nothing the pilots could have done to avert disaster, according to
a lawyer who specializes in aviation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A piece of any size or any kind of failure of the tail wing
would result in an immediate pitch down of the airplane from which
you could not recover,'' said Michael Danko, a lawyer in Menlo
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is searching an area near where Flight 261 plunged into
the Pacific Ocean for the piece. The National Transportation Safety
Board announced that radar images of the rapidly descending
jetliner picked up something coming off the plane when it crashed
on Jan. 31, killing the 88 people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The radar signals corresponded to a loud noise heard on the
cockpit voice recorder as the MD-83 began its final dive into the
sea, said James E. Hall, the chairman of the NTSB.
</P>
<P>
   Divers seeking clues to the Alaska Airlines crash have recovered
a damaged jackscrew that moves the aircraft's horizontal
stabilizer, the focus of the investigation, a federal official
said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't known if damage to the screw, recovered Monday night,
occurred during the flight or as a result of the airplane's impact
with the ocean, Hall said Wednesday on NBC's ``Today'' program.
</P>
<P>
   The stabilizer controls the up-and-down motion of the plane
during flight. It is controlled by two motors that turn the
jackscrew, similar to the mechanism that controls garage door
openers.
</P>
<P>
   Danko, who is not involved in the crash investigation, was
careful not to draw conclusions from the information released by
the investigators, but said a mechanical problem with the
40-foot-wide horizontal stabilizer on the plane's tail is typically
manageable unless part of it breaks off.
</P>
<P>
   The horizontal stabilizer, which is the focus of the crash
investigation, plays a critical role in maintaining a plane's trim,
or nose-to-tail balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty likely that there was some kind of
structural failure in part of the tail with the horizontal
stabilizer that made the aircraft uncontrollable,'' said Danko, an
aviation lawyer who has reviewed several air crashes while suing
airlines on behalf of the families of passengers.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigators said last week that one of two loud noises
heard on the cockpit voice recorder came just seconds before the
plane entered into its final plunge.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of Flight 261, which was going to San Francisco from
Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, had received clearance for an emergency
landing at Los Angeles International Airport after reporting that
the plane's horizontal stabilizer was jammed.

CHILI DIPS TASTE TOO GOOD TO PASS UP
</HEADLINE>

favorite recipes)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Louise of Studio City, Calif., misplaced a delicious dip recipe
shared by a reader years ago that was made with a package of cream
cheese, either canned beans, refried beans or canned chili and
maybe some shredded cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Three readers came to the rescue with some great-sounding
variations on the theme, and I can't wait to try them. Alberta
Altman's recipe is from a cream-cheese carton and has become a
family tradition at Christmas. Joanne Moore writes that Hot Chili
and Cream Cheese Dip is easy to make and has become a favorite of
many every time it is served.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce West first sampled the dip at a New Year's Eve party at a
tennis club in Washington. She once served the dish at a high
school swim team party, and the parents ate it in the kitchen
without ever bringing it out to the swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   With these endorsements, the dips will make great party fare.

1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan, combine cream cheese, chiles and chili over
medium heat until cream cheese is melted and ingredients are
blended. Add cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Keep warm. Serve with chips.
</P>

   NOTE: This recipe can be doubled or more.

HOW BARNS GET THEIR COLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Why are all the barns in northern Kentucky painted
black? _ G.A., Alvarado, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ ``This color scheme came from the tradition of using
lamp black and diesel fuel as a cheap wood preservative,'' Heber
Bouland writes in an article reprinted by the Michigan State
University Museum ``Barn Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a departure from the tradition of painting barns red,
which became popular in the northern and eastern United States in
the early 19th century. ``Some barn authorities claim it was the
Scandinavian influence; they used red to simulate brick and
wealth,'' Bouland writes.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Barn Journal,'' a publication dedicated to the
``appreciation and preservation of traditional farm architecture,''
is published on the Web at museum.cl.msu.edu/barn.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I write to Maria Shriver? I want to share my
children's stories with her. _ F.S., Grand Prairie, texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to Shriver or anyone else affiliated with
``Dateline NBC'' in care of NBC News, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Room
510, New York, NY 10112.
</P>
<P>
   Shriver, 44, is a a contributing anchor on ``Dateline'' and
MSNBC correspondent. She also wrote a bestselling children's book
last year, ``What's Heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   Selling more than 300,000 copies, Shriver's book became the
first children's title in 30 years to reach the top 10 of the ``New
York Times'' bestseller list.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I buy pure gum spirits turpentine? _ B.W.,
via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Klean-Strip pure gum spirits turpentine is carried by
Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Builder's Square and Payless Cashways stores,
according to the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The ``professional quality'' solvent is used as a thinner for
oil-based paint and varnishes. You also can find pure gum spirits
turpentine at some art supply stores.  &QL;

   STAGING-HOUSES (San Francisco) _ There are times _ confronting a
sherbet-green entryway in a house for sale, or a globe light
fixture from the ``Brady Bunch'' era _ when Ken Fulk thinks of
himself as a pair of glasses, correcting people's vision. ``You
don't want to walk into a house and say, `Oh my god, the carpet,'''
said Fulk, 34, one of a growing band of decorators specializing in
the fine art of ``staging,'' or professionally propping a house for

   LATZ-DESIGN (Undated) _ Peter Latz grew up playing in the bombed
ruins and abandoned quarries of Germany's industrial Ruhr district
after World War II. ``I have no trouble with rubble,'' he likes to
say. So it makes perfect sense that 500 acres of old blast
furnaces, elevated rails, slag heaps and a river that was nothing
but a waste water ditch would become his master work. This vast
landscape park, Duisburg Nord, is at the northern tip of Emscher
Park, a nice name for the industrial wasteland that stretches 434
miles along the Emscher River. In 1989 this part of the river was
offered up for a competition by the International Building
Exhibition. Latz won the competition for Duisburg Nord, and began a
10-year construction project that will be largely completed this

   GREEN-HIGH-RISES (New York) _ In a crowded conference room last
month, Timothy S. Carey, the president of Battery Park City
Authority, talked about plans for a ``green'' apartment building to
developers who usually associate green with the color of money. The
audience was briefly stunned to silence as they heard the
minutely-detailed guidelines for what is being billed as the first
green (that is, environmentally sensitive) residential high-rise in
the country. The impetus for this ambitious, politically correct
plan came from Governor George E. Pataki, who has made
environmental issues a cause and is soon expected to propose a tax
break for builders who use environmentally beneficial technologies.

   ELECTRIC-CARS (Undated) _ ``Where are you planning to drive this

He wasn't being nosy. I was about to rent an electric car, which
can cover about 120 miles before its nickel-hydride battery needs
to be recharged. And so I'd have to plan my itinerary around

<P>
   In Colonial times, homeowners used shutters to control the
amount of light coming into the house; curtains were less usual.
The standard interior shutter was a paneled piece without openings.
It had a central raised panel, much like a cabinet door, and it
faced the window. The other side of the shutter was flat. By the
second half of the 19th century, louvered or Venetian shutters
became increasingly popular.
</P>
<P>
   Interior shutters are still a practical addition to any window.
Besides controlling light, they can add a decorative accent to a
room. Interior shutters are easy to install and inexpensive. Most
lumberyards and home centers carry ready-made shutters of
unfinished pine in a variety of standard sizes. They are available
with either fixed or movable louvers.
</P>
<P>
   The sizes range from 6 to 13 inches wide, and 16 to 48 inches
tall. These will fit most standard windows, although a little
trimming and shaving may be necessary. For extra-large windows, a
cabinetmaker or lumberyard that offers millwork will make shutters
to specification.

   Installing shutters is not particularly difficult, but it is
important to measure the shutters carefully and trim them
precisely, or they will not hang straight. You will need four
shutters. Two shutters will be hinged together and attached to the
left side jamb, the other two to the right side. There are eight
hinges, four to join the shutters together and four to mount the
shutters to the window jambs.
</P>
<P>
   Measure the distance between the window jambs and divide this
figure by four to find the approximate width of the the shutters
you need. The shutters should come up to the top of the lower sash
on double-hung windows; they should not extend beyond the sash.
Measure this distance to find the shutter height you need. You may
have to buy shutters taller than the sash height, but you can trim
them.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to trim the shutters with a stationary power saw,
like a power miter saw, a table saw or a radial arm saw, because it
is difficult to make accurate cuts with a hand saw. Trim the bottom
of the shutters first, but do not cut off more than three-quarters
of an inch. If you need to trim more, take the additional cut from
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Next check to see if all four shutters will fit in the width of
the window. Lay the shutters flat, then tape them together
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The shutters will eventually be hinged together and the method
you use to mount the hinges could affect the total width of the
shutters. Mortised hinges will fit in a recesses chiseled in the
edge of the shutter and will not add much to the width. Cutting
mortises precisely takes skill, however.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to surface-mount the hinges, but you'll have allow
for the thickness that the hinges will add to the total width of
the four shutters. An easy way to do this is by inserting
eighth-inch thick pieces of cardboard between each shutter before
you tape them together.
</P>
<P>
   Stand the taped shutters in place on the window stool (the flat,
horizontal piece that rests on the window sill) to test the fit. If
the shutters are too wide, you will have to plane a little wood
from each to narrow them.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the gap between the shutters and the side jamb. It
should be about an eighth of an inch wide from top to bottom. A
tapered gap indicates that the window frame is not square, and you
will have to plane some wood from the edge of the shutter to
compensate for this. Be sure to check the gap at both side jambs
before attempting to install the shutters.
</P>
<P>
   When the shutters are trimmed to proper height and the edges
shaved to accommodate the hinges, sand them lightly with 120-grit
sandpaper. Finish them with either stain or paint. Use a narrow
brush, no wider than one inch, so you can work the stain or paint
between the louvers. Allow time for the finish to dry.
</P>
<P>
   If you have stained the shutters, you will want to apply a coat
of clear varnish.
</P>
<P>
   When the finish is dry, mount the hinges. Use two half-inch
hinges to join each pair of shutters together. Each hinge should be
secured with wood screws (these are provided with the hinges).
Drill pilot holes before driving the screws home. Position the
hinges so the hinge pin is facing the window. This will allow the
shutters to fold accordion style toward the jambs.
</P>
<P>
   Use the hinges of the same size to mount the shutters to the
window jambs. This time, the hinge pins must face in the opposite
direction, toward the interior and away from the window. This will
allow the shutters to open away from the window.

SENDING E-MAIL COPIES CARRIES A FEW RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Spencer Grey sent a message to a group of friends and
colleagues last fall notifying them of his new address, he thought
nothing of putting all of the recipients' e-mail addresses in the
``To'' field of the message.
</P>
<P>
   But when he returned from a vacation in Hawaii a couple of weeks
later, he discovered that one of his friends had copied the e-mail
addresses of the other recipients and sent them an invitation to a
party he was throwing in December _ on the theory that any friend
of Grey's was a friend of his. For the most part, it was a
harmless, ``the more the merrier'' gesture. Except the party
invitation ended with a tongue-in-cheek reference to drugs, and
Grey's e-mail list included some clients of his New York Internet
consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this major e-mail faux pas,'' Grey said, adding that he
was relieved that his friend's message was not more offensive. ``If
I have learned anything, it's the value of the Bcc option,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as various aspects of electronic communication have
presented new social issues or prompted the evolution of new
etiquette, how to deal with recipient lists in electronic messages
is an issue that has become more complicated with the growing use
of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   For those who use e-mail to communicate with groups of friends
or business contacts, the question is one of the appropriateness of
revealing or of hiding all of the recipients' e-mail addresses.
Stories like Grey's suggest that increasingly, the latter option is
gaining momentum.
</P>
<P>
   To hide the addresses in most e-mail programs, users type all of
the them into the Bcc, or blind Cc, field, instead of the To or Cc
areas. In business-related messages to a colleague, the blind Cc
option is often used to send copies to other individuals without
the colleague's knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, using Bcc can be devious in the workplace. But
anecdotal evidence suggests that the Bcc feature is gaining
popularity for personal correspondence sent to a large group of
people, especially among those who have had their Cc lists reused
without their consent.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Tadaki, a banker in London, said she has been more careful
about group messages since an incident last year when a colleague
from business school used the e-mail addresses from a message
Tadaki had sent informing friends about her new address. In this
case, the purpose of the message was more commercial than social:
the colleague sent Tadaki's list a message advertising a couch for
sale in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit annoying for a lot of people,'' Tadaki said,
particularly since she has lived in various countries and her
e-mail list included friends in the United States, Singapore and
Japan. In other words, it was not a list of people who were likely
to buy a couch in England.
</P>
<P>
   Like Grey, Tadaki said having her e-mail list borrowed made her
rethink how she addresses messages to a large list of recipients.
``Next time I send out a change of address, I will definitely do
Bcc,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Tadaki said there were still cases when she would use
the To field for group messages _ namely, an invitation to a party
or some other social gathering. ``It allows people to see who else
is coming or who is invited,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that issue, at least in terms of social correspondence, is
what presents the ``to Cc or to Bcc'' dilemma. On one hand, privacy
concerns have increasingly made Internet users skittish about
sharing their e-mail addresses _ a view that in some cases extends
to friends' addresses. On the other hand, it can be a bit
disturbing to receive a party invitation via e-mail where the To
field says ``undisclosed recipients'' or ``recipient list
suppressed'' _ phrases some e-mail programs insert when all of the
recipients have been blind Cc'd on a message.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Booher, the marketing communications manager for
health-care technology company in Silicon Valley, said she tries to
balance Internet etiquette with social etiquette when deciding how
to address group messages. To pass along information about a change
of address, a new job or some other announcement, she said, she
generally uses the Bcc feature.
</P>
<P>
   For party invitations, though, whether she Cc's or Bcc's the
addresses depends on the size of the event. ``If it's a small group
and I think people might want to carpool or something, then I Cc,''
Booher said. ``They know each other, and they're not going to spam
each other.'' But when she is having a bigger party, Booher said
she generally blind Cc's the entire list. ``It's a privacy issue,''
she said. ``There's no reason to give everybody your Cc list and
have them potentially use it for spam.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these precautions, Booher said an acquaintance once
asked her for her e-mail contact list to invite everybody on it to
another event. Booher demurred. ``I said, `Why don't you just bring
flyers to my party and pass them out instead.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for those who said they had used e-mail addresses gleaned
from friends' correspondence, most were reluctant to have their
names published, for fear of being electronically blacklisted.
</P>
<P>
   But off the record, a former employee of an Internet company in
California admitted to forwarding a particularly lengthy list of
e-mail addresses to the company's sales group, noting that the
domain names of the addresses represented a ``gold mine'' of sales
leads at other Internet ventures.

<P>
   An aspiring New York theater director acknowledged a habit of
scanning the other e-mail addresses on group messages from friends
in the business, on the off chance a networking opportunity might
present itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, contacts initiated via a serendipitous encounter with
a list of e-mail addresses are not always considered unwelcome or
suspect. In some cases, a group e-mail can spark a new relationship
or reconnect old friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Niestat, a program coordinator in Boston for the Jewish
campus organization Hillel, got back in touch with a friend from
high school when she recognized her name on a group e-mail message
from a mutual friend. Ultimately, the correspondence sputtered out.
But Niestat said she suspected most people shared her tendency to
peruse the other e-mail addresses listed on group messages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said her friend Katy Filner has gone one step
further _ on occasion striking up random e-mail conversations with
other recipients of a message from an acquaintance, asking things
like, ``I saw your name on Bob's e-mail list and wondered, how do
you know him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``She figured, if this person is on Bob's list, he's one step
closer than a stranger,'' Niestat said. ``The thing about e-mail is
you do things a little bit more capriciously than you'd ever do
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Filner, confirmed that she had indeed initiated e-mail
conversations in this rather offbeat manner, noting that a good
source of e-mail addresses were the joke messages people often
forward to friends _ in most cases, leaving all the previous
recipients' addresses visible in the headers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I was single and I thought, oh, I'll just look
for a guy's name,'' Filner said. She said she sent messages to
about five people, at least one of whom wrote back saying, ``Don't
ever write to me again.'' But one person responded more positively
and they ended up corresponding via e-mail for about a year,
although they never ultimately met.
</P>
<P>
   Although she hasn't written to anyone found on a list lately,
Filner said she still scanned the other addresses listed on e-mail
messages. ``I always look down the lists just out of curiosity,''
she said. ``I think it's fun just to see if I know anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her own policy about sharing friends' e-mail addresses,
Filner said she always Bcc's large lists. ``I never forward
people's names because I know what people like me do,'' she said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why those who send e-mail messages to multiple
recipients would do well to remember that once you hit the Send
button, it's out of your address book and out onto a very large,
very public network. In other words, Cc at your own risk.

PET STORES OFFER DIVERSION AND GOOD DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I fervently wish I were not the sort of person who needs to buy
a product called Nature's Miracle Stain and Odor Remover.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to explain my position to the three cats last week,
using as reasonable a tone of voice as could be expected from a
person who was on her knees scrubbing the bathroom grout (again)
with chlorine bleach. ``Litter box,'' I said to them. ``Surely
you've heard of the concept?''
</P>
<P>
   Pretending to speak no English, the cats looked at me blankly.
Then, as if I had left the room, they nonchalantly began to wrestle
and whisper ribald, mouse-related jokes into one another's ears.
</P>
<P>
   It is at times like these that my cats remind me of my three
children, which must be the reason I have not ``taken steps,'' to
use the words of my grandmother, who would have ominously pointed
out that there were other ways to rid yourself very quickly of an
odor problem. Note to any cats who might be reading this: she owned
a pair of fur mittens. And had a very clean house.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think my grandmother was thinking of the Internet as a
possible solution. But last week I gave it a try anyway, to see
what kind of deal I could get on Nature's Miracle from four popular
online pet supply stores: Petopia, Pets.com, Petstore.com and
Petsmart.com.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened to me almost as soon as I started
browsing on the sites. I forgot why I was there in the first place.
Each of these sites contains many amusing diversions for pet
lovers. I particularly liked the article on Petsmart.com that
described the New Year's Eve ``wedding'' of a Maltese dog who wore
a white satin gown to the ceremony. And I lost track of time after
discovering Petopia's online vet, who answers questions on
``aggressive painted turtles'' and ``why does my cat like to be
spanked?'' _ that I lost track of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But I also frequently forgot exactly which site I was on,
although I had previously spoken on the phone to representatives of
all four, and asked them to describe the quirks that set each site
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what they said, I guess it's possible that one site has
a few more premium products or that another is better for one-stop
shopping. But I can't remember which was which.
</P>
<P>
   These stores, which all began business within the past 15
months, sell a wide range of food and supplies for almost any kind
of (legal) house pet you may own. While the number of available
items may vary _ last week, for example, the sites reported
inventories that ranged from 8,000 to 12,000 products _ all four
sell the basics.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that it's a buyer's market out there, as the
competitors struggle to build customer loyalty. Online prices are
generally competitive with the prices at offline discount pet
stores, even after you take the shipping costs into consideration.
If price is your main consideration, then it's worthwhile to search
all four sites to see which one might offer free shipping this week
or might throw in a free bag of dog food when you buy a leash. They
charge as little as $4.95 for shipping and will refund your money
if you are not fully satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The prices were an unexpected surprise because most pet food
buyers who turn to the Web are probably looking for convenience.
It's far more pleasant to have a 40-pound bag of pet food delivered
to the door than to lug it home from the store yourself. And all
four sites allow you to schedule regular deliveries of food and
other supplies. (At each site, the tool has a different name: at
Pets.com (www.pets.com), for instance, look for the Keep It Comin'
tool. At Petopia (petopia.com), it's the Bottomless Bowl.)
</P>
<P>
   If the four sites are so similar, how do you pick one?
</P>
<P>
   Well, each site does have a distinct feature or two that might
to appeal to specialty buyers. If, for instance, you want to buy
live fish online, then Petstore.com (petstore.com) is the place to
go. And Petsmart.com (www.petsmart.com) has an amusing pet food
calculator that informed me that my cat Silver needed to consume
226 calories a day to meet his nutritional needs. If you want to
adopt a homeless pet, go to Petopia, which links to the nationwide
Petfinder database of animals that need homes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's really no reason for you to confine your
pet-related shopping activities to big stores. To get leads on
quirkier online stores, I phoned two pet experts at About.com, a
people-powered search site where human guides steer people to
online resources.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sower, the site's dogs guide, said one of his favorites was
Dogtoys.com (www.dogtoys.com), where he buys chew toys for his own
Jack Russell terrier. ``The site sells only toys and treats, and
they really take the time to do it right,'' Sower said. ``The
selection is divided by breed, so if you have a Labrador retriever,
there's a whole collection of toys recommended for Labs.''
</P>
<P>
   Franny Syufy, About.com's cats guide, recommended some unusual
toys that would probably amuse the sort of cats who deserve to be
rewarded for good behavior. At Pole Kat Pole (www.polekatpole.com),
for instance, you can buy, for $19.95, a 30-inch rod and reel that
casts a catnip mouse or other suitable bait. Or you can mail photos
and a description of your pet's personality to Artwarming Portraits
(www.artwarming.com) to commission a painting of your pet for as
little as $100. (Did I really just write ``for as little as $100?''
I have been looking at pet sites for too long.) And Me-Ow-Trageous
(www.catfurniture.com) sells items like the Rock-CAT-Ship Condo, a
68-inch-tall cat playhouse shaped like a missile ($320). ``This is
something that you're just not going to be able to find locally,''
Syufy said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, but until certain cats show a major attitude change, I
think I'll stick with Nature's Miracle. Three of the four big
online stores had it in stock, at prices well below my local pet
store's. I bought it from Petstore.com, which offered free shipping
on orders under 50 pounds and listed the product under Repellants
and Deodorizers. Resigned, I bought the large size.

IMAX: MOVIES WITH A THIRD DIMENSION THAT MAKES YOU DUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, digital artists love to bandy about the term 3-D.
There are so-called 3-D computer games like Quake. There are
graphics called 3-D in films, like those used to anthropomorphize
Potato Head in ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, though, these are little more than two-dimensional
images with depth and shadows. They don't jump off the screen _ at
least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX Corp. plans to take some animated classics quite
literally into a new dimension beginning this year. IMAX, the
Canadian company that has developed the technology and theaters
behind the oversize-movie experience, will release ``Cyberworld,''
a compilation of 2-D animated shorts that have been digitally
converted into 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is scheduled to be seen worldwide in October,
will feature converted clips from recognizable hits like ``Antz''
and ``The Simpsons.'' In addition, it will showcase
computer-animated shorts that were created to exploit the power of
the large screen.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Wechsler, the co-chief executive of IMAX, said that was
just the first step in taking the flat film into 3-D. Speaking of
the stars of ``Toy Story,'' he said, ``For incremental dollars, we
can have Buzz and Woody flying out of the theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAX 3-D is not new. The productions have been thrilling
theatergoers since the first one, ``We Are Born of Stars,'' was
previewed in Japan in 1985. Since then, nearly 80 3-D IMAX theaters
have opened around the world, from Chattanooga, Tenn., to Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the films have tried not only to make viewers duck
their heads but also to shed some tears. ``T-Rex: Back to the
Cretaceous,'' released in 1998, followed the adventures of the
teen-age daughter of a paleontologist as she is transported 65
million years back in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time,'' from 1995, took the audience on a
poignant tour of old New York by creating sweeping versions of
vintage stereoscopic photos from the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Stereoscopic images, twin pictures viewed through twin lenses,
ushered in the three-dimensional era in 1838. The first 3-D films
came about in the early 1920s when movies were shown in anaglyphic
format, which incorporated two slightly different images of a
scene, dyed red and green, on the same film.
</P>
<P>
   When viewed through special glasses with a red filter for one
eye and a green filter for the other, the images would come
together as one and appear to have depth. This rather low-tech
process peaked in the early 1950s with B movies like ``Bwana
Devil'' and ``House of Wax.''
</P>
<P>
   A live-action IMAX 3-D film is created by shooting the scenes
with a special camera with two apertures. By positioning the
apertures at approximately the distance between the human eyes, an
image can be simultaneously recorded from slightly different
perspectives on two separate rolls of film.
</P>
<P>
   The film is then played back on a double-lensed projector that
casts the image on the giant aluminum IMAX screen. Special
shutters, filters and viewing glasses let the viewer see the left
and right images separately; the brain combines them to perceive
the movie as three-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   Although the projection and the viewing process are identical
for an animated film like ``Cyberworld,'' the 3-D aspect of the
film is created in the ones and zeros of program code.
Computer-animated projects like ``Toy Story'' and ``Antz'' are
created using sophisticated 3-D modeling software.
</P>
<P>
   The IMAX conversion process essentially goes back into this
software and shifts the point of view slightly, to create two
images that are like those used in live-action 3-D. By viewing the
images simultaneously through the special glasses, the 3-D magic
comes to life.
</P>
<P>
   For animated clips made originally byIMAX, computer artists draw
the animation with a special stereoscopic device that lets them
draw digital images with a freely moving wand. The movements are
then fed into a computer and stored as 3-D images. Making an IMAX
film from scratch is time-consuming and expensive; it could cost
twice as much as it would take to convert a film with computer
animation into the IMAX format.
</P>
<P>
   This conversion technology could even be applied to the
computer-animated sections of films like ``Men in Black'' or ``Star
Wars: The Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler estimated that similar technology could be used within
five years to transform live-action film sequences. If a colorized
``Casablanca'' looks bizarre, just imagine the possibilities of
Bogey in 3-D. Here's  &UR; really  &LR; looking at you.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Somewhere between a boiled wool skirt and a divine
silk rumba dress, two anti-fur protesters briefly interrupted Oscar
de la Renta's fall fashion show Tuesday in the main tent in Bryant
Park. The women were tackled by security guards, dragged to an exit
and detained by the police as the models resumed their sultry
progress down a white runway left stained with black scuff marks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the tactics of anti-fur demonstrators are so
familiar to people in the fashion world, the ruckus stirred little
more than mild interest. De la Renta said afterward that he had
watched the whole thing on a video monitor backstage. He didn't
seem fazed. A few fur-clad clients joked among themselves that
maybe they ought to seek cover in the second row. But otherwise the
disturbance produced the same world-weary reaction of boredom that
fashion people reserve for looking at clothes.
</P>
<P>
   De la Renta's collection was terrific. It combined rustic
embellishments, like crewel embroidery on wool coats and
sable-trimmed vests, with tight, modern-looking pants and
miniskirts in suede or leather. Although there was a sense of
riches being piled on _ a striped cashmere sweater in multiple
autumn hues over a short crewel-embroidered brown tweed skirt, a
lace-cut leather mini with lace-cut, thigh-high boots _ the
underlying spirit of the clothes was young, younger than de la
Renta has shown in a while.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were those big important ball dresses for which
de la Renta is known, but then out came the model Giselle in a
caramel snakeskin shirt and a slinky pair of tan pants paved with
oval green and peacock-blue stones. So, some clothes had sex
appeal, others a great sense of chic. Sometimes they even combined
both, as when a model came out in a flaring black silk faille
dress, its gathered pleats recalling Balenciaga's Spanish skirts,
with a black ribbed turtleneck sweater bunched like a scarf around
her neck. If she had pulled the chunky sweater on, it would have
made light of those serious pleats. Charming.
</P>
<P>
   The New York fall 2000 women's shows are so far shaping up to a
strong season. On Monday night, Marc Jacobs sent out a collection
that perfectly conveyed the put-together look that has become the
dominant story for fall. He summed it up with A-line coats in taupe
and cream wool with ring-pull zippers and leather stripes at the
pockets and cuffs, and sleeveless tops in honey or brown
herringbone wool with matching knee-length skirts. The message of
relaxed, girlish coolness doesn't get much sharper than a buff
turtleneck with three-quarter-length sleeves worn with slim brown
herringbone trousers and a pair of low, whip-stitched shoes.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Jacobs seemed under the influence of Miuccia Prada,
who last season in her Miu Miu collection put across a kind of
early 1960s bourgeois teen-age innocence. But the most appealing
quality about Jacobs' clothes, the thing that one kept noticing,
was the way they fit. The cut was loose and a little boxy, and it
looked right for these dressy but casual times.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Badgley and James Mischka have advanced so far from
tinseled slip dresses that it was no wonder their show on Monday
evening drew most of the big department store bosses, like Philip
Miller of Saks Fifth Avenue and Burton Tansky of Neiman Marcus, all
of the magazine chiefs and a few socialites. ``Something for
everyone,'' a store buyer trilled, as a finale of models, in the
hues of a Russian tapestry, circled a field of synthetic snow and
ice sculpture under the main tent in the park.
</P>
<P>
   That something is a snappy elegance with just enough sparkle to
keep a modern glamour puss interested, and enough simplicity to
keep her from going over the edge. Black lace-knit trousers with
illusion pinstripes of beading were wrapped with tight jackets of
black or deep red leather cinched with narrow sash belts, or in the
case of a black wool jacket over a slim black striped illusion
skirt, with a 6-inch-wide leather belt. Out came a ruby-red
sequined dress draped gently over the bosom, followed by a black
fur chubby nestling cozily over a slinky black top and a
wet-looking pair of ruby sequined pants.
</P>
<P>
   In the mix were low-key looks, too, like a gray cashmere skirt
and jacket edged with knitted ribbing over a gray turtleneck, and
for evening, a navy scoop-neck sweater over a navy chiffon blouse
and a pair of shimmering navy trousers.
</P>
<P>
   In the program notes for her show Tuesday, Yeohlee Teng said she
wanted to ``forge a path away from today's fashion omni-trends,
mega-mergers and inside politics.'' Golly, Ned, all that for
clothes? She showed a lot of serious-minded skirts in somber hues,
often with simple, textured coats. There were brown and burgundy
charmeuse blouses with kerchief ties lapping at the neck, and
frequent plays of checks and squares and undulating lines. But like
Jil Sander, another minimalist known for her cerebral exercises,
Teng seems to struggle with the simple idea of making clothes look
feminine. Never mind sexy.
</P>
<P>
   With the official schedule crammed with shows, a couple of
designers decided to present their clothes away from the tents and
in novel ways. Katayone Adeli invited a few reporters down to her
store on Bond Street to watch a photo session with her clothes _
the delicately seamed coats and suede skirts, the mix of
Victorian-lace blouses and hard-edged shearling. She'll later
distribute the pictures, in what the trade calls a look book, to
editors. ``You'd miss the details at a fashion show,'' Adeli said,
``with all the loud music and the hype and the editors looking at
each other.'' Although that can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Rubin and Kip Chapelle put on a tiny presentation, just a
dozen or so outfits, in their loft here. It was a gem. ``We really
wanted to make clothes that are very wearable and still have
something special that people notice,'' Rubin said. That meant
simply draped sleeveless tops in tobacco-brown Ultrasuede, wide
trousers with a side pleat extending from the pockets and lined
with a tuxedo stripe, and an aqua wool coat with fringe at the
edges and on the back of the sleeves, like wings. Seams that would
have gone unnoticed on a runway enlivened a strict high-collared
coat in dusky brown wool lined with the surprise of aqua silk. In
the middle of the back was a single pinched pleat, making the plain
coat at once strange and wonderful.

THE SIMS WHO DIE WITH THE MOST TOYS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know how bugs, magnified 10,000 times, become fascinating
and monstrous? The Sims are kind of like that.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has played a Maxis computer game is familiar with
these creatures. They populate SimTown and SimCity. They work in
SimSkyscrapers. They get into SimTraffic jams. From SimCity's
godlike perspective, they look like ants.
</P>
<P>
   But then, from the top of the World Trade Center, real people
look like ants. So it's easy to believe that the Sims are human.
</P>
<P>
   Zoom down to a Sim's-eye view, as Maxis does in The Sims
computer game, and the Sims become fascinating _ and monstrous _
because they're not human. But they're not quite ants either.
They're a kind of ant-human hybrid, which raises some provocative
questions about human nature and the limits of computer game
design.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, The Sims takes a SimCity approach to the human
soul, which means that everything that goes on in a Sim's head, and
every aspect of the human condition (work, friendship, romance,
domestic life) is subject to mechanical metaphors. Everything is
measured and subject to well-defined conditions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sim Personality consists of five factors,
categorized in the Personality Design window: Neat, Outgoing,
Active, Playful and Nice. You have 25 personality points to
allocate among these qualities.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of personality as a zero-sum distribution of psychic
resources is highly egalitarian _ it doesn't acknowledge that some
people are messy, antisocial pigs with no redeeming qualities. On
the other hand, this model has its limits. And they are limits
determined not by a game designer's vision of humanity but by a
computer's ability to understand human nature because a computer
cannot understand anything that is not quantified.
</P>
<P>
   So Sims have straightforward and measurable needs, namely
Hunger, Comfort, Hygiene, Bladder, Energy, Fun, Social and Room.
All these needs are satisfied by interacting with objects, be they
televisions, bathroom fixtures or neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sims' world, everything is an object that yields a
measurable benefit when some action is performed upon it. A
roommate (a conversational object that bumps up the Social bar
graph) is more or less analogous to the couch he's sitting on. (The
couch yields Comfort if you sit on it and Energy if you nap on it).
</P>
<P>
   In a world with no intangibles, the only form of success is the
acquisition of more and better objects. More expensive objects more
efficiently address Sim needs. The bar graph labeled Fun goes up
faster if you are watching a high-definition television than if you
are watching a black-and-white television.
</P>
<P>
   The Sims live in a perfect consumer society where more stuff
makes you happier, period. There's nothing else. So your goals in
SimLife are purely material: Work your way up the job ladder so you
can earn more money, so you can buy more furniture, a bigger house
and more toys.
</P>
<P>
   To a Sim, there is nothing intrinsically worthwhile about
romance. But romance (quantified with relationship points that tell
you how much nuzzling and flattery is needed to get to the next
stage) allows you to add a member of the opposite sex to your
household and ultimately to reproduce. (If your relationship point
reading is high, a dialogue box pops up and asks you if you want to
have a baby. If you click yes, a bundle of joy instantly appears.)
</P>
<P>
   Reproduction is an important game strategy because you need
children to socialize with the neighbors' children so you can
socialize with their parents, and you need to socialize with
neighborhood parents to get ahead professionally. An information
box at the bottom of the screen helpfully informs you how much
networking is necessary for professional advancement.
</P>
<P>
   A number with a little smiley face indicates how many
neighborhood friends you need to get that big promotion so you can
buy more stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, as the Sims walk in the door from work, they announce
their arrival and how much money they made that day, as that total
(in Simoleans, the local currency) is added to the tally of
household assets.
</P>
<P>
   Soon there will be another round of shopping, and more
happiness. Sims never get old. They don't have to retire. So why
save, when you can buy things?
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if your Sims have a lot of Simoleons in the bank, they
are not as happy as they could be,'' the manual says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes, we all have heard those axioms about thrift, and a
penny saved and all, but in the Sims world, that means that you're
not buying stuff. And not buying stuff is a problem. Not buying
stuff means you're not upgrading the Sims' environment so that it's
easier to make them happy. They're consumers, you know, and they
are most happy when they can have a choice between pinball or the
piano, computer games or the plasma TV. They want it all.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, so do we. And The Sims is disturbing in its crudeness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also disturbing in its accuracy, to the extent that
getting and spending is the modus operandi for a lot of folks, to
the extent that we organize our lives around the acquisition of
objects, and to the extent that we treat each other as objects, as
a means to an end. To some degree, at least in the public,
professional sphere, we are all pushing buttons and pulling levers.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: How far does that go? By taking the metaphor to
its logical extreme, The Sims asks that question in an elegant and
provocative way. And to that degree, it succeeds as art, or as
modern architecture. It pushes the limits of the medium by
revealing them, by laying bare the machinery. By building a window
into Sims' souls, it prompts us to consider our own. &QL;

RAPPER'S NOT WAITING FOR HIS BIG BREAK _ HE'S MAKING IT HAPPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   J.D. Jimmerson IV heard the same old lines at least a hundred
times: ``Hey, J.D., we're gonna go in the studio'' or `Hey, J.D.,
let's do a song together.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Or whatever. Point is, people don't follow through; they want to
be rap stars but they don't want to actually put in the effort. And
record companies aren't exactly dime-a-dozen in Como, a struggling
Fort Worth neighborhood where Jimmerson has lived for most of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   You want to get anywhere in the rap game, he says, you do it
yourself. ASAP.
</P>
<P>
   And so he has: In the past 16 months, the 19-year-old Jimmerson
_ whose rap name is Mr. Aggravated Foe Braids _ has released two
full-length hip-hop CDs, ``Step Into My Kitchen'' and ``The Kitchen
of Agony'' _ almost entirely on his own, using a self-rigged system
involving a keyboard, a minidisc recorder and a karaoke machine
hooked up in his living room.
</P>
<P>
   He sells the CDs at Wherehouse Music on Camp Bowie Boulevard,
where he has worked for more than a year. Before that, he sold his
first tape, ``Murda Is Temptin,'' out of the drive-through window
at Grandy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, they'd order some food and I'd say, `I got a tape, man'
'' says Jimmerson, sitting in the living room of the west Fort
Worth apartment he shares with his fiancee, Laquisha Lacey.
``They'd say, `For real? That's you?' and they'd buy one.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to work, Jimmerson rides the bus or gets a ride with his
mom, Yvonne. He has never seen the inside of a real recording
studio, never had anybody put up a dime to back him or help get his
CDs pressed.
</P>
<P>
   But he dreams. He dreams big. And he's willing to work for those
dreams: He gets friends to take pictures of him, has them put
together on another friend's computer, and he goes to Kinko's to
have copies printed up.
</P>
<P>
   He can get a copy of a CD burned for $5, including the CD case;
add the cost of the artwork, and he can make a CD for $6, sell it
for $10 and make a nice $4 profit on every copy sold. Which allows
him to buy more equipment and pay for more CDs to be burned. He
says he has sold more than 800 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't make it because they wait so long, by the
time they finally do something they're old and they give up,'' he
says. ``I'm trying to make this happen for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So saying, he gets up and demonstrates how his system works: He
does a song's rhythm on the keyboard; it's hooked into the minidisc
player, which is connected to the Optimus karaoke machine, which he
got for Christmas when he was 12.
</P>
<P>
   He hears the rhythm on the headset, does his rap over it on the
karaoke microphone, and the two are thus recorded together, and
he's got it all on minidisc. If he wants to overdub the voices, he
repeats the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I've got it down pat,'' he says, ``it'll take me 12 minutes
to do a five-minute song. It's real easy. I did this myself. I just
came up with it. I try to do two, three songs every month.''
</P>
<P>
   The results, on ``Step'' and ``Kitchen,'' are basic, raw _ and,
with melodramatic sampled strings, full of an atmosphere of
imminent dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep a spooky atmosphere,'' he says. ``I was always a big
fan of horror movies _ `Halloween,' the Chucky movies, all the
Stephen King movies. I threw stuff like that in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Como, and in the Texas towns of Plano and Austin,
Jimmerson loved rap and horror movies. He was first impressed with
rappers Kris Kross and Too Short and began rapping in elementary
school: He'd record himself rapping over an instrumental version of
a Too Short song such as ``The Ghetto,'' take the tape to school,
play it for friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be called Daffie Duck because I always bought a
whole bunch of Daffy Duck stuff, but I changed the name when I was
in sixth grade because I didn't want to be sued,'' he says. ``Then
I started rapping as Stayflow _ like the starch _ and then a friend
of mine, Eric, called me Foe Braids and I slapped Mr. Aggravated on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved out on his own when he was 18, around the time he
graduated from Western Hills High School; he had already met
Laquisha. The two will marry on Sept. 16, 2001, the third
anniversary of their first date, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Wherehouse Music manager Charles Buxton says he's ``amazed'' at
how well-known Jimmerson is in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all word of mouth,'' he says. ``A lot of people in Como
know him, and a lot of white guys come in and ask for his stuff,
too. And he's a heck of a nice guy _ which is refreshing. You hear
so much about gangster rap, and he's a straight-ahead nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmerson's next project, he says, is a horror movie set in
Como; think, he says, of a cross between ``Reefer Madness'' and
``Evil Dead II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be called `Da Killa' _ it's gonna be about a Fort
Worth massacre,'' he says. ``There's a riot in Como on Halloween,
and it affects everybody in Fort Worth. Somebody's going around
turning everybody into zombies. It's gonna be real funny and real
horror _ a whole lot of blood and a whole lot of big laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   And the soundtrack, he says, is nearly done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every track will be new, and they'll have the spooky beat and
people talking, the best scenes from the movie,'' he says. ``And at
the end I'll have music videos and commercials and interviews with
local rappers. I'm trying to get everybody involved. It's a good
way to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought a camera from a pawnshop before Christmas and shot
maybe 4 percent of the movie before the camera began acting up and
``the film got jumpy.'' So he's saving for a new one, a better one,
and he plans to have the film done this summer; the soundtrack will
be out in the next two or three months, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about to get that new camera,'' he says. ``I've already
got all the props _ Halloween masks. I want this to be a movie
everybody remembers five years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's done, he says, he'll sell the videos for $15 each; by
that time, he says, he'll probably have also saved enough for a CD
burner, which means he can cut out the middleman and reproduce the
CDs himself. That means the per-CD production cost will drop from
$6 to $3.50 _ a $6.50 profit.
</P>
<P>
   After that? Who knows. Definitely another movie, and another
soundtrack to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, J.D. Jimmerson IV is not waiting around
for anybody's help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my career is going pretty good,'' he says. ``If
somebody offered me a record contract, for real, it would depend on
how it is. I would still want to do things I want to. I hate
procrastination.''

   Q. I need to save and scan copies of black-and-white cartoons as
TIFF files because they print well, but I worry that this is not a
good format for e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   What type of file should I use when I send the files as
attachments, and is it possible to convert the work I've already
scanned?
</P>
<P>
   A. The tagged image file format, or TIFF, which uses the file
extension .tif, is a popular way to save scanned images because it
can handle any size, resolution and color depth.
</P>
<P>
   TIFF files, while printing nicely, can also be rather large and
take up a lot of hard drive space, which also makes them a little
unwieldy as e-mail attachments. It is possible to convert copies of
your existing TIFF files into a smaller, more Internet-friendly
format, like the graphics interchange format, or GIF.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have image-editing software that you use with
your scanner, look in the program settings to see if you can open a
TIFF file and save a copy as a GIF. If not, there are plenty of
inexpensive shareware programs available on the Web that can help
you. Mac users might try Graphic Converter 3.7.2
(www.lemkesoft.de/gcdownload(underscore)us.html) and PC users can
try Image Converter Plus (www.fcoder.com/products/imgconv.htm).

   NEW YORK _ Her canvas is a small nugget of acrylic, and Annette
Kirszrot will work on it for an hour, painting a portrait smaller
than a dime, checking back and forth between her work and the
person sitting a few feet away in her examining chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a photograph you can be close, but never close enough,''
she said, seated in her studio in Manhattan. Next to her was a
cabinet with drawers marked L blue, L brown, R blue, R brown and
Hazel. Inside were other artificial eyes she had painted, looking
at first glance like small, shiny seashells.
</P>
<P>
   When she feels she has captured the inner magic of the iris, she
glosses it with a varnish she keeps in a Lancome jar. After careful
fitting and polishing, the plastic eye transforms the patient from
disfigured to nearly normal.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of satisfied customers lean against the books on her
shelf. They include a photogenic bride (``Thank you for making me
so beautiful,'' the back of the snapshot reads) and a teen-age boy.
(``Thanks for giving me my life back. Now kids at school don't make
fun of me anymore.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kirszrot (pronounced KIRSH-rot) is one of about 200 ocularists
in the country and nine in New York City, which has the most
board-certified manufacturers of ocular prostheses of any city in
the country. The New Yorkers include descendants of eye makers from
Lauscha, Germany, the historical home of glass eyes. The eyes are
no longer made of glass, a practice that went out during World War
II, when German glass was unavailable. The craft, which tends to be
passed through families, is painstaking and exact, and, at its
best, invisible.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 people a year are fitted for an artificial eye,
mostly because of cancer, trauma and genetic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Danz and Samuel L. Wright, ocularists and brothers-in-law
who work at Richard Danz &AMP; Sons here, say they ran into one man who
had been sleeping on a couch when a spring popped through, taking
out his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Typically people are hurt in more hazardous pursuits: stringing
bows, setting off fireworks, playing with BB guns, snowball
fighting, wrestling with bungee cords and shooting paper clips. One
man was having a perfectly lovely honeymoon in Florida until a
pelican flew into him.
</P>
<P>
   Kirszrot and Randy Danz say they sometimes cannot tell from a
photograph which of their patients' eyes they made. The inner
corner of the eye is the hardest to replicate, and usually tips
them off.
</P>
<P>
   With new technology in implants made of coral or spun
polyethylene, the body is able to send new blood vessels through
the marble-shaped implant, which then is able to move in parallel
with the patient's seeing eye. The artificial eye is then attached
to the implant. The ocularists also make carefully painted shells
that can cover damaged eyeballs. Danz even has a patent for a pupil
that will dilate according to the amount of light in a room.
Unfortunately, no one has yet perfected an artificial seeing eye.
</P>
<P>
   Danz's and Wright's handiwork appeared in ``The Natural,'' a
movie with Robert Redford that features a gambler played by Darren
McGavin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character was supposed to have a poorly fitted artificial
eye,'' Danz said. ``We made one that was a light blue color, and
they said no, it wouldn't do, it won't show up on camera. Then we
made an iris that was square and oversized, in a Day-Glo color, and
it was still hard to see. If you see the movie, it still doesn't
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it to drop on the floor and roll,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't roll,'' his brother-in-law said, explaining that
they are irregular, elongated ovals.
</P>
<P>
   They have fielded other unorthodox requests. A member of the
Hell's Angels wanted an eye with a gold-winged skull charm embedded
in it. They did the work, and Andy Warhol photographed it. Another
motorcycle enthusiast in Illinois has an artificial eye with a
diamond chip in it.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Gougelmann, who works in Manhattan and said his
grandfather Peter was the first ocularist to work in the United
States, in 1851, says some patients have asked to have their
initials embedded in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a patient that flew his own plane up from Texas,''
Gougelmann said. ``He used to get six eyes: two for a daytime
pupil, one for a nighttime pupil and one for the morning after. One
was with a Confederate flag in it, and one was a dancing girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacture of eyes, with or without dancers, is complex,
and varies by family. Some ocularists take an impression of the
socket with alginate, a molding material used in making impressions
of teeth. They make a cast mold, in which they create a wax model
of an eye, see if it fits the patient, make adjustments and then
cast an eye out of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   But Danz does not like working with molds. He usually can, for
lack of a better word, eyeball the dimensions of the socket they
need to fill, creating an eye without taking an impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can look and say it needs to be this kind of curve, this
deep here, this wide here, and how it would affect the eye, not in
one gaze but in all gazes,'' he said. This is the empirical method,
he said, and he inherited its knack from his forefathers, four men
named Dan Danz.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these genes of all these fellows doing it have made my
life a lot easier,'' he said. He is training his daughter, Heather,
25, as an apprentice, the only way of entering the field.
</P>
<P>
   After the eye is produced, the painting begins. Some ocularists
operate more like artists' studios than small manufacturers. Using
colors like excelsior yellow, Watchung red and magnesium cobalt,
Wright uses oil and acrylic, helped along by a clear polymer, which
he keeps in a Nantucket Nectars bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Kirszrot, who did her apprenticeship in Israel, outlined the
process. ``You copy the fellow eye of the patient. You try to get
all the details, the striations, the veins,'' she said, while
sitting in an office decorated with items as beautiful as the iris:
an iridescent paperweight, chrysanthemums, a tiny tree with jeweled
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whites are never exactly white,'' she said, adding that
there are more than a dozen kinds of white: tinged with yellow, red
or green. ``If the white is off, or it's too white, it's going to
stare.''
</P>
<P>
   When the painting is done, she adds the finishing touches,
including tiny red veins, which are too small to replicate with a
paintbrush, even the size 0 and 00 red sable brushes that
ocularists favor.
</P>
<P>
   To solve that problem, Kirszrot uses a short strand of red silk
thread, which can be divided into 50 strands. She lays several tiny
filaments across an acrylic eye that has been moistened by varnish.
The eye is baked for an hour and a half (the temperature is a
secret). The result looks mirror-perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Kirszrot joined the profession after wavering between a career
as an artist or an accountant. ``I just said I can't give up the
artwork,'' she said. ``I couldn't give up people, as opposed to
paper. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   And patients tend to return the affection. The process of
fitting an eye is not particularly painful, they say, and must be
repeated every three to five years (or quarterly, for infants), as
the shape of the socket changes over time.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a highly profitable profession. Danz and Wright say
Medicaid, which they no longer accept, covers only about $300 for
an eye, which takes them about two weeks to make. Some projects for
which the eye, eyelids and lashes need to be recreated can cost up
to $5,000, not counting later adjustments as the patient ages.

<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ The twice-monthly meeting of the writers'
group was in session in the backroom of Fish Tales, a seafood
restaurant across Seawall Boulevard from the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Harvey, a mechanic who is 66 and twice divorced, rose from
the table and read his latest poem, an ode to a long-ago love.
Virginia Garvin, 78, a retired college English teacher, read a
story about Navy boot camp in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Then Eleanor Porter, 75, who had been a magazine editor in
Manhattan, took her turn. Her essay was an effort to explain the
group: Why 21 men and women from their mid-60s to their mid-80s,
who included a retired librarian, postal worker, accountant and
former Roman Catholic priest, had been meeting for three years,
writing their life stories and reading them aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``This morning, as I was getting up, some lines came to me from
a play,'' Porter said. ``I thought it was `Death of a Salesman.'
They go something like this. `Attention. Attention must be paid to
this man. He must not be allowed to drop into his grave like a
dog.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I found myself thinking: That's what we are doing. We are
paying attention to ourselves. We are paying attention to our
lives. To what we have done and been and lived through.''
</P>
<P>
   This Galveston group is one of thousands across the country, in
retirement communities and in nursing homes, on college campuses
and in Elderhostels, in churches and synagogues, where older people
are getting together to look back at their lives and share their
stories.
</P>
<P>
   The writing of autobiographies is hardly new, and the search for
roots has been popular for some time. But now members of a reticent
generation that came of age before the therapy culture and Oprah
are excavating and disclosing their own personal histories _ warts,
secrets and all _ examining the past to make the most of the years
left to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've democratized autobiography,'' said Rick Moody, the
former director of the Brookdale Institute on Aging at Hunter
College. ``It's no longer just for the rich and famous, for people
with distinguished lives.''
</P>
<P>
   These new memoirists are writing for the same reasons writers
have always written: To search for meaning in their lives, to find
their voice, to leave a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're claiming our lives,'' said Porter, an exuberant woman
who, in her writing, is working out why she never married, despite
a number of proposals. ``Your life is a bunch of stories, and then
you put it down, and it has form. You think, `This is my life, and
it's OK.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gerontologists call the work these groups are doing by various
names: life review, guided autobiography, spiritual autobiography,
reminiscence. When done with a skilled guide and with sympathetic
listeners, it can be a key to emotional growth in old age, they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Burdett, the retired accountant in the group, is writing his
life story because he wants his three sons to have a record of who
their father was. ``My father just wasn't knowable,'' he said. ``In
my house, my mother did the talking. She had the feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Moody said, ``We're living in a world where people say, `Oh, get
over it, don't think about the past, just move on,' What life
review is saying is, `No, think about the past, work it through.'''
</P>
<P>
   Experts widely believed it was unhealthy for the old to look
back until the 1960s, when Robert N. Butler, director of the
International Longevity Center in New York, published a seminal
article on what he described as the natural process of life review
among older people.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Dobrof, a gerontologist at the Brookdale Institute, recalls
that as a young social worker at the Hebrew Home for the Aged in
New York, nearly 40 years ago, she was advised to stop asking the
elderly Eastern European refugees there about their childhoods, and
instead take them to the bingo room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the staff said we shouldn't encourage people to
reminisce, it made them depressed,'' Dobrof said.
</P>
<P>
   The Galveston group began with a ``Share Your Life Story''
workshop at the University of Texas Medical Branch that was
attended by 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Harvey, who had never written much of anything, was among
them. At first, he said, he felt embarrassed by his lack of
education. But as he began to write about what he had done, his
view changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made me admit that I've had a hell of a life,'' said
Harvey, who has been a brakeman, a florist, a newspaper delivery
man and a mechanic on tugboats and oil rigs. ``I never thought
about it before. Day to day, you do things. Things happen. I found
out, I've been shipwrecked off the coast of California, barroom
brawling in Alaska, shot at in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of guys get together, and you tell war stories,'' he
went on. ``You embellish them, and you lie a lot. It's a lot of
fun. It's male bonding, you could say. To talk about it seriously,
I never did. Maybe I've reached an age where I can afford the
luxury of being direct and honest and more or less sincere, without
feeling like I need to apologize for it: This is what I was and
what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey has also written about the scent of gardenias _ his own
Proustian moment _ the former wife he still loves, and the day he
made a pact with a rat that he would not kill another living thing
unless absolutely necessary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The workshop was led by Thomas R. Cole, a professor of
humanities in medicine at the Institute for the Medical Humanities
at the medical branch, with one of his graduate students, Kate de
Medeiros. Cole said he learned the power of narrative by writing
the biography of Eldrewey Stearns, a manic-depressive recovering
alcoholic who had been a leader in the sit-in movement in Houston
in the early '60s. The book, ``No Color Is My Kind'' (University of
Texas Press, 1997), was a collaboration, with Cole taping Stearns'
recollections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave him back his life in a form that nobody could take
away,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said the workshop was inspired by others in the field of
aging, including James E. Birren, a leading gerontologist who
teaches guided autobiography at UCLA and the poet Marc Kaminsky,
who helps the elderly tell their stories through poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Cole and De Medeiros encouraged the group's members to write in
whatever form suited them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very conscious shaping of turning points,'' Cole said.
`` `What is it you need to work on? What is it you want to reclaim
and narrate, to get clearer on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Reading to the group is as important as writing. ``An idea is
nothing till you put it down on paper,'' said Ivan J. Arceneaux,
71, who has written about the day shortly before his ninth birthday
when he decided to become a priest. ``Reading it is unbelievable.
To read it aloud makes all the difference in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other women of her generation, Joy Weiss, 80, did not
think she had anything to say. Her son, Marc, pushed her to join
the group not long after her husband died, she said. ``I said,
`Marc, what can I write about? I don't remember anything.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had that much self-confidence,'' added Weiss, who
married young, worked in her parents' furniture store and reared
three sons. ``Other people have moved around and traveled and seen
other parts of the world. All I know is Galveston.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weiss found things she could write about _ her mother, her
childhood memories of nickel Cokes, her husband of 55 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would be proud to know that I have become a little more
independent,'' she wrote in a letter to her husband, ``realizing I
am on my own and must assume certain duties. You should see me
replacing batteries where needed and resetting the clocks and
answering machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The point of the group is not simply to tell entertaining
stories. ``You can't just ask people for their happy memories,''
Cole said. ``You've got to find out what's stuck in your craw. It
takes courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Julius Halasz, 85, a Hungarian immigrant who says he spent his
adult life ``hiding from my memories,'' took Cole at his word. In
``My First Christmas Present in the U.S.A.,'' he wrote about the
breakup of his marriage, nearly 50 years ago, when his wife cheated
on him and then left him for the other man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into my car, started to drive toward east, quite away
from Toledo, practically numb, when it started to dawn on me what
happened,'' he wrote. ``It finally dawned on me what had happened,
TO ME, who was so anxious to have a family and keep it together in
any kind of condition. It was lost so easy, with a single cheap
deception.''
</P>
<P>
   Halasz has also written about his parents, who were killed in
World War II, and about the solitary life he led after his divorce,
working all over the world as a construction engineer. ``It comes
in sequences back so clearly it's unbelievable,'' he said. ``It
reminds me how many times I went to sleep alone in my life. I
looked up at the ceiling and say, `Why me?'''
</P>
<P>
   But Halasz also writes about the past decade, about his life
with ``my dearest,'' Velma Bradshaw Leavell, 84, a widow
</P>
<P>
   `When we first met, he didn't want to sleep with me because he
was afraid he would hurt me,'' Leavell said. ``He slept so fitfully
he thought he would hit me. I told him, `Don't worry about it, I'll
just conk you on the head.' After he started writing, he got less
fitful.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavell's autobiography, which she is writing for her four
children and has her passion for horses as a major theme, is not
without pain. ``I just lived every day,'' she said. ``I never even
thought about it till we started writing about it. I lost a baby,
lost a husband, lost another husband, my mother died. You learn to
go with the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   De Medeiros has collected the groups' work into two books,
published by the senior services office at the University of Texas
Medical Branch. She is 35, and one of the things that has struck
her is what older people choose to write about.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, regardless of what they did for a living, ever writes
about their jobs, or their weddings, or the birth of their
children, or the war, things that many people would assume most
older folks would write about,'' she said. ``They write about the
relationships and the very small gestures that have made them
human.''

   &UR; Excerpts From the `Share Your Life Story' Group in Galveston &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Porter: From ``Share Your Life Story, Baby''
</P>
<P>
   Proms are the presumably necessary rituals of the tribe. the
trials by which the tribe sorts out the most obvious winners of the
most obvious states: the sexual stakes. The hero athlete and the
pretty cheerleader. Winners in the competition of reproductive
genes. Proms do not measure intelligence, sensitivity, artistic
merit, moral awareness, etc. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the sexual stakes game, I was lost and wandering. Try, in
Galveston, Texas, in the south of the U.S. of A., in circa 1939,
try being female, intense, bright, anxious and too tall. Then try
making small talk in the spaces between partner dances. Try hell.
</P>
<P>
   It's like not knowing how to groom, if you are a chimpanzee. You
are out of it. And the tall, bright chimpanzee felt therefore
repeatedly humiliated and repeatedly helpless, in a situation for
which there was no solution, no way to work at the problem.
Scholastic tests you could study for. Good behavior you could
accept. Proms, you could only grit your way through ...
</P>
<P>
   And then, a thousand years later, you are free at last. You have
been loved, you have cried, you have been happy, you have lost, you
have been in it and now you have personally influenced a dozen
people to come to a little nightclub, a little cave, that has been
there at 33rd and Ball for fifty years, reaching back to the glory
days of entertainment in this little city, to when artists of
entertainment came to the city auditoriums, and to the big clubs,
the big caves, and then, later, to this tiny spot to relax and jam.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   We are suddenly dancing, free form, alone and together. We don't
need partners. We are maturely sexual. We have evolved. First apes,
then primitive man, then fast forward to the prom.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Ellie, a certain female in the tribe, observed
by anthropologists to have been uncertain and sad at certain former
rituals in the early years. She is observed screaming with
wine-induced laughter, free at last, moving toward death with the
happy beat. Moving on. Moving, baby. Moving.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Harvey: From ``Night of the Rat''
</P>
<P>
   There was light enough to read by if you don't mind squinting a
little and it was by this light that I spotted my first victim. He
wore a shiny, ebony coat as he calmly sauntered down the stringer
toward the morning's repast I had placed about 8 feet from my
sniper's position.
</P>
<P>
   I figured that when he became engrossed in gorging himself, I
would send him to rat heaven, but he did the unexpected. Instead of
immediately attacking his food, he sniffed it several times, picked
it up in his mouth and with calm dignity, walked slowly toward me.
I was absolutely awed when he stopped about two feet away, dropped
his food, stood up on his hind legs and seemed to deliberately
appraise me. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In fascination I watched his post breakfast grooming ritual as
he carefully washed his paws and combed his hair. It was during
this process that he and I reached a tacit gentleman's agreement,
the terms of which are as follows:
</P>
<P>
   1. I would never again kill anything unless absolutely
necessary. Necessary meaning to protect myself or to prevent or end
a creature's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   2. To kill without hesitation and as painlessly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   3. Never to accept pleasure, satisfaction, or guilt from the
justified killing of any living thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Burdett: ``What Now?''
</P>
<P>
   Retired. Off the treadmill. Out of the rat-race. Affairs in
order. Paper read. Bills paid. Laundry washed and folded _ It'll
only take a minute to put it away. Enough time for everything _
Then some. Too much of a good thing. Too many crossword puzzles.
Too many naps. Errands I used to do on the way from Point A to
Point B have become major events. Is this what it's supposed to be
like? I retired on insufficient data. Now I'm expected to live
another twenty-five years. Almost ten-thousand days. A slow death.
Travel? Romantic involvement? Don't think so. Need to do something
productive, Significant, Meaningful, Gratifying. Like reinvent
myself. Start all over.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I plan to install a set of decorative shelves in my family
room, using adjustable or movable shelf brackets that fit into
slots on the metal standards I will mount on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   My wife feels that the metal brackets under each shelf will be
quite noticeable, especially on the higher shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Can I do anything to hide or at least make these brackets less
visible without a lot of extensive carpentry or custom building of
some kind?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are three simple steps you can take to make the shelf
brackets less visible.
</P>
<P>
   First, buy brackets that are about an inch shorter than the
width of the wood shelves you will be installing on top of them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, drill two 3/8-inch (three eighths inch) holes about half
way through the wood into the bottom of each shelf, as shown in the
illustration. These will accommodate the vertical tips on each
bracket, and thus eliminate the need for their reaching up in front
of each shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Third, attach a strip of wood molding at least twice as wide as
the thickness of the shelf to the front edge of each shelf. Once
mounted, the molding will make the brackets below even less
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some black tar was accidentally spilled onto my light colored
vinyl siding by the roofing contractor.
</P>
<P>
   He cleaned the spots off with acetone, but now that we are
getting more sun those places where the tar was removed have a
slight shine or gloss that makes them very noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Washing with detergent has not helped dull these areas to match
the matte finish on the rest of the siding.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell me how to dull these glossy spots so they do not
stand out as much?
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds as though the original siding has weathered quite a
bit so that the original finish has ``chalked'' enough to give it a
dulled look.
</P>
<P>
   When the tar was washed off, the solvent also removed the
``chalking'' on the finish, thus exposing the original luster.
</P>
<P>
   You could use a solvent to clean off all the siding in the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to avoid this big job, you may be able to get by
with simply dulling the shiny places by rubbing down with a mild
abrasive such as a kitchen scouring pad (sold for cleaning pots) or
even an automobile cleaning and polishing compound (sold for
restoring old, dull finishes).
</P>
<P>
   Q: The side door entrance to my detached garage has the hinges
mounted so the hinge pins are on the outside. This makes it easy
for a burglar to remove the door even when it is locked.
</P>
<P>
   What is an inexpensive and simple way to improve the security of
this door without having to take the door off and re-hang it so
that it swings inward?
</P>
<P>
   A: Take the center screw out in the one half of each hinge that
is fastened to the door frame.
</P>
<P>
   Then tap a short length of 1/4-inch diameter metal rod into the
original screw hole until it projects out past the face of the
hinge by about 1 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Now drill out the screw hole in the other half of the hinge (the
part attached to the door) directly opposite this first hole so
that when the door is closed the protruding metal rod will slide
smoothly into this hole.
</P>
<P>
   Experiment with the length of the rod until it permits the door
to close properly.
</P>
<P>
   This rod will keep the hinge from separating or coming apart
when the door is in the closed position, even if the hinge pins
have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The bathroom walls in my old house are covered with plastic
panels that were put up with a cement of some kind.
</P>
<P>
   I know the walls under this are plaster, and I would like to
remove these panels if I can.
</P>
<P>
   Any suggestions you can offer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only suggestion I can offer is to try scraping them off
by using a stiff scraper of some kind, or even an old wide chisel.
</P>
<P>
   Start by trying to force the blade in along one of the seams, or
possibly near the floor or ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next to a vanity or other fixture of some kind should
also be a way to get the tool started under one edge.
</P>
<P>
   Once started, use a hammer to keep forcing the scraper in behind
the plastic so that you can eventually peel large sections off.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that you will still be left with gobs of cement or
adhesive on the walls, so you will then have to use an electric
sander to get a smooth surface.

 &HT;    Local trio's offering resonates
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Lanier Trio has been treading water since
cellist Dorothy Lewis suffered a stroke last fall. She's doing
well, but it'll be a while until she regains her full playing
ability. The trio hopes to reschedule its three-concert series at
the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts next season. Meantime,
here's a wonderful recording of the Mendelssohn Trios to remember
it by. These two staples of the chamber music repertory are among
the finest of Felix Mendelssohn's output: dramatic, passionate,
enchanting music, as appealing to musicians to play as audiences to
hear. Parts of this recording are a little violin-heavy, but when
the violinist is William Preucil, concertmaster of the Cleveland
Orchestra and former concertmaster of the ASO, one really can't
complain. Georgia State faculty member Cary Lewis, Dorothy's
husband, is the excellent pianist. The Lanier's Mendelssohn is a
splendid addition to any library.
</P>

   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   Mendelssohn Piano Trios
</P>
<P>
   Lanier Trio: William Preucil, violin; Dorothy Lewis, cello; Cary
Lewis, piano. Gasparo. 8 tracks.

 &HT;    Exploring the quirkier side of that thing called love
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Valentine's Day approaching, one thing most of us can agree
on is that love is strange. Let the starry-eyed out there rent
``Sleepless in Seattle'' and ``An Affair to Remember.'' Here are
some couples bound together by something more than love.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bonnie and Clyde'': They robbed banks the way most couples
give dinner parties.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Depression exploits of Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty)
and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway), the movie became a landmark. A
sign that Rock Hudson was history and the future (at least for the
next decade) would be Dustin Hoffman and Al Pacino and Jack
Nicholson ... and, of course, Beatty.
</P>
<P>
   One not-so-romantic footnote: When Francois Truffaut first told
the star/producer about the project, Beatty envisioned making the
movie with his then off-screen squeeze, Leslie Caron. But by the
time the cameras rolled, he'd hired a hot young unknown (Dunaway)
who, in her autobiography, reveals that she was all too happy to
play her opening scene without wearing any underwear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sid and Nancy'': Here's a love story that goes Erich Segal
one better. What can you say about a 21-year-old rock star who
overdosed a few months after allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to
death? Plenty, according to Alex Cox, who directed this rudely
sordid yet perversely captivating account of the eat-it-raw romance
between Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) and his
sleazy American groupie Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb).
</P>
<P>
   More strung-out than star-crossed, this hard-rock Romeo and his
junked-up Juliet lived a tragicomedy of blood, puke and shared
needles. At times, it's like watching ``I Love Lucy'' as a junkie
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Some nostalgic '70s touches include the Cat Stevens soundtrack
and scenes actually shot at Manhattan's infamous Chelsea Hotel. And
look for Courtney Love in a tiny role as another groupie.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Harold and Maude'': A cult favorite in the early '70s, Hal
Ashby's whimsical black comedy chronicles the love affair between a
depressed 19-year-old, Harold (Bud Cort), who drives a hearse and
likes to stage elaborate suicide attempts, and a sunny 80-year-old
eccentric named Maude (Ruth Gordon), who befriends him by offering
him candy at a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Panned on its initial release, the picture developed a fiercely
loyal following; a theater in Minneapolis played it for three
years. And here's a weird factoid: Apparently Gordon's Maude was
modeled after Peter Lawford's mother. Let's not go there.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Oscar and Lucinda'': One of the oddest romances ever
committed to screen, made all the odder because it stars Ralph
Fiennes and Cate Blanchett, both of whom can pull off traditional
romantic roles effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, sometime in the 19th century, a shared addiction to
games of chance results in the chance meeting of Oscar (Fiennes), a
shy English clergyman who fears water and his fiercely
fundamentalist father, and Lucinda (Blanchett), an Australian
heiress mesmerized by glass. On a ship bound for Sydney, the two
lock eyes over a pack of cards _ one addict recognizing another _
and their fates are joined. Just how joined, well, you'll have to
see for yourself. Think Merchant-Ivory crossed with Werner Hertzog
and you'll have a hint of what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Bob &AMP; Carol &AMP; Ted &AMP; Alice'': At the time (1969), Paul
Mazursky's attempt to get hip with the Flower Power generation was
embarrassing. Especially if you were under 30. Now its naive satire
is almost appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Bob and Carol (Robert Culp and Natalie Wood) and their best
friends, Ted and Alice (Elliott Gould and Dyan Cannon), decide to
literally embrace the sexual revolution by going to Vegas (!) for a
weekend of partner swapping.
</P>
<P>
   Culp and Wood were the bigger names, but Oscar nominations went
to Gould and Cannon for their supporting roles. Still, Wood had the
last laugh: She earned $3 million (that's $3 million in '60s money)
for her share of the considerable grosses.

 &HT;    CD mini reviews
 &HT;    By Nick Tate, Bo Emerson and Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'll Kill Ya''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Zevon. Artemis. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Warren Zevon's ``Excitable Boy'' days are clearly over. In his
first album in five years, Zevon moves squarely (and perhaps too
seriously) into midlife crisis territory. No witty ditties here
about werewolves, lawyers, guns or money. Instead, ``Life'' is a
slow trudge through the dark stuff of death, dying and loss of
vigor. Such material should be fair game for Zevon's jaded,
left-of-center perspective. And, in spots, he hits the mark,
recalling the grim brilliance of his glory days on the slow
acoustic rocker ``I Was in the House When the House Burned Down,''
the S&AMP;M folk ballad ``Hostage-O'' and his stripped-bare take on
Steve Winwood's ``Back in the High Life Again,'' which he twists
into an ironic after-hours anthem for street drunks. Yet many
tracks here sound half-baked and thin. Much of ``Life'' lumbers
along like a funeral procession, with Zevon's half-spoken deadpan
droning on about entropy and decay. Too often, Zevon sounds like
that wild old high school friend who used to make you laugh (and
think), but whose once sharp wit has grown dull and whiny over the
years.

   ``Spirit Into Sound''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Hart. Grateful Dead Records. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Grateful Dead was always greater than the sum of its parts,
a truism illustrated by this polished but unremarkable set from
former Dead drummer Mickey Hart. As with many Hart projects, such
as the mind-boggling ``Dafos,'' the sound of ``Spirit Into Sound''
is vibrant, spacious, rapturous.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the musical ideas are repetitive and limited. A
collection of mid-tempo instrumental wallpaper, much of the CD
could pass for the interstitial music that plays between National
Public Radio segments. Hart knows how to make percussion tell a
story, as witnessed by the 1970s gem ``Diga,'' which he recorded
with the great teacher and percussionist Zakir Hussain. Hussain
reappears here on the lugubrious final cut, ``Indian Night,'' but
doesn't enliven the procedures. The compact disc follows the
publication of ``Spirit Into Sound,'' a book from Hart that
collects inspirational quotes about the impact of music from
sources as various as Plato and Ice-T. Perhaps ``Spirit Into
Sound'' reads better than it plays.

<P>
   Notoriously poky auteur Stanley Kubrick had nothing on Green
Gartside. It's been more than 10 years since the last Scritti
Politti album, and about 14 years since the band's sole hit single,
``Perfect Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed a bit since then, and Gartside, who is
Scritti Politti, reflects that here. What's surprising is that it
doesn't sound like a leap from 1988's ``Provision.'' It doesn't
sound dated, either. A neat trick, that. And Gartside's
high-pitched, airy voice is as distinctive as ever. Hip-hop
influences, via guest rapper Mos' Def, who co-wrote two tracks, and
the vocal presence of Me'Shell Ndegeocello bring things nicely up
to date. Gartside is at his best on the uptempo tracks, tending
toward the syrupy on ballads such as ``First Goodbye.'' Stick to
the groovers, including the guitar-heavy ``Umm'' and ``Tinseltown
to the Boogiedown.'' A pleasant surprise.

 &HT;    New day dawning for fans of Judds?
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is ever as it seems with those Nashville women named
Judd, so why should this new CD from spitfire daughter Wynonna be
an exception? It's billed as her fourth solo CD, and there are 12
tracks here that are just Wynonna. But if you open up the jewel box
like a secret panel in an Agatha Christie library, you'll find a
second CD containing four tracks by Wynonna and her mother, Naomi _
the first tunes they have recorded together since their teary,
yearlong breakup a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The secret disc, which the label says will only be included in
the first 250,000 CDs released to stores (we'll see), presents a
quandary for Judd fans. With a bizarre mix of cover tunes (a
note-for-note remake of Joni Mitchell's organic jazz love song,
``Help Me''), utterly forgettable ballads and that tedious,
pole-dancer growling, Wynonna's solo disc flops around like a
string of fish. In contrast, the Judd music soars. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's more than Naomi's subtle alto harmonies. Her country
influence _ fiddles, pedal steel, homespun lyrics _ makes her
daughter sound confident and more at home. The tunes romp over
Wynonna's indistinguishable pop. ``Big Bang Boogie,'' a Texas swing
dance tune layered with barroom piano and Bob Wills fiddles, is as
fun as a new pair of saddle oxfords. The pedal-steel ballad
``That's What Makes You Strong'' is a tender hymn about love and
forgiveness lifted from Naomi's cross-stitch platitudes about faith
and family.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, this could be the sputtering last gasp of
Wynonna's solo career (and any attempt to have an identity outside
her publicity-hungry mother). But if it is indeed a return of the
Judds, welcome back.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Day Dawning''

 &HT;    The trick? Lust turning to love
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``trick'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a huge treat, but it's a sturdy and often
well-acted example of post-AIDS, post-``queer''-bashing cinema.
</P>
<P>
   In this romantic comedy, the characters' sexuality isn't the
only thing that's a given; so is a prominent aspect of gay single
life. That is, while lots of guys are looking for true love, on any
given night they'll certainly settle for a quickie with a real
cutie (actually, a good many straight singles feel the same way).
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel (Christian Campbell), an aspiring musical comedy writer,
is a real cutie. Mark (John Paul Pitoc), however, is more than a
cutie. He's a well-muscled hunk of boy-toy who dances at a local
bar wearing little more than a smile and a skinny pink thong. The
two pick each other up, both clearly intending nothing more than a
mutually gratifying one-night stand. But that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Mark lives in one of the outer boroughs of New York, so
Gabriel's Greenwich Village place is the obvious choice.
Unfortunately, it's occupied _ first by his ditsy best friend (Tori
Spelling), who's busily photocopying her resume, then by his
boorish straight roommate, whose girlfriend has just returned from
Europe. For the rest of the movie, Gabriel and Mark roam the
streets. Every time a possible solution arises, so does an
obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trick'' becomes more endearing as its simple lust story turns
into a simple love story. Forced to get to know each other before
sex, they learn some surprising things. What weakens the picture is
that, as it goes along, the obstacles become more and more
contrived. After a point you begin thinking, hey, fellas, why not
just spring for a hotel room?

 &HT;    Extra protein, calcium fuel the fuss over `plus' milk
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hillary, you're not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hillary Rodham Clinton moved to New York, she's had
occasion to do some of her own grocery shopping _ and she admits to
being a bit befuddled by all the choices on the dairy aisle,
especially skim milk ``plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the British press claims this shows how out of touch the
first lady-turned-senate candidate is with mainstream Americans.
But truth is, a lot of grocery-cart pushers in these parts don't
know what the ``plus'' stands for either.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they've been selling skim milk pumped up with extra
protein and calcium in California for several years. But locally,
``plus'' has only been widely available for about a year. And who
could notice it among all the products like 70 percent lactose-free
2 percent milk or fat-free half-and-half (do we even want to know
how they've pulled that one off)?
</P>
<P>
   ``Several processors offer `plus' milk now. I bought it for the
first time during the ice storm, when the grocery was out of my
regular milk,'' said Cheryl Hayn, manager of communications and
nutrition for the Southeast Dairy Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hayn said the milk is whiter and has a creamier texture _ an
attempt to satisfy those who find skim milk bluish and watery. But
it's still fat free.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a fast-growing product,'' said Carlton Bates,
spokesman for Parmalat New Atlanta Dairies. Its Farmland Dairies
brand has offered ``plus'' milk in Atlanta for a couple of months;
Parmalat brand will hit the shelves in a couple of more months.
</P>
<P>
   Wait till Hillary sees all the new choices on the cereal aisle.

<P>
   &QR;  ``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge'' (unrated) _ HBO's lovingly
indulgent, Emmy-winning portrait of the singer-dancer-actress who
helped break Hollywood's color barrier. Halle Berry delivers what
could be her most intoxicating performance. Granted, she's no Meryl
Streep, but her sexy and subtle portrayal of Dandridge makes it
clear that she's more than just the sum of her finely chiseled
cheekbones. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Lyle V. Harris
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Blue Streak'' (PG-13) _ A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence
vehicle. He's a crook posing as a cop to recover a $17 million
diamond he stashed years ago. Basically a series of quick skits,
there are enough action scenes to mollify audiences who can't get
enough gunfire and breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak
along, at 93 minutes it gets the job done. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Black Cat, White Cat'' (R) _ Emir Kusturica returns from
self-imposed retirement after the controversy that followed his
last film, ``Underground.'' Movie lovers, be grateful. His latest
manic fable concerns star-crossed lovers, a forced marriage and
lots of geese running around. Oh yes, Grandpa's corpse is up in the
attic, under ice. Kusturica makes it all make hyperactive, lyrical
sense. In Romany and Serbo-Croation, with subtitles. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Romance'' (unrated) _ A dull little French film with an
undeserved hot reputation. Upset because her boyfriend has stopped
having sex with her, Marie (Caroline Ducey) starts having lots of
sex. Rough sex, indiscriminate sex, quickie sex. Even bondage sex
with her boss, who takes about an hour to tie her up (guess they
don't have Boy Scouts in France). The movie is very explicit and
absolutely unerotic. It's about as much of a turn-on as a trip to
the gynecologist. In French with subtitles. Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   _Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Astronaut's Wife'' (R) _ On a routine space mission,
astronaut Spencer Amacost (Johnny Depp) loses consciousness for two
minutes. When he returns to Earth, pregnant wife Jillian (Charlize
Theron) begins to suspect some sort of spooky alien intrusion. What
happens then, we can't tell you; the studio dumped this space-dog
in theaters without prescreening it for the press.

   WASHINGTON _ The National Infrastructure Protection Center,
created two years ago as the focal point of the Clinton
administration's effort to protect critical national systems,
largely serves as an information clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   NIPC brings together representatives from the private sector and
from the federal, state and local governments. Its major mission is
to protect U.S. telecommunications, energy, water, financial and
other systems from physical or electronic disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NIPC will provide a national focal point for gathering
information on threats to the infrastructures. Additionally, the
NIPC will provide the principal means for facilitating and
coordinating the federal government's resources'' when an attack
occurs, President Clinton wrote in a 1998 directive.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry critics complain that the Clinton administration
has not provided enough funding for NIPC to carry out its role
effectively. At a news conference Wednesday, Ron Dick, a NIPC
official, acknowledged that the agency had not attained the
``optimum level'' of funding for personnel and other resources.
</P>
<P>
   Located in FBI headquarters here, NIPC has three main sections:
</P>
<P>
   _ A Computer Investigations and Operations Section coordinates
FBI investigations of computer intrusions. The section also
includes a Cyber Emergency Support Team to respond to major
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Analysis and Warning Section collects real-time information
about infrastructure threats from government and industry sources,
analyzes it, and distributes its findings to all interested
parties.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Training, Administration and Outreach Section coordinates
the training and continuing education of cyber-investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The director of NIPC since its creation in February 1998 has
been Michael Vatis, an attorney and a former official of the
Executive Office for National Security in the Justice Department.

CHECHENS SAY REBEL COMMANDERS ARE HOLDING JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A Russian reporter for Radio Liberty who has been
missing since he was swapped for Russian soldiers in Chechnya last
week is now being held by rebel commanders somewhere in the
breakaway region, a representative of the Chechen government told a
Moscow radio station on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion by Sharip Yusupov, Chechnya's representative in
Moscow, contradicted the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, who
insisted last weekend that the reporter, Andrei Babitsky, had not
been taken by Chechens in an exchange for Russian prisoners, as the
Russian authorities have claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, whose fate has fueled furious protests in the Russian
media, was shown Wednesday in a grainy video clip on Russia's
largest commercial channel. Babitsky, giving the date as Feb. 6,
said circumstances prevented him from returning home to Moscow, but
added that he was with people who were trying to help him.
</P>
<P>
   Yusupov said he had heard from sources that Babitsky, 35, was
being held in a secret location in Chechnya, in the custody of a
commander known as Islambek Ismailov, until he could be taken out
of Russia. But like other information in the Babitsky case, this
too was treated skeptically Wednesday by Babitsky's family and
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila, said Wednesday the latest video told
her nothing except that her husband was in trouble. She said the
film gave no clues about the identity of Babitsky's keepers, or
where the videocassette had come from. ``As a wife, I am thoroughly
confused,'' she said, noting recent comments by Russian officials
who said that her husband is alive and well. ``If they are saying
he is alive and well, then that means they know where he is. Again,
it leads to a pile of questions, and there has been nothing so far
that can take away the pain from my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky was last heard from on Jan. 15, when he called the
Moscow bureau of Radio Liberty to say he was heading out of Grozny,
the Chechen capital, as Russian forces pounded it. The next day, he
was detained by federal forces. On Feb. 3, the Russian authorities
contend, he was exchanged for Russian soldiers held prisoner by the
Chechens.

<P>
   Computers are now involved in many of life's chores and
amusements. Should you let them find your soul mate?
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T Labs in New Jersey, the Media Laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other research centers,
scientists have devised programs to look for online matches that
can enhance your business or social life.
</P>
<P>
   Like a good flesh-and-blood matchmaker, each of these programs
takes a close look at its user. The software does a statistical
analysis of the seeker's interests or communication style, then
sallies forth in search of someone who appears to be compatible.
The difference is that these matchmakers begin their searches on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Matchmaking programs are part of a group of personalized
software that scientists call robots, software agents or softbots.
The first generation of these agents offered to introduce people to
new books (as on Amazon.com), schedule a meeting of six busy
people, fetch the lowest price for a refrigerator advertised on the
Web or suggest items for a shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   The newest generation of software agents includes robots that
are prepared to perform business and social introductions to ease
the paths of people venturing into the salon that is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is no software version of Madame de Stael and her French
salon of the late 18th and early 19th centuries just yet. But there
is Yenta at MIT, and Cobot at AT&AMP;T Labs, two examples of
matchmaking software developed to make business and social
introductions among like-minded people on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really trying to use software agents that are
considerably different from those before,'' said Michael Kearns,
who is the department head for artificial intelligence research at
AT&AMP;T Labs and a co-developer of Cobot. ``Instead of tasks like
coordinating calendars, these software agents will step out and
take much more initiative, making social introductions, not a task
people have traditionally thought of machines as being good for.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of software agents that communicate with one another on
the Internet and exchange Internet addresses so their owners can
meet sounds more like science fiction than fact. And even though
the robots' creators are concerned about keeping private
information private, the creation of such multi-agent networks is
sure to raise worrisome questions of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the software agents, Yenta, named after a Yiddish word
for a woman who gossips, is designed to introduce its users to
like-minded people at no cost to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Yenta's creator, Leonard Foner, said: ``My software agent was
developed expressly to show that you could have a matchmaking
system and still protect your privacy. Yenta is basically a tool to
help busy people find other people with common interests.'' Foner
developed Yenta for his doctoral project at the MIT Media Lab and
is a member of the software agents group there.
</P>
<P>
   Foner created Yenta with business and research, not romance, in
mind. ``Suppose you are a researcher working on a problem you
haven't published, and someone else is working on it, too,'' Foner
said. ``Your Yenta and his Yenta could bring you together.''
</P>
<P>
   British Telecommunications at Adastral Park, Ipswich, took Yenta
from MIT's Media Lab and adapted it for a trial run in its personal
agent system at many company sites. It is currently being used by
1,300 employees to build business relationships within the company.
``The number is still growing,'' said Barry Crabtree, a research
engineer and technical adviser who oversaw the adaptation. ``It's
turning out to be a good way for people with similar interests
within the company to get in touch with one another,'' Crabtree
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Yenta works. Users can download the software agent
free by following the links at the
yenta.www.media.mit.edu/projects/Yenta site. (Yenta will run only
on Unix machines for now, although Foner is considering a Windows
version.) The Yenta software immediately tells Foner's server the
recipient's I.P. address so other copies of Yentas can communicate
with it. ``The server records no personal information except that a
Yenta ran on a certain machine sometime in the past,'' Foner
explained. ``Otherwise, it is completely anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   The user can then point his or her copy of Yenta at selected
computer files and turn it loose. To analyze files, the robot
counts the number of times words occur in documents, like ``agent''
or ``hockey'' or ``Flaubert,'' and summarizes the information.
</P>
<P>
   Using that summary, the robot identifies clusters of documents
that use the same words. ``Soon you have clumps of word lists that
are mostly talking about the same subject,'' Foner said. For
instance, the user's copy of Yenta may find that in a group of 24
documents, all share the same top five keywords, like ``robot,''
``collaborative,'' ``filter,'' ``Yenta'' and ``results.''
</P>
<P>
   Yenta is then ready to go out and find other copies of Yenta
that have identified clusters of documents that share the same top
keywords. The software is concerned only with how often keywords
appear, not with context. When a Yenta spots a match, it tells the
user it has identified a cluster of other Yentas that share his or
her interests. ``All really close matches get notification from
their respective Yentas that they should talk to one another,''
Foner said.
</P>
<P>
   All communication between users takes place through the Yenta
software. E-mail addresses and identities are not shared unless the
users decide to do so.
</P>
<P>
   To get started on its collaborative life, the software can ask
Foner's server for the addresses of a random handful of Yenta
copies around the world. Within an intranet, the Yenta can simply
broadcast _ send out a general call _ in search of other Yentas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are in a company or in any network that supports local
broadcasts, including most types of Ethernets, you can broadcast
internally to see if there are other Yentas,'' Foner explained.
</P>
<P>
   The network of Yentas spreads as Yenta A asks Yenta B: ``Do you
know any more Yentas? Can you give me their I.P. addresses?'' Yenta
runs automatically in the background around the clock, Foner said.
``Every so often it finds itself in a group of other Yentas that
share an interest.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Yenta copies communicate with one another, passing
messages and arranging introductions, all communications are
encrypted, including the files that each Yenta stores on the
computer's hard disk to keep track of its user's interests.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 people signed up for the original testing of Yenta; a
smaller number are still interacting, Foner said, while he is
preparing an updated version. British Telecom continues to adapt
Yenta to its own use, and Intel has also licensed the software.
Paul B. Anders, a senior engineering researcher at Intel, said,
``Intel is looking at several knowledge management tools, like
Yenta, that match experts to problems.''

</P>
<P>
   If Yenta is the office gossip, a new softbot called Cobot is
more of a sociologist. Instead of looking through e-mail messages
and talking to Web browsers, Cobot analyses transcripts of user
interactions from a chat room in LamdaMOO, an on-line community
that was created in 1990 at Xerox's PARC laboratory and is still
popular among computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cobot sits around in the living room _ the center of social
activity in LamdaMOO,'' said Kearns, who developed the robot with a
colleague, Charles Isbell. ``It builds up a statistical profile of
how people in the room communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   LamdaMOO lends itself to artificial intelligence experiments,
Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike commercial chat rooms, LamdaMOO provides you with other
ways to communicate besides directed speech, ways that let you
express nonverbal communications,'' Kearns said. For instance,
Kearns explained, if he sees someone he knows in the chat room, he
can type ``hug Kim'' instead of ``hello.'' Kim will see ``Michael
hugs you,'' and other people will see ``Michael hugs Kim.'' Using
other simple commands, users can signal many emotions, like
shrugging or laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With communication this rich,'' Kearns said, ``it's really
possible for people to start to exhibit a communicative style and
personality. Some people laugh more or speak more, and it's
possible to statistically measure these styles.''
</P>
<P>
   To observe these styles and to determine, for example, which
chat room contributors are aggressive, which ones like to hug and
which ones are skeptical, Cobot was placed in the LamdaMOO living
room last year. It is arbitrarily considered male because LamdaMoo
players usually declare whether they are male or female and Cobot's
inventors wanted him to fit in.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cobot does not take the initiative in social
interactions. Instead, members of the chat room communicate with
the robot directly to inquire about their online habits and those
of others. At first, few players spoke to Cobot, but when users
discovered that he could provide them with illuminating details
about themselves, he became quite popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Users were fascinated by their personality profiles _ how
often they hugged, for instance, or were hugged,'' Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobot was prepared to give them ``objective, statistical
information about how they behaved in the virtual world,'' Kearns
said. The analysis is based on things like how much a person scoffs
and even harsher details, like: ``You rate Mike as your No. 1
friend. Mike rates you No. 8 on his list.'' To do this, Cobot
counts each player's actions and figures out what percentage is
directed toward each other player. ``In this way, a legitimate
social imbalance is uncovered,'' Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobot will begin taking a more active role by suggesting,
without prompting, that people become acquainted. ``Soon Cobot is
going to be able to introduce people to one another based on a
common friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Kearns and his colleagues also sought to give their softbot a
better conversational style. Instead of trying to write his
responses to queries, the team stocked Cobot with documents like
the Unabomber manifesto or the script for ``Planet of the Apes.''
The robot matches the words and phrases directed toward it _ other
than requests for a statistic _ with words in its reference
documents. When it comes up with a match, it uses that part of the
document to generate a response that gives ``the appearance of
personality,'' Kearns said.
</P>
<P>
   The living room liked the newly improved Cobot and chatted with
him even more, apparently delighted that the robot had developed a
cranky side. (Just don't ask him about the foibles of technology.)
</P>
<P>
   To keep Cobot from irritating users by taking the initiative too
often or at the wrong moment, ``Cobot will get rewards or
punishments from the group as he learns,'' Kearns said. Cobot will
soon be able to notice that two people in the living room who are
not talking to each other have a similar circle of friends. He may
decide to introduce them. Some people will like that, Kearns
predicted, and some will not. The users can punish or reward Cobot,
and he will quickly learn which users want his help.
</P>
<P>
   Cobot is already full of surprises for his creators. Isbell has
been taken aback by the depth of his software agent's education, he
said, just as Henry Higgins was startled by his handiwork in
``Pygmalion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I ask Cobot about myself, and I discover interesting
and annoying things,'' Isbell said. ``For instance, I asked Cobot,
`Tell me who acts like you.' It turns out that I act like him. I
was a little disconcerted by this.''

&HT;     ABORTION: NOT A SIMPLE CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE ZAPPA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Every so often, what we have labeled a
``political issue'' meets our own stories. In an unexpected moment,
public and private collide in the most uncomfortable (and therefore
useful) way.
</P>
<P>
   The borders of belief and doubt merge and expose the more
complex, and perhaps the more true.
</P>
<P>
   I experienced one of those moments recently with my 11-year-old
son. We were walking along the street on our way to get ice cream.
It was meant to be a lighten-up escapade following a visit to the
pediatrician, where he'd just had stitches removed.
</P>
<P>
   He'd been anxious about those stitches and we were both
relieved. We passed a row of newspaper vending machines where a
headline leapt at me and I stopped. I assumed my son would either
ignore the ``boring'' newspapers, or he wouldn't know which
headline I wanted a closer look at.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as children will, he not only spotted the object of
my hesitation, but read it out loud: ``Bomb at abortion clinic
kills guard, injures nurse.''
</P>
<P>
   I feel myself brace for the inevitable. ``Mom, what's
'aberton'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion, honey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's 'abortion'?''
</P>
<P>
   I hesitate. I've been a pro-choicer for as long as I can
remember, but I find in an instant my oversimplified politics
subject to the most meaningful scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abortion is when ...'' _ I determine not to be euphemistic _
`` ... when someone is pregnant, and they find they can't keep the
baby, or the baby is sick, or something's wrong, so they kill the
baby before it's born.''
</P>
<P>
   His chin drops visibly. ``They kill the baby?''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating his next question, I try to explain method. ``Well,
yes, sometimes they take drugs, or ...'' and I falter, realizing
there's no way to avoid making this sound horrible to his ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kill the baby? How? Does it hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, people aren't really sure. And there are lots of
different ways, but one of them is by taking pills.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm waffling. I'm copping out and I don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, how can people just kill their baby? Before it's even
born?''
</P>
<P>
   He's indignant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's very complicated. And we hope that no one does it
without thinking seriously about it. But you know how you've talked
about people who are mean to their kids, or people who hit their
kids, or seem like they don't want them?''
</P>
<P>
   He nods, looking vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, in some cases, if the kids can't be taken care of, or
have a good home, it might be better to have an abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   I realize I'm defensive and I wish I weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are lots and lots of people who think that abortion
is so wrong they think no one should have one, ever. They think
it's so wrong, they'll use bombs at places where people go to have
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really stupid. I mean, that seems even worse, right?''
he scoffs. ``It's like you use a bomb to let people know you
disagree. Right?''
</P>
<P>
   He asks again, ``Mom, how do they kill the baby?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it depends on how long the woman has been pregnant. If
it's very early, and the fetus is very tiny, they can take pills
...''
</P>
<P>
   Hiding again. I know this must be in a small percentage of
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it gets later, it's more like an operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Our arrival at the ice cream shop is a temporary distraction. I
know we'll come back to the subject again. And then it will be my
job to explain a D and C. It can't sound anything but painful and
violent to 11-year-old ears.
</P>
<P>
   When I was younger, it was important for me to establish and
cling to my political beliefs. What I didn't realize was how much
of this came from my need for identity.
</P>
<P>
   My politics, to a great extent, helped shape who I was. Now that
my circle of friends is smaller and more genuine, my various badges
no longer exclusively identify me.
</P>
<P>
   Part of growing, both up and older, involves the acceptance of
complexity. The shades of gray between the extremes of an issue are
really the areas that describe most of us. Besides, it's our
stories _ the individual, private accounts, bound to be complex,
most likely fraught with ambivalence _ that define where we live,
and only eventually lead to our politics.
</P>
<P>
   But my son needs clarity. He wants to know, now, what it is, who
does it, and whether it's right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As we stand at the glass counter, he deliberates, all his focus
on mint chip or rocky road and what kind of topping goes best.
Should I tell him that we almost aborted him?
</P>
<P>
   When we first got pregnant, we, like many others, weren't
``ready.'' The pregnancy was a surprise, we'd only been married for
a few months and were already having a rocky time of it. We had our
hands full with just being married.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there wasn't even a question. We simply were not
ready to be parents, let alone good ones.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately we had decided that the timing of this pregnancy,
while not optimal, was largely an inconvenience and that on its own
didn't justify termination. It seemed to me more clear than ever
that there are bigger things at work than us.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ironic twist, then, as life so often likes to twist,
that a few months later we had a bad blood test, an elevated AFP
(alpha-fetal protein, or some such), which indicated some sort of
damage _ spinal and/or brain damage _ that could suggest medical
reasons for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   We were crushed; by then we'd become excited about the birth. We
were told, incidentally, that at times an elevated test result
could instead indicate twins. Two ponderous, miserable days later,
we had an ultrasound, and there they were, swimming around each
other. We both cried with shock and relief. And the irony,
especially as I stood there with my son, chocolate-mouthed and
smiling, has never left me.
</P>
<P>
   When I have to pick sides, I'm as pro-choice as I've ever been.
But oversimplifying the issue is as dangerous as the extremism to
which it leads. There's nothing like a clinic bombing, a doctor
being shot or the depictions in those posters, even at a blur, to
make me sure about my convictions. But I'm not about to answer my
son's questions about abortion by passing on the polarity.
</P>
<P>
   I turn to the trusting face of my 11-year-old, ready for the
truth, and I'm daunted by the task. I think I'll have to tell him
our story, because it's his story, too, even though I know there
are parts of it he's not going to like.

HILLARY TALKS ISSUES WHILE RUDY TALKS BASEBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Campaign
Countdown commentary column.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Campaign
Countdown, a rotating campaign-commentary column written by former
Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro and by
MSNBC host Laura Ingraham.) 
 By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Up in New Hampshire the chickens were coming home to roost.
There was blood in the political water, and the race for the White
House was picking up steam.
 &HT;    Even so, I found that I was more interested in what was going on
at the State University in Purchase, N.Y., where Hillary Clinton
was officially announcing her run for the Senate.
 &HT;    Naturally, I was delighted to see John McCain deflate George W.
Bush's $70 million balloon. The Texas governor may call it a mere
bump in the road, but as he watched McCain's South Carolina poll
numbers shoot up and his Website contributions pour in, Bush must
have felt like he was standing at the helm of the Titanic. Was it a
bump he hit? Or was it an iceberg?
 &HT;    Meanwhile, an incumbent vice president who barely survived
struggled to put a good face on his narrow win, while Bill Bradley
_ having spent more than $3 million to show he was the better
candidate _ grappled with the fact that, for the first time in his
life, he'd come up short.
 &HT;    But I have to admit that neither race had my full attention.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and First Lady Hillary Clinton aren't
running for president, but their race promises more fireworks than
Gore, Bradley, Bush and McCain put together.
 &HT;    As Hillary prepared to announce her candidacy to a few thousand
of her nearest and dearest friends at SUNY/Purchase, Rudy bounced
from network to network, grinning like a Cheshire cat as he
announced that, though he's running for the Senate, he has no
intention of announcing his candidacy.
 &HT;    Yes, that sounds bizarre, but it seems that when he formally
announced he was running for mayor the first time, he lost. The
second time he neglected to announce, and won. So the third time he
figured it was good luck to keep his mouth shut _ and he won really
big.
 &HT;    I had to laugh, because it was so typical. We Italian-Americans
are not only religious, we're also superstitious. I couldn't help
wondering if his mother had pinned a red ribbon on little Rudy's
underwear to keep him safe when he went off to school, the way my
mother did.
 &HT;    Even if she did, Rudy's going to need more than a red ribbon to
win this race. On Day 1 of the official campaign, Hillary wasted no
time before taking on the mayor head-on.
 &HT;    ``I may be new to the neighborhood,'' she said, ``but I'm not
new to the issues that concern you.''
 &HT;    She was, of course, confronting the so-called ``carpetbagger''
issue that Giuliani loves to tweak her with. It was smart politics
_ ignoring an attack rarely makes it go away, it simply gives your
opponent some room to maneuver.
 &HT;    What's more, she's right. Senators work on issues that concern
all Americans, no matter what state we come from _ issues such as
education, health care, Social Security, gun control and a woman's
right to choose. And she's been working on them for years, even if,
as Rudy likes to remind us, she's never done so in elected office.
 &HT;    Public officials like Giuliani want us to believe that the only
record that counts is one of accomplishment in the public sector.
By that standard, Sen. Orrin Hatch _ a man with literally decades
of public service to his credit _ ought to be the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination, instead of heading home to
Utah as an early-primary victim.
 &HT;    Yes, Hillary was saying _ I'm new to New York and I've never
held elective office. So what? Let's talk about the issues that
matter to us all, and which candidate is better able to make a
difference on those issues.
 &HT;    And Hillary whacked him again, firing a salvo of her own, when
she said, ``I'll fight against the politics of revenge and
retribution.''
 &HT;    It didn't take much reading between the lines to recognize a
shot at Giuliani's notoriously vindictive temperament and his
penchant for scorched-earth turf battles.
 &HT;    Now, understand me: I like Giuliani. Not enough that I want to
see him in the Senate, but certainly enough to give him credit for
the things he's done for our city.
 &HT;    But he should drop the carpetbagger comments and, while he's at
it, stop with the Yankee jabs already! The mayor may think that
this election is about who's the truer Yankee fan, but no one else
cares.
 &HT;    I remember my brother taking me to Yankee Stadium on Saturdays
back in the 1940s. We would sit in the bleachers and cheer for Joe
DiMaggio, Tommy Henrich and Phil Rizzuto. My credentials as a
Yankee fan were impeccable _ at least until I moved to Queens and
started rooting for the Mets _ but that obviously didn't help me
win a Senate seat.
 &HT;    If it makes the mayor feel better not to formally declare for
the Senate, fine. But if he's running, he'd better start taking the
campaign and us voters seriously.
 &HT;    And if his party ends up nominating George W., Rudy had better
make sure he's wearing a big red ribbon on Election Day.

   ISRAEL-LEBANON (Jerusalem) _ A tense state of anticipation
gripped much of the Middle East on Wednesday as Israelis and Arabs
waited to see whether the conflict in Lebanon would defuse or
escalate, reviving active hostilities between Israel and its
neighbors. Israel again bombed southern Lebanon, and Shiite Muslim
guerrillas continued firing mortar shells at Israeli outposts.
Another Israeli soldier was buried. And Israeli residents on the
northern border endured their second full day in musty concrete
bunkers while Lebanese civilians spent their second day with only
sporadic, generator-powered light and heat. By Tuesday, it became
clear. With the acquiescence or assistance of Syria, the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas in Lebanon
had succeeded in undermining the regional peace effort, which they
oppose. By Deborah Sontag.

   GERMANY-TAX (Berlin) _ Germany Inc., the tight-knit economic

Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder approved draft legislation that will
slash taxes and open the way for German corporations, particularly
banks and insurance companies, to sell off the extensive

 &HT;    TOP COLLEGES MORE OPEN TO POORER STUDENTS, CONGRESS TOLD
 &HT;    570&AMP;add.

   WASHINGTON _ Despite tuitions that consistently rose faster than
family incomes, the nation's elite private colleges are more
accessible to low-income students than they were three decades ago,
a Senate committee was told Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``High college preparedness'' _ as measured by SAT scores and
high school class rank _ is increasingly more significant than
family income in determining who attends these selective colleges,
testified Caroline Hoxby, a Harvard economics professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the main group of students who appear to be getting
displaced from very expensive colleges is the group of students
from medium-high to high incomes who have low college
preparedness,'' Hoxby told the Senate Committee on Government
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being replaced by highly prepared students from
low-income families,'' said Hoxby, who compared 1972 and 1992 high
school graduates in her research on college costs.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxby was among the witnesses who testified at a committee
hearing on the ``Rising Cost of College Tuition and the
Effectiveness of Government Financial Aid.'' She credited federal
grants and loans with helping make expensive colleges more
accessible to low-income students.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, students are increasingly leaving college with heavy
debts.
</P>
<P>
   The increased accessibility of elite colleges to low-income
students has come ``at a high cost of indebtedness and stress,''
said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, the tuition has more than doubled at
four-year colleges, far outpacing the inflation rate and family
incomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1990 through 1996, average tuition for a full-time
resident undergraduate student rose 43.8 percent,'' said committee
Chairman Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. ``But during that same period, the
consumer price index rose only 15.4 percent and median household
income rose a mere 13.8 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the testimony showed that the issue is more complicated
than just rising costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a strange marketplace in which college education
operates,'' said Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   For the top tier of private colleges _ the Ivy League schools,
Duke, Stanford and similar highly selective institutions _ students
are fighting for the chance to pay $32,000 or more per year to
attend. These elite colleges have had the fastest rising tuitions,
Hoxby said.
</P>
<P>
   But the elite schools have actually shown pricing restraint,
noted David Breneman, dean of the Curry School of Education at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the huge applicant pools that they have, they could
clearly charge even higher prices,'' Breneman explained.
</P>
<P>
   One of these private institutions, Williams College, recently
announced it would not raise tuitions in the coming year, he noted.
He called the gesture ``a fool's errand'' that is unlikely to be
followed, since demand is ``price insensitive'' for such schools.
</P>
<P>
   However, price is a factor for private colleges that are an
academic notch or two below the elite level. In order to entice
better students and fill their classes, these colleges are
beginning to offer ``merit-based'' financial aid to good students
regardless of their family incomes. The elite colleges usually
provide only ``need-based'' financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges argue that rather than providing a $30,000 grant to
one needy student, it makes economic sense to give $5,000 apiece to
six excellent students.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses differed on whether the ``merit-based'' grants, which
often amount to discounts in the ``sticker price'' of tuition, are
worthwhile in helping make college more affordable for more
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think merit aid is an appropriate element in price
competition,'' said William Massey, a Stanford business professor.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut College President Claire Gaudiani blasted merit
aid as an academic abomination aimed at filling dorm rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colleges and universities are even hiring consultants who will
come in and design a system to pinpoint exactly how much financial
aid you need to offer to which students to maximize the number of
high-quality, low-need students who accept your offer of
admission,'' Gaudiani testified. ``This is called financial aid
leveraging and it is extremely effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses agreed that the debate over rising tuitions is
skewed because of the costs of elite private colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I been asked about the high price of community
colleges, which enroll over 43 percent of all undergraduates,''
said Breneman. ``Rarely am I asked about the rising cost of public
colleges and universities, which enroll over 37 percent of all
undergraduates. And within the remaining 20 percent of
undergraduate enrollment, the concern is directed to those highly
selective institutions at the top of the pecking order that may
enroll only 2 to 3 percent of all undergraduates.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``college tuition has not risen across the board,''
said Hoxby. ``In fact, since 1970, tuition has remained almost flat
in real terms for fully 50 percent of the colleges places in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   It is at the colleges that were already the most expensive that
tuitions have risen most significantly, she said.

   Cold Is No Friend to the Lemon
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two lemon trees that I grew from seeds nine years ago.
Until this winter they were grown in pots and kept indoors during
the winter months and outdoors the rest of the year. This October,
for the first time, I planted them outside. Will they survive
winters in northern New Jersey? Will they ever bear fruit?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've read your question several times, hoping it wasn't true,
because if it is, I'm afraid your lemons have gone to the great
orchard in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   All the common kinds of citrus are sensitive to frost, and
lemons, which are among the most tender, will be killed if
temperatures drop below about 25 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   So, this pair will never, alas, bear fruit. But even if they had
lived, they may not have produced for four or five more years, at
which point they may have been 10 to 20 feet tall. Seed-grown
plants are a gamble, when it comes height, while citrus trees sold
for pot culture are either naturally dwarf, like the Meyer lemon,
or grafted onto dwarfing rootstock.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of potted lemon trees in the North is shiny green
leaves, fragrant winter flowers, and a better chance at usable
fruit than sweet citrus like oranges, which need hot summers to
develop sugars and seldom bear well in confinement.
</P>
<P>
   Sour types like lemons, Key limes and kumquats don't mind mild
summers and are at home in containers as long as they are large and
the soil in them is well drained.
</P>
<P>
   The down side _ there is always a down side _ is that indoor
conditions frequently make lemon trees vulnerable to scale, red
spider mites and other pests that thrive where plants are stressed
by drought and low light. Kumquats and sour mandarins, while not
immune, are generally less bothered than lemons.
</P>
<P>
   They're also generally more robust in their growth habits. The
pair of experimental mandarins in the lobby of the Sports and
Fitness Center at Lehman College, in the Bronx, for example, have
been thriving for years, fragrantly blooming, putting out lots of
tiny, sour orange fruits, even though they get little sun and only
minimum attention. David Cain, the greenhouse manager who is
responsible for them, said, ``My management technique is basically
to hack them back when they start to get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   So, before you enter the lemon lists once more, consider the
alternatives. Kumquats, for instance, will give you the same
year-round gifts of shiny leaves, fragrant flowers and delicious
fruit while giving you far less grief. If you're set on lemons,
Meyers are probably the way to go. They're slightly hardier than
other lemons (down to 18 degrees Fahrenheit), well adapted to pot
culture and quite generous about fruiting young.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer lemons, kumquats and other citrus for pot culture are
available from Raintree Nursery, 391 Butts Road, Morton, Wash.
98356, (360) 496-6400; and Edible Landscaping PO Box 77, 361 Spirit
Ridge Lane, Afton, Va. 22920, (800) 524-4156. Both offer free
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   What to Do With Ashes
</P>
<P>
   Q. We burn wood pellets for heat and have wondered whether the
ashes would be OK to put in a composter. The bag says 100 percent
wood, with less than 0.25 percent fines (we think they mean wood
powder). I am not worried about the ashes making our soil too
alkaline. We put lots of organic material into the composter.
</P>
<P>
   A. They do mean wood powder (fines is a technical-sounding word
for crumbs), and it's the alkalinity of the compost itself that you
should be concerned about. Two or three cups of wood ash in a
50-gallon barrel won't hurt, but if you add much more you could
slow down _ or kill _ the bacteria that power the composting
process.
</P>
<P>
   Composting won't change the ashes themselves; they're already as
broken down as they're going to get. You might as well spread them
very thinly on the soil and save space in the composter.

 &HT;    MISSING RUSSIAN REPORTER SPARKS CONTROVERSY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER 
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A missing muckraking journalist, a shady prisoner
exchange, intelligence agency double-talk and a deadline to win a
war. What sounds like the basis for a best-selling suspense novel
has unfolded as real life in Russia this week.
</P>
<P>
   Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky, a 35-year-old veteran war
correspondent working for the U.S.-financed Radio Liberty network,
disappeared on Jan. 16 after slipping past government censors and
filing uncensored news reports for weeks about the fighting between
Russian soldiers and Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the disappearance, Russia's security service, the
Federal Security Bureau _ successor to the communist era KGB _
raided Babitsky's Moscow apartment and confiscated notes and
photographs he had taken of dead Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 days of silence, the Russian government announced it
had arrested Babitsky on charges that he did not possess the proper
accreditation to work in Chechnya. A Kremlin spokesman assured his
worried wife that the journalist would soon be released.
</P>
<P>
   But on Feb. 3, the government broadcast a shaky, hand-held
videotape made by the FSB that showed Babitsky being handed over by
armed Russian soldiers to two masked men. The Kremlin explained it
had swapped Babitsky for two Russian prisoners of war and had
handed him over to Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   This development sparked outrage among freedom of speech and
human rights groups, which compared the turn of events to
Soviet-style methods of repression.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is barbarity. Journalists have been placed on the same
footing as rebels, a pen on the same footing as a bayonet,'' said
Genry Reznik, Babitsky's lawyer. ``The government says it is
fighting for our safety, but in exchange it looks to be taking our
civil rights. This should alarm all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the outcry, a second, more mysterious videotape surfaced
Wednesday. It was delivered to Radio Liberty by an unidentified man
driving a black Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, which was allegedly made last Sunday, a limp
Babitsky sits in the corner of a stark, white-walled room. He talks
in vague phrases, says he wants to go home, and reveals no hint of
where or by whom he is being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, the circumstances are such that I can't
immediately get home,'' Babitsky said. ``Things are normal here, to
the degree they can be normal in war conditions. People who are
with me are trying to somehow help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Babitsky's wife, his lawyer nor his colleagues have
heard from the journalist since the day before his disappearance,
including the period that the Russian government said Babitsky was
in its custody. They doubt the authenticity of the videos and fear
he may be dead.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the intrepid reporter comes at a critical time for
acting Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is the favored
candidate to win presidential elections scheduled for March 26.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has not commented publicly on the Babitsky case. The
Kremlin's spokesman for Chechnya, Sergei Yastrembsky, told
journalists that the acting president ``was informed'' of the
situation, but knew the details of the prisoner exchange ``only
after'' it took place.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrembsky said the government has no responsibility for
finding or ensuring the safety of its citizen, alleging Babitsky
agreed to the exchange and was in fact working for the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Having slipped through government controls to reach the front
lines of battle, Babitsky's coverage often contradicted official
information given by the Kremlin about fighting and casualties,
causing anger and embarrassment to many Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Since the onset of fighting in September, the war that Russia
describes as a fight against ``terrorists and bandits'' has been
overwhelmingly popular. Putin, seen as the architect of the Russian
offensive, has watched his popularity ratings soar from about 2
percent approval in the early fall to almost 80 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
   However, many independent observers believe that Russian
casualties in the war are at least three times higher than the
official number of approximately 2,000 dead and 3,000 wounded _ a
fact that, if it could be proven, might negatively affect Putin's
ratings. With presidential elections less than two months away,
Putin's candidacy could be damaged by such a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy restrictions on movement by journalists and aid officials
in the war zone have made it impossible to verify casualty figures.
Babitsky, though, was one of a handful of journalists who broke
through military censors and roadblocks to report firsthand on the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's colleagues and his lawyer say they have independent
evidence that Babitsky was detained on his way out of the Chechen
capital of Grozny by local Chechen militia working on the Russian
side against the rebels. The head of the unit, Bislan Gantamirov,
is the man many Kremlin officials want to head a pro-Moscow Chechen
government after the war is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Reznik alleged that Gantamirov's men held Babitsky, beat
him, then turned him over to local FSB officials for an
undetermined length of time before the exchange allegedly took
place.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't sure where Babitsky is now and don't trust FSB
statements saying the secret service has proof he is alive.
</P>
<P>
   They have been rebuffed in their attempts to speak to officials
involved in the detention and alleged exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are planting a forest of lies to hide the truth,'' Radio
Liberty's Moscow Bureau Chief Savik Schuster said about the
government's attempts to explain and update the situation.
``They've changed their story many times now. Still, no one is
taking responsibility for Babitsky's life.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ There are times _ confronting a sherbet-green
entryway in a house for sale or a globe light fixture from the
``Brady Bunch'' era _ when Ken Fulk thinks of himself as a pair of
glasses, correcting people's vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to walk into a house and say, `Oh my god, the
carpet,''' said Fulk, 34, one of a growing band of decorators
specializing in the fine art of ``staging'' or ``propping'' houses
for sale, a phenomenon that has reached epic proportions. ``My job
is to help create a frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the nation's most expensive real estate market, where it
is not uncommon to have 15 buyers in a bidding war, staging _ also
called house-dressing or ``fluffing'' _ is rapidly becoming the
norm. Eager to get top dollar, homeowners are paying $2,000 to
$10,000 to have humdrum rooms transformed into scrumptious
interiors. To professional stagers like Fulk, who has a retinue of
haulers, painters, floor and tile refinishers and carpet layers at
the ready, falls the task of eliminating the orange shag, smoked
mirrors, 1960s bathroom tile and dead plants (dead is a major
turnoff) that can stall a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Stagers are brought in, usually at the urging of a real estate
agent, to ``bring out the good features of a home,'' particularly
in aging homes, in the words of Marlene Wharmby, an Oakland stager
who propped nearly 200 houses last year and whose signature is the
telltale Tiffany box she leaves on the night stand. (Arthur
McLaughlin, a San Francisco stager, leaves chocolate kisses.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a house one way, we sell it another,'' said Malin
Giddings, a broker at TRI/Coldwell Banker, who often summons
McLaughlin to stage million-dollar listings with props plucked from
an inventory of some 20,000 items: linens, towels, plates, wingback
chairs and lampshades. ( McLaughlin buys 350 lampshades at a time.)
``He does in four days what a housewife does in nine months,''
Giddings said. ``I mean, it's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Objects that do not fit in are out. McLaughlin once asked a
client with an original Georgia O'Keeffe to put it under the bed.
``It didn't fit in with the overall decor,'' he explained. (He
prefers to have his own artist, Janet Bogardus, copy any painting,
Monet to O'Keeffe, and alter it to his own specifications _ it
might need a smidgen more peach, say.)
</P>
<P>
   Such staging tricks can give a lift to an older property and
warm up a newly minted one, said B.J. Droubi, a San Francisco real
estate agent, who estimates that staging adds $30,000 to $60,000,
often more, to the final price of a home.
</P>
<P>
   With a profusion of IPO-flush clients, the Bay Area has become
the epicenter of staging, home to some 70 professionals with names
like Stage Hands, Center Stage, Stage Right and House-Dressing.
Then there is Stage Interiors, a 10,000-square-foot warehouse
filled with rental furniture and accessories. In this town, it
sometimes seems that all the world's a stager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Staging was supposed to be about creating a facade,'' said
D.J. Grubb Jr., president of the Grubb Co., an Oakland real estate
agency, who dates the craze to the period just after 1991, when
developers were trying to lure buyers to houses they had built to
replace thousands destroyed by wildfire in the Oakland and Berkeley
Hills. Now, Grubb said, ``it has become an icon, the branding of a
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Although still largely a West Coast phenomenon _ the 1920s
hacienda outside Los Angeles owned by William Boyd, a k a Hopalong
Cassidy, was staged recently _ the trend has caught on in cities
like Minneapolis, as a strong economy and expectations among
time-pinched buyers seeking perfection grow, said Martha Webb, an
author of ``Dress Your House for Success: Five Fast, Easy Steps to
Selling Your House, Apartment or Condo for the Highest Possible
Price'' (Three Rivers Press, 1997). ``It's harder to look at a
house that's well staged,'' she said, ``because you lose your
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Droubi tries to steer buyers to houses that aren't staged, so
they won't get into bidding wars on overpriced properties. ``A
staged house evokes an emotional response _ people will pay
whatever it takes to get it,'' she said. ``I tell them to try to
see past the dirty orange shag carpeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sellers, however, are another story. ``We tell them to paint
the living room pale yellow,'' she said. ``All of a sudden, it's a
darling little house.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulk has a personality as buoyant as the sofa pillows he keeps,
along with several hundred antiques, in his barn in Napa. ``I see
so many houses filled with bad carpets and wrong decisions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon recently he paid a visit to Charlotte Albright, a
42-year-old confectioner who is selling the three-bedroom Victorian
house she shares with her schnauzer, Rocket. ``Pretty ... I would
lose it,'' he said of the yolk-colored sponge paint in the living
room. ``Let's minimize the track lights to focus on the beautiful
woodwork.'' He then turned to the delicate matter of scent.
``Anything that evokes Rocket we need to eliminate,'' he said
sweetly but sternly.
</P>
<P>
   Staging takes diplomacy. ``You really have to be polite,''
McLaughlin said. ``People's sofas are very emotional to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stagers ``depersonalize'' a space, removing family photographs
and other cherished possessions. ``You don't want buyers thinking
about who lives there,'' Fulk said. ``You want them to think about
themselves living there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not uncommon for a houseful of lovingly accumulated objects
to be banished to a garage or basement, which is what happened
recently to Antoinette Broussard, an interior designer and writer
in San Francisco. She is staying at her mother-in-law's house while
Fulk stages her house of 22 years. ``It's difficult,'' she said,
her voice tinged with sadness. ``But if you want to get the best
price, you have to take your ego out of it, put your personal
feelings aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright will spend $20,000 on staging. ``It is a little
invasive,'' she said, noting that she was feeling ``a little
protective'' of the smashed-Fiestaware tiles around the fireplace,
which Fulk deemed ``too kooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Staging requires a different knack from regular decorating.
Gray, for instance, is not a good resale color, ``because it
doesn't make a space look happy,'' McLaughlin said. Turquoise is a
turnoff, reminding people of ``the `Miami Vice' era.'' McLaughlin,
who has been staging for 18 years, possibly a national record,
recalled a client in the Pacific Heights neighborhood with
baby-blue halls and stair runners. ``Baby blue is not a resale
color, especially in a multimillion-dollar mansion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maximum wattage is another staging must. ``You want dramatic
shadows,'' he said, ``as opposed to dark, depressing shadows.''
Among the telltale signs of staging are unopened bottles of olive
oil on the kitchen counters, a dining room table set for dinner
(minus the silverware, an antitheft touch) and cozy-looking double
duvets and mattresses piled a la ``Princess and the Pea.''
Television sets, deemed ``too harsh a reality,'' in the words of
Wharmby, the Oakland stager _ are usually absent.
</P>
<P>
   Staging is a little bit like romance, McLaughlin said: ``You
never get a second chance. First impressions _ that's it!''
</P>
<P>
   For buyers, staging can present pitfalls, causing them to swoon
over day lilies artfully placed in a kitchen corner where the
refrigerator should be. ``If at first glance a place looks like a
perfect person lives there, then like nobody lives there, it's
probably been staged,'' said Bob Powers, founder of Stage Hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Holman, a lawyer for the National Association of Realtors
in Chicago, said sellers must disclose ``material defects in a
property of which they are aware,'' such as a crack in a
foundation. But strategically placing a Venetian glass vase at a
window to block an unappealing view or making a bedroom look bigger
by installing a narrow antique bed are not against the law. ``Most
buyers are unaware of staging,'' Droubi said. ``But there's a fine
line. You don't want people to feel manipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Sargent, a science professor at the University of
California at San Francisco, recently bought an 1883 house in the
Noe Valley area that had been staged by Fulk. A pewter tray on the
coffee table had green apples lined up in a grid, three on a side.
``You look at it and say: `What is this? Pottery Barn?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what appealed to Sargent was not the things that had been
staged. It was the old stove and the view of a steeple between
poplar trees. Staging, he said, ``reveals the pathology of the real
estate industry and how calculated it has become.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a recent rainy Sunday afternoon, it was difficult not to be
smitten by a humble three-bedroom bungalow on the market for
$519,000 in Piedmont, an affluent community adjoining Oakland. No
detail had been left unstaged. Lamps glowed invitingly in the front
window, and an antique cookbook lay evocatively on the breakfast
table. The house's defects _ tiny, undistinguished rooms _ seemed
like assets, the narrow antique beds and floral comforters evoking
a thatched-roof bed and breakfast in Dorset.
</P>
<P>
   Striving to instill as many feelings of home as possible,
Wharmby placed a bottle of Champagne with four antique glasses on
the dining room table. She even brought a touch of class to the
``Motel 6 bathroom,'' as she called it, taking attention away from
dated, beat-up decor with cut-glass bottles of designer perfume.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have drugstore perfume,'' she explained, summing up the
stager's art, ``it's never going to have the impact of a few
bottles of Chanel No. 5.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Hair today, grown tomorrow
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I finally got a haircut yesterday. It took me
three weeks to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, there's such a narrow window of opportunity. My
barber, being two-thirds retired, works only twice a week, which
makes it hard on everybody but him.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm too old to break in a new barber. I've been going to
Nick since I was in high school. Back then I wore a flattop, and
Nick the Barber was the local flattop king.
</P>
<P>
   I always ask him what folks are talking about. The barbershop is
still as good a barometer as any of the concerns of the community.
</P>
<P>
   Nick said people are talking about presidential politics, Bush
and McCain, Gore and Bradley. I'll tell you in one sentence what I
think. Quoting the title of the new book by that crusty old Texas
populist Jim Hightower:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote, They'd Have Given Us
Candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead we talked about hair.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lady barbers was sweeping up the hair around the
chairs, sweeping it up into a big pile and sweeping it into the
back room.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do with all that hair, Nick?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it out with the trash,'' Nick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like it'd be good for something,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is,'' Nick said. ``It's good for your garden.''
</P>
<P>
   And he told me this story:
</P>
<P>
   Billy the Barber, who cuts hair a couple of chairs down from
Nick, used to have his own shop, just a small building on the edge
of town, and he'd sweep the hair out the back door.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was the owner, along with cutting hair he also had to
cut the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he got to noticing,'' Nick said, ``how much thicker and
greener the grass was around the back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it was _ the hair mixing with the soil. Hair's
just full of nitrogen, don't you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for a fact, I didn't. But who's going to argue with a
barber named Nick when he's snipping around your ears with a pair
of scissors?
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``How much hair are you throwing away each week?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know. A couple of garbage sacks full, I'd guess,''
Nick said. ``There have been times when some customers asked us to
save it for them. That's what they did with it, fertilized their
gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder why an entrepreneur isn't trying to market
hair as a gardening supply.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the promotion: ``A Hair-Raising Experience ... Nothing's
As Good For The Old Sod As Something From The Old Nog ... Hair
Today, Grown Tomorrow ...''
</P>
<P>
   Here I was, getting my hair cut in a small window of
opportunity, and opportunity was knocking.
</P>
<P>
   Nick and I could go in as partners. With what they're sweeping
up, we could clean up, enriching ourselves along with the soil.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if we got too rich, Nick probably would want to
totally retire from cutting hair ...
</P>
<P>
   Nah, it's not worth it. I'm too old to break in a new barber. It
was probably a hairbrained idea anyway.

&HT;     NO STAIN OF GUILT ABOUT ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By REA LUBAR DUNCAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost everything I know about abortion I learned
from not being able to get one.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going back to the 1950s when abortion was still illegal in
New York state, where I lived. It wasn't until 1970 that ``abortion
without condition'' was legalized in the state and not until 1973
that the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision nationally
established abortion as a woman's fundamental right.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the question of legality didn't apply to me. Or so
I thought. I was a proper married lady with a medical history of
repeated miscarriages who already had three faulty fetuses removed
in a hospital (a Catholic hospital) by ``dilation and curettage'' _
more commonly spelled a-b-o-r-t-i-o-n.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, although I was desperately sick by the second
month of the pregnancy, I wasn't staining. So my gynecologist found
``no reason to remove the fetus.'' Yet it was as if a heavy black
poison was seeping through me, dragging me down.
</P>
<P>
   Sound crazy? The doctors thought so. Actually, it was true.
</P>
<P>
   Why now did my gynecologist unequivocally refuse to recommend a
D and C, I asked my father, a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Because it was an abortion, he explained, and unless rape could
be proved or near-certain death predicted for the mother, doctors
who performed abortions could lose their license, even go to jail.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he sent me to two gynecologists who had known me
since childhood. Fear overcame friendship. Recommend a D and C? No
way.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto several other doctors I sought out on my own.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time then, in desperation, I considered an illegal
abortion although, as a doctor's daughter and because of personal
conviction, it was not my style. Had I not been so terribly sick, I
would happily have had the baby.
</P>
<P>
   In the medical community, of course, a few ``good abortionists''
were known _ to whom the ``cleanest'' doctors sometimes sent
patients, evaluating, for whatever reason, the need greater than
the law. But I was in my fourth month and my father thought it
dangerous to have the fetus removed except in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since I was sick. At least he believed me. No one
else did.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't till my 24th week that my father suggested a possible
solution. Demeaning. A lie. If a psychiatrist would attest that I
was emotionally incapable of rearing a child, a legal abortion
might be allowed. So, once more, this time to the psychiatrist, I
repeated the story I had told so often and so painfully that it was
difficult for me to speak.
</P>
<P>
   That did it. His diagnosis said that I was so disturbed, I
``frequently could not talk,'' a condition that evidently precluded
child-rearing.
</P>
<P>
   This opus won an OK from my gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   How ironic that now, when I no longer needed blood proof, I
should start to stain steadily. Better late than never, I thought.
At least I no longer needed to be certified.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The psychiatrist's report was posted on the outside of my
hospital door for staff, cleaning help and the visiting public to
read.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was no abortion, no D and C. Since the fetus was,
as a nurse told me, ``the size of a grapefruit,'' the doctor
induced labor to expel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have lost them anyway,'' the doctor pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   Them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there were two of them, both dead, boy twins.''
</P>
<P>
   The first twins in our families.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been dead a long time and poisoning you from the
start,'' the doctor calmly stated. ``It was amazing you didn't
develop fatal toxemia. Had they lived and you'd gone full term,
they would have been born deformed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all a very long time ago, but still so painful that this is
the first time I've been able to put the words down for public
reading. Why now? Maybe my need to give another view, an intimately
personal view, into the public abortion controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-choice? Whose? The mother's? The doctor's? The law's?
</P>
<P>
   Pro-life? Whose? The mother's? The child's? And by whose
decision?
</P>
<P>
   I still long for those twins. But no, not deformed.

 COMPUTER COLUMN: AOL 5.0: TAKEOVER ARTIST IN YOUR COMPUTER (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some 21 million people now use America Online as their portal to
the Internet, because it is easier to use than most alternatives.
And for people who are just getting started in the online world,
AOL does have many advantages. It streamlines the process of
setting up an Internet account, and offers a large collection of
content and services, including highly popular services like
instant messaging, buddy lists and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But for anyone who connects to the Internet through another
Internet service provider, or through a business network, the
newest version of AOL 5.0 can cause all sorts of problems.
</P>
<P>
   The problems arise because AOL 5.0, under certain circumstances,
commandeers the network settings of the user's Windows-based
computer. During the installation process, one of the instruction
boxes on screen asks if the user wants AOL to be the user's primary
Internet connection. ``No'' is the default choice. Clicking ``yes''
invites AOL to move in and rewrite the settings so that the
computer connects to AOL whenever the user wants to browse the Web,
send or receive e-mail, or do any other online activities. At the
same time, however, it disables the network configurations needed
to gain access to the Internet through other service providers.
</P>
<P>
   It is the equivalent of the invited house guest who moves in,
raids the refrigerator, rearranges the furniture, borrows the car,
hogs the phone line and steals the remote control for the
television. And the guest will not leave unless you file eviction
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Some users complain on Internet message boards that they never
invited AOL 5.0 to be their primary Internet connection, but that
it moved in anyway. And some say that filing the eviction notice _
basically, uninstalling AOL 5.0 and reinstituting the network
settings in a time-consuming process _ did not fully dislodge AOL
5.0 from their systems. Some people said they ultimately had to
reformat their hard drives, in effect burning down the house as a
last resort to get the unwanted visitor to leave. It prompted one
computer magazine to call AOL 5.0 the ``upgrade of death.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL was sued this month in U.S. District Court in Alexandria,
Va., by a Maryland law firm whose partners were upset with the
installation features of AOL 5.0. The lawsuit seeks class-action
status and up to $1,000 in damages for each of the estimated 8
million AOL users who have downloaded and installed AOL 5.0. The
lawsuit contends that AOL ``violates ordinary consumer deceptive
practices law, federal and state statutes,'' including one that
bars interference with the use of computers.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL spokeswoman said the lawsuit ``is without merit and has
no basis in fact or in law.'' AOL has not indicated its plans for
responding to the lawsuit, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company concedes that version 5.0 aggressively takes control
of the user's computer, but it rejects complaints that doing so is
wrong, even when there are no warnings to the consumer about the
technical consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing AOL as the default service allows the software to
rewrite settings so that the computer automatically dials AOL,
instead of asking users to manually select AOL as the dialer each
time they go on line.
</P>
<P>
   AOL says that its rivals, including AT&AMP;T Worldnet, MSN,
Mindspring and Earthlink, all set themselves up as the default
dialer at installation. In a news release issued after the lawsuit,
AOL contends that AT&AMP;T and Prodigy reset themselves as the default
even if the user chooses otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   AOL asserts that it reprograms the customer's network settings
only to make the computer less complicated to use, and only if the
user deliberately designates AOL as the primary Internet
connection. ``Our mainstream customers depend on us to take all
that complex stuff and make it all work for them,'' said Barry
Schuler, president of AOL's interactive services division. ``These
are people who don't want to get into the operating system
configuration level of the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, saying ``yes'' to AOL simplifies your life by
disabling connections to rival online services, to company network
connections and to alternative e-mail systems. A cynic might note
that disabling rival software directly translates into profits for
AOL. Advertisers and e-commerce companies pay AOL hundreds of
millions of dollars each year to deliver consumers to them, and
disabling alternative network connections makes it more likely that
AOL customers will stay with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   But, Schuler said, fewer than 10 percent of AOL's 21 million
subscribers have multiple Internet service providers. The rest are
not affected by the Internet default settings. And to be fair, some
AOL users who do have multiple Internet connections, including me,
had no problem with the installation. However, I had learned to
click ``no'' only after AOL 4.0 completely trashed my network
connections on another machine. Given the choice of making AOL 5.0
my default Internet connection, I would have clicked ``Over My Dead
Body.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said this week that AOL's customers have given the 5.0
upgrade the highest satisfaction ratings ever measured for an
upgrade version. He said that AOL maintains a customer support
staff of 8,000 people, and that there have been so few complaints
lodged against AOL 5.0's network banditry since its introduction
last October that ``it doesn't even register on our radar.'' Still,
he said, the company is offering free technical support to anyone
who needs help configuring the software.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, AOL says that it is not a significant problem,
and that even if it were a significant problem, it is the
customer's fault, not AOL's. Besides, AOL says, it is not doing
anything that its rivals do not do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   AOL clearly appeals to millions of people, but it also attracts
the scorn of many Internet users. Many of its critics remember when
AOL was synonymous with constant busy signals, dropped connections,
slow connection speeds, proprietary Web-browsing and e-mail
software that was truly lousy, sloppy security practices, poor
e-mail connections with the outside world, heavy-handed censoring
of content, torrents of unsolicited e-mail advertising (commonly
known as spam), and obnoxious pop-up advertisements that were in
your face from the first time you logged on until you logged off,
or got dropped, whichever came first.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, many of these criticisms still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Also, AOL has been a favorite playground for hackers, swindlers
and ``social engineers'' who prey on the relative lack of
sophistication of new users to troll for passwords and credit card
information.
</P>
<P>
   So why do millions of new users flock to the service each year,
when AOL's closest rivals, Earthlink and Mindspring, consistently
score higher in national customer satisfaction polls? No doubt part
of the answer is that AOL's aggressive marketing campaigns bombard
potential users with free disks and free trial offers, and AOL
software comes installed on many new computers. If you thought it
was hard to avoid AOL disks already, just wait until AOL's new
partner, the media behemoth Time Warner, starts hawking AOL in
magazines and on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But the true basis of its sustained and growing popularity is
that AOL makes it easy for novices and casual computer users to go
online. Despite the horrors encountered by AOL customers who click
``yes,'' and even some who click ``no,'' the new version 5.0 does
make connections more reliable _ assuming one does not use any
service other than AOL.

   It is also apparent that AOL has grown so large, and so
ambitious, that it is attracting the kind of animosity in the
high-tech world that until now has been directed chiefly at another
behemoth, Microsoft. The acquisition of Time Warner gives AOL
almost unimaginable power in the media world. Like Microsoft, AOL
is becoming arrogant and cavalier in its treatment of customers. It
was Microsoft's idea, after all, to make ``default'' Internet
connections a feature of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   But although AOL has many more direct competitors than
Microsoft, even Microsoft's radar screen reveals upstarts like
Linux and the Macintosh, which are achieving popularity as much
from their users' fear of Microsoft as from their technical merits.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the introduction of AOL 5.0, Steve Case, the
company's chief executive, was quoted in news reports as saying,
``You stop thinking about AOL as a screen-based, PC-based,
telephone-based service and start thinking of it as a set of
capabilities embedded throughout your life.''
</P>
<P>
   I prefer not to embed things in my life that limit my choices.
For people who do not mind having AOL turn their computers into
dedicated AOL terminals, AOL 5.0 is an easy choice.
</P>
<P>
   For everyone else, just click no.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The southern periphery of an arctic air mass over Canada will
gradually spread into the northern tier of states from the Rockies
to New England on Thursday. Meanwhile, unseasonably mild air will
linger from the southern Plains to the Middle Atlantic coast. A
wavering front separating the air masses will be the focus for a
series of disturbances that will produce inclement weather from
coast to coast during the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Mild conditions will linger Thursday from southern New England
to the Southeastern states. Sunshine will be plentiful in the
Southeast but clouds will increase farther north as a front moves
slowly south through New England and the eastern Great Lakes. North
of the front, a few inches of snow will accumulate in the cold air
mass across the central Great Lakes States . A narrow band of sleet
and freezing rain is expected across southern parts of Michigan and
Ontario where there will be a shallower layer of cold air. The snow
and ice will spread into northern New England tonight while
scattered rain showers develop farther south.
</P>
<P>
   The northern and central Plains will be much colder than recent
days as high pressure moves south from Saskatchewan. A broken band
of light snow and flurries will occur where moist winds ascend the
sloping terrain near the east slopes of the northern Rockies. A
band of heavier snow may develop in northern Kansas and Nebraska on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Patchy valley rain and mountain snow will cover much of the
interior West. The Pacific Northwest will stay mainly dry.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: High Pressure Snow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robust winter high pressure systems are crucial to many
snowstorms because they are mounds of cold air near the surface of
the earth. When warm, moist air is flung north ahead of a low, it
is lifted over cold air, setting the stage for snow. Without a
strong high, cold air is eroded by warm air, thereby curtailing the
lifting, which, in turn, limits the severity of the snowstorm.
During the next few days, sprawling high pressure in Canada will
channel a mound of cold air into the northern tier of states
heightening the risk of significant snow from the northern Plains
to the interior Northeast. &QL;

GETTING COLORS RIGHT WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

 By CATHERINE GREENMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You still can't brush your cheek against that fuzzy blue blanket
before you buy it online. But E-Color, a San Francisco-based
computer graphics company, has introduced a technology to help
reassure online shoppers that what they see, at least, is what they
get.
</P>
<P>
   True Internet Color, as the technology is called, adjusts a Web
site image's colors so visitors ordering clothes or home
furnishings, for example, will see them exactly as they were
intended to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make a difference in terms of what something actually
looks like,'' said Richard Gravely, president and chief executive
of ArtEx, an online art gallery scheduled to begin operating this
summer that will feature True Internet Color.
</P>
<P>
   The technology works by recording information about how a
monitor displays color, taking into account factors like the
computer's video card configurations, the monitor's control
settings and environmental lighting.
</P>
<P>
   True Internet Color is activated by a software module that
requires a brief download from either the E-Color Web site or from
an Internet site that has licensed it. The computer user clicks on
several color fields, answering questions about how certain colors
are being displayed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, any site the user visits that has True Internet
Color will remember the viewer's monitor settings, much like an
Internet cookie remembers where a site visitor has been within a
site during a previous visit.
</P>
<P>
   An icon in the lower-right-hand corner of the viewer's computer
screen indicates whether or not the site being visited is using
True Internet Color. A ball encircled by a red streak indicates
yes, a red X in front of the ball indicates no.
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers who have licensed True Internet Color include
Bloomingdales.com; MXGonline.com, a shopping site for teen-agers;
and Indulge.com, a luxury goods and accessories site.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdales.com is the only site where True Internet Color is
up and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``The benefit for us is being able to give consumers one less
thing to worry about,'' said Carrie Rocco, vice president of sales
and marketing at Indulge.com, a beauty and spa products site that
plans to incorporate True Internet Color in April. ``This should
help them feel that they will get what they're expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatiana Rosak, director of e-commerce at Bloomingdale's in New
York City, said the technology also helps give the viewer a better
idea of what fabrics look like. ``It lets them see some of the
textural detail, like if it's a herringbone or a houndstooth
pattern,'' she said. ``We think it's important to represent the
items on our site as closely as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   But the color accuracy of the camera used to produce the Web
image is another factor, according to Richard Herbert, executive
vice president of Pantone Inc. in Carlstadt, N.J. ``The main
limitation is the accuracy of the image as compared to the original
item,'' he said. ``A color-calibrated monitor alone is ineffective
unless the source of the image has been identified under standard
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Pantone has provided the fashions and home
furnishings industries with a uniform system in which colors are
identified by numbers. The company is trying to do the same for
online retailers and shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pushing a shop-by-color strategy, not a
view-better-color strategy, which doesn't really let people shop
for color-compatible clothing across different Web sites,'' Herbert
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is working with more than 30 online retailers to
help them include color information about products, Herbert said.
Pantone is also creating a color chart, which will either be given
away by the online retailers or available to them at a nominal
price.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers will be able to go to a Web site, view an item of
clothing, say, and pull up a list of numbers representing colors
that the item comes in. They can then compare the numbers on the
screen with the color guide in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be able to compare what they see on the screen with a
guide at their desk, without having to guess,'' Herbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pantone system will also use software that calibrates
computer color. &QL;

<P>
   Sleek, simple and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a throwback to an earlier age when television
commercials hawked space-age-design electric ranges and
bullet-nosed vacuum cleaners, but the phrase is resurfacing to
describe a new class of computers called Internet appliances that
are so, well, sleek, simple and easy to use that they barely seem
to qualify as computers.
</P>
<P>
   As the category suggests, Net appliances _ with cute names like
i-opener, I-Brow, I-Station and Qubit Web Tablet _ act more like
microwaves than mainframes. Push a button, and they are on, up and
running. And you don't have to be a computer science major to keep
these things humming. Actually, Internet appliances don't have
moving parts, so they don't hum, rattle or rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about these friendly machines guiding NASA probes or even
navigating the intricacies of your income taxes. These computers,
endowed with modest microprocessors and even more modest memory and
onboard storage, are aimed squarely at getting consumers cheaply,
quickly and almost effortlessly onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For ease of use, most of these computers will come with
factory-set function keys that literally put weather, e-commerce,
news and other Internet services like e-mail and virtual address
books at the user's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   On the first appliance to appear on the market, the $299
i-opener, there is even a function key for pizza. Press it, and the
machine's 10-inch, color screen pops up a Web site, complete with
an order form, for a local pizza parlor. Other devices have preset
e-commerce sites to deliver everything from music CDs to steamed
mussels.
</P>
<P>
   This new wave of PC-lite Internet machines is arriving on a wave
ushering in what many computer experts are calling the post-PC age,
in which access to the Internet's goodies will no longer be
exclusive to conventional computers. Other devices, like
WebTV-style set-top boxes, handheld personal data assistants like
the Palm VII, Web phones and even game consoles like Sega's
Dreamcast, will increasingly give users quick, easy access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Acer and several other companies, big
and small, are preparing to offer Internet-only terminals by the
summer. Many are expected to cost from $200 to $400, and some may
even be given to consumers free in exchange, for example, for
signing up for broadband Internet service to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new category of candy that the consumer is going to
no doubt find irresistible,'' said Michael Dunstan, senior manager
of the Acer America Corp., which this summer will release the
I-Station, an inexpensive Internet-only terminal with a bright
liquid crystal display color screen and a wireless keyboard, as
well as a sister machine sold as one of the MSN Web Companion
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Internet appliance manufacturers are trying to reach the almost
48 million American households _ almost half of all the nation's
households _ that do not have computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to target that 48 percent,'' said B.J. Riseland,
product manager at Microsoft Network, which will soon release an
Internet appliance. ``We've found that people don't have computers
for a couple of reasons: cost and complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to a PC, it is a fairly easy purchase,'' said Marc
Warshawsky, manager of information appliance platform development
for Compaq. ``I would say that these kinds of products have a great
amount of appeal to the so-called offline world, people not
involved in the PC world or the Internet world.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the machines do not have hard drives, so they are not
capable of storing very much on their limited flash memory. None of
the machines aimed at American markets have input devices like
CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or even floppy drives, so playing Tomb Raider or
making a spreadsheet in Microsoft Office will have to wait for the
full-function personal computer to boot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal computer has a lot of functionality that a lot of
people don't necessarily need,'' said Bryan Ma, consumer device
analyst for the International Data Corp., a consulting group that
tracks global technology information.
</P>
<P>
   Ma said he was optimistic that Internet appliances would become
mass market devices because consumers are increasingly unwilling to
pay for expensive and hard-to-maintain computer bells and whistles,
features that many never wanted anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all they want to do is go on the Web,'' Ma said, ``then an
information appliance might be all they need.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riseland, echoing the sentiments of other Internet appliance
makers, said that the appliances are not intended only for the
technological have-nots. Manufacturers hope that Internet
appliances will also serve as convenient companion technologies to
people who are happy with their computers but want a faster, easier
way to go online. Many makers of Internet appliances, after all,
are heavily invested in the future of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   A simple way of understanding the difference between an Internet
appliance and a personal computer, Dunstan of Acer said, is to
think of a PC as a kitchen stove that can do lots of things _ bake,
cook, fry. Then think of an information appliance as a coffee
maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can brew coffee on a stove, but you can do it a lot easier
with a coffee maker,'' Dunstan said. ``That's the whole idea. An
Internet appliance does one or two things really, really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Martin and her husband, Chuck, were among the first to buy
an i-opener, just before Christmas last year. They did so because
they didn't like bothering with the family's home computer, a
10-year-old Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin, a 39-year-old homemaker, said the family, which
includes two children, uses the i-opener ``a lot more'' than it
used the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We check it for weather or the news,'' she said, ``and all we
have to do is hit a button and it tells us what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Martin, senior pastor of Fellowship of the Hills Church near
his family's home in Austin, Texas, said he thinks of the Mac and
the i-opener as separate kinds of devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to do anything from play games to create documents,
I go use the Mac,'' Mr. Martin said. ``If I want to just send
e-mail, check someone on the Web, order tickets, call out for
pizza, I do it on the i-opener. On that machine I don't have to sit
down and wait for it to boot up, get the right program and wait for
a few windows to open up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martins keep their i-opener on a countertop between the
living room and the kitchen. ``I'm on it all the time,'' Ms. Martin
said. ``I imagine myself as Jane Jetson.''
</P>
<P>
   The i-opener, made and managed by Austin-based Netpliance, has
paid a bit of a price to be the first Net appliance on the market.
The i-opener's keyboard is attached with an unslightly Y-cable for
anyone wishing to use an optional mouse rather than the
keyboard-based pointer.Several other soon-to-be-offered Internet
appliances use wireless keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, setting up the i-opener is almost as simple as
plugging in a telephone answering machine. Several users said they
were surprised to discover that once the machine was plugged in to
the telephone and power lines, it automatically dialed its access
numbers and configured itself in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The i-opener delivered on its promise to provide quick and easy
access to the Internet. The pre-set function keys quickly fetched
weather and news information over a standard telephone line and a
built-in 56K modem. Only occasionally and after many hours of use
did the machine freeze. Pressing the Hang Up key and letting it
reconnect to the Internet solved the problem in a couple of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The i-opener, which uses an operating system that is a variation
of Linux, had no trouble playing streaming audio and then playing,
for example, Internet radio through its tiny, built-in speakers.
But it could not play streaming video, locking users out of some of
the hottest offerings on the World Wide Web. Officials for i-opener
said the device is not equipped to handle streaming video, but
later versions of the machine are more likely to.
</P>
<P>
   Munira Fareed, director of product marketing for Netpliance,
said the i-opener, which weighs about 5 pounds and relies on 32
megabytes of random access memory and 16 MB of flash memory, uses a
lot of compression technologies to manage its data. And much like
the WebTV set-top box, i-opener automatically goes online
periodically to update and store information like weather and news
that consumers are likely to want very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   By caching the information, Fareed explained, the i-opener does
not have to go online every time someone presses the weather key.
</P>
<P>
   With some mostly minor variations in style and feel, most of the
Internet appliances to be released this year will probably have a
flat, laptoplike monitor, a keyboard and a 56K modem. Some will be
equipped to accommodate high-speed broadband access.
</P>
<P>
   David Armitage, chief executive and founder of Qubit Technology,
is banking on a wireless variation on the theme: the Qubit Web
Tablet is scheduled for release by July. Looking very little like
the competition, the Qubit is basically a handheld touch screen
with a few buttons on its border. When a user touches virtual
buttons on its 10-inch, color LCD screen _ much like using an
automated teller machine _ the device uses radio waves to
communicate with a separate module about the size of two packs of
playing cards that will connect to the Internet through either a
56K, digital subscriber line or cable modem. Indoors, the device's
range will be about 250 feet, Armitage said. The Qubit can be
seated in a recharging cradle that also houses a pullout, wireless
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Qubit Web Tablet is expected to be about $400
when it reaches retail shelves by Christmas, Armitage said. But
consumers are more likely, he said, to be introduced to the
2.5-pound Qubit by way of a telecommunications or cable company or
Internet service provider using it as part of a service package.
The Qubit will be able to use most ISPs, including America Online
and MSN, unlike some of the other devices, like the i-opener, which
uses only its own Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to use the information appliance as a Trojan
horse for becoming an Internet service provider and then lock you
in,'' Armitage said. ``I want to deliver an experience that is
different from a PC to homes that may already have an ISP and may
not want to switch.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether consumers will shop and browse the Web with
a wireless touch-screen pad or even buy a stripped-down,
Internet-only computer is a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honest answer,'' said Dunstan at Acer, ``is that it is an
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, computer hardware and software designers widely
agree that the near future will be one marked with
Internet-connected devices practically everywhere and always ready
to offer a virtual hand. Lamar Potts, vice president of marketing
for Be, said in the next couple of years the average American can
expect to own an Interned-connected stereo, kitchen appliances like
toasters and refrigerators. And all of the devices wordlessly
chatting with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications, a technology consulting group, projects
that by 2002 the average American household will have 2.7 online
devices.
</P>
<P>
   In time, said Potts, ``you are going to have one literally in
every room of your house.''

READY _ SET _ FLIRT!! IT MAKES LIFE WORTHWHILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The master flirt may have been 56, but he wasn't past his prime;
a true flirt ages well, because he grows wise, learns to listen,
gains patience. It was 1972. The master approached Peggy Lipton,
the twentysomething starlet of the TV hit ``The Mod Squad,'' as he
had approached a thousand other women. His opening line was like a
martini: dry, straight up, perfect. ``Would you let an old man buy
you a cup of coffee?''
</P>
<P>
   And so Frank Sinatra began another romance, initiated over a
not-so-innocent cup of joe. His succinct introduction showed what a
perfect flirt he was: assured but self-deprecating, indicating
strength and] vulnerability. Nevertheless, it wasn't a skill that
came naturally to him. Sinatra had developed his flirtatious charm
over decades of such encounters. ``I'm supposed to have a Ph.D. on
the subject of women,'' he once said, ``but the truth is I've
flunked more often than not.'' Still, Sinatra knew enough to pass
on advice. ``Make her feel appreciated. Make her feel beautiful. If
you practice long enough, you'll know when you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the rub: practice. Most people think flirts are born,
not made. Wrong. Flirting is serious business, a pastime worthy of
intense study, something that should be worked at, for it is never
mastered. If a gasser like Frank, the heppest cat ever, professed
confusion over the object his affections, how could Clydes like us
think it comes naturally?
</P>
<P>
   But diligence is not all that makes a flirt. To be great at
flirting, it takes many things that you can work on, but one thing
you can't: You must love women. Or men. Whichever, but you must
love them, all of them, no matter their age or appearance. Flirtees
can sense whether your attention is conditional. It's what makes
the difference between a flirt and a lech.
</P>
<P>
   My friend says Italians can't help but be flirtatious. (This
friend is Italian. Sinatra was Italian. Me, Italian.) He says it's
who we are, what we do. We spread smiles and winks. We are, he
says, born with this tendency. (Tendency, not skill; it still must
be put to use and refined.)
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence from my life suggests that he's correct. My
first inkling that I was a serial flirter came when I took three
dates to my ninth-grade prom. I felt like ol' blue eyes that
evening: dapper in my baby-blue tux and feathered hair, walking
into the steak house for dinner with Diane, Kim and Angie at my
side. We laughed, made silly dares, sipped our cokes over ice. Full
of fine food and soda, we were whisked by limo to the prom, where
each of the ladies persuaded other young men to take them out
dancing, leaving me solo. Sure, it's pathetic, but the point is
that I got what I wanted most: a legendary night of flirting. (At
least, that's how I choose to remember it.)
</P>
<P>
   It runs in the family. My grandfather, Alfonse, to this day is
an irrepressible flirt. No woman has ever walked through his door
and not been wooed. ``My Lord!'' he exclaimed when I introduced him
to my wife, ``Son, you don't deserve beauty like this!'' To him,
women are worthy of high drama. He wandered out of his kitchen,
where he'd been singing Italian opera and watching over a simmering
pot of tomato gravy. He took her hand and said, in a serious low
tone, ``My dear, he may love you, but I'll] cook for you.''
</P>
<P>
   My saint of a grandmother would watch these displays and beam.
She seemed to take as much joy in her husband's compliments when
directed at others as when they were given to her. (Which was
often. To be allowed withdrawals from the marital flirting bank,
one must make frequent deposits.)
</P>
<P>
   My wife has somewhat the same reaction, as I take after
Grandfather Alfonse quite a bit. Some women worry about men like
me, though, saying that flirting sends a signal that a man is not
satisfied in his relationship. I say that one has nothing to do
with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it's natural. Consider the South American titi monkey,
one of the world's most monogamous creatures. (Certainly more so
than humans, according to anthropologists, some of whom classify
Homo sapiens as ``slightly polygamous.'') Titi monkeys are so in
tune with their mates that they will spend hours every day going
through a petting and fawning ritual to make sure their mate is
completely happy. If you want to bother a titi monkey, take away
its offspring. If you want to make one wig out and wail, take away
its mate. We're talking commitment. Yet even the titi monkeys
flirt. They occasionally pay special attention to other monkeys who
aren't their mates, if only to remind themselves they still have
``it.''
</P>
<P>
   Flirting ``is not done just to get sex or marriage or any
serious goal,'' says Susan Rabin, author of three books on flirting
and director of the School of Flirting in New York City. ``It is
done for the joy of it, the joy of being charming and playful and
flirtatious.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless olives are involved. Then, the flirting might get a
little hot. A single female friend tells the story of a man she
recently met at a health-food market. Through some form of
flirtatious magic, he ended up feeding her an olive to see if she
wanted to purchase them. Olive. Chew. Smile. Another olive. Chew.
Smile. Third time, with the charm. As she put it, ``Not a bad
day.''
</P>
<P>
   You can find a flirt anywhere. Freud knew a good flirt when he
saw one. In analyzing a type of man who sees his love as a way to
``rescue'' women, he mentions a patient ``who knew how to win his
ladies by clever methods of seduction and subtle arguments. ...''
</P>
<P>
   One of the best flirts I've ever known is one of the ugliest men
I've ever known. He is quite overweight, dresses horribly, often
looks unwashed and generally appears psychotic. Women love him.
Why? Simple. ``Dude, I don't know what it is,'' he once told me.
``I guess it's just that I love women. I love to be around them. I
love to hear them speak. I love to see them smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to my final point, but the most important: To flirt,
or to be flirted with, simply feels good. Flirting is about
laughter, it's about nourishing the ego minus the id. It's about
hitting that small, vibrant note in someone's life, an inner chord
that, when plucked, makes you blush. These moments suggest an
intimacy, something that makes you feel connected to people in
simple, sexy ways. One friend I always enjoy talking to at parties
is a young woman who, whenever she sees me, says the same thing:
``You look wonderful.'' I know she only says it to embarrass me, to
make me uncomfortable in a lighthearted way, but it never fails to
make me smile. It's a socially acceptable thrill, and how few of
those are left?
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to be careful when you flirt? Sure. You never know
when you might say or do the wrong thing. Mark Cuban, the Dallas
Mavericks owner, recently ran into my wife at a radio station, and
he struck up a conversation. He noticed the Cartoon Network shirt
she was wearing. ``I love Cartoon Network,'' the billionaire said,
touching her shirt. ``I watch Johnny Bravo] every chance I get.''
What was the wrong thing my wife did? Nothing, that's what. Well,
she giggled. But that's unsatisfactory. The man is a billionaire.
She should have pushed the flirting into high gear, maybe scored
some good Mavs tickets. She could have at least batted her eyes. Or
maybe offered to buy him a cup of coffee. That always works.

COMMENTARY: SCHOOLTEACHERS ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a shoeshine stand at the elegant Nordstrom store in the
Westchester Mall north of New York City, and on Sundays the man
snapping a cloth over loafers and oxfords is Timo Hughes. Although
the customers tip him well, his is not the classical tale of a
pauper or immigrant trying to buff his way up the American ladder
on a smile and someone else's shoeshine.
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week, Timo Hughes works as a sixth-grade teacher in
the Bronx. Despite 10 years of classroom experience and a master's
degree, he is moonlighting to supplement his $42,000-a-year pay.
</P>
<P>
   Moonlighting is something 40 percent of America's teachers do,
according to union surveys. The Brooklyn shop clerk from whom the
former New York City schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola buys his
pasta is a teacher. Teachers have been encountered after hours
selling perfume in department stores, working as waiters and
hawking hot dogs at sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, a 38-year-old bachelor, does not see shining shoes as
beneath his dignity. He does his scruffy work in an incongruous but
proud uniform of red bow tie and white shirt, wielding his
horsehair brush and his cloth with verve and panache. Even in his
job as a teacher, he considers himself a working stiff, a wage
earner whose heart was with the subway and bus workers when they
won a new contract in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at people on Wall Street making a killing,'' he said,
``and then you have these guys taking them to work every day, and
they're struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Hughes unmindful that teachers' having to scavenge for
second jobs says much about the way Americans regard the
profession. Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, puts it bluntly: ``The values here are totally skewed.
Look at countries we're competing with like Singapore, China,
Scandinavia. In those countries, teachers are among the
highest-paid salaried employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Education seems to be the issue du jour. Presidential candidates
and chief executives alike push for tougher standards, longer
hours, a longer school year. Yet thoughtful students of education
acknowledge that no remedy will be worth a stick of chalk unless
the quality of the teaching force itself is greatly enhanced,
particularly in the nation's cities, where skill and pay lag those
of the suburbs substantially. There is no more important ingredient
in the fragile chemistry of learning than the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Asking for an increase in standards while offering poor pay
means that the schools will continue to attract the bottom layer of
college graduates, those who barely pass their licensing
examinations. State data released in November showed that 31
percent of New York City teachers had failed their main
certification exam at least once, compared with only 4.7 percent of
the teachers elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a wide pay gap, the disparity in teacher quality
between city and suburb is not likely to narrow very soon. New York
City teachers, who three decades ago earned more than their
counterparts in the Westchester County communities of Scarsdale and
Bronxville and made the city's schools the envy of the nation, now
earn 25 percent less than the Scarsdale and Bronxville teachers.
Forget the chasm between their salaries and those of young
investment bankers: after five years' employment, New York City
teachers earn less than trash collectors _ $39,500, as against
$45,900.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching began to suffer 30 years ago, when women, the backbone
of the profession, drifted toward greener pastures in banking, law
and medicine, fields that had been only marginally open to them.
Even those who remain as teachers find it increasingly hard to
justify continuing with a career that pays so little. That is why
in New York City a record 14,000 teachers are expected to retire in
the next 18 months. Many of them will end up doing what they
already do _ but in the suburbs, at higher pay, while collecting a
city pension. The suburbs are raiding the city's best teaching
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the nation's teacher unions are not the most trustworthy
advocates. Their lobbying and bargaining share blame for the fact
that the most seasoned teachers end up in the most middle-class,
congenial working environments; that too many children are assigned
to special education, which provides jobs for teachers; that
merit-pay proposals languish. But it is hard to argue with their
point that teachers as a whole, who after all are cultivating
future generations, need to be more highly paid.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a sentimental look back, but those who grew up in a
world before our reverence for authority figures was shattered
remember when teachers were regarded as icons of order and trust.
Those people would be disheartened to see their teachers shining
shoes to make a decent living.

 &HT;    ADMINISTRATION TRIES TO COOL IRE OVER CDC BUDGET
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control,
bracing for a congressional grilling, can expect the heat to be
turned down a few notches Thursday at a congressional hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by CDC director Jeffrey P. Koplan and Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala to reassure lawmakers have
apparently diffused some of the anger over findings that some
officials intentionally misled Congress on how they spent CDC
research money.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the efforts to address this problem provide some degree
of reassurance,'' said Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., chairman of
the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees the agency
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to see how satisfied I am, and members are, with what
Dr. Koplan is going to tell us and whether this is sufficient to
alleviate concerns about inaccurate information being provided to
Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Porter's remarks contrasted with his announcement last week that
he was summoning a half-dozen top CDC officials for lengthy
questioning to ``straighten out'' the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the hearing postponed a day because of funeral for
former House Speaker Carl Albert, but it was also abbreviated, with
only Dr. Koplan called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said he expected Koplan to address charges that his
agency misstated the amount spent on researching chronic fatigue
syndrome and the hantavirus. An investigation by a federal
inspector general found that CDC had misled Congress, which had
designated funding for the two diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Koplan, who has spent part of the week making private visits on
Capitol Hill, is expected to outline internal changes and greater
external scrutiny for his agency's budgeting team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take this very seriously,'' Koplan said in a statement
issued Wednesday in Atlanta. ``CDC staff work hard every day to
protect the health of Americans and must have the support and trust
of Congress to do that. We are taking corrective actions to fix our
problems and working to restore the trust of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala also assured Porter's subcommittee that her department
would step up oversight and require all CDC budget officials to
undergo training.
</P>
<P>
   Porter said that lawmakers don't blame Koplan for problems that
predated his tenure, but he said that he would seek assurance that
the budget irregularities are not part of ``a culture of the entire
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Koplan can satisfy lawmakers in Porter's subcommittee,
the CDC is not off the hook yet.
</P>
<P>
   The House Commerce Committee on Tuesday launched a separate
investigation of the agency. Chairman Thomas Bliley sent a letter
to the CDC seeking internal audit report, changes made in reports
to Congress, and travel expenses of CDC Viral Division Chief Brian
Mahy. Bliley asked for the documents by Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., has formally asked the Justice
Department to open a criminal probe into whether any CDC officials
intentionally lied to Congress. The Justice Department has not
announced a decision.

 &HT;    Political ticker: End of campaign trail for Forbes
 &HT;    EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After spending more than $66 million of his own money in a
relentless six-year bid for political viability, publisher Steve
Forbes abandoned his second presidential campaign Wednesday with
little to show for his investment. The shy, bookish conservative
called it quits after third-place finishes in the New Hampshire and
Delaware primaries. His advisers said Forbes would announce the
withdrawal decision Wednesday in New Jersey, his home state.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S ON TO SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Wednesday toward a collision in South Carolina,
George W. Bush said his 2-to-1 victory in Delaware's GOP
presidential primary will buoy his supporters, while John McCain
claimed he'll get a boost for finishing second in a state he
bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   CLOUD OF NEGATIVITY HOVERS
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining major GOP contenders wasted no time today in
making a pitch for conservative publisher Steve Forbes' supporters.
Each steered his campaign toward issues, with George W. Bush
focusing on legal reforms and frivolous lawsuits, and John McCain
talking about a ``Veterans' Bill of Rights'' including geriatric
care and other improved benefits. But increasing character attacks
threaten to drown out all else in their battle for the crucial
South Carolina primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   `PRO-LIFE' ACTIVIST FINDS ANOTHER CANDIDATE
</P>
<P>
   A prominent South Carolina anti-abortion activist and backer of
Steve Forbes, Horry County Christian Coalition Chairman Lois
Eargle, endorsed John McCain on Wednesday. ``He is the strongest
pro-life candidate in the race,'' the National Journal's Political
Hotline quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS TURN TO EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley and Al Gore focused tightly on education Wednesday.
Bradley was in St. Louis, describing an $8.5 billion proposal to
double funding for the main program financing schools in distress
and triple money for charter schools. He argued that the Clinton
administration has been ``long on promises and short on progress.''
Gore was in Detroit, detailing his proposal for a national
college-tuition savings program and pre-school program for all
4-year-olds. He said Bradley discovered the education issue only
after ``14 months have passed in this presidential campaign and
three states have had elections'' rejecting him.
</P>
<P>
   BUT DOES BRADLEY SPEAK HIGHLY OF TRUMP?
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump, in St. Louis to speak at a Tony Robbins motivation
seminar, was asked if he will really enter the presidential race.
``We'll make that determination next week,'' he said. Learning that
Bill Bradley also was in St. Louis, the Post-Dispatch said he
``chuckled'' and added that he wanted Bradley to know what he
thought of him. Trump, according to the newspaper, called Bradley
``the most overrated of the major contenders. He's got a bad way
about him. He's bad on taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   NON-REPUBLICANS BOOST McCAIN IN MICHIGAN
</P>
<P>
   A new Detroit Free Press poll released Wednesday gives John
McCain a 45 percent to 43 percent edge over George W. Bush. Among
traditional Republican voters, however, Bush holds a 52 percent to
37 percent lead. Michigan has an open primary, which means all
voters are free to choose which party's primary they'll vote in.
But even if McCain wins the overall vote Feb. 22, he could still
end up with fewer delegates. That's because the vote is broken down
by the state's 16 congressional districts. The poll's margin of
error was 5.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO HEALTH CARE WARS
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton has re-entered the health care wars, this time
calling for legislation to allow cheaper prescription drugs to be
imported into the United States from Canada. ``I didn't give up
then and I won't give up now,'' said Clinton, who led the failed
effort of President Clinton's administration to overhaul the
nation's health care financing system in 1993 and 1994. She vowed
to make health care costs a major Senate campaign issue in the race
that is expected to pit her against Republican Rudy Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   TOO HARD ON HAIDER, SAY BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party's Pat Buchanan told supporters that Europe and
the United States have no cause to fear far-right Austrian leader
Jeorg Haider. Buchanan accused members of the European Union of
being hypocritical and arrogant when they voted to freeze
diplomatic relations with Austria after Haider's nationalist
Freedom Party was sworn in last week. ``I think the European Union
would have been better of to accept the decision of the people of
Austria and move on,'' The Associated Press quoted Buchanan as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   HAS VENTURA HAD ENOUGH OF REFORM PARTY?
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the country's highest Reform Party
official, and one of his advisers reportedly are considering
breaking away from the party, which has been rocked by infighting
for months. Ventura adviser Dean Barkley said Wednesday that he
would quit the party if national Chairman Jack Gargan, who was
installed with Ventura's backing, is removed at a dissidents'
national committee meeting Saturday in Nashville, Tenn. Ventura
scheduled a news conference for Friday. The Associated Press said
neither he nor aides would say more.
</P>
<P>
   BRADLEY SHOULD `PASS THE BALL'
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign was taken aback by a request from the head
of South Carolina's Democratic Party for Bradley to withdraw from
the race. Richard Harpootlian asserted in a letter to Bill Bradley
that Bradley should step aside to spare Al Gore the damage that
could cost Gore the general election. ``I believe it is time for
you to pass the ball to the vice president, who has the opportunity
to make the game-winning basket,'' Harpootlian said in one of
several metaphorical references to Bradley's Hall of Fame
basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   BUT WHAT IF HE HAS TO RUN AGAINST McCAIN LATER?
</P>
<P>
   Reprising what was dubbed ``Medi-scare'' in the 1996 campaign,
Al Gore claimed an unlikely ally in John McCain and told senior
citizens in Pembroke Pines, Fla., on Tuesday that Bill Bradley
would endanger Medicare. ``McCain and I have in common putting
money from the surplus into Medicare and keeping it from being
drawn down when the baby boomers retire,'' Gore said. ``Bradley
would not put a penny into this.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU CAN QUOTE HIM ON THAT
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) endorsed George W.
Bush over his Senate colleague, John McCain. Lott said that Bush
has the ``character, intelligence and leadership'' to be president.
Asked by reporters when he would make an endorsement, Lott
responded, ``What do you think that just was?'' Later, according to
the Washington Times, Lott tried to play down his comments, saying
it wasn't an ``official endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   UPGRADING TO FIRST CLASS
</P>
<P>
   After Al Gore seized on Bill Bradley's griping about cold food
aboard a campaign plane, Bradley has made a major upgrade. The
Bradley campaign is now chartering a far more comfortable jet to
whisk staff and reporters around the country. Bradley, who just a
week ago was quoted complaining about the lack of an oven on his
old plane, is now clearly more pleased with his executive-seating
ride, according to ABC News. Although the garish pink leather
interior has earned the new plane the nickname the ``Bradley
Bordello,'' it has heat _ which is a major improvement.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S THE INDEPENDENTS, STUPID!
</P>
<P>
   Political strategist Dick Morris, ousted from the Clinton White
House, still casts a savvy eye. Writing in the New York Post,
Morris said Richard Nixon's old rule _ run to the extreme in
primary season, but run to the middle in the general election _ no
longer holds true. That's because, says Morris, the partisans no
longer control the primaries. He notes that indies cast 40 percent
of the vote in both party primaries in New Hampshire, are allowed
to vote in two-thirds of the state primaries, and ``are where the
action is.''

RINGLING BROS. NEW CIRCUS: INTIMATE THEATER, GOURMET FOOD, NO

   Sitting only a few feet from the circus ring, you can see the
tension on the face of the high-wire walker. On his forehead, he
balances a 20-foot pole; a woman sits atop the pole, striking a
pose. Bearing this weight, he walks across the ring, climbs a
ladder to the wire and traverses it _ uphill.
</P>
<P>
   With his every calculated step, the audiences exhales. The woman
is attached to a safety wire, just in case. She's smiling, but you
can see that she's struggling to maintain her balance on the pole.
She must sit perfectly still during the act's 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Circus performers are known for death-defying acts such as this,
but never before have American audiences witnessed the action from
as close as they can at performances of the new one-ring Barnum's
Kaleidoscape, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &AMP; Bailey's first production
under a tent since 1956. It's slightly more highbrow than the
traditional circus, but it's a lot more personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make no excuses,'' says Jim Ragona, the show's managing
director. ``This product is pitched to a more affluent, more
influential, a more intellectual, a more theater-going customer
than our other products. That is an absolutely conscious
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the long-standing European circus tradition of
animal-free, theatrical circuses, similar Canadian and American
circuses were all the rage in the '80s and '90s, thanks to
Montreal's acclaimed Cirque du Soleil. This group has spawned an
international franchise, with permanent homes in Singapore,
Amsterdam, Mexico City, Las Vegas, Orlando, Fla., and Biloxi, Miss.
Its show ``Quidam'' played in Dallas a few years ago, and the
group's newest production, ``Dralion,'' will come to Dallas this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Cirque du Soleil also inspired countless other troupes that
combine the theater and circus arts, such as Cirque Ingenieux and
Cirque Eloize.
</P>
<P>
   Even the long-running Big Apple Circus jumped on the bandwagon
with ``Oops! The Big Apple Circus Stage Show.'' The premise was
that a circus troupe joined forces with a Shakespearean acting
company. It was an intriguing concept, but it failed to completely
hold the audience's interest.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, exponentially marked differences between the
cirques and the circus. Cirque du Soleil and other groups are
decidedly more avant-garde and experimental, and they incorporate
as many elements of artistic expression _ such as dance and
movement _ as they do acrobatics, jugglers and high-flying feats.
Kaleidoscape does this, but much more accessibly. Theatergoers will
probably be more attracted to Cirque du Soleil, but Kaleidoscape
holds on to its American circus roots. It is family fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like operas and musicals,'' says Kaleidoscape's star
clown, David Larible. ``Both have a stage, both have a story, and
in both, people sing. But one is the opera and one is a musical.
It's a different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Larible uses such metaphors often. In this case, the musical is
Kaleidoscape. The story begins with Larible in normal clothing. He
wants desperately to become a clown, and when he proves himself,
Pipo (a European harlequin) and other performers transform him into
his dream in front of the audience. Considering that Larible was
one of the show's creative directors, it's no coincidence that this
parallels his own life.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth-generation circus performer, Larible wanted to be a
clown. His Italian predecessors were acrobats and his father was a
juggler. His chance came when his family realized he wasn't any
good at the other acts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the trapeze acts, high-wire walking, juggling and other
acts in Kaleidoscape, Larible grows as a performer. ``In the end,
he turns out to be the star of the show,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ragona: Once, ``Circuses were a string of vignettes. An act
was an act. You could pretty much juggle the acts throughout the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've discovered is that we cannot tell you a story in
the way theater does. But there is a story. You want to know what's
going to happen to David next. It has a beginning, middle and end,
and all the things that make a circus a circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Another distinction between this new brand of circus and the
traditional one is the lack of animals. ``Oops!'' included a
parakeet act, and Kaleidoscape uses horses, a flock of geese and a
duck, but both largely rely on skillful human feats. The cirques
don't use animals at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of our goals,'' says Julie-Catherine Paradis of
Montreal's Cirque Eloize. ``I think it's a very European way of
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ragona says the decision to use fewer animals has to do with the
intimacy of this show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel strongly that there is a place in the world for the
three-ring spectacle circus, with as many animals as you can cram
into a room,'' he says. ``People want to see an up-close and
personal circus; they want to be able to touch a performer.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling that Kaleidoscape is a more personal and elegant
show is immediate when you walk into the tent. Plush crimson velvet
adorns the columns, tables and even the tops of trash cans. The
chairs are soft and lined with the same fabric. Behind VIP seating
are sofas that seat five comfortably. An hour before the show
begins, circus performers are in the lobby; after the show, they're
available to greet circusgoers and sign autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the food is different _ you know this because of the
prices. In addition to popcorn and cotton candy, there are Angus
hot dogs, gourmet pastas and, in each market, food from a local
eatery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was probably a time in this world, probably at the turn
of the century in Europe, when this is what a circus looked like,''
Ragona says. ``It was an elegant experience like the opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The tent seats 1,850, so even the ``bad'' seats are closer than
the house seats in an arena. VIP seating is just outside the ring.
``When you sit this close,'' Ragona says, ``here's what you know:
You know that the lady who's on the trapeze has 3 inches of
calluses on her heels. It is a visceral experience. You can see the
flaws. No one in this arena sits there and says `Oh, I can do
that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At first, it feels as if Kaleidoscape is trying to imitate its
cirque competitors, but that's not the case. Ringling Bros. has put
its unique stamp on Kaleidoscape. ``Competition is good for the
circus industry,'' Ragona says. ``That's the great thing about
(groups) like Cirque du Soleil _ they raised the bar.''

<P>
   No subject lends itself to a false dichotomy like that of
virtual and real communities. But the two are not opposites, not
exclusionary and not necessarily good for the same things.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the argument that virtual communities cannot do
what real communities can, a common position, is analogous to the
argument, when Model T cars rolled off assembly lines, that cars
cannot do what horses can: become your friends. Both modes of
transportation, though, get you there, and cars command some
obvious advantages of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The current primitive virtual communities are stronger in
several ways than the real thing: if you are lonely or down, you
can go online any time, find out which of your buddies is around
and visit. (Try to do this at the neighborhood bar on Sunday at 7
a.m.)
</P>
<P>
   If there is a snowstorm or you are sick with the flu, not very
mobile or afraid of the streets, you may not make it to your local
country store or senior center. But you can always log on.
</P>
<P>
   When a car does something you thought only a horse could do,
like inspire affection, for instance, it is surprising. So it is
surprising that several important features of real communities are
beginning to be provided online, albeit in different ways than
offline _ ways that have their own weaknesses and strengths.
</P>
<P>
   One essential characteristic of communities is that they are
largely self-policing. Real communities minimize the role of the
state, the police and the courts by relying on gossip. You know
which store to avoid and who is likely to repair your roof on time
because of a subtle system that rates and updates reputations
through offline chatter.
</P>
<P>
   Online communities also need to find ways to do this. In
auctions, at least one side ends up taking a risk; it is often the
buyer but occasionally is the seller. So each party is keen to know
the other's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, the huge auction site (www.ebay.com), handles this problem
through an ingenious system of rating reputations. Similar systems
are used by Amazon (www.amazon.com) and Auctions.com
(auctions.com), among others.
</P>
<P>
   After auctions or trades, both sellers and buyers are asked to
rate one another. As a result, each participant acquires a score
that reflects the number of positive and negative comments
received. All are posted online.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I was considering bidding on a political science book
by Harold Laski in an online eBay auction. To check out the
seller's reputation, I looked at her feedback from other sellers
and buyers. She had earned 30 positive comments and had drawn only
one complaint.
</P>
<P>
   All the comments were listed; a typical positive comment was
from a seller (whose own score was a high 1,502) who wrote: ``Fast
with payment, nice to deal with, AAAAAAA(9 plus signs).'' The
negative comment did not impress me. The seller seemed reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Digging further, I found that the eBay screen name and number
appears above every negative or positive comment. Using that
information, I could ascertain a complainer's reputation. The
system seems to work like a charm: Fewer than 1 percent of eBay
auctions involve fraud, said an eBay spokesman, Kevin Purseglove.
</P>
<P>
   There are no comparable statistics for satisfied customers in
offline communities, which may not in fact do as well. Offline
gossip is more nuanced. You would know, for instance, that someone
did not deliver this time because his wife had just discovered that
she has breast cancer, so you would give that person another
chance. But on the other hand, eBay's system encompasses millions
of people, while gossip systems can encompass at most a thousand or
so people.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual communities cannot provide nearly as much subtle and
encompassing knowledge of members as a real community. But they can
include many more people. One's strong suit is depth, the other's
is breadth.
</P>
<P>
   Like reputation, trust is also important both online and off.
For transactions to flow seamlessly, people must trust one another.
In real communities, people's default is to do so. They are taught
from childhood to presume that members of the community are good
people. It is considered inappropriate to distrust any member,
unless there is cause.
</P>
<P>
   Most virtual communities start from the opposite assumption: I
do not know you, other than your online alias, so how can I trust
you?
</P>
<P>
   But three developments allow e-trust to flourish. For low-value
transactions (often up to $250) auction communities provide free
insurance that covers any goods or payments that are not delivered.
</P>
<P>
   For larger amounts, i-Escrow (i-escrow.com) serves as an
electronic form of trust for many sites, including GO.com
(www.go.com), GimmeaBid.com (gimmeabid.com) and Mac4Sale
(www.mac4sale.com).
</P>
<P>
   After an auction ends, the buyer deposits the money owed with
i-Escrow. The seller is then told to ship the goods. Once the buyer
verifies that the merchandise has been received, i-Escrow sends the
money to the seller.
</P>
<P>
   When quality makes a difference _ such as when buying stamps or
Pokemon cards _ quality can be determined by an appraiser, like
those at the International Society of Appraisers
(www.isa-appraisers.org). The seller can then post the information
or send appraisal printouts to interested buyers. Or a buyer using
i-Escrow can refer an item to appraisers before releasing payment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All that may sound a bit complex, but not for those who live by
the mouse. And it does generate a trustworthy e-system.
</P>
<P>
   Real communities foster intimacy as well as trust, as people get
to know one another and form close, warm bonds. It is often argued
that such closeness cannot be forged in cyberspace because people
cherish their anonymity and hide their true selves behind handles
and false presentations about who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, cyberspace has developed the tools that allow not only
the fostering of intimacy in one-on-one relationships (such as
e-dating) but also among members of groups. It is best to think
about these tools as building blocks. Some virtual communities are
based on only a few, while others accumulate a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   If a community is to be intimate, I hate to tell you, it must
exclude some people. Real communities keep people out with high
entrance fees (condominiums, golf clubs) and various admission
criteria (e.g., no pets or children allowed).
</P>
<P>
   Communities can do that kind of thing as long as they do not
violate laws concerning racial discrimination and a few other forms
of bias. By keeping membership homogeneous and small _ and if
possible, stable _ offline communities foster intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous virtual communities work in similar ways, although they
are much more upfront about their procedures than real ones.
ECircles (www.ecircles.com), for instance, makes it easy for anyone
to set up a closed community. Both Yahoo (www.yahoo.com) and Excite
(www.excite.com) run thousands of clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some are not merely closed but invisible _ they are unlisted.
Others post the names of the administrators who handle requests for
admission. And Size is often limited; Excite's clubs, for example,
can have no more than 2,000 members. The newest wrinkle is that
Excite lets groups of up to 10 members have an audible conversation
online, in real time.
</P>
<P>
   Much greater intimacy can be engendered if members of an
e-community voluntarily surrender their anonymity and the community
verifies identities. Some time ago, I joined one of the 80
little-known H-nets run by the National Endowment for the
Humanities. These are closed to the public and consist of groups of
professors specializing in, say, French history and culture or, in
my case, communitarian thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Participants must apply to be included, and many list their real
names on the screen. Several H-nets _ the one for people studying
the Hapsburg empire, for example _ vet these identities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, you can combine what you already know about Scholar
X from University Y with what you hear from her on H-net. Soon you
feel as though you know one and all, as if you were in some kind of
never-ending face-to-face meeting.
</P>
<P>
   You learn that Scholar A, whose writing you have long admired,
is rather slow-witted and that Scholar B, whom you have always
suspected of not knowing what he is writing about, is rather
sociable. Instead of small packets of personal information of
dubious validity, you get a rather broad and reliable band, which
is of great value for creating intimacy, maybe too much for your
taste.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that e-communities can reach the highest levels of
intimacy only if all the building blocks are in place: the number
of participants is kept relatively small, admission is controlled
to foster affinity, and people drop their Internet masks.
</P>
<P>
   But even if one or two of these elements are missing, online
communities can still allow people to build reputations and trust
and foster intimacy, much like offline groups. However, they do so
in different ways and, above all, can reach many more people, day
or night, rain or shine. &QL;

`ZERO': NOTHING IS SOMETHING TO GET EXERCISED ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zero may be nothing, but a lot comes out of Charles Seife's
story of it in ``Zero: The Biography of a Dangerous Idea,'' which
entertainingly traces the history of numbers from 30,000 years ago,
when some form of human neglected zero while notching a wolf bone
that was eventually unearthed in the 1930s, down to the role that
zero plays in contemporary cosmological theory.
</P>
<P>
   Seife calls zero dangerous because throughout human history it
has been throwing a wrench into our view of the world. The Greeks
were afraid of it, he argues, because of its implication of the
void and the infinite. Hence Aristotle's cosmology, in which ``the
universe was contained in a nutshell, ensconced comfortably within
the sphere of fixed stars'' and ``the cosmos was finite in extent,
and entirely filled with matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until the Renaissance, when painters introduced the
vanishing point in art (implying both zero and infinity) did the
dangerous idea fully enter Western consciousness. In the meantime
the Babylonians had introduced zero as a placeholder in about 300
B.C., a symbol to distinguish like sequences of digits from each
other. Alexander the Great probably carried zero to India, where it
was developed as an abstract concept, given to the Arabs and made
ripe for the age of European discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Such a version of history is charming and enlightening in its
way, and if Seife, a mathematician who writes for science
magazines, occasionally distorts history slightly _ surely there
was more to perspective painting than the acceptance of zero _ so
much the better for our understanding of zero's influence. He loves
a striking story and takes his anecdotal leisure, pausing to tell
us how Zeno of Elea (he of the paradox), while being tortured to
reveal his co-conspirators in a plot against the tyrant of his
homeland, clamped his teeth on the ear of his interviewer until
only death caused him to relax his bite.
</P>
<P>
   And how Archimedes died for trying to work out a geometry
problem; how Martin Luther's rebellion might have been influenced
by his constipation; how, because of the lack of zero in the Julian
Calendar, a child named Century born on Jan. 1 in A.D. 1 would be
only 99 in the year 100, and, in a playful mathematical appendix,
how, by dividing by zero only once, Winston Churchill can be proved
a carrot.
</P>
<P>
   The story gets a little more complex when zero enters more
recent history and figures in the discovery of the calculus by
Newton and Leibniz, l'Hopital's rule by Johann Bernoulli,
projective geometry by Jean-Victor Poncelet, and Riemannian
geometry.
</P>
<P>
   Here Seife must resort to occasional mathematic formulas, and
any reader not adept will have to be satisfied with getting an
approximate idea of what the author means when, for instance, he
writes: ``Despite the power of calculus, the key problem remained.
Newton's work was based on a very shaky foundation _ dividing zero
by itself. His rival's work had the same flaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if zero's precise role is elusive in the latter part of this
story, it provides an occasion for describing from a fresh
perspective such difficult ideas as quantum mechanics in general
and Hendrick B.G. Casimir's ``force of nothing'' in particular, or
the theory of relativity in general and the concept of black holes,
stars crammed into ``zero space,'' in particular.
</P>
<P>
   What Seife's biography adds up to is humankind's struggle to get
rid of zero, down to the creation of string theory in the 1970s,
``when physicists began to see the advantages of treating every
particle as a vibrating string rather than as a dot'' because ``if
electrons (and black holes) are treated as one-dimensional, like a
loop of string, instead of as zero-dimensional, like a point, the
infinities in general relativity and quantum theory miraculously
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Zero's answer, of course, has always been to fight its way back
into the picture. As Seife concludes his story: ``The arguments of
string theorists and cosmologists might be mathematically precise
and at the same time be as useless as the philosophy of
Pythagoras,'' who believed in a mystical connection between shapes
and numbers. ``Their mathematical theories might be beautiful and
consistent and might seem to explain the nature of the universe _
and be utterly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that scientists know is the cosmos was spawned from
nothing, and will return to the nothing from whence it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universe begins and ends with zero.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Seife's book, but his readers, after finishing, will
feel they've experienced a considerable something.

IF YOU'RE PICTURING A COW ON ICE, HERE ARE THE FACTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ In ice skating, when they say ``sal cow,'' what does it
mean and what are the correct words? _ E.G., Hurst, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The term you're hearing is ``salchow,'' and it refers
to a jump.
</P>
<P>
   To do a salchow, a skater takes off from the back inside edge of
one skate, makes a full rotation in the air and lands on the back
outside edge of the other skate.
</P>
<P>
   A skater makes two full rotations in a double salchow, three in
a triple salchow, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   The move is named for the first person to perform it: Swedish
skater Ulrich Salchow, a 10-time champion who won the men's singles
figure skating gold medal in the 1908 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, U.S. skater Timothy Goebel landed the first
quadruple salchow in world championship competition.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What is the actual meaning of ``auld lang syne''? _
C.H.W., N. Richland Hills, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ It's a Scottish expression that means ``old long
since'' _ another way of saying ``a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish poet Robert Burns wrote the song ``Auld Lang Syne''
in 1789, probably adopting the melody and lyrics from folk songs.
</P>
<P>
   It became a modern New Year's tradition after Guy Lombardo's
band played it in 1929 at a New York celebration broadcast on
radio, according to the ``Christian Science Monitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I write to the actor Kirk Douglas? _ J.W.N.,
Fairlawn, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to Douglas in care of Creative Artists Agency,
9830 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old actor stars this month in ``Diamonds,'' his
first film since a 1996 stroke that left him unable to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I first had my stroke, I thought I'd never do another
movie _ except if silent pictures came back,'' Douglas told the
``Calgary Sun'' in December.  &QL;

 &HT;    GERMAN PAYMENTS FOR FORCED LABOR COULD START THIS YEAR
 &HT;    450&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Germany could begin making payments to survivors of
Nazi-era slave and forced labor by the end of this year, U.S. and
German officials told a congressional panel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite an agreement by Swiss banks in August 1998 to
pay $1.2 billion to compensate Holocaust victims whose accounts
were plundered during World War II or lost afterward, ``not one
nickel has yet been spent for victims,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary
Stuart Eizenstat told the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials ``have taken an inordinate amount of time'' in
preparing to notify potential claimholders, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker, who
headed an international commission probing the handling of bank
accounts opened by Holocaust victims, said Swiss officials should
move quickly to publicize the names of 25,000 accounts having the
``highest probability of a relationship to victims of Nazi
persecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Volcker's commission identified 4.1 million Swiss bank accounts
during the Nazi era and found 54,000 that were ``probably or
possibly'' related to victims, many of whom were Jews killed during
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat and German Count Otto Lambsdorff, who negotiated a
settlement to compensate slave and forced laborers or their heirs,
said much work still needs to be done before the December agreement
can be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Still pending is approval of the settlement by the German
parliament, the Bundestag. The settlement is designed to protect
German companies, particularly those tied to American companies,
from numerous class action law suits filed by former laborers.
</P>
<P>
   German negotiators have agreed to total payments of $10 billion
German marks, about $5 billion. Approximately a quarter-million
victims of Nazi-era slave labor, roughly half of them Jewish, would
receive about 15,000 marks apiece, or about $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of forced laborers, most of them
non-Jews living in Central Europe, vary from a half-million to a
million victims. They would receive about 5,000 marks apiece, or
about $2,500, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the settlements would relieve German companies of
further legal liabilities, Lambsdorff said the payments were not
being made because of a legal obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of money could ever compensate for Nazi atrocities,
for the cruel suffering of the principal victims of Nazi
persecution. There can never be moral closure to the darkest
chapter of German history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Eizenstat said he welcomed
announcements made in Austria earlier Wednesday that the Austrian
government also planned to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel said Austria's Nazi past
requires ``special vigilance'' and steps to make sure the new
generation ``be given the history of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel said his government would make sure ``that former Nazi
'forced laborers' receive their rights as soon as possible'' and
that Austrian companies that used slave workers accept
responsibility to compensate them.
</P>
<P>
   He appointed the former president of the Austrian National Bank,
Maria Schaumayer, as the special representative for compensation
issues to work within the Austrian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally, we know that others in Europe have concerns and
fears,'' Schuessel said, referring to the international backlash
against his alliance with the far-right Freedom Party of Joerg
Haider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Austrians are also uncertain and are afraid of the new.
We don't know what is coming. I take these fears, the concerns and
the honorable criticism very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking office Friday, Schuessel sent a letter to the World
Jewish Congress and the Jewish Committee for Claims against Austria
offering to open talks on compensation for Holocaust victims.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Germany, which has paid $60 billion in compensation since
1951, Austria long sought to avoid responsibility, claiming it was
Hitler's first victim when the country was annexed by Germany in
1938.

LAWRENCE OF ARABIA AND THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (af)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compared with books, the Internet has a reputation only slightly
better than the local bar when it comes to scholarship. Yet there
is no reason the Web and the printed, footnoted, peer-reviewed page
cannot complement each other. The author of an acclaimed biography
is showing the way.
</P>
<P>
   To make the lesson even more convincing, the subject is T.E.
Lawrence, one of the most enigmatic figures of the 20th century and
the subject of a mountain of myth and deliberate falsehood long
before there were any modems to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of viewing the Web as scholarly pollution, Jeremy
Wilson, author of ``Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorized Biography of
T.E. Lawrence'' (Atheneum, 1990), has created the Lawrence of
Arabia Factfile, at www.castle-hill-press.com/teweb/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   It is intended as a supplement to his biography and provides
access to much of the historical background and many of his
sources, including fragile and valuable documents, letters and
photographs. He also moderates a public discussion group on
Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is no stranger to scholarly self-publication. Castle Hill
Press, which he and his wife run from their house, has been
reprinting many of Lawrence's own works by subscription. University
presses find Lawrence tough going because he cuts across so many
fields. Besides Arabia, Lawrence was an enthusiast of Crusader
castles, field archaeology and classical Greek (he wrote a popular
translation of Homer's ``Odyssey''), as well as motorcycles,
seaplanes and rescue speedboats (his innovations helped save lives
in World War II).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that a tremendous amount of nonsense is written about
Lawrence, often because the writers don't have access to reliable
information,'' Wilson said in an e-mail message. ``I foresaw that
most journalists and other researchers would soon use the Net, so a
Web site would be the cheapest and most efficient way to provide
that reliable information.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-year-old site already has more than 500 pages and is
growing steadily with the help of the T.E. Lawrence Society and
other supporters.
</P>
<P>
   It includes an introductory biography and a year-to-year,
sometimes month-to-month, chronology, from his birth in 1888 to his
death in 1935 after a motorcycle accident. It also has a guide to
printed and manuscript materials about and by Lawrence and people
and events closely associated with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet edition of the 1988 centenary exhibition on
Lawrence at the National Portrait Gallery in London lets one see
many of the illustrations used _ and many not used _ in Wilson's
biography and in ``Seven Pillars of Wisdom,'' Lawrence's history of
the Arab revolt against the Turks in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   A list of Lawrence quotations is very moving. ``All men dream,
but not equally,'' Lawrence wrote in a suppressed introductory
chapter to ``Seven Pillars of Wisdom.'' And in a 1935 letter, only
a week before his accident, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have done, what I am doing, what I am going to do,
puzzle and bewilder me. Have you ever been a leaf and fallen from
your tree in autumn and been really puzzled about it? That's the
feeling.''

CUISINE TO MAKE YOU QUIVER

<P>
   (begin ital) Trevor took Amber in his arms and crushed her in a
manly embrace, his lips searching for hers. Her chest heaved as she
surrendered to his amorous kisses, feeling the heat of his passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more can I give you?'' he whispered huskily.
</P>
<P>
   She looked deep into his eyes and answered breathlessly, ``How
about some nice smoked salmon?''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   With Valentine's Day approaching, we consulted local romance
writers about the most romantic meal they've ever served and asked
other experts to name their sexiest foods.
</P>
<P>
   From beluga caviar to linguine with clam sauce to
great-grandma's sugar cookies, we offer their suggestions for a
romantic dinner.
</P>
<P>
   First, set the mood. Bring out the fine china, turn on soft
music, scatter rose petals, light candles.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure nothing spoils the evening, make sure the foods and
drinks you serve are conducive to romance. Use garlic and onions
sparingly. Save the beans for another night.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of carbonated beverages. Burping is such a turnoff.
</P>
<P>
   And ask about food allergies. Nothing says mood killer like
shrimp cocktail followed by anaphylactic shock _ unless you're
planning to throw over Trevor for some hunky paramedic.
</P>
<P>
   From our research, we have learned that certain items are in the
Romantic Foods and Drinks Hall of Fame: champagne, caviar, anything
Italian, strawberries dipped in chocolate. If champagne isn't your
cup of tea, try hot chocolate, sparkling cider or sparkling grape
juice.
</P>
<P>
   But even hot dogs and beer can be romantic when served with
love.
</P>
<P>
   Make your own magic. &QL;

JACLYN REDING &QL; 
 &QL; 
Author of ``White Heather,` White Magic,` `White Knight` and the
forthcoming `White Mist.`(at)j &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Valentine's Day, 1991. Jaclyn Reding was cooking for her
husband, Steve, to whom she now has been married for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere: Table set with her good china; vanilla-scented
candles lighted around the room; the music of Irish flutist James
Galway playing in the background. The menu: fresh Italian bread,
linguine with clam sauce, tossed salad with no dressing, cheesecake
topped with chocolate-covered strawberries, champagne floated with
a strawberry and a sugar cube.
</P>
<P>
   That was almost a decade ago, and Reding still savors the
moment. Steve was the only one she ever dated.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met while both were working at an Italian restaurant
in Mentor, Ohio. She was the ``dessert girl'' and used to sneak the
handsome boy treats from the kitchen. She was 16. They married two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were right for each other because neither of us
liked dressing on our salad,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they finally are taking a honeymoon. In the spring,
the couple will visit Scotland, where they will vacation and Reding
will do research for her historic novels, which are set in Great
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   On Valentine's Day, they'll be at a Phoenix Coyotes game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not sexy,'' she says, ``but it's fun.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TARA TAYLOR QUINN &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Author of `My Babies and Me` and `Her Secret, His Child.` &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Tara Taylor Quinn not yet had sold her first
novel. On their modest income, Quinn and her husband, Kevin Reames,
couldn't afford to dine in fine restaurants. But one Valentine's
Day, they shared a romantic dinner that is still memorable for the
author.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn scrimped and saved to prepare a special picnic for her
husband. She spread a blanket on the bedroom floor and lighted
candles around the bathtub. When Reames came home from work, he
knew something special was in the air.
</P>
<P>
   After a romantic bath, they shared filet mignon, baked potatoes,
tossed salad, white Zinfandel wine and sugar cookies from her
great-grandmother's recipe.
</P>
<P>
   They were his favorites, but she made them only at Christmas.
For this Valentine's dinner, she made them heart-shape and frosted
them in red icing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought they were the best part of the meal,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   More than the menu was the meaning of that dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something special,'' Quinn says. ``He
understood what I was trying to say, and he said it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had met at an El Torito restaurant in Columbus, Ohio.
That was 16 years ago on Feb. 15, and she just had spent
Valentine's Day alone. Then she spotted Reames.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was magic,'' she says of that first encounter. ``It was
definitely a storybook.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn sold her first novel in 1993. She and Reames, a finance
director for AutoNation, now have a 14-year-old daughter and live
in a fine, five-bedroom house. But that Valentine's Day with the
heart-shape sugar cookies is still her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to a romantic dinner, she says, is answering the
question ``What would make that person feel special?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DIANA GABALDON &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Author of the ``Outlander'' series of historic adventure novels.
</P>
<P>
   Tuna fish.
</P>
<P>
   For Diana Gabaldon, one little sandwich sparked a romance that
has lasted 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Gabaldon and her husband, Doug Watkins, met in the
French-horn section of the Northern Arizona University marching
band. A Flagstaff girl, she invited him home for lunch one day and
found nothing but tuna in the pantry.
</P>
<P>
   But she made the sandwich to his specifications _ Bumble Bee
chunk tuna, mayonnaise, pickle relish, Roman Meal whole-wheat
bread, and served on a colorful plate left over from the days when
her parents operated a Mexican restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   He was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone cared how I like my food,'' he
told her.
</P>
<P>
   She was 20; he was 21. They began dating and married five years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Gabaldon, who holds degrees in zoology and biology and a
doctorate in ecology, writes novels that really can't be described
as ``romance'' but are full of passion.
</P>
<P>
   Her sexy stories are customarily set in 18th-century Scotland
and described with such words as ``smart, historical, sci-fi,
adventure-romance.''
</P>
<P>
   Her idea of a romantic evening is to watch her husband drag
racing, one of his passions. He also works as a developer of
commercial real-estate properties.
</P>
<P>
   Her idea of romance is ``anything you do together.''
</P>
<P>
   And her idea of a romantic meal is something that can be
prepared ahead ``so you can sit around, sip wine and be
congenial.''
</P>
<P>
   She recommends her enchiladas _ rich and spicy: ``It makes the
blood flow.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DENISE DOMNING &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Author of `Winter's Heat` and `Spring's Fury.`(at)j &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denise Domning can't recall the details of what was probably the
most romantic meal she ever shared with her husband, Ed Lindow. She
was too caught up in the moment of their wedding on the Queen Mary.
</P>
<P>
   That was July 1, 1987. Domning was divorced with two children,
and Lindow had pursued her relentlessly until she agreed to marry
him.
</P>
<P>
   First, they enjoyed a ``honeymoon'' _ a whirlwind
bed-and-breakfast tour of England, where her medieval novels are
set. Then they got married _ back in Long Beach, Calif., where the
Queen Mary is parked. They were married by the ship's captain, with
his dog, Happy, as their witness.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the newlyweds were treated to dinner in the ship's
fine dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember what we ate,'' Domning confesses, but
remembers feasting on love.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Domning doesn't cook too many romantic meals for her
family, which prefers what she calls ``basic foods.''
</P>
<P>
   But the former caterer has some ideas on how to cater to a
couple's passions on Valentine's Day. Her menu would consist of
roast duck with cherry sauce, red cabbage like her husband's
grandmother used to make, wild rice, flan and a chilled bottle of
1995 Chateau St. John Chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   There must be candles. There must be flowers _ lots of them _ on
the table, decorating the food, tucked into napkins.
</P>
<P>
   But most important is the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have all the romantic food, but if the spark isn't
there, you might as well be eating at McDonald's,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Domning has no regrets about being wooed and won by Lindow, a
semiconductor engineer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a wonderful husband, such a wonderful man,'' she
says. ``We've had an incredible life together.'' &QL;

25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As they cook, in a saucepan, combine beer, preserves, soy,
mustard and orange peel. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, then
remove from heat. Reduce oven to 425 and spoon sauce over ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Roast an additional 40 minutes for medium doneness, or reduce

 &QL; 
Enchiladas &QL; 
(From Diana Gabaldon) &QL; 
6 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 to 10 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   3 small cans (7.5 ounces each) tomato sauce (Diane uses El Pato
brand) or prepared tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   Frozen red chile to taste (omit if using prepared sauce)
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 cups cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound Cheddar cheese, mild or medium
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion (yellow or white) (optional)
</P>
<P>
   12 to 15 corn tortillas &QL; 
Coat the bottom of a heavy, 2-quart saucepan with approximately a
quarter-inch of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Peel and mince the garlic. Saute garlic in the oil until it
begins to turn brown, but do not burn. Add enough flour, usually 3
to 4 tablespoons, to make a thick roux. Mix the tomato sauce and
chile into the roux.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using frozen chile, how much you use depends on the
hotness of the chile, and your own tastes; 1/4 of a tub of hot
chile, or 1/2 of mild, is about right. Using the empty tomato-sauce
can as measure, add four cans of water, and stir well.
</P>
<P>
   Lower heat to simmer, and leave the sauce to thicken slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Half-fill a small frying pan with cooking oil and warm over
medium heat for dipping the corn tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Grate cheese and chop onion while waiting for the oil to heat.
When a small piece of corn tortilla dropped in the oil sizzles, the
oil is hot enough.
</P>
<P>
   The sauce should be fairly thick. Stir frequently to keep it
from sticking to the bottom of the pan, and add more water as
needed to keep it from getting too thick.
</P>
<P>
   You will need a plate or board to work on, and an empty cake or
casserole pan to hold the finished enchiladas.
</P>
<P>
   Using tongs, hold a tortilla by one edge and dip it briefly (1
to 3 seconds) in the hot oil. Shake off extra oil and dip the
tortilla into the sauce so that both sides are lightly covered with
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Lay each tortilla on a plate. Sprinkle a thick line of grated
cheese across the center of the tortilla and sprinkle chopped
onions over the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Fold the tortilla into a cylinder by wrapping first one edge and
then the other over the cheese filling. Place the completed
enchilada in the pan, folded edges down.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle remaining sauce over filled enchiladas and sprinkle
additional cheese on top for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Enchiladas can be made up to 24 hours before serving, though the
fresher, the better. If you do want to make them early and keep
them in the refrigerator, cover the pan with plastic wrap (the
sauce will eat holes in aluminum foil). To cook, remove any
covering and bake in a preheated 300 degree oven for approximately
12 minutes, until clear liquid begins to ooze from the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 to 15 enchiladas. &QL;

   COLLEGE-COSTS _ WASHINGTON _ Even though college tuition costs
have risen far faster than incomes over the past 30 years, the
nation's elite colleges are actually more accessible to low-income
students, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee was told

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what is nearly a mirror image of the two-year-old
trans-Atlantic legal battle over the ownership of an Egon Schiele
painting that had been lent to the Museum of Modern Art, a German
court has issued an injunction seeking to bar the return of a
painting with a clouded provenance to its American owner: the
Modern.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, the 1932 ``Bauhaus Staircase'' by Oskar Schlemmer,
is considered an icon of the Modern's collection and is usually on
view in the permanent-collection galleries. It has been lent to
museums around the world, frequently in Germany, and most recently
was part of ``The 20th Century: A Century in Germany,'' an
exhibition at the National Gallery in Berlin that closed Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the Modern acknowledged that the Schlemmer family,
which asserts that it owns the painting or is owed money for it,
had obtained the court order to hold it in Berlin for further
investigation, though the museum said it had not seen the
injunction. Before the injunction was served on the National
Gallery, ``Bauhaus Staircase'' had already been packed and shipped
to the Modern, where it is in storage during the museum's special
millennial exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   C. Raman Schlemmer, the painter's grandson and a representative
of the Oskar Schlemmer estate, said that the next step was a court
hearing in Berlin on Feb. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The case recalls the dispute over Schiele's ``Portrait of
Wally,'' which was on loan to the Modern from the Leopold
Foundation in Vienna in 1997 when the heirs of Lea Bondi Jaray
claimed it, saying the painting had been confiscated from her by
the Nazis. On Jan. 7, 1998, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert
M. Morgenthau, obtained a grand jury subpoena keeping ``Wally'' in
New York pending a criminal investigation into its ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Last September the New York State Court of Appeals invalidated
the subpoena, ruling that the state's 30-year-old Arts and Cultural
Affairs Law protected the painting from seizure in all cases,
criminal as well as civil. But within hours, the U.S. attorney's
office for the Southern District of New York and the U.S. Customs
Service obtained a seizure warrant for ``Wally,'' and it remains at
the Modern while ownership is determined in a civil proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The history of ``Bauhaus Staircase,'' unlike that of ``Wally,''
does not involve confiscation by the Nazis, but it is bound up with
World War II. In 1933, the year Hitler came to power, the architect
Philip Johnson, then a curator at the Modern, cabled Schlemmer at
the behest of Alfred Barr, the Modern's director, offering to buy
the painting. Schlemmer, labeled a ``degenerate artist'' by the
Nazis and forced to quit his post teaching art and take a factory
job, sent ``Bauhaus Staircase'' to him. Johnson bought it, lent it
to the museum and donated it in 1943, the year Oskar Schlemmer
died.
</P>
<P>
   On that, both sides seem to agree.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview from Italy where he lives, C. Raman
Schlemmer said that his 77-year-old mother, Ute, the painter's
daughter, went to court to determine ownership because it appears
that Schlemmer, if he was paid at all, did not get what he expected
to receive. ``The cable offered a price of 12,000 Reichsmarks,''
Schlemmer said, ``but after he sent the painting to New York he got
another cable saying there was a misunderstanding about price and
offering 1,200 Reichsmarks. My grandfather begged for something
more, but we never found a reply. We have no proof that Mr. Johnson
paid anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, reached by phone, said that the claim had no merit. He
agreed that he and Barr paid 1,200 Reichsmarks for the painting.
``That was the going price for a painting like that at that time,''
he said. ``I believe it was the cable people's fault, but the
mistake was acknowledged, and we went on from there.'' Johnson said
that Schlemmer must have been satisfied because later that year he
sold another painting to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Schlemmer, however, said that a 1933 catalog listed the value of
the painting at 2,000 Reichsmarks. He said his grandfather could
not press his case further at the time because at some point his
communication with New York was cut off.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Clark, associate general counsel at the Modern, said
that the museum had reviewed its records and found no basis for the
claim. ``Everything is in apple-pie order,'' he said. ``We've asked
them to give us anything that would substantiate their claim and
we've gotten zippo, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Schlemmers win in court, the Modern may not lose
``Bauhaus Staircase.'' Schlemmer said that his mother wanted it to
be on view and would lend the painting to the Modern.

   &HT;     Selling to school children  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The school system in Manatee County, Fla., stands to make almost
$5 million over the next decade if it permits Coca-Cola to peddle
its soft drinks in all its public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This strikes me as a great deal for the school system and for
the students who finally get to gag down their mystery meat with
something other than milk.
</P>
<P>
   The nice thing about the arrangement is the more Coke the kids
drink, the more money the school system makes. There could be
contests between individual schools to see whose students can drink
the most Coke in a year. Coke-chugging could join baseball,
football and tennis as a varsity sport and ``Most Gaseous'' could
become a highly sought yearbook distinction, right up there with
``Most Likely to Succeed'' and ``Best Personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Coke-in-the-schools idea has drawn opposition from
editorialists, nutritionists and other fringe groups who fail to
appreciate the advantages of corporate sponsorship of public
education.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Robert Reynolds, president of Education Market
Resources, says we shouldn't even be referring to them as
``schools'' anymore, but rather as ``the education marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly enlightened school districts not only accept corporate
sponsors, but also offer up their pupils for market research.
Children (excuse me, I mean ``focus groups'') in numerous schools
have done taste-tests of cereals, which Reynolds says not only
helps sell products but also enriches students' lives by adding
another ``educational process'' to their curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, companies need to break into the education
marketplace as quickly as possible, and few have done that better
than an outfit called Cover Concepts Marketing Services. Besides
delivering Calvin Klein notebooks to over 31,000 elementary
schools, Cover Concepts boasts a network of 22,000 daycare centers
where it hands out product samples, coupons and coloring books in
exchange for ``demographic'' data. That information is then sold to
clients like McDonald's and Kellogg's to assist their targeted
marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are only so many school children in America,
which is why the really smart companies, like Coca-Cola, are
experimenting with corporate sponsorship of the great outdoors. In
New York, Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of the state park
system. Other state-park systems have embraced corporate America in
an attempt to shore up their budgets, a move that the Wall Street
Journal described as ``free-market environmentalism.'' (Don't try
out that phrase in public without practicing it a few times by
yourself at home, preferably with a bucket nearby.)
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, there are still a few obscure, peripheral elements of
American life that do not enjoy the advantages of corporate
sponsorship, this column being one of the more glaring examples.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a big fan of soft drinks, camping scares me and I'm
afraid a Calvin Klein notebook would clash with the
bathrobe-and-slippers look that I have worked so hard to perfect.
Still, I'm a big consumer of products and I could certainly use
some extra cash in order to buy more.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not greedy. Five million over 10 years would be more than
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I'll even wear a T-shirt that says ``I Love Mystery
Meat!''if that's what it takes.
</P>

COMPUTER MONITORS FAIL SCREEN TEST
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By IAN AUSTEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Multimedia Web sites and DVD drives are increasingly turning the
computer into a new version of the television set. For picture
quality, however, many computer screens are put to shame by the
cheapest discount store portable TV.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just desk potatoes who are disappointed by computer
monitors. For those who want to do simple reading or tasks like
detailed drawings, the computer screen's performance lags well
behind paper.
</P>
<P>
   Computer manufacturers would like to see that change. Both
International Business Machines and Toshiba have different
technologies that each says may soon lead to high-resolution
computer screens for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Wisnieff, senior manager of IBM's Advanced Display
Systems Technology Laboratory, said that improving computer users'
views was more difficult than designing better chips in some
respects. ``We really struggled in the lab,'' Wisnieff said.
``There's over a mile of wiring in the display. Just getting
electrical signals around it quickly enough was a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most computer display researchers, Wisnieff long ago ruled
out the cathode ray tube _ currently seen on most desktops _ as the
answer to better screens because its technology is nearly at its
physical limits.
</P>
<P>
   But even garden-variety liquid-crystal-display screens are a
nightmare of complexity. A typical 16-inch monitor can contain
almost 1 million pixels, the basic image-forming unit. Each pixel
has three parts, for the colors red, green and blue. And each of
those parts has its own transistor. Wisnieff's group hoped to get a
better on-screen picture by increasing all of that by roughly a
factor of six.
</P>
<P>
   Wisnieff's group worked within tight economic constraints. There
are already LCD screens with a staggering ability to display fine
detail. But those were developed for military fighter jets and
hospital imaging departments, and they carry staggering price tags.
</P>
<P>
   To make a better screen for consumers who don't have a budget
the size of the Pentagon's, the researchers used current equipment
at the LCD factory that IBM shares with Toshiba in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their initial work focused on the screen's wiring, which
is, in fact, etched onto the surface of a piece of glass. One
problem with scaling up from current screens is that their wires
are created using molybdenum and tungsten, metals that are
relatively poor conductors of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Those two metals were originally chosen because they worked well
in the wire etching process. After some work, the IBM lab
eventually found a way to create faster wiring by developing a new
photolithography etching process that substitutes aluminum and
copper.
</P>
<P>
   That more efficient wiring led the group to create a 16.5-inch
prototype screen with 200 pixels per inch. Current monitors offer
only 80 to 100 pixels per inch. ``With this we're now getting to
the point where you're no longer aware of the pixels,'' Wisnieff
said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's screen-making partner, Toshiba, focused on the pixels
themselves rather than the wiring when it set out to build its
high-resolution screen. The liquid crystal in most monitors is a
material called amorphous silicon glass. Its molecules obediently
line up in the direction of the electrical charge applied by the
subpixels' transistors. When a subpixel's molecules are turned in
one direction by the transistors, they block the light from the
screen's backlight. Turned the other way, the light shines through
to create part of an image.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid crystal in Toshiba's new screens is a material called
polysilicon glass, which reacts 100 times as fast to electricity as
amorphous silicon glass. That allowed Toshiba to shrink the
transistors and wiring surrounding the pixels and speed up the
overall screen operation by moving some of the integrated circuits
that now ring the edge of LCD screens directly onto the glass
surface itself.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Toshiba began selling two screens with resolution of
202 pixels per inch. The catch is that they are only 4 and 6.3
inches and are thus aimed mostly at the handheld computer, e-book
reader and digital photo viewer markets. But Steven Vrablik,
director of business development for Toshiba's LCD product line,
said that even small screens benefited from the technology. ``The
pixels start to look more and more like a photographic image,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Wisnieff said, IBM will send several hundred early
versions of his screen to customers for testing. Their initial cost
will be high.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a more important issue that makes it nearly
impossible for average users to adopt high-resolution screens. All
the graphic elements of operating systems and most applications
software _ the tiny printer icon, for example _ are sized in pixels
rather than by the physical measurement they assume on screen.
Cramming more pixels into a screen, as Wisnieff has done, means
that the handy software icons shrink to nearly microscopic size.
</P>
<P>
   At IBM, Wisnieff's laboratory rewrote the underlying code of
Windows NT to inflate its display pixel counts. Lotus, a unit of
IBM, also created a high-resolution-compatible version of its word
processor. Wisnieff said that large corporate and government
customers would probably be able to do the same. (A Microsoft
spokeswoman said the company had no definite timetable for
introducing a solution in Windows.)
</P>
<P>
   For home users, that means getting an early high-resolution
screen will take both a fat wallet and a willingness to take on a
high-level science project. For the rest of us, Wisnieff said, the
improvement will be worth the wait. ``We'll be giving you something
much closer to hard copy right on your desktop.''

   BARKHAMSTED, Conn. _ The light and shadow that splash across the
pastures of Bucks County, Pa., or strike the lavish ironwork in New
Orleans have always inspired the sorts of images that Carol Wallace
creates in her watercolors. So, too, have the historic landmarks of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The artist has designed a series of note cards, stationery and
posters depicting such historic places as the Plaza hotel in New
York, the Hotel Hershey in Hershey, Pa., the Hotel Jerome in Aspen,
Colo., and even Angel Delgadillo's small barbershop on Route 66 in
Seligman, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace started the project in 1997 with a single poster of
historic Bucks County and a multicard series depicting old hotels
in Cape May, N.J. The Bucks County poster is in the Library of
Congress' permanent poster collection, and the Smithsonian
Institution's Cultural History Division is using each of the note
cards to document how the sites depicted looked at a particular
time. The featured landmarks and scenic sites raise money by
selling the cards and posters, known as the Preserve America
Collection.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for artists to help landmarks and scenic
sites raise money through the sale of their work. Woody Jackson of
Middlebury, Vt., perhaps best known for enhancing the packaging of
Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice cream with cow images, boosts the American
Farmland Trust with reproductions of his rural scenes on T-shirts
and tote bags, and Will Moses, a great-grandson of Grandma Moses,
does similar work for the Bennington Museum in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's series gained momentum when Crane &AMP; Co., the
stationers, began marketing the collection in October. Brochures
were mailed to people who oversee 500 historic sites, many on the
National Register of Historic Places, inviting them to commission
Wallace to create a watercolor or pen-and-ink drawing of their
sites. Wallace charges $750 to $1,000 for a 15-by-11-inch
watercolor and $600 to $800 for a pen-and-ink drawing. The site's
owner then pays Crane to print the cards, which sell for about $3
each at the places they commemorate.
</P>
<P>
   Crane also prints U.S. currency and printed invitations for such
events as the dedication of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Statue
of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that my work is in galleries, but I feel
through the card and poster line I can share my experiences of
these great places with others in a way that goes beyond individual
paintings,'' Wallace said. ``It naturally leads into wanting to
preserve these historic properties. And I can share my favorite
places _ old barns and stonework, Victorian architecture, country
stores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm looking into the face of an elderly person
when I look at the veneer of a barn,'' she said. ``I see character,
interest and tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 56, grew up in the Pennsylvania village of Tradesville,
which during her childhood had just seven houses and a country
store. Nearby were the Mercer Museum, with its large collection of
early Americana, as well as the Washington Crossing Historic Park
and the Pearl S. Buck home in Perkasie, Pa., which is a National
Historic Landmark. She describes the cards as a series of
``mini-history lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who lives here and works out of a studio in her home
and another one nearby in New Hartford, Conn., travels with a
camera and her briefcase-size wooden French easel. She has ventured
as far north as the boardwalks of Ketchikan, Alaska, and as far
south as the funky Half-Shell Market in Key West, Fla. Sometimes
she paints on the spot; other times she takes photographs and does
the finished work in one of her studios.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration with Crane started with a Berkshires series of
cards. The Berkshires Visitors' Bureau helped Wallace identify her
subjects _ historic landmarks that included the Hancock Shaker
Village; Arrowhead, the home of Herman Melville; Blantyre, a
Tudor-style inn; Tanglewood, the summer home of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra; Chesterwood, the studio home of the sculptor Daniel
Chester French; and Naumkeag, a mansion designed by the architect
Stanford White with gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said her challenge was to interpret each site in a new
and personal way. ``When I do a scene I gravitate to certain
objects, perhaps antiques, that are of interest to me,'' she said.
``Maybe I will highlight a patch of warm wood or the intricacies of
ironwork. I highlight moods. Mood is very important to portray. I
strive for strong graphic composition, rich colors, textures and
forms that invite the viewer into the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of her other work is in private and corporate collections.
James Biddle, the past president of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation, commissioned her to paint his ancestral estate,
Andalusia, in Pennsylvania. She is represented by the Lenox Gallery
of Fine Art in Lenox, Mass., and the Pope's Gallery in Charlotte,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Preserve America Collection will include a category called
Farms Across America. The first cards commissioned for the series
resulted from a collaboration between the American Farmland Trust
and Skitch Henderson, the former band and orchestra leader, and his
wife, Ruth. The couple preserved the Hunt Hill Farm in New Milford,
Conn., by converting one of the farm's dairy barns into their home
and another into a cooking school, store and art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace seeks advice from historical commissions and
preservation organizations on what properties to include in her
broader continuing series. The note cards and posters have
narratives that document the history of the sites depicted.
</P>
<P>
   Crane and Wallace are negotiating with such places as the Jimmy
Carter Historic Site in Plains, Ga., the National Historic Route 66
Federation in California and the Natchez Trace Parkway in Tupelo,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Many more historic sites need her attention, Wallace said.
``It's my dream to work on the Natchez Trace,'' for example, she
said, ``to understand its personal history.''

 &HT;    FBI VOWS TO STOP HACKERS, BUT TASK IS DIFFICULT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attacks by hackers disrupting some of the nation's
most popular Internet sites continued Wednesday as Attorney General
Janet Reno vowed that the FBI will do all it can to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   Online brokerage E-Trade and the high-tech news site ZDNet were
inaccessible Wednesday morning, the latest victims of a three-day
assault that paralyzed major Web sites by bombarding them with
requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   The cyber-vandals have covered their tracks by quickly jumping
from one innocent computer system to another launch their assaults.
All the companies targeted said hackers did not gain access to
their computers or retrieve information about their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, made possible by the basic design of the Internet
to provide universal access, could not be stopped either by federal
law enforcement agencies or the Web sites' own security measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we hoped would never happen, but it did,''
Ronald Dick of the National Infrastructure Protection Center told a
news conference at FBI headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said it had not determined a motive for the attacks nor
received any claims of responsibility, but Reno said ``they appear
to be intended to interfere with and disrupt legitimate electronic
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the attacks carried out in recent days could be the
coordinated effort of experts with a political or economic motive,
or mere vandalism by one or more teenage hackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 15-year-old kid could have launched these attacks. This is
not something that requires a great deal of sophistication to do,''
Dick said, comparing the procedure to an overloaded phone system
which results in a busy signal when callers attempt to dial in.
</P>
<P>
   If caught and convicted, the hackers could face a maximum
penalty of 5 to 10 years in jail and up to a $250,000 fine, or more
if a court orders the victims to be compensated for economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Wednesday for a political trip to Texas,
President Clinton said he didn't know if there was anything
Washington could do about the attacks. ``But I have asked the
people who know more about than I do whether there is anything we
can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Burke of the General Services Administration said there was
no evidence that the federal government's vast computer network had
been affected by the hacking in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   While the FBI said it was dedicating as many agents and
resources as needed to solve the case, Dick warned that protecting
the vast world of Internet commerce from vandals ``is not something
that can be done by any one agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick, chief of computer investigations and operations at
National Infrastructure Protection Center, said the FBI was working
closely with the victim Web sites to trace the electronic steps
back to the culprit keyboards. Ultimately, he said, preventing such
attacks is up to the businesses and organizations using the Web, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be incumbent on the community to put these
tools in place,'' Dick said.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend that crime-proofing the Internet is
virtually impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems are symbolic of much bigger issues. The
Internet was designed as an academic research tool and not as a
mass-marketing outlet. The design assumes it will be used only be
good people and not fall into the hands of bad people,'' said Jakob
Nielsen, author of the newly published ``Designing Web Usability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Security was never a priority,'' Nielsen said. ``Overcoming
these basic problems would require a vast restructuring of the
Internet at a time when users are just becoming comfortable with
the present structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have complained that the Clinton administration and
Congress have not done enough to give the FBI the money and
expertise it needs to fight cyber-crime.
</P>
<P>
   Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
announced plans Wednesday to hold hearings on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The attacks began Monday, focused on the popular Yahoo! Web
index. They continued Tuesday on eBay, Amazon, CNN.com and Buy.Com,
and Wednesday on E-Trade and ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer accounts were never compromised,'' E-Trade spokesman
Patrick DiChiro said. Fewer than one-fifth of its customers were
affected by the clogged traffic for about 90 minutes before the
company halted the attack, he said. Customers that were not able to
trade online were redirected to E-Trade's telephone trading desk,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ZDNet spokeswoman Martha Papalia said the company's site was
down for about two and a half hours early Wednesday. The site, one
of the 20 most visited sites on the Internet, had returned to
normal by midday, she said.
</P>
<P>
   CNN said its Web site was ``seriously affected'' when it came
under attack for nearly two hours Tuesday night before technicians
were able to shield its computers from the hackers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.Com Inc. said its site was inaccessible for more than an
hour late Tuesday because large amounts of ``junk traffic'' were
targeted at the company's computers, tying them up and preventing
nearly all its customers from making purchases.

BOOTING UP AND TEST DRIVING AN ELECTRIC RENT A CAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRED BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Where are you planning to drive this weekend?'' asked the man
at the Budget Rent A Car counter in Los Angeles. He wasn't being
nosy. I was about to rent an electric car, which can cover about
120 miles before its nickel-hydride battery needs to be recharged.
So I would have to plan my itinerary around charging stations _
giant electric outlets scattered in shopping center parking lots
and municipal garages. Death Valley wasn't a sensible destination.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I wasn't planning to go much farther than Malibu, for a
friend's 40th birthday party. Although there are no charging
stations in Malibu, there are plenty in Santa Monica, 10 miles from
my destination. What could possibly go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   So I made the decision to rent an electric vehicle. Two days
later, it would make an ignominious return trip from Malibu to the
Los Angeles airport on the back of a flatbed truck _ a
disappointing denouement.
</P>
<P>
   For years, I'd been hearing that electric cars were coming into
their own. As a Manhattanite, I'd admired the electrics from a
distance (so far they are only available in California and
Arizona), but I had not yet had the chance to find out if the
electric vehicle was an overpriced toy, a four-wheeled robot-pet,
or a viable alternative to the gas-guzzler. Luckily, on the morning
I arrived in Los Angeles, Budget was offering electric cars at
prices comparable to those for conventional vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before I discovered the first advantage to
renting electric: bypassing Budget's long Friday afternoon line, I
went straight to a special counter for electric vehicles. There,
Joe Borges, who runs the program (a joint venture between Budget
and EV Rental Cars), showed me pictures of the five cars available
to rent, which ranged from a blocky battery-powered Toyota sport
utility vehicle, the RAV4-EV, to General Motors' snazzy EV1.
</P>
<P>
   I figured I would need the Toyota, since I'm over 6 foot. But
the EV1 _ which looks tiny _ turned out to have lots of legroom
(extending well into where the engine would be on a conventional
car). I settled on that one at $69.95 a day. I liked its
aerodynamic wedge shape _ narrower in front than in back.
</P>
<P>
   I quickly learned that the electric car isn't for people in a
hurry. That's because there was so much to learn, I needed to take
notes. Sitting in the passenger seat, Borges showed me how to start
the car. There's no key; I practiced entering a combination, which
set a variety of lights flashing on the dashboard. ``It's booting
up,'' Borges explained.
</P>
<P>
   The most important number on the dashboard was the range _ how
many miles I could expect to drive before recharging. It read
``120'' _ meaning the car was fully charged. On the dashboard was a
notebook, in which Borges had inserted maps to the 400 charging
stations in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I learned the biggest drawback to electric cars: a
full charge requires about five hours. Californians can install
charging stations in their garages but for the renter, there is no
such luck. That, according to Borges, is why the public chargers
are near malls and beaches _ places, he says, you wouldn't mind
spending five hours.
</P>
<P>
   What if someone else's car is plugged in when you arrive (each
unit, the size of a parking meter, has only one connection)?
There's electric etiquette: Borges said that you can check the
charger's digital readout and unplug any car that's at least 70
percent full. (The power is provided free by Southern California
Edison)
</P>
<P>
   A few more pointers, and I was on my way, surprised at how well
the EV1 handled. I'd expected a glorified golf cart. Instead, the
car has powerful pickup, allowing me to pass. I made it over Laurel
Canyon to Asanebo, a favorite restaurant on Ventura Boulevard, in
nine minutes, tying my gas-car record.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was the attention the EV1 attracted. People
waved, tapped on their horns or shouted approval. In three days on
the road, I never saw another one.
</P>
<P>
   The trip back to Malibu was uneventful. The two-seater was
comfortable and quiet. The next morning, my range down to about 50
miles, I figured I'd visit a friend in Santa Monica while powering
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' he told me. ``There's a charging station right around
the corner from my house.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a parking-meter sized charging station on Montana
Avenue. But it was for another model; its plug did not fit my
outlet. We spotted a charger designed for my model down the block,
but it was blocked by a nonelectric car.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting the notebook on my dash, I selected another charging
station about a mile away. There, I plugged in the EV1 and then
boarded my friend's gas-powered car (``So 20th century,'' I told
him) for the short ride to Bergamot Station gallery complex, where
we spent a couple of hours looking at art. When we returned to my
car, it was only about 70 percent charged. Still, that was enough
to get me to a friend's house in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I made sure to stop for lunch at a new restaurant near
the Santa Monica Pier, near the pier's charging station. (One
glitch: that station is in a public parking lot, and I had to pay
$5 to get in.) Still, I was getting into the swing of this electric
car thing.
</P>
<P>
   After dinner (still only 70 percent charged), I drove to Malibu
for the party. Nestled among the Range Rovers and Jaguars on my
friend's private road, the EV1 made me proud. But when the party
was over, and I was back at my hotel, it exacted a price: I
couldn't get its interior lights to go off. Friends tried to help,
and we spent an hour flicking switches on and off, opening and
closing doors, trunk, hood. It was 2 a.m., too late to call anyone.
I went to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, the car was as dead as a Model T in a blizzard.
(I knew it was dead because its combination lock wouldn't click,
and its ``run'' light wouldn't light.) Unable to reach Borges on
his cell-phone number, I dialed the ``800''-number for Budget. The
person who answered, admitting she knew nothing about electric
cars, said she had no choice but to send a tow truck from the
airport. I felt guilty; I had let the Angelenos down.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Budget brought me a Honda Civic emblazoned on its
fender with the letters N, G and V (for natural gas vehicle).
Inside, I found a book of fueling locations _ only 175 places in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, I had a full tank, and I was leaving for home the next
morning. At the airport, Borges did not look happy about the
tow-in. Had I reached him in time, he could have arranged a
jump-start. (The battery that had died, it turned out, was the one
that started the car, not the one that powered it _ something I
would have known if there had been an owner's manual in the car.
Borges doesn't include it because ``it's just too complicated,'' he
said. He's working on a shorter version.)
</P>
<P>
   He was quick to say that he has completed 1,800 rentals in the
program's first year in existence, and 98 percent of the rentals
have been trouble-free. He also said he's had plenty of repeat
customers, many of them on one-day business trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``They save on fuel, they know they're doing something for the
environment, and they like the novelty of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, I enjoyed renting an electric car. I do not blame
the technology for my brownout; it may be that renting an electric
car to a guy who can't keep his cell phone charged isn't
California's best hope for solving its pollution problem.

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a crowded conference room in January, Timothy S.
Carey, the president of the Battery Park City Authority, talked
about plans for a ``green'' apartment building to developers who
usually associate green with the color of money.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was briefly stunned to silence as they heard the
minutely detailed guidelines for what is being billed as the first
green (that is, environmentally sensitive) residential high-rise in
the country. The impetus for this ambitious plan came from Gov.
George E. Pataki, who has said that environmental issues are a
priority and who has proposed a tax break for builders who get
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has done this before,'' Carey said. (And experts say
that's right, at least in the United States.) ``Take it as a
challenge to try and do something that everyone else will be
copying in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He exhorted the audience to focus on the prestige rather than
the expense of figuring out such potential features as ``integrated
photovoltaic panels'' and gray-water systems, which reuse water
collected from showers, sinks and laundry facilities. Going green
could increase the construction price tag between 12 percent and 20
percent. Proposals for the competition are due March 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very laudable,'' said Andrew Berkman, a lawyer for
Milstein Properties, ``but you'd have to be pretty brave to be the
guinea pig on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The new 24-story building, to be located at the corner of River
Terrace and Murray Street, is the first of five residential
projects in Battery Park City that will be awarded to developers
who best fulfill the strict design requirements presented in the
green guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we can beat California at something,'' said Alan
Traugott, a principal at Flack &AMP; Kurtz, a New York engineering
firm, about the project's potential to elevate New York's
reputation for caring about the environment. Traugott is a member
of the team of environmental and design experts that developed the
project's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect a high-rise yurt. The guidelines represent the
latest thinking on sustainable design in America that is
affordable. In fact, most of the required features have already
been tried out in commercial and small-scale residential buildings.
``We're not talking about bleeding-edge systems here,'' Traugott
said. ``It's all doable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the building represents a breakthrough because of the
combination of its large size and residential nature, demanding
that all systems work smoothly 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   While new to the United States, large-scale green residential
design is somewhat more common abroad. Ken Leang, a Malaysian
architect, who has been working on green high-rises for 25 years,
was recently the joint winner in a conceptual competition to design
the first green residential skyscraper in London. ``The more local
authorities put out these sort of guidelines, the better it will be
for our sustainable future,'' he said of the Battery Park City
project.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines stipulate everything from roof-top plantings that
don't need a lot of water to requisite bicycle storage. In a
broader sense, the building is intended to break records and
establish new precedents: the stone-and-brick apartment house must
be 30 percent more energy-efficient than required by current New
York state energy codes, bring in 30 percent more natural light
than city codes demand and have plumbing fixtures that use 10
percent less water than outlined in 1992's federal Energy Policy
Act.
</P>
<P>
   That's just for starters. The building is to be ventilated with
a central outside-air system that will deliver filtered, humidified
air heated to 55 degrees in the winter, and cooled and dehumidified
air in the summer. Building materials are supposed to be nontoxic
and ordered primarily from renewable or recycled sources. (Bamboo
floors, say, instead of oak; wool carpeting instead of synthetic.)
</P>
<P>
   Individual apartments would have their own temperature controls
and a master switch at the front door to encourage apartment
dwellers to turn off all the lights. In addition to
energy-efficient appliances and natural-gas cooking ranges, the
guidelines propose that developers borrow a trick from
well-appointed luxury houses: thermostats that can be operated by
phone or Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals, naturally, must not only satisfy the authority's
green agenda, but they must do so within a design that looks great.
It is hoped that construction will begin on the building early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial shock over the requirements and the looming
deadline, developers and builders reacted much as would be
expected. They sniped. ``What an interesting way to get a million
dollars worth of engineering free,'' said Stephen Sloan, a
developer, after the presentation. ``If the state really wants some
ideas, why not give grants to engineers instead of asking private
industry to do all the work?''
</P>
<P>
   The filtered and ducted outside-air system, versions of which
are already in use in offices like the new 4 Times Square and the
Audubon Society downtown, quickly came under fire. For the system
to work most effectively, windows should be kept closed (even
though the city requires that habitable rooms all have operable
windows). One former employee of the Audubon Society, Roger Cohn,
well recalled its office windows. ``When we first moved in, one of
the appeals was that the windows could be opened,'' he said.
``Then, when we got there, they were never unlocked.'' He allowed,
however, that the filtered air ``was probably better than breathing
the air off Broadway.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of operable windows underscored the differences
between residences and offices. ``I find it hard to believe that's
the best way to go,'' said Axel Staski, a Manhattan developer.
``Maybe I'm primitive, but I like to use my windows at home.''
Developers also complained that the venting ducts for such a system
would use up valuable space in the building, possibly the
equivalent of an entire floor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the technologies that developers are expected to make
room for, like fuel cells and integrated solar panels, do not yet
exist in widely applicable forms in the United States. ``If they
never go forward,'' Traugott said, ``the developers can always
reclaim the space later.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most ambitious goal _ and the one treated with the
most skepticism _ is to use gray water to flush toilets and
irrigate plants. For one thing, developers are balking at putting
in a second plumbing system to handle gray water.
</P>
<P>
   They may not have to. The Battery Park City Authority is
exploring building an underground facility, called a living
machine, that would collect, filter and return gray water to the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray water? What's it going to look like?'' said Jeffrey
Gillers, a project manager at Gruzen Samton, architects who are
already building an apartment house in Battery Park City with some
green features.
</P>
<P>
   The increased cost of the project will probably keep smaller
developers from entering the competition. ``It's going to boil down
to a few who can pay,'' said Jamie LeFrak, a partner in the LeFrak
Organization, about anticipated research costs.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Merrill, the vice president for acquisitions at
Rockrose Development Corp., said after the meeting at the Battery
Park City Authority: ``I'm impressed they're taking it on, but
doable? That's what we're wrestling with.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers are not going to tango alone. Suddenly,
architects with more than a passing familiarity with environmental
issues are very much in demand. Robert Fox of Fox &AMP; Fowle
Architects, the architects in charge of 4 Times Square _ one of a
handful of large-scale green office buildings in New York City _
was called by six developers.
</P>
<P>
   William McDonough, an architect committed to sustainable design,
said he had heard from three interested in pursuing the project
with him. ``What fun!'' he said. ``It will be a delightful
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has never designed a green residential building of
this size and scope, McDonough said he looks forward to the
challenge. ``It's not rocket science,'' he said. ``It sounds like
rocket science because we're new to dealing with these issues.''
The Empire State Building is basically a green building, he added,
where the windows are operable and the floors are made of organic
materials like terrazzo and wood. ``It's really just about a clean,
light, air-friendly building.''
</P>
<P>
   Battery Park City Authority officials admitted that they were
not going to get everything they asked for. But, said James Gill,
the authority's chairman, ``It's a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Gruzen of Gruzen Samton put the impact of the city's
first green high-rise apartment building into perspective. ``It's
psychological,'' he said. ``A building like this makes people
believe there's a brave new world out there.''

 &HT;    SENATORS MOVE TO TRIPLE HIGH-TECH VISAS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing a booming U.S. economy and tight market for
skilled labor, key senators moved Wednesday to triple the number of
high-tech visas to 195,000 for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most important pieces of legislation that
will come before this Congress,'' Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said
at a news conference attended by a half-dozen Republicans at the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   His views were echoed by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of
the Judiciary Committee, who said, ``If Congress fails to act
promptly to alleviate today's high-tech labor shortage, today's low
jobless rate will be a mere precursor to tomorrow's lost
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and others stressed that under current market conditions,
successful high-tech firms cannot afford to back away from their
ongoing efforts to expand e-commerce and their work in related
cyberspace fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question,'' said Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, ``is
whether this work will get done in the United States or outside the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation would also exempt from the revised
ceilings for the so-called H-1B visa foreign researchers employed
by U.S. universities, as well as graduates who have received a
master's or doctorate degree from a U.S. college within the prior
six months.
</P>
<P>
   A 115,000 visa allotment for the 1999 fiscal year, which ended
Sept. 30, ran out last June. If nothing is done, the sponsors
predicted this year's quota will run out even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who chairs the Senate immigration
subcommittee, stressed the bipartisan nature of the bill and said
he envisioned cooperation from Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Tex., who heads
a similar House panel.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of two Democratic co-sponsors, Bob Graham of Florida
and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, joined in voicing their
support. And Smith has yet to take a public stance.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also remains wary of raising the
number of visas beyond the compromise levels enacted two years ago.
Under that legislation and without further congressional action,
the annual number of H-1B visas would drop to 107,500 on Oct. 1,
and then revert to the original level of 65,000 a year later.
</P>
<P>
   One reason behind White House coolness is that organized labor
largely opposes the drive for more high-tech visas. It contends
that it limits job opportunities for U.S. citizens and allows
employers to pay foreigners below-market salaries and avoid hiring
older native workers.
</P>
<P>
   A pro-labor lobbying group, the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, accused Abraham of ``pandering'' to high-tech
firms in return for ``substantial political contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Abraham's proposal would give away our best-paying jobs
to nationals from other countries,'' said Dan Stein, the group's
executive director. ``At a time when labor market conditions would
create incentives for high-tech employers to seek out and train
American workers for the jobs of tomorrow, Abraham is once again
ready to allow them to opt for foreign labor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basic arithmetic,'' said Paul Donnelly, another opponent
and organizer of the Immigration Reform Coalition. ``This proposed
explosion in the H-1B visa program will force all skilled
immigrants to become guest workers for at least seven years. It
will block citizenship for the best and brightest for 15-20 years.
... Instead of new Americans, this legislation will create
'permatemps'.''
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to garner broader backing for their bill, the sponsors
also added a provision for training high-tech U.S. workers. A
proposed $500 visa fee would raise $150 million for domestic
scholarships and education over the next three years.

<P>
   For the romantically inclined, a deserted tropical beach or an
elegant restaurant may be the place to propose marriage. But Bob
Shrum got down on bended knee amid the buzz of power tools.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, it was under the heavenly glow of the light bulb
display in the main aisle of the Home Depot in Wilkins Township,
Pa., that he asked Teresa Sekel to be his bride. As tears streamed
down her face, a crowd of employees and Home Depot shoppers
gathered by the couple. ``I'm sure when people saw the crowd they
must have thought it was some sort of power drill demonstration,''
Shrum said.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship started, and blossomed, last year among the
2-by-4s and the spackle. Shrum, 50, a dictation equipment salesman,
was working on his own house at the time they met. The couple went
to the store on their dates as often as four times a week. And that
house is now  &UR; their &LR;  love nest.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of love and romance are surfacing from Home Depots all
over the country. As a singles meeting place, it has become the
do-it-yourselfer's version of Barnes &AMP; Noble _ at almost any hour
of the day or night. The readers of Delaware Today magazine voted
the Wilmington Home Depot one of the Top 10 places to meet men.
Romances have started near the kitchen sinks and in the tile and
grout aisles, with at least six couples marrying under the chain's
cavernous roofs in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Nasir Khan, 26, says he has asked out women he has met at the
Flushing, Queens, Home Depot, though he considers himself shy. ``It
says a lot about her personality if she's fixing something up or
renovating _ and it usually means they have good life skills and
good credit,'' he said. Khan, who sells real estate, explained that
he looks for women with a can-do attitude. ``Women that you meet
here are going to be more serious about life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a Home Depot in Wichita, Kan., a young man proposed to his
girlfriend, whom he had met at the store, over the public address
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not in the business plan,'' said Dick Hammill,
senior vice president of marketing and communications for Home
Depot, the 20-year-old building and gardening supply mecca that has
913 stores. ``I suppose it's like the laundromat scene of the '60s
and the produce aisle of the '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Mensche, 19, who works in the kitchen and bath department
at the Home Depot in Flushing, said: ``It's almost like this place
is under some sort of spell. It's unbelievable how many people hook
up here.''
</P>
<P>
   The best nights for singles are Wednesdays and Thursdays, he
said _ weekends attract more of a family crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once watched as a guy and a girl reached for the same
sink,'' Mensche recalled. ``It was like love at first sight. I
watched them leave the store together.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities for store employees to meet customers seem to
be even better. ``Richard in lighting gets a phone number a
night,'' he added, looking enviously over in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   One aisle over, a customer, Juliet Herman, 37, was pricing wood
cleaners. ``We were just talking about meeting people here
tonight,'' she said, indicating a friend. ``I don't go to bars and
my philosophy about meeting men is, simply, You never know.'' She
was involved in renovating her home and aware of the possibility of
meeting a man with whom she has something in common.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Grauer was working in the tool corral of the Towson, Md.,
Home Depot when he saw a familiar face: Beatrice Hayes. They had
met a long time ago. The reunion led to love and, about a year
later, marriage. Their wedding, of course, took place in the Towson
Home Depot in front of 430 customers. Palm trees were dragged over
from the garden center and an arch was set up, while the store
remained open for business. ``Even during my own wedding my best
man met a customer, whom he is still dating to this day,'' Grauer
added.
</P>

   For those trying to recreate the romance of a classroom
flirtation, Home Depot University offers free courses in a variety
of building and renovation techniques. Chatting and joking around
after the class, 30 students at the Flushing store disbanded after
learning how to install a kitchen counter. Vinnie De Luca, the
teacher, said of his students, ``They're all here because they want
to learn, but you couldn't find a better place to meet someone you
have something in common with.'' And after class, there's a
Nathan's right upstairs with romantic fluorescent lighting.
</P>
<P>
   At the smattering of Home Depots across the country that stay
open 24 hours a day, customers have been spied cavorting in the
molding aisle, mingling among the electrical fixtures, flirting
over the paint chips. Sarah Kelly, 29, a movie director, frequents
one in Hollywood when she's in need of an ego boost. ``There are
always cute guys around _  &UR; helpful &LR;  cute guys,'' she emphasized.
She once held up a power drill and played dumb. ``About 10 guys
came diving at me from all directions,'' she said. ``I can't tell
you how many single friends I've told. It's just an easy place to
start up a conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Mastrianni, who is in charge of product knowledge and
the training of associates in the Hollywood Home Depot, said there
is an active social scene on Friday nights after 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to see the mix of personalities that flock in
here late at night,'' she said, adding that the mix often includes
artists, actors and dancers, with a few contractors thrown in for
good measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's an alternative to a bar,'' she said. ``Either
that, or they're meeting people at the store _ and then heading out
to a bar.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it even easier is that salespeople can be hard to
find, and so singles can ask questions of the person standing
nearest them, especially an attractive person: ``How does this
work?'' Or, ``What do you think of this color?'' Or even, ``What
are you doing later on?''

KURDISH REBELS SAY THEY WILL ABANDON WAR FOR SELF-RULE IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Kurdish rebels who have been fighting for
self-rule in Turkey since 1984 announced Wednesday that they had
given up their war and would press their cause ``within the
framework of peace and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their leader, Abdullah Ocalan, was captured a year ago, he
has repeatedly urged his fighters to lay down their weapons. The
statement issued Wednesday by his Kurdistan Workers Party was the
first that officially declared their willingness to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said that the party held an ``extraordinary
congress'' at an undisclosed location last month and that delegates
``confirmed the decision of the party leader to stop the armed
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in everyone's interest,'' the statement said. ``It means
paving the way toward peaceful and democratic unity in the Middle
East.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels added, however, that their decision was
``inseparable'' from Ocalan's fate. He has been sentenced to death.
But the government has said it will not carry out the sentence
before the European Court of Human Rights has reviewed it. The
review is expected to take at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's group is believed to have 4,500 active fighters. Most
are considered loyal to him and therefore quite likely to accept
the new decision. But a few have denounced him as a turncoat and
vowed to continue fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Combat has subsided in the mostly Kurdish southeastern
provinces. The statement suggested that the region might slowly
return to a semblance of normality after a conflict that has taken
more than 30,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sign that the Turkish authorities were prepared to
accept the disarmed rebels into the political system. Military
commanders and their civilian supporters, including Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit, have rejected overtures from Kurdish nationalists in
recent months. They consider the rebels terrorists and insist that
they surrender unconditionally and face prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been a few vague signs that the climate may be
starting to change. In a recent case before the State Security
Court, where suspected rebels and their sympathizers are tried,
military judges allowed a Kurdish woman who spoke no Turkish to be
accompanied by a translator. That was an extraordinary concession,
lawyers said, because using Kurdish in courts and other public
offices is normally forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem recently amazed many people here
when he told an interviewer that he believed that Kurdish-language
television broadcasts, which are forbidden, should be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen Kurdish intellectuals and politicians announced
last month that they planned to form a political party. They said
it would provide Kurds with a new way to express their views in the
political system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The existing pro-Kurdish party, People's Democracy, shocked the
establishment in April by winning mayoral races in nearly every
important southeastern city. Prosecutors are seeking to shut down
the party on the grounds that it supports separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Kurds traditionally use the word Kurdistan to describe the
region of Turkey where they live, along with mainly Kurdish
adjoining regions of nearby countries. But that word is anathema in
Turkey, where the authorities interpret it as an implicit call for
separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently reacting to that concern, the rebels announced in
their statement that they would drop the word from the names of
their various wings. The fighting wing, officially known as the
Kurdistan People's Salvation Army, is now to be called simply the
People's Salvation Army. A political arm, the Kurdistan National
Salvation Front, has become the Democratic People's Union.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the country would have to recover from
the trauma of war before former rebels could be welcomed into the
political arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will happen, because it has to happen,'' predicted a
retired diplomat who spent years defending his country's
uncompromising position against Kurdish nationalism. ``But it will
take time. It took a long time for Israel to bring itself to sit
down and talk with terrorists. It took a long time for Spain and
also for England. Here in Turkey, I don't think it can happen with
Ecevit and this group in power. They're too emotionally involved in
the whole thing. But in the long run, that's the direction things
have to move.''

 &HT;    Spano's appointment receives national attention
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt about it: Robert Spano is hot stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra named the Brooklyn
Philharmonic conductor as its new music director, a New York Times
columnist was mourning the fact that the 38-year-old maestro wasn't
tapped for the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   The Times opinion piece was one of numerous articles that
appeared Wednesday in U.S. newspapers and on the Internet. The
Boston Globe, Houston Chronicle and San Francisco Chronicle all had
stories. National Public Radio's ``Performance Today'' highlighted
the news with an hourlong segment that included excerpts from
Spano's New Year's Eve concert with the ASO; works by ASO conductor
Yoel Levi, who departs this summer; and recordings by Donald
Runnicles, the San Francisco Opera music director who was named ASO
principal guest conductor Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Tommasini, The New York Times classical pundit who has
long been a Spano supporter, wrote: ``His admirers, including many
critics, may wish that a major American orchestra, especially the
New York Philharmonic, had had the courage to give him the
chance.'' His rebuke was also targeted at Boston and Philadelphia,
the other top five U.S. orchestras shopping for conductors.
Tommasini's laurels were paired with a news report that appeared on
the cover of the Times' Living Arts section.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle reassured Runnicles' public that his
presence in that city won't be diminished. ``San Francisco remains
my passion and my priority,'' music critic Joshua Kosman quoted the
45-year-old Runnicles as saying. Tommasini said that the
appointment of Runnicles, ``a proven caretaker of the mainstream
repertory,'' is meant to reassure the old guard by balancing
Spano's predilection for 20th century music.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth pointing out that while both men will continue their
affiliations in Brooklyn and San Francisco, their commitment to the
ASO will not be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   The ASO search committee didn't place a residency requirement on
the music director, but Spano says he wants to move to Atlanta
anyway. He says he's ``frustrated'' that he won't be in the city
more next year. Next season, he'll conduct five weeks, then go full
time for the three seasons beginning in the fall of 2001 (14
concerts).
</P>
<P>
   Just as husbands and wives increasingly lead separate
professional lives in distant cities, the jet age has enabled
conductors to take multiple gigs. So Spano can easily honor the
five-week commitment of his Brooklyn contract. Levi lived almost
full time in Atlanta because he wanted to be with his wife and
three children.
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the advent of the jet plane, no conductor is going to
give you what Koussevitzky gave to Boston back in the '40s, or what
Stokowski and Ormandy did in Philadelphia,'' said Boston Symphony
Orchestra executive director Mark Volpe. ``Those days are past.
Most music directors commit to 12 or 15 weeks, but that's not the
whole year.''
</P>
<P>
   At ASO offices on Tuesday, staffers celebrated by shooting
fireworks, and ASO President Allison Vulgamore let out a mighty
``whoop'' as she drove out of the parking lot. Chester Jacinto, the
ASO director of public relations, said a firework struck the top of
Vulgamore's Volvo, then skipped off onto the pavement as a startled
ASO board member watched.

 &HT;    Hotel hot tub may be risky for couples on a getaway
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's the season of the tub.
</P>
<P>
   But before lovebirds take a romantic dip in a whirlpool or hot
tub, perhaps they should share a little special time with rubber
gloves and bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Some public health officials and doctors are concerned that
people looking for a simple soak could walk away with a respiratory
problem, urinary tract infection, rash or even life-threatening
illness from unsanitary or improperly cleaned tubs in hotels,
resorts and inns.
</P>
<P>
   Little research has been done on the subject. But critics say
that few hot tubs _ or the newly promoted individual jet tubs _
outside the home are maintained diligently. And, though therapeutic
tubs used in health care settings are subject to strict guidelines
and inspections, there is far less oversight of similar hotel
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real lack of data in this area,'' said Matthew
Arduino, a hospital-infections specialist with the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. ``I would like to say the risk
is low. But the problem is, it is hard for us to gauge even that,
since we're only called in during outbreaks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two decades, Arduino said, public whirlpools and hot
tubs have been the primary source of several confirmed outbreaks of
disease. Among them are Pontiac fever, a flulike illness caused by
the same water-dwelling organism that causes Legionnaires' disease;
folliculitis, an itchy skin rash caused by a bacteria called
pseudomonas aeruginosa; and respiratory illnesses such as
bronchitis. One case also involved a 10-year-old girl who
contracted atopic eczema, a skin inflammation, after sharing a hot
tub with a friend who had fever blisters caused by herpes simplex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to ruin anybody's romantic evening, but I have no idea why
anyone would want to sit in all that yuck,'' declared Dr. Dean
Edell, a syndicated San Francisco talk-show host and physician who
has crusaded against public hot tubs. (His show airs in Atlanta
from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. Saturdays on WGST.)
</P>
<P>
   The risk is high enough that medical facilities have rigorous
standards for cleaning and maintaining hot tub equipment. CDC
guidelines require sufficient chlorine levels in medical tubs and
recommend that they be drained and disinfected between patients,
Arduino said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel and motel tubs are a different matter. More hotels have
bought whirlpools, jet tubs and hot tubs in recent years, leading
manufacturers say, although they would not release sales figures.
But it's unclear how well those tubs are being cleaned and
monitored, Edell said.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, local health departments are required to inspect
hotels and motels for cleanliness and check their pools and tubs
for proper chlorination. But each county determines how often that
occurs, said Barbara Joye, spokeswoman for the state Department of
Human Resource's Division of Public Health. ``There's only been one
outbreak in the past five years that was brought to our
attention,'' Joye said. ``But we don't know about everything that
goes on out there.'' The outbreak of Pontiac fever affected a
handful of people in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Individual jet tubs, as opposed to larger, more powerful and
complex whirlpools and hot tubs, can be even more problematic.
Although health inspectors in Georgia do spot checks of the tubs as
part of a hotel bathroom's general cleanliness, there is no special
procedure for checking the jet tubs' pipes, Joye said.
</P>
<P>
   Tubs can be breeding grounds for microorganisms. ``Bio-film'' _
the slime of soap, body oils and other trapped debris that clings
to pipes _ can promote such growth.
</P>
<P>
   So where do hotels learn how to keep their tubs clean? The
American Hotel and Motel Association has standards for swimming
pools, but not tubs. The National Spa and Pool Institute, an
industry group, offers a brochure for homeowners but does not
typically address commercial use of hot tubs and whirlpools. And
standard cleaning guidelines don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called 10 hotels
seeking information about their tub-cleaning procedures. Only one _
the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown _ would give a detailed
explanation. The communal whirlpool's lint strainer is cleaned each
shift and its extensive filtering system is backwashed three times
a day. Fresh water and chemicals are also added on a daily basis,
according to Brian Flaherty, the hotel's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's four individual jet tubs are sanitized by workers
who fill the tubs with water, add chemicals and run the jets. Then,
once the water has drained, the jets are cleaned with bristle
brushes and the tub is cleaned. But Flaherty said the jet tub era
is waning _ the hotel has stopped installing them during
renovations or new construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges of jet tubs is they do, indeed, require
a great deal of maintenance,'' Flaherty said. ``But they're there,
and they need to be cleaned.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Ritz-Carlton, such cleaning information is
``proprietary,'' said spokeswoman Sandra Ryder. In Stone Mountain,
Ga., a Holiday Inn receptionist, who would not give her name, said
the hotel's jet tubs are cleaned ``with a toothbrush by the pool
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven metro Atlanta hotels _ a Hampton Inn, a
Comfort Inn, a Best Western, a Courtyard by Marriott, a Drury Inn,
a La Quinta Inn and a Hyatt Hotel _ did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of response is one reason some critics are leery of
such an aquatic romantic rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a germ freak,'' Edell said, ``find something else to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ---
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Before using a hotel whirlpool bath or hot tub, ask the hotel
management how it cleans and maintains its facilities. And if it's
a communal hot tub, such as in a health club or poolside, ask them
when they last changed the water and checked the pH levels, says
Jack Cergol, director of communications for the National Spa and
Pool Institute. The pH level should be from 7.2 to 7.8.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make sure the drain is topped with what's known as an
``anti-vortex cover,'' which can prevent suction injuries. Although
the cover doesn't have anything to do with germs, its absence
indicates a serious lack of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If all else fails, lovebirds can take the same steps
manufacturers recommend that homeowners take to clean their private
jet tubs: Pour 2 ounces of bleach into the filled tub and let it
run through the system. Then drain the water and refill the tub
before using.

   Q: I have arthritis in my hands and my daughter has multiple

</P>
<P>
   _ Jackie Parkerson, Clarksville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Author Shelley Peterman Schwarz, who has multiple sclerosis,
has written two books that help the physically challenged: ``300
Tips for Making Life With Multiple Sclerosis Easier'' (Demos
Medical Publishing, $16.95 plus $3 for handling) and ``Dressing
Tips and Clothing Resources for Making Life Easier'' (AJ Press,
$19.95 plus $3 for handling).
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz knew of no bras with Velcro brand fasteners but
suggested that ``front-opening bras in stretch fabrics may be
easier to fasten than back opening ones.'' If you have mobility in
your arms, other options are sports bras and T-strap bras.

   Q: My husband drinks regular coffee but I prefer decaf. Several
years ago, I saw a coffee maker advertised that had two carafes and
one central unit. I have not seen it lately. Is it still available?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ellen Griffin, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Another java request: In our household, one of us drinks
decaffeinated coffee and the other the fully leaded stuff. This
leads to conflict in the morning over who gets to make which coffee
first. One solution would be a coffeemaker that makes two pots of
coffee simultaneously. I've only seen one side-by-side drip coffee
maker, the Krups Duothek. Could you please help me locate it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Grover, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Blame the goverment for why you are experiencing trouble
finding Krups Duothek Therm Coffee Maker for $149.99. It has to do
with the ``banana tariff wars.'' In retaliation for Europe's
insistence on buying bananas from their former Caribbean and North
African colonies, the United States has imposed stiff penalty
tariffs on certain European goods, including French handbags and
German coffeemakers, i.e. Krups. This has doubled the price of some
items. No one knows when the dispute will be resolved but Krups
spokesman Brian Martin says he hopes it will be ``in the next few
months so once again, the Duothek can be imported into the U.S.''
Until then, to keep peace in your families, you might have to buy
two separate coffeemakers, to make your cuppa Joes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I visited the wine country in California, I bought a
bottle of Wine Away, which removes red wine stains. But I have
looked everywhere around Atlanta and can't find it. No one has even
heard of it. Please help me locate this product.
</P>
<P>
   _ A. Johnson, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: No more whining over spilled wine. The remover is at Cook's
Warehouse, 549-1 Amsterdam Ave. N.E. A 12-ounce bottle is $7.99.
Information: 404-815-4993. We also found Wine Away in the Home
Marketplace catalog (1-800-356-3876, order No. 01609). A 12-ounce
bottle is $12.95. Two or more bottles are $10.90 each. Wine Away,
according to the manufacturer, removes red wine stains from
carpeting, clothing, upholstery, even silk neckties and blouses.
Since it is made from fruit and vegetable extracts _ with no bleach
or chemicals _ it's safe around kids and pets. You can also order
online at www.TheHomeMarketplace.com. Follow the prompts: cook and
serve/cleaning/wine away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Twinkle, a copper cleaner but I can't find
it anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ Irene Walren, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another request: I am trying to locate Twinkle, a copper
polish to clean the bottom of my cookware. It seems to have
disappeared from stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cammie Cole, Dunwoody, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another Twinkle request: I am looking for Twinkle silver
polish but I can't find it in the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Joanne Walker, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: On your toes, Twinkle fans. This popular polish _ for brass
and copper and for silver _ was recently sold by S.C. Johnson Inc.
to Malco Products. In the changeover, it was temporarily off the
shelves but is now returning. The Winn-Dixie store at 1496 Church
St., Decatur (404-378-0982) has Twinkle Copper and Brass Cleaner
($2.58 for a 4 3/8-ounce container; no silver polish, however).
Twinkle, all varieties, can be ordered directly from Malco. You
must buy a case (12 4 3/8-ounce containers) for $20 plus shipping.
Order: 1-800-253-2526, Ext. 217.

LONG STRETCH FOR DAFOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins goalie Byron Dafoe is going on adrenaline and
instincts these days as his team fights for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who has started 12 consecutive games, hasn't had a break
since backup Rob Tallas got between the pipes a month ago against
Toronto. Of the Bruins' 43 games since Dafoe signed his contract
and reported to the team, he has started all but six, including the
first two right after his return.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll be right back in the pressure cooker Friday night in
New York against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to (play Dafoe). I have no choice,'' said Bruins coach
Pat Burns after Wednesday's practice at Ristuccia Arena in suburban
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for our lives here and he's our No. 1 guy.
There's no secret there. It's not a question of when we have to
give guys games, we have to try and win every game. We have to go
to our No. 1. It's tough on Robbie, I know, and he's been great
about it. But until we determine where we're going here, we have to
keep it this way.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's status quo for Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every game has been important, but obviously, they're even
more important now,'' said Dafoe, who has posted a 13-14-10 record
with a 2.80 goals-against average. ``We're involved now in a
situation where every game is like a four-point game because of
where we are in the standings.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe compares each game down the stretch to ``like a playoff
game. You have to be mentally and physically ready and do what it
takes to get a win. For me, I like to take a little nap before we
play, then think about the opponent, who their snipers are, things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dafoe said he's not into overanalyzing before each start.
``Some goaltenders like to study videotape and the way guys make
moves and stuff, but I'm more comfortable with not labeling guys
too much. If you do, then that one time, he can do the opposite and
you look foolish,'' said Dafoe. ``Obviously you know certain
players have certain habits, like (Washington's) Adam Oates likes
to pass the puck and Peter Bondra likes to shoot the puck, so you
know that as they're coming down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're facing a guy on a breakaway, there's no rhyme or
reason as to what he's going to do. Sure, there are guys who you
know like to shoot high glove side, and I've had times where I've
prepared for that, but I also haven't given anything else away and
come up with the big save.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what he's going to have to do to keep the Bruins from
falling out of the playoff picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about playing a lot is that if you've had a
tough night, you know you're going right back in again,'' he said.
``You look at what happened, what went wrong, and what you could
have done to make a particular stop, then put it in the bank and
work the next practice. And when the next game comes, you've got a
fresh 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe said the Bruins have played better lately. But the fact
that some recent games have been lost in overtime (against Florida
and Calgary) or tied late in the final period (Ottawa and
Washington) has frustrated him and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record has been pretty good lately, but it could have been
really good,'' he said. ``There was some frustration and
disappointment in those games because we were almost there. But
there has definitely been a trend for the better and if we can get
over that little hump, we'll be on a real roll here.''

 &HT;    When it comes to romance, nothing tastes like chocolate to
deliver message of love on Valentine's
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chocolate as an aphrodisiac? It's a titillating idea but one
that scientists have yet to prove. It's more like chocolate is an
obsession, when you consider that 36 million boxes of the sweet
stuff will be sold for Valentine's Day, according to the Chocolate
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   But chocolate and romance do share a close, personal tie. Aztec
ruler Montezuma reportedly drank 50 cups of chocolate a day to
bolster himself before attending to his harem of 600 women. That's
a lot of cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   And Casanova indulged in chocolate, believing it would enhance
his sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever chocolate's powers, tradition dictates that sweethearts
give and receive chocolate on Feb. 14 _ a romantic ritual that
sends messages of love.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll sponsored by the Chocolate Manufacturers Association,
nearly 80 percent of men and women named Valentine's Day as the No.
1 chocolate gift-giving occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We predict that $1 billion will be spent on candy for
Valentine's Day 2000,'' says Susan Smith, spokeswoman for the
chocolate group. ``And nearly all of that's for chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   You can spend $5 to $50 _ and up _ for a fancy, heart-shaped,
1-pound box of chocolates. Ever wonder why one kind is so much more
expensive than another?
</P>
<P>
   First, you might think it's the box: A dense velvet heart vs.
basic cardboard with no embellishments.
</P>
<P>
   Not always.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, we recently shopped around for a variety of
Valentine chocolates. We found simple, heart-shaped cardboard boxes
from Russell Stover and Whitman's Sampler filled with about a pound
of chocolate for under $10 apiece. Then we paid $56 for a pound of
Godiva chocolates snugly ensconced in a lush, burgundy velvet
heart, studded with tiny gold-toned dots. The Godiva box won the
beauty contest hands down.
</P>
<P>
   The box that would easily come in second was a garnet velvet
heart boasting a cream satin bow and a satin bottom. It was filled
with 15 truffle hearts. The 6.5-ounce box cost $10.99. It looked
much more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   While we may ooh and ahh over the elegant boxes, the real test
is in how the chocolate tastes. And does a fat price tag
necessarily mean better flavor?
</P>
<P>
   According to Smith, there is a difference in quality among
chocolate makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly the ingredients they use. For instance, some
manufacturers use vanillin instead of real vanilla, and some use
more chocolate liquor. And I know that some manufacturers process
the chocolate longer for a smoother texture. Of course, some
chocolates are handmade, and you'll pay more for the artistry.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TO BUY COCOLATE
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ways to tell the difference between the
inexpensive and the pricey brands:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Check ingredients: Fine chocolates should be made of natural
ingredients such as cocoa butter, sugar, chocolate liquor, cream or
milk and flavors. And look for vanilla rather than the artificial
vanillin. Some less expensive chocolate uses edible shellac.
Chances are, if you can't pronounce many of the ingredients, you're
dealing with artificial additives that lower the quality.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How they're made: Expensive chocolates cost more to make _ and
it usually shows. Many chocolatiers, in the European tradition, use
elaborate and distinctive molds in the manufacturing process. And
some boutique brands sold in select outlets actually hand-dip
pieces. Often with less costly, mass-produced chocolates, you'll
see few variations, and it's a sure bet that little, if any,
hands-on labor was involved.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Let your senses be the judge: High quality chocolates should
have a glossy, polished look, with no blemishes on the exterior.
</P>
<P>
   As you would with wine, take in the scent of an opened box of
chocolate. It should have a fresh, rich aroma. And finally, when
tasting chocolate look for a smooth texture, not grainy. Fine
chocolate should have a slight ``snap'' when you bite into the
shell.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder if it's really worth shelling out $56 for a pound of
chocolates in a red velvet heart-shaped box? It may not be,
according to our informal, blind taste test of five popular
chocolates available locally. Each taster sampled a selected candy
from each of the test boxes. The panel of four members of the
features staff rated each category using a range of 1 to 10 _
meaning a possibility of up to 40 points in each of three
categories: taste, value and appearance. The testers had no idea
which candy was which until the tasting was complete. Only then did
they make a judgment on the dollar-to-pound value. Surprisingly,
none of the candies earned higher than 79 points out of a possible
120. Perhaps even more surprising was the fact that the humble
Whitman's Sampler _ the least expensive of our boxes _ was the
favorite among our testers.

THE FANTASTICAL FUTURE OF TV
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: RESENDING for ARIZONA REPUBLIC.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What we've called television for the past 50 years is undergoing
radical changes at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television as we know it will be gone in 15 years,'' says Jim
Chabin, president of the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
Remember the talk a few years back of a 500-channel universe?
Though we're not quite there yet, we're already talking 500,000
channels. And the speed at which technology is moving is likely to
make that happen sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is technology altering the types of programming we'll
be seeing but the way we watch television, too. Once called the
boob tube, TV is becoming increasingly interactive and
computerlike.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few signs the future is almost here:
</P>
<P>
   _ In the past year, AT&AMP;T bought two of the world's largest cable
companies, Microsoft bought a chunk of AT&AMP;T, and this month America
Online made a deal to merge with Time Warner with its cable and
broadcast networks, No. 2 cable system and music, movie and TV
studios. And you can count on more major corporate marriages like
these, as other big players try to position themselves for a new
entertainment world order. This competition is likely to spur
changes as these new companies try to roll out their technologies
first.
</P>
<P>
   _ A variety of new devices are smearing boundaries between TV,
the Internet and other media, including sophisticated new digital
cable set-top boxes, WebTV Plus, the Replay and TIVO personal video
recorders, computer peripherals such as ATI's All-in-Wonder 128
graphics card and videogame consoles like the forthcoming
PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the first time this fall, viewers could more actively take
part in some of the shows they love, as with enhanced versions of
``Jeopardy'' and ``Wheel of Fortune,'' thanks to interactive
technology developed by a Los Angeles company called Mixed Signals.
Again, owners of WebTV Plus machines and other set-top boxes can
use their remote to play along, as information transmitted in the
closed-caption part of the TV signal is used to key action on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   _ ABC TV regularly touted on air the interactive aspects of its
``Monday Night Football'' telecasts. Tonight's broadcast of the
Super Bowl on ABC will feature the same enhanced TV offerings of
the network's Monday Night Football, including a pick-the-play game
synchronized to the second with the broadcast. The ABC, NFL and
ESPN Web sites will also include such features as a ``momentum
meter'' that tracks emotional shifts in the game's progress.
</P>
<P>
   Both before and after the game, the sites will feature chats
with sports figures, scouting guides, and analysis and statistics,
among other information.
</P>
<P>
   _ MTV game show ``WebRIOT'' also requires its viewers to log on
to the MTV.com Web site with their computer while watching the show
if they want to play along. But 44,000 people a day are doing so.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dish Network's new Dish Player takes the idea further,
combining a satellite TV receiver, personal video recording
services and WebTV Plus. TIVO and Philips are creating a similar
device for the leading satellite service, DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the computer world, peripheral companies are doing their
own boundary pushing. ATI's All-In-Wonder 128 graphics card, for
instance, gives a computer such capabilities as HDTV tuning,
replay-like video recording, video editing and the ability to play
DVDs and audio CDs, even karaoke titles in the Video CD format.
</P>
<P>
   And what's driving all this? Money, of course. There's a ton of
it to be made, making it easy to buy what you see on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   RespondTV made a splash last year with an experiment selling
pizza to Bay Area WebTV Plus users watching a ``Star Trek''
marathon. The WebTV Plus, a $199 box sold by Sony and Philips based
around a Microsoft service, provides a simple Internet connection
through the television.
</P>
<P>
   RespondTV's behind-the-scenes software let WebTV viewers use the
box's remote control and wireless keyboard to order a pizza without
even leaving their couch to get the cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 250 people clicked on the ad, and 150 people bought a
pizza, out of maybe 1,000 who could actually see the ad,'' said
RespondTV President Richard Fisher. Advertisers love numbers like
those, and will pay big to get similar results, said Josh Bernoff,
Forrester Research principal analyst, who predicts that by 2004,
there will be 24 million U.S. households able to interact with
their TVs.
</P>
<P>
   And in the future, such impulse buys will be even easier,
because the digital cable set-top boxes now being put in homes
around America will already know the buyer's address and billing
information, Fisher said. Buying will be as easy as changing
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct marketing is a $160 billion industry that TV doesn't
participate in any appreciable way,'' Fisher said. Soon it will.
</P>
<P>
   Even devices long considered as little brothers to the TV set,
videogame consoles, are getting smarter and more powerful. Sony's
PlayStation 2 comes to the United States this fall with a DVD
player, leading-edge computer chips and high-speed peripheral
connections that can turn it into a home entertainment and Internet
center.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has also promised to create a high-speed broadband service
in 2001 so PlayStation 2 owners can attach hard drives and fast
modems to their machines and download movies and music.
</P>
<P>
   You can already watch, rent, even buy digital movies on the
Internet, though much needs to be done to make it as easy as
turning on a TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is possible to watch video on the PC, it's
uncomfortable,'' Bernoff said. ``Computers are not typically set up
right to make that easy. So most of what you see right now with
video on PCs is a dress rehearsal.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sightsound.com was the first to offer a downloadable,
feature-length movie for sale or rent, the independent sci-fi flick
``Pi.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had it up for 3 1/2 weeks,'' said company co-founder
Scott Sander. ``And about half the sales were to strategic sales
people at the studios. It wasn't a business yet, it was an
expedition, but we learned a lot in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of other companies are joining Sightsound online, some
buying movies and other programs, and others creating original
shows, said Mariana Danelovic, senior manager of the digital media
business incubator for KPMG Peat Marwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think within the next couple of years there's going to be
more and more programming on the Web that's going to be TV-like,''
Danelovic said. ``I don't believe that mass-broadcast events are
the way to use the Internet effectively. What we've developed are
the niche media networks.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Entertaindom.com, a Warner Bros. entertainment site in
Burbank, scored a notable success with its much-downloaded animated
short, ``The Peeper,'' created by hot comedian Adam Sandler. Other
big-name performers are also coming to the Web, such as comedian
Robin Williams and musical entrepreneur Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, which
will only increase viewer interest in Web-based programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Internet is going to be the new place for
entertainment,'' said Mediatrip.com president Robert Faust.
Mediatrip had its own Net hit this fall with ``George Lucas in
Love,'' a short spoof that Faust said drew 150,000 viewings in
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are big numbers for a company that's not doing much
marketing right now,'' said Faust. For comparison, a decently rated
cable show will have around 1.5 million households watching at any
given moment.
</P>
<P>
   If all this sounds dizzying, listen to Robert Hopkins, senior
vice president and general manager of Sony's High-Definition Data
Center and one of the authors of the U.S. HDTV technical
specifications. ``If you can't do it now, just wait a couple of
years. We'll be delivering video one way or another into the home.
I believe things like the home theater are going to be even more
important than they are now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a quick list of places to go to look for video content on
the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   _ Yack.com (www.yack.com): It styles itself as a TV Guide for
the Internet, with listings of live events you can watch and
expanded coverage of other programming. A good place to get a sense
of what 500 million channels really means.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sightsound.com (www.sightsound.com): They hold the patents on
several key parts of the business of downloading music and movies
from the Net. And they hope to become the company helping studios
sell their stuff online. They already have dozens of mostly B
movies and independent works available. With their patents in their
back pocket, they've scaled up big time and plan to be a big
purveyor of studio product in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atom Films (www.atomfilms.com): Mika Salmi has been collecting
tons of short films, including ``Plug,'' the much-heralded
11-minute short by USC grad Meher Gourjian, and ``The Qui-Gon
Show,'' a parody of our favorite interstellar blockbuster from a
galaxy far, far away. One of the big stars of the new broadcasting
paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   _ WireBreak.com (www.wirebreak.com): ``Forget coffee, take a
wire break,'' goes the pitch from this Venice-based company trying
to attract the interest of college kids and corporate drones with
access to high-speed business or university connections. They're
producing four shows so far in bite-size chunks designed to appeal
to those with fast connections and short breaktimes.
</P>
<P>
   _ MediaTrip.com (www.mediatrip.com): The Hollywood-based company
has acquired Internet sites to some distinctive shows, such as the
``Shakespeare in Love'' spoof ``George Lucas in Love,'' and its own
original content, such as the way politically incorrect ``Lil'
Pimp'' animated series, a weekly stand-up comedy series at Largo in
Hollywood, plus a weekly music show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Digital Entertainment Network (www.den.net): An ambitious
Santa Monica-based company targeting very narrow slices of the teen
market, with 30 shows and related chat rooms, games, bulletin
boards and more for everything from fraternity slobs to Christian
teens to East L.A. youths to skatepunks. Short video segments are
optimized to play adequately even on slow connections.
</P>
<P>
   _ Film (www.ifilm.com): Like Atom, iFilm has been busily locking
up rights to a lot of shorts and other films by others. They have a
sleek site and a solid array of offerings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yahoo Broadcast Services (www.yahoo.com): Yahoo bought
Broadcast.com for five really big ones (that would be billions of
dollars), tucked it into a corner and have been trying to figure
out how to best show off the hundreds of thousands of hours of
content Broadcast.com has accumulated. A lot of the archival stuff
is pretty great and now much more accessible. The vast archives
include a ton of news and other non-fiction material, plus lots of
oddball stuff.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eruptor.com (www.eruptor.com): Not a lot of stuff, but some
pretty gorgeous and interesting initial original programming. They
have marketing savvy and ambition, with their own set of ``Eruptor
girls'' and small-time stars such as Olivia D'Abo in their
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Threshold (www.thethreshold.com): The same fellows who
brought you ``Mortal Kombat'' movies, games, TV shows and
everything else are now going online with an array of programs
pitched solely for young males. If you're about 24 and dripping
with testosterone, this is digital heaven: Duke Nukem, Conan the
Barbarian and Rena Mero (formerly WWF wrestler Sable) among much
else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pseudo.com (www.pseudo.com): A New York-based Web
entertainment site with a wide array of its own programming,
including such show.
</P>
<P>
   _ Soundbreak.com (www.soundbreak.com): A music site that has
live DJs (complete with streaming video of them at work) playing a
wide array of music.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spike Radio (www.spikeradio.com): A quirky Net radio site with
internationalist techno tendencies, this Hollywood-based operation
is doing some video now, with plans to do a much wider base of
lifestyle and music in the next couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Launch Media (www.launch.com): Santa Monica-based Launch has
cut deals with three of the Big Five record labels to show their
music videos on its site. Launch, which first made a name for
itself with a CD-ROM-based ``magazine'' that focuses on music, film
and gaming, now is expanding its Web presence substantially, not
only with music videos but its own Web radio service, called
Launchcast.
</P>
<P>
   _ Global Music Network (www.gmn.com): It specializes in
classical, jazz and opera music, with 60 hours of video and 200
hours of audio available for listening. They recently added opera
king Placido Domingo to their board of directors. He also will
produce music of his own and of other artists for the site.
</P>
<P>
   _ BreakTV (www.breaktv.com?): This Sherman Oaks-based company
mostly brings traditional TV shows to the Internet, without much
modification. The company is also doing some original content, and
running contests, but otherwise adding little to the TV experience.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For a while, to judge from their home videos, Jesse and Crystal
Money and their newly adopted daughter made a happy family. But
that did not last long. Within weeks of bringing the blond,
blue-eyed 9-year-old Russian girl to their home in Atlanta, they
discovered that she was angry, destructive and something of a
thief.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Money tells the story in ``The Perfect Child,'' when she
came upon Samantha (a pseudonym) holding her 2-year-old son,
Joshua, over the edge of a 30-foot-high deck, she feared that the
girl was about to carry out her threats to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   The Moneys, who first located the girl through the Internet,
complain to Troy Roberts, Thursday night's ``48 Hours'' reporter,
that they were not fully alerted to her condition by the adoption
agency, which gave them a glowing account of the girl's personality
despite evidence of mental retardation.
</P>
<P>
   For four months, until the Moneys' cash ran out, Samantha was in
the care of psychiatrists. One labeled her ``a homicide risk,'' and
she was put on antidepressants. The couple installed cameras in
several rooms of their home to keep track of Samantha and sent
Joshua off to stay with his grandmother in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although the adoption agency, the Frank Foundation, seems to
have a respectable record and one official hints that the Moneys'
reaction to the girl's behavior may have been excessive (Mrs. Money
describes Samantha as a conscienceless sociopath who is incapable
of bonding or affection), the program cautions the thousands of
American families seeking to adopt foreign-born children that
regulation is spotty and that they may not be getting the whole
truth.
</P>
<P>
   A second case reported Thursday night leaves open the
possibility that a different couple might have been more welcoming
to Samantha despite her problems. A couple accepts two children
with disabilities who have been rejected by their adoptive parents.
The new parents are committed to sustaining a loving home as they
try to meet their children's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The Moneys, however, gave up on Samantha. ``She doesn't love
us,'' Mrs. Money says. ``She doesn't know what love is.''
</P>
<P>
   They took the girl back to a psychiatric hospital in Russia and
surrendered their adoptive rights. Samantha says she wants to
return to her American home, and the adoption agency has recently
brought her back to this country but has not yet placed her with a
new family. For now, as Roberts sums up in this affecting report,
Samantha is deemed to be ``defective merchandise.''

 &HT;    Breezy Oxygen still working on its elements
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   See Oprah. See Oprah sit down. See Oprah learn to turn on a
computer. See Oprah learn this is a mouse and this is a mouse pad.
See Oprah learn to go online. See Oprah go straight to ...
Oprah.com. See Oprah's entourage get excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a nice page, Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lovely page.''
</P>
<P>
   See Oprah get excited, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my page!''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes of ``Oprah Goes Online,'' a new offering on the
week-old cable channel Oxygen, in which Oprah Winfrey is a
prominent investor, we learned: how to turn on a computer and how
to surf Oprah.com, a link on Oxygen.com, the Internet adjunct of
Oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy. As Oprah reviewed the important points of her
online experience: ``First, you need a staff of 25...''
</P>
<P>
   There's something breathtaking about Oxygen, a new network for
just us girls. Programming blows by like the blue air bubbles that
swirl all around the channel's logo. It's a disorienting mix of the
exasperating and the shameless, with some inventive ideas tossed
in. It plays less like a network than a telethon, a kind of run-on
variety show that moves from one act to the next and never stops
pitching, hoping you're committed enough to the cause _ in this
case, women _ to stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Staying tuned wasn't easy during the first week of Oxygen. Let's
call it a work in progress, with a slate of uneven programming that
mostly provides advice and insight for women who view advice and
insight as a consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen begins at 6 a.m. with two hours of yoga called
``Inhale,'' and finishes in prime time with ``Exhale,'' a talk show
hosted by Candice Bergen, who in a Rooms to Go setting encourages
guests to speak their deepest psychobabble (``...helping girls
develop competencies,'' was one author's attempt).
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the day is peppered with the likes of the network's
signature ``Pure Oxygen,'' two hours of news-they-think-you-can-use
(Problem: ``What can I wear when I'm sipping latte at Starbucks
with the girls?'' Solution: ``I found this sleek rain coat online
at bananarepublic
</P>
<P>
   .com''). ``The Girl in the Picture'' unreels vintage (really
old) movies with female stars, and adds ``Pop Up Video''-style
comments at the bottom of the screen (``Bette Davis once posed nude
for a sculptor''). ``Trackers'' is an after-school teen show, where
you'll learn that kids would rather have a rumor about them being
weird than dumb.
</P>
<P>
   The weekends include Oprah's Webfomercial disguised as computer
advice; a headache-inducing ``Pajama Party,'' featuring pajama-clad
girls (sure this isn't ``The Man Show''?) who pretend to be
thrilled by guests like Jerry O'Connell; and ``X-Chromosome,'' an
animated half-hour that explores the feminine psyche so sharply and
so darkly it seems out of place amid all the other see-through
...oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Other early observations:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow'' is the most-used exclamation on the network. Second
place: ``This is so cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-founder Geraldine Laybourne appeared during an interview with
a female boxer on ``Pure Oxygen'' wearing boxing gloves and
throwing punches at a heavy bag (``I've learned it's all in the
footwork and staying relaxed and breathing and snorting''). She
should never do that again.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites aren't nearly as interesting to look at on TV as they
are on computers.
</P>
<P>
   The parenting advice, spliced in throughout the day, is the most
practical on TV. Your kid throws a tantrum? Put her in front of a
full-length bedroom mirror, where she'll laugh when she sees
herself, giving you time to figure out what to do next. Why didn't
we think of that?
</P>
<P>
   The mom of one ``Trackers'' host is ``so proud'' of her. Another
host's dad is ``like a total nut job.'' Another host used to go to
Chinatown when she was a kid. ...Oh, sorry, there's an audience?
</P>
<P>
   Fun facts about women: They have a better sense of smell than
men, they have better endurance because of their body fat (``You
knew it had to be good for something!'') and they're ``horn dogs
like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxygen is one more reason there will always be a Teri Garr.
She's a panelist on the network's remake of the '50s game show
``I've Got a Secret,'' hosted by former talk show washout Stephanie
Miller. The rest of the celebrity panel: Amy Yasbeck (``Wings''),
Christopher Reid (Kid of Kid 'n Play) and Hal Sparks (``Talk
Soup''). If you remember the '50s version, Garr is the new
millennium's Peggy Cass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we watched.
</P>
<P>
   That's plenty for now. Oxygen clearly sees itself as the future.
It's nutty for ``convergence,'' the notion that the TV and home
computer will someday be one. Hosts constantly read e-mails and
herd viewers to Web sites, while Internet addresses show up on a
bar at the bottom of the screen even for products being advertised.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional couch potatoes could experience a bit of vertigo:
all the floating information and wall-less boundaries between
what's a show, what's an ad and what's a promo take a while to get
a handle on.
</P>
<P>
   The look and attitude is all over the place. Oxygen acts smart
and hip even as it's condescending and banal. It tries so hard to
be up to the minute, it often looks dated the second it's done
(didn't we see that last year on ``TalkBack Live''?). It wants to
appeal both to girls and grrrls, and winds up somewhere in that
great nowhere middle.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its interactive viewers have been disappointed, if
messages in www.oxygen.com are an indication. This one was typical:
a woman excited about the network, but cranky about what she's
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``After catching bits and pieces of your channel for a week, I'm
really confused,'' she wrote. ``Exactly what is the demographics
you are shooting for? I'm not sure I'm any of them. ...I've
nicknamed Lifetime the `somebody stole my baby' channel. You guys
must be the `Reviving Ophelia' channel. A noble cause no doubt but
some of your programming is very condescending. ... Maybe I should
just go back to watching `The View.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wow.

LOSING PRIVACY IN THE AGE OF THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
 (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word privacy does not appear in the Constitution of the
United States, and yet most Americans tell pollsters that they
consider privacy to be one of their fundamental rights, one from
which many of our other constitutionally protected rights derive.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, citizens willingly part with small nuggets of
their privacy every day as a trade-off for small but important
conveniences, among them the ability to pay for purchases with
credit cards, to use automated teller machines and to receive basic
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing number of people willingly spend an increasing
part of their lives connected to the Internet, the most voracious
vacuum of personal data in history.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st
Century,'' Simson Garfinkle details insidious threats to privacy
that arise from the Internet, from public and private surveillance
cameras, from biometric devices and medical technology, from spy
satellites and computer chips, and above all from the unrestrained
gathering and unauthorized sharing of personal information through
computer databases.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbing equation of advancing technology and diminishing
privacy is hardly new. Louis Brandeis and James Warren warned of it
more than a century ago in a Harvard Law Review article that
articulated the ``right to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been many important books about privacy and
technology in recent years. But Garfinkle's, arriving on the cusp
of the 21st century, is the first to catalog how new technologies
are being systematically deployed to strip people of their privacy,
and to propose an agenda for safeguarding what little remains of
our privacy as digital technology advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Database Nation'' is illuminating and disturbing, fascinating
in its explanations of new technologies, but easily accessible to
readers who might not otherwise have an interest in computers.
Garfinkle's accounts of privacy abuses are alarming, not because
they are unusually horrifying but because they are so familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkle, a computer programmer and a graduate of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has lived his entire life in
the computer era. He was born in 1965, the year the federal
government proposed building the National Data Center, a vast
database that would be a central depository of cradle-to-grave
electronic records for every citizen.
</P>
<P>
   As with many new technologies, the National Data Center was
envisioned as an engine for efficiency that would benefit all
citizens by consolidating their personal records _ birth
certificates, tax records, school records, Social Security records,
military records, medical records and death records _ into one
vast, easily searchable data bank.
</P>
<P>
   The center was never built, in part because of concerns about
its cost and in part because of concerns about privacy. Instead,
each federal agency was encouraged to build its own database. As
the cost and capacity of computers became more attractive, major
businesses also began building databases.
</P>
<P>
   These disparate databases proliferated, each with its own
guidelines and policies, and Garfinkle's database nation was born.
In the ensuing decades, it has been so nourished by new
technologies that these pools of personal data are ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   At a technology conference that ended Wednesday in Palm Springs,
Calif., for example, more than a dozen fledgling Internet companies
took turns detailing for an eager audience of electronic commerce
executives and venture capitalists technologies that could more
efficiently capture information about people online. Some managed
to make their presentations without once mentioning privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Such events underscore Garfinkle's contention that the main
threat to privacy does not arise from an Orwellian totalitarian
state, but rather from commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   But is the technology itself a threat to privacy, or is it the
humans who control the technology? Garfinkle begins his book by
arguing that ``technology by itself doesn't violate our privacy or
anything else; it's the people using this technology and the
policies they carry out that create the violations.''
</P>
<P>
   But he ends by arguing that the ``technology is neutral''
argument is wrong. ``History is replete with the dehumanizing
effects of technology,'' he writes. ``By its very nature,
technology is intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   There are arguments on both sides. On the human side, the Health
Privacy Project at Georgetown University released a report last
week concluding that most Internet health sites, including online
pharmacies, do not adhere to their own privacy policies. Some of
these companies provide health information about their customers to
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And on the technical side, England's national DNA database,
which stores what is unquestionably the most intrusive and personal
information about its citizens, was reported this week to have
mistakenly identified an innocent man as a burglar, throwing the
science of DNA matching into an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   The future promises more exotic inventions with the potential to
impinge on privacy, including, as Garfinkle notes, brain mapping
(akin to mind reading), intellectual avatars and autonomous
software agents. But Garfinkle argues that it is possible to stop,
or at least control, the policies that enable abuses of the
technology. Doing so requires that, on a societal level, we change
our thinking and our laws.
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkle notes in his book, for example, that there is no
federal law prohibiting the unauthorized release of personal
medical information. And he proposes an agenda for change,
including the creation of a permanent federal agency charged with
safeguarding privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Garfinkle notes the impact that Rachel
Carson's book ``Silent Spring'' had on the environmental movement,
and unabashedly seeks to have the same positive impact on the cause
of privacy. One can only hope that it succeeds. &QL;

FORBES CASHES OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on his showing in the three small states that have voted
so far, Steve Forbes will not be greatly missed following his
departure from the presidential campaign Wednesday. In quitting the
race, however, Forbes leaves lessons both personal and systemic.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes made a splash in 1996 with his 17 percent flat tax
proposal, which had an appealing veneer of equity to some voters.
But the plan made little sense then and even less in 2000. With the
gap between the highest income earners and those with more modest
salaries widening further in four years, the flat tax has not
resonated with voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the current campaign, Forbes essayed an unsubtle appeal to
the religious right. His conversion, freighted with moralizing, was
so obviously a cynical attempt to win a narrow voting bloc that he
ended up capturing only a few of those votes in Iowa and turning
off more broad-minded Republicans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he pressed on. Only in America could a candidate so lacking
in credentials have even a faint hope of actually winning the White
House. He could have run in New Jersey for Congress or governor;
perhaps he still should.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth Forbes's most outstanding quality as a national
candidate was his checkbook. The reason that he lasted so long this
year was not his tax plan or his support from the fundamentalist
right, but his cash.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republicans were more plausible candidates _ with
more experience and better visions. Lamar Alexander, Elizabeth
Dole, and John Kasich are three. All had difficulties with their
campaigns, but a lack of funds meant they had no ability to recover
and gain their footing.
</P>
<P>
   With the enormous costs of the bi-coastal March 7 primary
looming so early, the field has been winnowed too soon. The nation
is lucky that vigorous two-person campaigns still exist in both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   But the field should not be so limited nine months before the
election. Next time, money and the calendar should play lesser
roles.

 Employers have no business knowing genetic information  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you want to know if you're predisposed to cancer, muscular
dystrophy, heart disease and the like?
</P>
<P>
   Some people do. Some don't.
</P>
<P>
   There's agreement, though, on a follow-up question: Would you
want your employer to know?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton issued an executive order this week barring
the use of genetic information as a condition of hiring or
extending benefits to federal employees. He also endorsed bills
pending in Congress that would extend similar protection to
private-sector employees and job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   These are necessary. Potential misuse of genetic information
threatens individual privacy and employment security. And, as we
all know from weather forecasts, no prediction should get the
weight of a guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Much medical good flows from gene research. We can pinpoint
inherited errors in some genes that are responsible for thousands
of diseases. We know of countless other disorders that occur when
inherited tendencies interact with lifestyle and environment.
</P>
<P>
   It's now possible to predict susceptibility to many disorders
and work to prevent or treat them early.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that the same knowledge _ if shared with others
_ also provides fuel to deny applicants a job or insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   An employer worried about rising benefits expenses or
absenteeism could dump an applicant whose pre-employment medical
tests revealed an increased risk for incapacitation.
</P>
<P>
   A boss could choose to promote only those employees whose
genetic workups don't indicate possible debilitation ahead.
</P>
<P>
   To deter this from happening, some states are augmenting federal
law by enacting genetic privacy laws. Many more states have bills
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Definitions and focus vary in the slew of legislation, as do
interpretations of federal protections provided in the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Americans With
Disabilities Act and rulings from the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the executive order nor the sum of existing and proposed
legislation provides once-and-for-all direction or protection
against genetic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The best advice may be, to borrow from another situation,
``Don't ask, don't tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers shouldn't request or disclose employees' genetic
information. Employees should resist sharing it.
</P>
<P>
   Until (if ever) the law catches up with science, chances are
good that employees will be discriminated against and employers
will be accused _ rightly or wrongly _ of genetic discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   But if employers don't have genetic information, they can't be
accused of discriminating because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, some workers whose family medical histories indicate
a high health risk are refusing genetic tests. It's not the
possible health indicators alone that they fear. It's workplace
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   We shouldn't hear of people refusing diagnostic breakthroughs
because they're afraid the knowledge would cause them to lose their
insurance, job offers or chance for advancement.

HACK ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet is an extraordinary tool for knowledge and
commerce, but its reliability is open to question after the hacking
attacks this week. Yahoo! and the other companies have been put on
notice that they must protect their sites better against the
hackers' electronic barrage if the Internet is to become a
rock-solid communications medium like the telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno was right to give this crime top
priority. Finding the hackers will be difficult, however, since
they use relay computers to bombard the sites with thousands of
messages, thus effectively shutting them down. These relays can be
computers in companies hundreds or thousands of miles from the
hackers' own. And the saboteurs themselves could well be foreigners
_ sometimes beyond the reach of US law _ although their targets _
Yahoo!, Amazon, eBay, and others _ suggest a familiarity with
well-known US Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington can help, the responsibility for security rests
first with each company. These sites have extraordinary stock
market valuations, and Yahoo! is making a profit. They have enough
money and market power to hire the best people to improve internal
protection and demand that their Internet service providers and the
companies where the relay computers are located build similar
protections into their systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released last week, Deloitte &AMP; Touche and the
Information Systems Audit and Control Foundation found that
Internet companies often place a low priority on security issues in
the mistaken belief that their sites are protected. Many companies
do not have clearly defined policies and, if they do, consider
security issues in isolation without regard to problems at other
sites with which they did business.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is decentralized enough so that other sites were
available to offer similar services when Yahoo! and the others were
down. And the level of electronic commerce is low enough so that
the disruptions did not cause great damage. But the major Web sites
are now on notice that they must be adequately protected if
e-commerce is to reach its full potential.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even in the privacy of his home, a handsome but
debris-strewn brownstone in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn,
Dave Eggers cannot seem to spit out the words without mumbling
apologetically. But if you were 29 and had written a memoir with
the kick-me title of ``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,''
you might mumble, too.
</P>
<P>
   (He knows, he knows. ``The author wishes to acknowledge your
problems with the title,'' he writes in the book's long, hilarious
``acknowledgments'' section. ``He too has reservations.'')
</P>
<P>
   If Eggers, who has the laconic manner and speech patterns of a
Venice Beach Hacky Sack player, has a slightly hard time explaining
himself in person, he has no such trouble in the book, the amazing
story of his life so far. It is the story of how both of his
parents died of cancer in the space of five weeks, leaving Eggers,
then just out of college and as devoted to having a good time as to
anything, to raise his 8-year-old brother, Toph, with the
intermittent help of two older siblings.
</P>
<P>
   It is the story of how he and some friends threw themselves into
the sleepless, heady world of startup magazines in San Francisco in
the early 1990s, believing in all seriousness that they could
reinvent the medium, and of how Eggers almost got a spot on MTV's
``The Real World,'' something his older, wiser self now finds
deeply embarrassing. And it is a story about storytelling itself,
about being self-consciously ironic in the particular, cynical way
of Eggers' skittish, self-referential generation, but also about
being young and idealistic and funny and full of life even as the
world falls apart around you.
</P>
<P>
   In the throes of some early media stardom that seems guaranteed
only to escalate, Eggers comes across as quizzical, friendly and
very slow-spoken. Toph, now 16 and a high school student (Eggers
won't say where and kindly asks that Toph, whom he refers to as
``the boy,'' not be interviewed), is in the room next door, working
on his computer and occasionally shouting to his brother.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the author, whose hair springs up in tightly
coiled corkscrews as if he has been plugged into an electrical
outlet, is uncourteous or unwilling to respond to questions about
himself. It is just that he has already addressed most of them in
the book, a tour de force of controlled, taut writing mixed with
wild flights of fantasy and long, self-indulgent rants that
alternately amuse, annoy, tease and disturb.
</P>
<P>
   The first question has to be, How much of this strange account
is true?
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of it, to a point, Eggers says. He discusses this
interesting issue numerous times in the book, beginning with a long
opening section in which he acknowledges, among other things, ``his
friends at NASA and the United States Marine Corps'' and ``the
distinguished senator from Massachusetts.'' (There is also an offer
of $5 ``from a U.S. bank, probably Chase Manhattan, which is not a
good bank _ do not open an account there,'' to the first 200 people
who write in proving that they have read the book.)
</P>
<P>
   It is here that he comes right out and says it: He is an author
with a ``propensity to fib in order to make himself look better, or
worse, whichever serves his purpose at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also occasionally merged events, toyed with chronology,
changed details so as not to hurt people's feelings and massaged
the dialogue so that, for instance, his and his friends' habit of
punctuating sentences with the words ``dude'' and ``like'' is not
reflected in the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events ran over me like a truck,'' Eggers said of his
parents' death, leaving him with no choice but to write and write
until it had all worked itself, sort of, out of his system. He
wrote as a substitute for psychiatric help. (``Dave would never,
never go to therapy,'' said his friend Zev Borow in an interview.)
He wrote well past midnight night after night, fueled by adrenaline
and a particularly eye-opening soda called Surge.
</P>
<P>
   He used the first-person present, he said, because it would have
been ``cheesy and fraudulent'' to fictionalize the story: ``To call
me `Ed' and put me in the third person sounded ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Eggers' decision to tell his story in the way he does was a big,
self-exposing gamble, and one that seems to have paid off, judging
from the admiring early reviews and the way the book is being
passed like a new drug from reader to reader. Writing in The New
York Times, Michiko Kakutani called the book ``a virtuosic piece of
writing, a big, daring, manic-depressive stew of a book'' and
pronounced Eggers ``staggeringly talented.'' Yet it must be said
that it is not for everyone, that some people have been thoroughly
irritated by all this self-knowing mockery. The critic Benjamin
Anastas said in The New York Observer that he found the book ``a
brain-bending mixture of inventive talent and utter carelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   It must also be said that Eggers' friends, the people in
``Eggersland,'' as one friend called it, are a little overwhelmed
by all the attention. ``Oh, no, make it stop,'' said one when
called for his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird that part of your life and your friend's life is
now being looked at as sort of a touchstone, a symbol,'' said
Borow, a magazine writer in New York. ``But if somebody's got to be
a supernova literary celebrity, why not Dave? He's really, really
smart and really, really talented.''

</P>
<P>
   Of course, what happened to Eggers and his family was stunningly
unfortunate. He is aware of that, and also aware of the potential
criticism _ one directed at the authors of many recent memoirs _
that he is exploiting or exaggerating his tragedy in the name of
art. (He addresses that in the book, too. The author ``would like
to acknowledge that no, he is not the only person ever to lose his
parents, and that he is also not the only person ever to lose his
parents and inherit a youngster,'' he writes. ``But he would like
to point out that he is currently the only such person with a book
contract.'')
</P>
<P>
   But through all the horrors of his family's plight _ the
slow-motion sinking of his father on the driveway one day, when he
seemed to be praying but was really collapsing with the cancer that
would soon kill him; the wasting away and bleeding and coughing
that marked the last days of his mother's long, long illness; the
twin funerals in which his parents' friends seemed almost
embarrassed to be exposed to so much tragedy at once _ Eggers found
a pure joy in living with his younger brother, to whom he acted as
parent, companion and frequent partner in mischief.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said, `That's so nice of you to do that,''' Eggers said
of raising Toph. ``But I would rather have had Toph as a roommate
than anybody else, and the alternative was much worse. What were we
going to do, break up the family and send Toph to a salt mine?''
</P>
<P>
   His older siblings helped, but his brother was working out of
town and his sister attending law school, so mostly it fell to him.
It has been a happy pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our life required some parental situations, but mostly it was
like living with a friend from college,'' he said. ``My age kind of
regressed and his got a little bit older, and we sort of met
halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   The parental role seems to fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too stunned to speak,'' Eggers writes at one point when he
overhears the mother of one of Toph's classmates mention how she
lets her 12-year-old son ``fire up'' cigarettes at home. ``She
should be jailed. And I should raise her children. Maybe I'm the
only one qualified to raise all these kids _ so many of these
parents are old, dusty.'' When he describes the scene to Beth, his
sister, ``she is entertained, as always, by the inadequacies of our
fellow parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Eggers drove Toph to school, tucked him in at night and read
books like ``Hiroshima'' aloud. ``Oh sure, there's all the horror,
the indescribable suffering, the people's skin coming off like
cottage cheese,'' he writes, ``but, see, I have decided that as
much as there will be fun and hilarity in this house, I am
determined to also fill this place with sober and lasting
learning.'' They also negotiated the minefields of sex (Toph ends
up playing spin the bottle with a group of girls) and religion
(``Jesus died for your Christmas fun,'' is how Eggers explained
Christianity).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Eggers helped found Might, an influential,
short-lived magazine that sprung up like a fungus in San Francisco,
affecting a knowing, self-conscious air that mercilessly ridiculed
its subjects and its contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no limit, no ceiling, and the idea was that you and
your friends would take over the world and help everybody,'' Eggers
said. ``We thought the magazine could be elected president.''
</P>
<P>
   But harsh reality set in, at work and outside of it. One of
Eggers' friends fell into a coma when the balcony on which she
stood collapsed. Another overdosed. And Eggers found himself
suffering from a chronic fear of death, coupled with an
overwhelming, panicked feeling that he had to keep everyone else
from dying, too. ``A lot of the time, while I was working on the
book, I was just a mess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having edited the media section at the online magazine Salon
(``the daily deadline was killing me, and the getting up in the
morning''), Eggers is now running the literary magazine
McSweeney's, which has the same exposed, self-aware sensibility as
his book, down to the whimsical readers' contests, inside jokes and
penny-by-penny accounting of how much it costs to print and
distribute. (None of the contributors are paid; the magazine is
printed in Reykjavik and delivered by boat. ``It's cheaper,'' said
Eggers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``McSweeney's is an effort to experiment with form,'' Eggers
said. ``It's an effort to tell the same story, in a different way,
without taking it too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The same might be said of ``A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering
Genius,'' of course. Or maybe not. But it is a tribute to Eggers'
resilience that he has emerged from the things he describes with
his restless optimism more or less intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand you are so completely bewildered that
something so surreal and incomprehensible could happen,'' he said.
``At the same time, suddenly the limitations or hesitations that
you might have imposed on yourself fall away. There's a weird,
optimistic recklessness that could easily be construed as nihilism
but is really the opposite. You see that there is a beginning and
an end and that you have only a certain amount of time to act. And
you want to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Yes. Yes. But what's the deal with the title?
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most titles, it was a place-marker for a long time, and
it kind of became too late to change it,'' he said. ``And it made
me laugh.''

COLUMN: JUSTICE IN THE TANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Loeb's delicatessen on 15th and I streets serves
the best hot corned beef sandwich in town. It was there I ran into
Lee Radek, who for years has been successfully making certain that
no investigation of illegal Asian money poured into the
Clinton-Gore campaign touches any of the higher-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Munching a pickle, I asked how come the current trial of Maria
Hsia _ the longtime Gore fund-raiser charged with using Buddhist
nuns as conduits for $140,000 of illegal contributions _ was being
held in Washington, rather than near the Hacienda Heights, Calif.,
temple, scene of the alleged crime?
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought this would be a better venue,'' the chief of the
cover-up replied. From his concealing standpoint, he's right _ the
nation's capital is far better for acquittal or most lenient
sentencing of the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Justice wants none of the Clinton-Gore Asian funny-money
traffickers such as John Huang, Pauline Kanchanalak and Charlie
Trie to face punishment that might induce them to involve any of
the famous recipients of China's largess.
</P>
<P>
   In moving the trial of Hsia (pronounced shaw) to Democratic
D.C., Reno Justice was certain it would get a Clinton-appointed
judge. That's because in all the ``Asian Connection'' cases here,
the chief federal judge bypassed the normal random assignment
procedure to direct all those cases to Judge Paul Friedman.
</P>
<P>
   After this liberal jurist relieved Clintonites in 1998 by
dismissing as ``Alice in Wonderland'' five of six felony counts
against Hsia, the Court of Appeals overruled him, reinstating the
charges whose prosecution he so reluctantly oversees today.
(Feeling the heat of criticism about being the repeatedly chosen
instrument of the cover-uppers, Friedman last week got the chief
judge's egregious assignments stopped.)
</P>
<P>
   Reno's Radek not only has a demonstrably anti-prosecution
Democratic judge but the usual 90 percent Democratic D.C. jury.
Hsia's lawyer reminded it this week that the defendant ``is a
minority, supports Democrats and has all her life.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses against Hsia? Not to worry. John Huang, having been
given a walk and thus under no coercion to talk, will remember
nothing about Clinton-Gore involvement. Two potentially
incriminating Buddhist temple money handlers, given immunity by
Justice in return for promises of testimony, have fled overseas.
(It just didn't occur to ever-trusting Radek to pick up their
passports.) The judge won't allow the absent witnesses' grand-jury
testimony to be used at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Justice considers D.C. the best place to pretend to be
prosecuting the Clinton-Gore milking of Asian money sources. Only
here can it safely point to Maria Hsia as the evil mastermind of a
secret plot _ and portray the vice president and members of his
staff who were present at the Buddhist temple fund-raiser as the
innocent victims of her nefarious scheme. This argues that the
chairman of the Democratic National Committee, also present with
his hand out, was duped as well.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Justice thus dumps everybody's guilt on Maria Hsia's head,
treating her as the Dragon Lady of money-laundering _ all the while
confident of her acquittal or (if the jury surprises) sure of her
gentle treatment in sentencing, or (if the judge suddenly wants to
learn the truth) relying on her presidential pardon right after
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   About that awful word, ``truth'': At first Gore said the
fund-raiser was merely ``community outreach''; months later, he
amended that to knowing only it was ``finance-related.'' But Gore's
10-year relationship with Hsia was always based on her
fund-raising; Harold Ickes sent him a memo that John Huang was
organizing the temple event to raise $250,000; and there stood
fund-raising Maria in a golden robe when he walked in. Yet he still
denies he knew he was raising Asian-generated money in a Buddhist
temple.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore has never denied it to the Justice Department. That's
because no prosecutor, no grand jury, no FBI agent has ever dared
to ask the vice president. Janet Reno protected him as Maria Hsia
will protect him. Gore has broken no law because _ as we have seen
all too often in the Clinton administration _ there is no law
against misleading the public.

COMPANIES WANT YOU TO LIKE INTERNET RADIO 
EXTRA LAYER OF PROTECTION FOR ALL OF THOSE DISCS 
LINUX USERS PROTEST LAWSUITS ON DVD ENCRYPTION CODES 
THE WATERGATE TAPES: NIXON AND DEAN ONLINE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are now more than 3,000 radio stations that stream their
broadcasts over the Web and hundreds of Internet-only radio
stations have also sprung up, enough to restore the romance of the
lonely disc jockey taking to the airwaves before the days of strict
Federal Communications Commission regulations and golden-oldie
formats.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, there's not much romance to listening to Internet
broadcasts, unless you care you hold a 20-pound central processing
unit up to your ear as kids once did with cheap transistor radios.
Two companies want to change that with stand-alone Internet radios.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these is the iRad, an Internet appliance from
Audioramp.com. The iRad can connect via a 56K modem through a phone
line or home networking system and plays streaming audio through a
pair of attached speakers. (There is also a separate speakerless
version with digital output jacks that connect to a stereo.) The
iRad also has an AM/FM receiver and, with a PC connection, can play
stored MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   Audioramp.com also runs a Web site that, in the words of the
company president, Dan Sheppard, acts as a ``personal audio
manager,'' automatically downloading the listener's selections from
the site's extensive playlist of music files. ``Users don't like
technology and they don't like to learn new technology,'' Sheppard
said. ``So we do everything behind the scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipping for both models of the iRad begins in April; the price
is $399.
</P>
<P>
   One of the iRad's competitors is making all the same noises.
Like the iRad, the Kerbango is a stand-alone Internet receiver that
can also play stored MP3s, can connect to separate stereo speakers
and also has an AM/FM receiver. Kerbango also has a Web site that
offers an extensive directory to Internet broadcasts and has its
own list of archived material ready for streaming. The radio itself
will also be available in spring for what the company says will be
less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these companies are betting that cutting the PC out of
the equation will increase the popular acceptance of Internet
radio. But many Web-based stations broadcast in something less than
stereo quality and network connection problems could bring the
party crashing to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be breaks occasionally,'' conceded Jon
Fitch, the chief executive of Kerbango. ``But unlike your PC, if
Excel crashes your computer, you can still hear the music.''

   Extra Layer of Protection For All of Those Discs
</P>
<P>
   CDs and CD-ROMs are manufactured with a layer of clear plastic
on the bottom to protect the encoded data from scratches caused by
the slings and arrows of modern life. But sometimes one layer just
won't do, particularly when young gamers sling their disks all over
the place.
</P>
<P>
   The CDfender is a simple new product that literally adds a layer
of protection. It consists of a thin disk of clear polycarbonate
(the same plastic used in the CDs) treated with a chemical that
serves to bind it, though not permanently, to the bottom of the CD.
Reading of the CD by the laser is unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   The product, which is produced by Optidisc of Green Bay, Wisc.,
is currently available on the Web (at www.neato.com) and in Europe,
and the company is arranging distribution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested retail price is $7.49 for five discs, which can be
used with audio CDs, CD-ROMs, write-once and rewritable CDs and
Sony PlayStation discs.
</P>
<P>
   A version for DVDs and Sega Dreamcast discs will be available in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   At last, the perfect gift for people who used to hold their
records by the edges only, even when the records were still in
their sleeves.

   Linux Users Protest Lawsuits On DVD Encryption Codes
</P>
<P>
   Users of the Linux operating system are sounding alarms this
month about a series of recent lawsuits concerning DVD technology.
The lawsuits, the users say, unfairly punish people who are trying
to make it possible to run DVD movies on Linux-based machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America sued four Web
publishers in January, accusing them of violating copyright laws by
circulating computer programs that can break DVD encryption
protections. Once the encryption on the DVDs is broken, movie
executives argue, people can copy and distribute movies at will
without paying for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a case of theft,'' Jack Valenti, president of the
association, said in a statement about the lawsuits. ``The posting
of the de-encryption formula is no different from making and then
distributing unauthorized keys to a department store.''
</P>
<P>
   But the publishers say they posted versions of the programs so
that they could be downloaded by Linux users to play movies they
had already bought.
</P>
<P>
   Current DVD players are not designed to work with Linux. The
only way to run DVDs, users contend, is by copying the contents to
the computer's hard drive and playing them from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been misrepresented as a case against piracy,'' said
Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union. ``It's not about piracy. It's about
interoperability.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become so heated that some computer users who
gathered at Linux World in New York last week took to the streets
with flyers condemning the lawsuits. And the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, an online civil liberties group that is representing
the defendants, held a forum on the issue on Friday, where people
donned blue T-shirts with anti-copyright symbols and trumpeted new
sites that have posted the de-encryption programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people filing this lawsuit,'' said Eric Corley, one of the
defendants at the forum, ``have spread this code more than we ever
could have.''

   The Watergate Tapes: Nixon and Dean Online
</P>
<P>
   Many people have a favorite moment from the Nixon White House
tapes. For Jerry Goldman, a professor of political science at
Northwestern University, it is the point at which John Dean sneaks
up on the phrase ``cancer on the presidency'' in a conversation
with President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Dean testified about having this conversation
with the president and was not believed at the time,'' Goldman
said. ``But he knew about the taping at the White House and he knew
that he could be vindicated by these tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is taking the 12{ hours of White House tapes that were
recently released by the National Archives and posting them on the
Web site History and Politics Out Loud (www.hpol.org), an online
library of American political recordings. ``I had to pay $432 to
get all the tapes,'' Goldman said. ``I thought, `Gee, these belong
to the American people.'''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a RealPlayer, which can be downloaded,
listeners can hear the original words of Nixon, Dean and Haldeman
and follow the conversation with synchronized transcripts. The
site, which Goldman operates in partnership with Michigan State
University, also features recordings of Presidents Franklin D.
Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman began posting the Watergate tapes with the notable
conversations about the break-in, the ``smoking gun'' and his
favorite exchange between Dean and Nixon. ``The quality of the
audio is particularly crisp,'' Goldman said of the cancer
conversation. ``And it's really riveting.''

million of his personal fortune on a quest for the White House,
quit throwing good money after bad and gave up on his second
presidential race Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' decision, which he was to formally announce Thursday in
Washington, came one day after he finished a distant third in
Delaware's Republican primary, which he had won four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Delaware ... he didn't see a clear way to get (the GOP
nomination),'' said campaign manager Bill Dal Col.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said Forbes had spent $35 million to $37 million on this
campaign and that all but $5 million had come from his personal
fortune, which has been estimated at $440 million. Dal Col said
Forbes spent $37 million out of his own pocket in 1996, putting the
publisher's total personal expenditures on the two campaigns at $67
million to $69 million.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes won the Delaware and Arizona primaries in 1996,
campaigning almost exclusively on a proposal to replace the federal
income tax system with a simplified flat tax. He lost the 1996
nomination to Bob Dole, but only after battering Dole with negative
television ads that were believed to have contributed to Dole's
eventual loss in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Forbes put together a more extensive organization.
And in an obvious attempt to win the votes of religious and social
conservatives who rejected him four years ago, he broadened his
campaign message. He attacked abortion and embraced other
conservative priorities.
</P>
<P>
   He finished a strong second to Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the
Iowa caucuses Jan. 24 but slid to third in the next nominating
tests, the New Hampshire and Delaware primaries, trailing both Bush
and Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' withdrawal left Bush, McCain and the third remaining
Republican candidate _ longshot Alan Keyes _ to battle for his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' spokeswoman Lisa Kruska said she didn't think the
publisher would endorse any of the remaining candidates, at least
not now.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain, who surprised the Texas governor with a
lopsided victory in New Hampshire on Feb. 1, are now locked in a
tight race for the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
   The National Right to Life Committee, a leading anti-abortion
group, has been supporting Bush, who was considered the early
front-runner for the Republican nomination. But many anti-abortion
activists don't like either Bush or McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The two leading Republican contenders both oppose abortion, but
each would make exceptions in cases of rape or incest or to protect
the life of the mother. And, unlike Forbes' stated position,
neither would require their federal judicial appointees to pass a
``litmus test'' on the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither candidate is really pro-life (anti-abortion). They
both place conditions on whether the right to life should be
guaranteed,'' said Colleen Parro of Dallas, director of the
Republican National Coalition for Life, an anti-abortion group that
isn't endorsing any presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to have to decide on (the basis of) other
issues because there isn't a dime's worth of difference between
Bush and McCain'' on abortion, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, will see one immediate benefit from Forbes'
withdrawal. There will be one less candidate attacking the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes had made Bush his No. 1 campaign target. He ran a
television ad in Iowa and New Hampshire, accusing Bush of violating
an anti-tax pledge as governor, and he paraded a member of the
Texas Board of Education and a former member of the panel in both
states to criticize Bush's record on education.
</P>
<P>
   The same anti-Bush TV spot had already started running in South
Carolina but has been pulled, Dal Col said.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign manager predicted that Bush and McCain would
benefit from the publisher's absence.
</P>
<P>
   He said McCain, who is running as a Republican ``maverick,''
will probably pick up votes from South Carolinians who view
themselves as independents or anti-establishment. But Bush, he
predicted, will get a strong vote from Republican conservatives in
the California primary March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain vowed to woo Forbes' backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work hard to appeal to his voters,'' Bush said
Wednesday on NBC-TV's ``Today'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told CBS-TV's ``The Early Show:'' ``Most Republicans
think my tax cut ... is far more conservative than Gov. Bush's tax
plan. I think they'll head in our direction, and I'll welcome
them.''

 &HT;    Louisiana feels pinch of puny crawfish season
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ You call that a crawfish? Looks more like a fire
ant.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's crawfish season normally peaks in February, with
plenty of fat, juicy mudbugs going from fishermen's nets into
propane-fired boiling pots. But crawfish farmers, fishmongers and
restaurant owners agree: This the worst season in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it this bad,'' said Henry Poynot, owner of Big
Fisherman Seafood in New Orleans. ``And the customers know it. No
one's even asking for them. I feel like I'm selling ice to
Eskimos.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponds that normally yield 2,500 pounds of crawfish a day are
coughing up a piddly 60 pounds, said Laddie James, a crawfish
farmer in Opelousas.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're small,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Several years of below-average rainfall are the main culprit,
said Robert Romaire, professor of aquaculture at Louisiana State
University. Water in the crawfish ponds, where farmed crawfish
grow, and in the Atchafalaya Swamp, where the wild crawfish roam,
has been too low to support reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   But James isn't so sure that's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep our ponds flooded and we still don't have any
crawfish,'' he said. Some farmers believe a pesticide used on rice
_ which is often grown in crawfish ponds in the summer _ is
damaging the crawfish. But scientists have not found evidence of
that.
</P>
<P>
   A normal crawfish season, which runs from November to June,
yields 40 million to 60 million pounds of crawfish statewide,
Romaire said. So far, buyers are lucky to get a tenth of what they
normally buy on a daily basis. All the crawfish caught is going
straight to state seafood markets and restaurants. That means no
exporting to other states, and the processing plants, which remove
the tail meat and freeze it for gumbos and fried dishes, are idle.
</P>
<P>
   Poynot said he usually buys and quickly sells out of seven
45-pound sacks of crawfish every weekday and 25 to 30 sacks on
weekends. This year, he's lucky if he can get two sacks every
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Super Bowl Sunday, I got four sacks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the crawfish are puny, barely the size of
a thumb. And they're expensive. Poynot has to sell them for $3.59 a
pound boiled; normally, they're under $2 a pound in February.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lyles, a customer at Big Fisherman, took a disheartened
look at the half-filled bin of teensy crustaceans and went ahead
and ordered 6 pounds for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready for crawfish season, but it isn't ready for us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In southwest Louisiana, Cajuns customarily save the fist-size
crawfish for themselves and ship the slightly smaller ones to New
Orleans and beyond. But there are no giant crawfish to hoard this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been rather small,'' said Jenny Guidry, co-owner of
Crawfish Town restaurant outside Lafayette. But she tried to put a
good face on the worst season she's ever seen. ``They're getting
better. I'd say they are small to medium now. And they are very
tasty.''

&HT;     SENATE REPUBLICANS WANT MORE FOREIGN HIGH-TECH WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDY HOLLAND  
 &HT;     c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three prominent Republican senators _ Orrin Hatch
of Utah, Phil Gramm of Texas and Spencer Abraham of Michigan _
introduced a bill Wednesday that would boost the number of visas
for high-tech foreign workers to 195,000 for the next three years,
up 80,000 from the current total.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Hatch waved 21 pages of help-wanted ads
for high-tech workers in a newspaper here and warned that Congress
must overcome the shortage or businesses ``will be forced to take
their opportunities of growth abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which Hatch pledged to move swiftly through the
Senate Judiciary Committee that he chairs, would lift the cap of
115,000 so-called H1-B, or high-tech foreign-worker, visas for
2001, 2002 and 2003. Under the current 1998 law, that cap is slated
to drop to 107,500 next year and 65,000 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would exempt from the cap foreigners who take high-tech
jobs at American universities. It would also exempt foreign
students who have recently earned advanced degrees in high-tech
areas such as computer science, math and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsors also said the legislation would raise $150 million
over three years from $500 fees that employers would pay for each
new visa. The funds would finance training programs and
scholarships for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   So far the bill has 20 co-sponsors, including three Democrats,
Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California, Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut and Bob Graham of Florida. Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., also supports it. Lott recently said there is a need
to fill ``really critical positions'' in the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he hopes the Clinton administration ``has the smarts
to listen to Alan Greenspan,'' the Federal Reserve chairman, who
has also said such a bill is needed.
</P>
<P>
   But White House spokesman Patrick Dorton said the president is
still analyzing proposals for increasing the numbers of high-tech
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in the past, our ultimate orientation must be training and
educating American workers,'' Dorton said.
</P>
<P>
   The House appears willing to wait and see what the Senate does
about the bill. Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who chairs the
Immigration and Claims Subcommittee of the House Judiciary
Committee, has yet to endorse any H1-B worker legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to enactment of legislation that is good for
both the high-tech industry and American workers,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said it would be ``crazy'' not to try to retain foreign
students with advanced high-tech degrees in this country. ``These
are the best and brightest people on the planet and we want to keep
them,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham, who chairs the immigration subcommittee on the Senate
judiciary panel, said the long-term solution to the shortage of
high-tech workers ``will not be found through immigration.'' But he
added that ``the explosion of start-ups is proceeding far faster
than we can supply the workers here at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of the measure acknowledged that momentum is
building in Congress for raising the H1-B worker cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech industry is on a roll, and I wouldn't be
surprised if additional increases are enacted,'' said Vin O'Neil,
legislative representative for the Institute for Electronic and
Electrical Engineers, a Washington trade group.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neil said it is too early to think about raising the caps
until the National Academy of Sciences completes a study in
September assessing whether the high-tech industry has practiced
age discrimination against American workers.

campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain has made enormous

cancer, the country's second biggest killer after cardiovascular
disease, is nothing short of disgraceful, a stark example of the

of four New York City police officers accused in the shooting death
of Amadou Diallo. A neighbor of Diallo's testified for the defense
that she heard someone say, ``Gun!'' just before the four police
officers accused of his murder began firing at him. It was
testimony that the defense attorneys wanted badly, but it came at a
price. The woman said on cross examination that she saw the four
officers get out of their car with their guns drawn and without
shouting any warnings, begin firing. The defense lawyers surprised
by the testimony and spent much of the day trying to repair the
damage. By Jane Fritsch.

   NY-MRSCLINTON (Syracuse, N.Y.) _ Hillary Rodham Clinton charged
Wednesday that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had wrongly injected religion
into the Senate race, saying that she was ``appalled'' that
Giuliani had attacked her in a recent fund-raising letter for what
the letter called her ``hostility toward America's religious

BOOK TALK: LITERARY PARTIES FOR LITERACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were 13 literary dinner parties here Wednesday
night to raise money to support the programs of a writers'
organization, and naturally none of them were given by poor people.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the writer members of the PEN American Center were
not complaining that a few well-heeled people were using them for
their own celebrity. In short, in recent years the group has had a
sort of hanger-on-ectomy, so Wednesday night's fund-raising dinners
were given mostly by people successful in the arts, including
writers, not merely prosperous bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   PEN (an acronym for poets, playwrights, essayists, editors and
novelists) has programs to fight censorship, to defend the freedom
of writers and to promote literacy among those who suffered the
punishment of not being able to read. The group has about 2,600
members and an annual budget of about $1.2 million, and Wednesday
night's dinners, the first such this organization has had, were to
raise money for its Readers and Writers literacy program.
</P>
<P>
   At $250 a ticket they were expected to bring in about $35,000.
Under that program last year PEN sent books and 70 of their authors
to 35 schools, literacy programs and community centers in
low-income neighborhoods in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: first PEN ships the target group enough
copies of an author's book, generally donated by publishers, for
each student. After the teachers and the students read and discuss
the book, the author pops into town to visit the class.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Roberts, PEN's executive director, says that these books
are perhaps the first the readers ever complete and that the
writers' visits are almost assuredly the first time that the
readers have ever met an author. Such programs are intended to
expand a student's world, weaning the apprentice from intellectual
shuttlecocking between solipsism and television.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts Wednesday night were the writers Marie Brenner, Gail
Monaghan, Wendy Gimble, James Chase, Beth Gutcheon, Joan Jakobson
and Jacqueline Weld; Joan Bingham, book editor; Georgia Shreze
Greenberg, composer; William Monaghan, architect; Frank Richardson,
investor; Susan Burden and Barbara Liberman, therapists; Maria
Cook, photographer; and Hans Kraus, a photography art dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Each party had its guest writer, and those included John Guare,
Martin Cruz Smith, Christopher Buckley, Benjamin Cheever, Fran
Liebowitz, Dominick Dunne, Robert Caro, Judith Thurman, Michael
Cunningham, Ruth Reichl, Simon Schama and Jamaica Kincaid.
</P>
<P>
   PEN and its fund-raising methods have been draggled by
controversy over the years. Perhaps this is not surprising and is
even appropriate given the the independence that writers acquire
doing their lonely work, which is one reason the organization
decided to add the dinner parties this year as a way of raising
money with some panache. Still, its fundamental money-raiser is the
organization's annual black-tie dinner, for which individual
tickets are $500 and $1,000 and the major book publishing companies
buy a table or two at $10,000 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   About four years ago, when PEN was in a financial crunch, it was
proposed to bring nonwriters, nearly all of them wealthy, onto what
was then a bloated board of 95 members in the hope that they would
contribute cash or at least know how to gather it. Writers went
ballistic and high-minded. A decade ago, the wife of a financier
had become president of Friends of PEN, an affiliated support
group, and was accused by some writer members of being among a
group of wealthy people who were using the celebrity of PEN to give
themselves glittering visibility in the city's literary life.
</P>
<P>
   Last year those attending the gala in black-tie and evening
dresses arrived to find the Rainbow Room, where the party was held,
under siege by whistle-blowing, shouting, picketing restaurant
workers. Some of the writers refused to pass the picket line and
others went in briefly and left.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these people are word workers, not political
fund-raisers, and however awkward their methods no one can argue
that the money raised is not worthily spent.
</P>
<P>
   And the rich-riding-the-writer's-back controversy seems to have
disappeared. PEN's new board, which will be formally elected Feb.
28, will have 37 trustees, all but 6 of them writers. This year's
gala will be held April 10 at the New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Auletta, the New Yorker writer and a former PEN trustee,
said: ``The PEN budget used to be overly reliant on a single
source; now it has a broader base. We can use the Medicis, but just
a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutcheon said, ``This is the first time I've made myself useful
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun of these dinners is that they are very intimate,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, an editor at Grove Atlantic, said she was ``happy to be
trying to do something different, so our support does not rely on
just the gala.'' A modest enough thought by Lorenzo de Medici's
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, throughout history the other side of patronage of the
arts has been plunder. PEN has had some of that, too. From 1988
through 1992 Mont Blanc was the major sponsor of the annual gala,
and every place setting included a Mont Blanc pen. It was like
watching the sack of Rome to see the guests stuff as many pens as
they could into purses and pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course I'm exaggerating, but when books replaced pens as
souvenirs, some of the anticipation and intoxication went out of
the proceedings.

SHELBY LYNNE: SAYING GOODBYE NASHVILLE, HELLO SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years ago, Shelby Lynne had had enough of Nashville, and
it looked like Nashville had had enough of her, too.
</P>
<P>
   She'd started out young and strong _ her first recording in
Music City was a duet with George Jones, ``If I Could Bottle This
Up,'' cut when she was 18 _ but subsequent records couldn't find an
audience, and by 1996, dispirited, she headed back to rural
Alabama, where she'd been raised.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had nothing else to do,'' she says. ``I didn't know if I'd
get a Holiday Inn gig. It just didn't work for me in Nashville _
it's a hit-driven town and I didn't have any. I felt freedom when I
left there.''
</P>
<P>
   That freedom gave Lynne lots of time to really dive into
songwriting and rediscover the delights of '60s/'70s soul music:
Aretha Franklin, Al Green, and Dusty Springfield's classic soul/pop
record ``Dusty in Memphis.'' Free from having to worry about
pleasing a record company and moving a lot of CDs, she looked back
on her life and began writing a series of honest, personal songs.
</P>
<P>
   In a very sweet turnaround, those songs have become ``I Am
Shelby Lynne,'' a fiercely soulful statement of purpose that has
given Lynne a major industry buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Released in Europe last fall, the CD was praised to the skies by
such influential music magazines as ``Q, Uncut'' and ``Mojo;'' it
was released in the United States last week, and has picked up a 9
(out of 10) review from ``Spin'' and glowing notices from ``Elle,
Rolling Stone'' and ``Wired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel happy about the record _ it's the record I
wanted to make,'' says Lynne, 31. ``Nashville was confining for me,
because I wanted to cut meatier material and I was writing songs by
myself. I just took from everything I liked in music and tried to
write songs that stand the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seventh song, `Lookin' Up,' is the best country record
I've ever cut, and I had to leave Nashville to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``country'' is a loose definition: Lynne is clearly being
marketed as a unique artist who is blending country with the soul
elite listed above, along with a generous dollop of Burt
Bacharach-style '60s pop smarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to regroup and figure out where the songs would
take me,'' she says. ``I realized what I was feeling was a soul/R&AMP;B
feel, and when I got on a roll they really started coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD _ cut in four studios, from Alabama to California _ is
largely a collaboration with Bruce Bottrell, who has produced
Sheryl Crow's ``Globe Sessions,'' and to be sure there is a touch
of Crow's classic-style rock here and there.
</P>
<P>
   But in the main, Lynne and Bottrell (who wrote eight of the CD's
10 songs, sometimes with other writers) teamed up to craft a sound
that has its deep roots in the late '60s. Bottrell played guitar,
drums, pedal steel, keyboards and bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out I was a pretty decent songwriter and it was OK
to make records totally different than in Nashville,'' she says.
``And I figured out I was OK with who I was.''

SPORTS COLUMN: `IT JUST HAPPENED TO GO IN' 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever the Chicago Bulls needed a last-second basket during
their run of six championships, everybody knew who would be taking
the shot, especially the other team. And one night, when a timeout
was winding down with only a few seconds remaining in a playoff
game, Coach Phil Jackson even announced, loud enough for anyone
nearby to hear, who would take the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win the game for us, Michael,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Michael Jordan did just that.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that now with Tiger Woods in golf. When he leaves the
practice range or the putting green, he responds as if his swing
guru, Butch Harmon, has told him, ``Win the tournament, Tiger.''
</P>
<P>
   And Tiger keeps doing just that. At age 24, he is dominating
golf the way Michael Jordan dominated basketball.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins at the Buick Invitational, which starts Thursday near
San Diego, it will be his seventh consecutive PGA Tour victory
dating to last August, the longest winning streak in golf except
for Byron Nelson's record 11 straight in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so much that Woods is winning as it is the way he's
winning.
</P>
<P>
   With a 40-foot birdie putt in a playoff with Ernie Els at the
Mercedes Championship in Hawaii, he won the way Jack Nicklaus, Ben
Hogan and Bobby Jones won so many tournaments: in a duel with
another world-class golfer.
</P>
<P>
   With an eagle 2-birdie 3-par 3-birdie 4 finish on Monday, he won
the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am the way Arnold Palmer won so
many tournaments: with a charge down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   But Woods' charge Monday wasn't just another charge from behind;
his eagle at the 15th hole set off an explosive charge.
</P>
<P>
   When his pitching wedge from 97 yards spun and rolled softly
into the cup for a 2 on the 397-yard par-4 hole, it was as if a
stick of dynamite had detonated. He suddenly was only two strokes
behind the leader, the rookie Matt Gogel, who later would bogey
both the 15th and 18th holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are trying to get it close and leave yourself a putt for
birdie,'' Woods said later. ``It just happened to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   But he just happened to have hit it that close so it could go in
and he suddenly could be back in the hunt to win.
</P>
<P>
   As dazzling as Woods' wedge at the 15th had been in landing a
few feet to the right of the flagstick, his wedge to the green on
the 402-yard 16th was even more accurate. It landed about two feet
in front of the cup, dead on line, and spun to a stop about three
feet beyond the flagstick. Birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that wedge shot didn't happen to go in, it showed
that the wedge that ``just happened to go in'' at the 15th was not
a fluke, that his control of a golf ball can be as consistently
precise as his power off the tee is consistently awesome and his
competitive fire is consistently blazing.
</P>
<P>
   It also showed that the more difficult the course (and Pebble
Beach is ranked among the world's most difficult), the more likely
it is that over 72 holes he will rise above all the other pros in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Woods is going to win every tournament he enters. As
dominant as Nicklaus, Hogan and Jones were in their respective
eras, they did not win every tournament. The game does not allow
that. The swing is too elusive. The putting touch is too fickle.
Slumps happen. And a golfer has no defense against another golfer
suddenly shooting better scores.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Woods is the defending champion at this week's Buick
Invitational at Torrey Pines, a scenic two-course public layout,
low scores will be easier for others to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's streak, for example, ended at the Memphis Invitational
won by, surprisingly, an amateur at the time, Fred Haas Jr.; Nelson
finished in a tie for fourth, five strokes behind Haas.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, incidentally, has talked about how Nelson's 11 in a row
from April to August in 1945 was ``more difficult than having it
spread out from one year to the next,'' as his streak is. He also
knows that after his four PGA Tour victories at the end of last
year's schedule, he didn't win at the Johnnie Walker Classic in
Taiwan and at the Williams World Challenge in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate Nelson's streak, consider that with six straight
PGA Tour victories, Tiger Woods is only halfway to breaking it. But
that doesn't detract from his dominating golf the way Michael
Jordan dominated basketball.

FINDING SPLENDOR IN THE RUINS OF THE RUST BELT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Germany, Italy, England, Scotland, Mich., Wash., Va.)  By ANNE RAVER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter Latz grew up playing in the bombed ruins and
abandoned quarries of Germany's industrial Ruhr district after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no trouble with rubble,'' he likes to say. So it makes
perfect sense that 500 acres of old blast furnaces, elevated rails,
slag heaps and a polluted river would become his master work.
</P>
<P>
   This vast landscape park, Duisburg Nord, is at the northern tip
of Emscher Park, a nice name for the industrial wasteland that
stretches 40 miles along the Emscher River, in western Germany,
from Duisburg to Dortmund. In 1989 this part of the river was
offered up for an international competition. Latz won, and so began
a 10-year construction project that should be largely completed
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Latz, 61, who has built his career on excavating the cultural
memory of old industrial sites and designing sustainable urban
landscapes, has left much of the wasteland alone. There are
neon-yellow lichens covering the slag heaps and brooding blast
furnaces, abandoned ore bunkers and teetering elevated rails. They
are the very fabric of a landscape park that holds all the fears
and tarnished dreams of a people raised on steel and coal. If ever
there was a genius loci, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been late to see their own industrial wastelands
not only as potential public parks, but also as repositories of
their history: the precedent was Gas Works park in Seattle, which
embraces the heroic structure and history of an old gas plant. But
there are many restrictions on its public use because of concerns
about pollutants. There may be much to learn from the Germans, who
have taken a minimalist approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way was to cover up these sites with clay and soil and
plant indigenous plants, but that does not do justice to them,''
said Latz, who here recently to give a slide talk at the
Architectural League of New York. Bringing nature back, or building
pretty gardens and playgrounds, ignores the true nature of such
places.
</P>
<P>
   Latz, who grew up in the Saar, near the French border, developed
his penchant for sustainable design in the 1950s, when he planted
100 fruit trees and a vast vegetable garden and strawberry beds to
feed his parents and seven brothers and sisters. He studied
landscape architecture at the Technical University of Munich and
the Institute of Urban and Regional Planning in Aachen.
</P>
<P>
   He has been interested in alternative technologies since he and
his wife, Anneliese, a fellow landscape architect, moved into their
first house in Kassel, a 1930s town house that they retrofitted
with solar panels and a greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to keep opening and closing windows, because it was
always too hot or cold,'' Latz said. The greenhouse was intended to
sustain the Latz family of four, just as Latz's earlier gardens had
provided sustenance in the postwar years. ``Peter didn't allow us
to buy any vegetables,'' she said. ``He got very angry when I
bought grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   That early effort evolved into the Latzes' far more efficient
home, built out of an old farmhouse near Friesing, 25 miles from
Munich. The couple's office, which is attached to the house by a
greenhouse, specializes in alternative technologies. But it is the
moonscapes of industry that claim Peter Latz's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to manage our industrial heritage,'' he said. ``To
understand that landscape is culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Latz says such landscapes change him more than he changes them.
Before drawing plans, he looks for patterns, layers of information,
connections among fragments. ``While all the other competitors were
drawing, drawing, drawing, Peter was telling stories,'' Latz said
of the bid for Duisburg Nord.
</P>
<P>
   He won the competition with Jungian images (a falcon circling a
tower) and a plan that celebrated the rusting hulks of the iron and
steel works. He wanted to clean up the polluted waters flowing
through the land, but keep the grittiness.
</P>
<P>
   At Duisburg Nord, rock climbers now scale huge ore bunkers
planted with fern gardens or roses and serpentine hedges. Children
play on the grand Piazza Metallica _ a classic plaza surrounded by
old blast furnaces. It is laid out not in marble, but with corroded
seven-by-seven-foot cast-iron plates, each one weighing seven tons,
recovered at a nearby pig-iron plant.
</P>
<P>
   The open waste-water ditch called the Emscher River, which was
carrying untreated sewage to the Rhine River, was funneled
underground to a treatment system. The old canals and cooling
basins of the steel plant were filled with the clear water that
flows from a rainwater collection system. Water lilies, irises,
fish and dragonflies _ and deep sea divers _ now enjoy the
waterworks.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrians can walk along sky-blue catwalks attached to old
railway lines high in the sky and look down into the maze of
gardens in the bunkers or the neon yellow slag heaps that Latz said
should remain, letting rain and wind erode them naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Toxic areas, and there are plenty of them, are off limits, but
he has made efforts to reclaim some. A giant windmill pumps water
from a polluted canal up a spiraling chute, funneling it along
elevated channels attached to the old railway lines, where it
cascades back down to the gardens. The system aerates the water in
a modern-day version of Villa Lante, the ornate Renaissance water
garden in Viterbo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Latz explored these ideas on a more modest scale in 1985, when
he won a design competition for Harbor Park, a bombed-out ruin of a
coal dock on the banks of the Saar River. He and his students at
the University of Kassel took rubble and began building gardens
that evoked Roman ruins. They used the plants that had seeded there
on their own, many of them exotic and rare, and townspeople brought
roses and lilacs from their own yards. There was an artificial ruin
called the Water Wall that was built out of red brick, with paths
that were sunken to muffle the noise of traffic from an overhead
highway bridge that crossed the Saar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used a lot of water falling from the Water Wall, to cleanse
the water and create a noise, so you don't hear the traffic,'' Latz
said. It won the German Federation of Landscape Architects Award in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The American landscape architect Richard Haag saw the same
potential in boilers and towers in a gas manufacturing plant that
had blighted the Seattle waterfront. His magnificent Gas Works
Park, which opened in 1980, has been closed down periodically by
the Environmental Protection Agency, because of contamination
fears. To make the site safe, the federal government has insisted
that the gas generator towers be fenced off so people can't climb
on them and walk through them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a powerful thing to walk under them,'' Haag said by
telephone from Seattle. Though the towers are landmarked and will
not be torn down, federal and state environmental agencies are
insisting that much of the land near them be capped and covered
with new soil.
</P>
<P>
   The land of garbage disposals and Mr. Clean is wary of its
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Bargmann, a landscape architect and land artist who
teaches at the University of Virginia, noted that the German
government is much more lenient about the toxic sites that remain
in manufacturing and industrial areas. She particularly admires the
work of Latz. ``He accepts these sites as landscapes, and not
objects or ruins, and he very carefully laces people through them,
so you are able to get close and immersed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bargmann, who is speaking at the Architectural League of New
York on April 13, is now working on a design for the 1,200-acre
Ford Motor Co. landscape, which she calls ``two square miles of
industrial bliss,'' at the River Rouge Plant in Detroit that the
architect William McDonough has just been commissioned to turn into
a $2 billion green operation. So Americans may yet mine their own
wastelands for cultural history.
</P>
<P>
   Latz, meanwhile, is reveling in the ruins of other European
industrial landscapes, like a blast furnace plant in Volklingen,
Germany, which he says ``lies like a stranded battleship on the
Saar River.'' (The blast furnace plant is now a world heritage
site.) He and Ian Hamilton Finlay, a Scottish poet and garden
artist, are constructing a series of water gardens and ``lawns'' of
bright green stone on the demolished foundations of the Shell
Research Center in Thornton, England.
</P>
<P>
   The Latz firm is also collaborating with a Luxembourg
architectural firm, Paczowksy/Fritsch, to design a whole town on a
former submarine base built by the Germans during World War II at
Lorien, in Britanny. A submarine ``built with glass and illuminated
with the color of the deep blue sea,'' Latz said, would be the
centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, when Latz built a garden of rusty screws, all the
metal was carried off by a homeless man who lived in the bushes.
The lessons of industrial landscaping were not lost on him.

SERBS' ANGER LINGERS AFTER RECENT VIOLENCE IN MITROVICA

<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ U.N. police officers apprehended a man
here Wednesday who was slashing the tires of their cars and who
lashed out at one policeman, injuring his eye, a spokesman for the
peacekeepers said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a minor incident compared with the violence of last week,
but it reflected the continuing tension and anger of Serbs living
on the north side of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after some of the worst violence that troops have seen
in eight months of peacekeeping in Kosovo, many Serbs are still
cursing and threatening foreigners in the street.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Serbs in Mitrovica, including more than a dozen
interviewed on the street in recent days, do not appear to have
altered their views since the war against NATO and the arrival of a
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. A large percentage of them
blame the Albanians for everything bad that has happened.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 Serbs live in the northern part of this
divided city, and almost a third of them are refugees from other
parts of Kosovo. They possess a readiness to take things into their
own hands and a measure of organization not found among Serbs
living in the isolated enclaves around Kosovo where they are far
more vulnerable to attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs of Mitrovica see themselves as defending the only
viable outpost of Serbian control in Kosovo against the Albanian
majority. They are bolstered by an almost ethnically pure Serbian
area stretching north behind them to the boundary with the rest of
Serbia. This provides them with a direct, safe land connection to
Serbia proper. With an estimated population of 50,000 Serbs, the
area represents the largest concentration of Serbs in Kosovo, 50
percent of the total left in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   All of the dozen or so people interviewed said that the Serbian
mobs that rampaged through Mitrovica on Thursday night,
intimidating Albanians and leaving eight dead, were reacting to the
grenade attack on a Serbian cafe that wounded 15 young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment people remembered everything,'' said Oliver
Ivanovic, the executive president of the Serbian National Council
and an acknowledged leader of the Serbian community. ``The 20 Serbs
killed in the area in the last seven months. The 28 people
kidnapped and disappeared. Everyone has a reason to be angry. It
was very difficult to control them.'' Ivanovic was on the streets
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A history teacher, Dragoljub Radenkovic, who fled his home in
the town of Vucitrn, a town about 6 miles southeast of Mitrovica
that is now wholly populated by Albanians, says people are
revolted. ``For eight months journalists have only been writing
about Serbs being killed,'' he said. ``In eight months you never
saw the Serbs killing Albanians. There was a lot pent-up inside
people and it exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Serbs, Ivanovic, a sophisticated, English speaking
businessman who has become the main connection with the
international peacekeepers and administrators in the region, was
alone in acknowledging his people's recent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very bad things happened,'' he said. ``I cannot support that,
but just ask that you understand it. I was feeling very angry too
that night.'' Other Serbs, including his deputy, Vuko Antonijevic,
appeared to applaud the crowd's actions that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you for what you did,'' Antonijevic told a
rally of 2,000 people on Monday. ``You showed how much you love
your city and how you can defend it against Islamic terrorism. You
showed in the best way what is the Serbian answer for attacks on
Serbian youth in coffee bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Milan Ivanovic, a doctor from Mitrovica's
hospital, ranted against the NATO-led peacekeepers and U.N.
officials for allowing Albanians to persecute the remaining Serbian
population in Kosovo. ``They are killing Serbs, they are putting
Serbs in concentration camps in Kosovo and in Albania, and they are
doing it in the presence of the U.N. mission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Serbs in the street repeated similar accusations,
defending the expulsions of Albanians. ``They did the same to us,''
said Smiljana Milosevic, whose grocery store backs up to the cafe,
Le Bel Ami, where the grenade attack occurred. She said the
Albanians still living on the north side, now under heavy
protection by peacekeeping troops, should leave, ``because there
are no Serbs on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked how the violence could be resolved, most Serbs
appeared unsure. Some said the curfew currently in force was good
and improved their security. Others said the curfew had left them
vulnerable and unable to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Many say they cannot rely on the peacekeepers and U.N. police
officers for security and must therefore provide their own. ``We
are just defending ourselves, with our bare hands,'' said
Milosevic, the storekeeper.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Serbs have a fairly well-organized defense here that is
loyal to Ivanovic. It is made up mostly of young men who carry
walkie talkies and guard the bridge, inspecting Albanians who cross
from the south side to the north. Whether the young men played a
role in the violence is not known.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanovic says his organization is opposed to expelling all the
Albanians from the north side of the city in order to make it all
Serbian because that would invite more attacks from Albanians. He
is also against the partition of the Serb-dominated region from the
rest of Kosovo.

   MIDDLESBOROUGH, England _ Jackie O'Donnell's oncologist couldn't
have been more clear about her prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from advanced ovarian cancer, with five inoperable
tumors after surgery, O'Donnell urgently needed aggressive
chemotherapy. But, the doctor explained, her local health authority
would not pay for the treatment he was recommending, a drug that
can prolong life for a year or more and is routinely used in the
United States, Europe and some parts of Britain. If O'Donnell
wanted it, it would cost her $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't believe it, because in this country we were
brought up to believe that we would get the best treatment
available,'' said O'Donnell, now 55. She chose her life over her
budget, put the bills in a drawer when she could not pay them, and
has been in remission since last spring. ``It's hard, when it
stares you in the face that what you thought was really all
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where cancer care horror stories are as common as
the winter flu, O'Donnell's is striking only because it is so
familiar. Doctors, health-care advocates and even the government
say that Britain's record on cancer, the country's second biggest
killer after cardiovascular disease, is nothing short of
disgraceful, a stark example of the limitations of Britain's
fraying system of socialized medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems are a chronic lack of money, specialists and
cancer treatment centers; a lack of national standards that means
that treatment is available in some parts of the country but not
others; and a tendency at times to postpone aggressive treatment
until it becomes too late.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer programs are so underfunded and chaotically managed, the
World Health Organization says, that 25,000 people die
unnecessarily of cancer in Britain each year _ people who would
most likely have survived if they lived in countries with better
standards of treatment, like France, Germany or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase `Third World cancer care' has hung heavy over the
National Health Service for years,'' Gordon McVie, executive
director of the Cancer Research Campaign, one of Britain's largest
cancer charities, wrote recently in The Daily Mail. ``Today it is
no longer a sound bite; it describes a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems in the overstretched, underfunded National Health
Service are not limited to cancer. It is hard to pick up a
newspaper these days without seeing signs of a system in trouble. A
critically ill patient is shunted from place to place in a
desperate 100-mile search for an intensive-care bed, and finally
dies in the ambulance. A new study shows that 500 patients die a
year while on the national waiting list for heart operations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And, in a particularly grim instance, a 73-year-old woman with
advanced esophagal cancer has the misfortune of being scheduled for
surgery in mid-December, when operations are routinely canceled to
make way for emergency patients suffering from pneumonia and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   The operation on the woman, Mavis Skeet, was scheduled, and
canceled, four times over the next five weeks: first because the
anesthesiologist had the flu, and the next three times because no
intensive care beds were available. After the fourth cancellation,
an ultrasound scan showed that the tumor had spread and had become
inoperable.
</P>
<P>
   Skeet is now in a hospital, being fed through a stomach tube and
receiving chemotherapy, waiting for the inevitable, said her
daughter, Jane, in an interview. ``They haven't given us a
timetable, but it's spread so quickly in five weeks that anybody
can work it out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that in a system with some successes _ the infant
mortality rates in Britain are lower than those in the United
States, for instance _ there are few areas where the situation is
so demonstrably bad as it is in cancer.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The health service has been chronically underfunded in the
last 10 or 15 years and is desperately short of money, and I'm not
aware of where things are any worse than in cancer,'' said Dr. Tim
Maughan, a clinical oncologist specializing in gastrointestinal
cancer and lymphoma at Velindre Hospital in Cardiff, Wales.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent studies, a British man with lung
cancer has a 6 percent chance of surviving for five years after
treatment, compared with a 12 percent chance in France and a 13
percent chance in the United States. For colon cancer in men, the
five-year survival rates are 39 percent in England, 59 percent in
the Netherlands, and 64 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And for breast cancer in women, the figures are 68 percent in
England, 80 percent in Switzerland, and 85 percent in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Even the relentlessly optimistic government of Prime Minister
Tony Blair has begun, however reluctantly, to acknowledge that its
cancer care is, in fact, bad. Last summer, Blair pledged to try to
reduce the death rate from cancer for people under 75 by 20 percent
in the next 10 years, saving 100,000 lives.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear exactly how he plans to do this, short of
injecting billions more dollars into the system or changing the way
it is financed. Britain currently spends 56 billion pounds _ $90
billion _ a year on health care, or 6.8 percent of its gross
domestic product _ nearly all of it public money. There is little
political will in Britain to move to a more cash-rich European or
U.S.-based model. Germany spends about 10.7 percent of its gross
domestic product on health care, and the United States, 13.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a recent television interview, Blair appeared to promise that
Britain would bring its health spending up the European levels by
2006, but when Treasury officials calculated that that would cost
perhaps an extra 12 billion pounds a year, money that would have to
come out of roads and schools, the promise was hastily downgraded
to an ``aspiration.'' Blair has already made an extra 21 billion
pounds available to the health service over three years, but much
of that is being taken up by steep salary increases for workers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Problems in the system, say advocates and doctors, are so
pervasive that literally billions of dollars directed specifically
at cancer are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The problems start at diagnosis. The National Health Service is
set up so that no patient can see a specialist without first
visiting his local general practitioner. But many Britons never
visit their doctor until their symptoms become alarming, by which
time their cancer might be advanced. And they are culturally
inclined not to demand things that Americans take for granted, like
regular physicals.
</P>
<P>
   The next problems are an aging network of radiotherapy and other
equipment, which health-care advocates say would cost hundreds of
millions of pounds to replace, and a severe shortage of cancer
centers and doctors. With about 500 cancer specialists serving a
population of 59 million, the average British cancer consultant
sees 550 patients a year _ and in some cases sees as many as 1,000
_ compared with 250 in France or Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britain has about half the number of cancer specialists it
needs,'' said Karol Sikora, the vice president in clinical research
for oncology at Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn Inc. and the former chief of the
World Health Organization's cancer program. To reach European
levels, he said, Britain would have to spend hundreds of millions
of dollars to hire, train and support new cancer doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Once the patients are diagnosed, care can vary significantly.
The health service is divided into about 115 local health
authorities, each of which receives a fixed sum from the central
government and decides independently how to spend it. That is why
some authorities will pay for drugs that others won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up with a situation where if you live on one side of
the street, you may be eligible for expensive anti-cancer
treatment, and if you live on the other side, you aren't,'' said
Dr. David Secher, director of drug development for the Cancer
Research Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Specialists say that the worst aspect of their job is having to
tell patients that the system will not pay for the drugs they need
_ drugs that, in some cases, have been developed by British
researchers in British laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham, Professor David J. Kerr, a specialist in
colorectal cancer at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, spends much of
his time begging various health authorities to let him administer
the cancer drug Camptosar, or irinotecan, which costs less than
$10,000 for a course of treatment and can prolong life by three or
more months. The drug is available in some parts of England, but
not necessarily where his patients live.
</P>
<P>
   ``For these patients, sometimes the drug increases their life
expectancy by 100 percent,'' he said. ``That might be an
anniversary reached, or a first child born.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Christmas, Kerr said, he asked the health authority to
provide Camptosar to a 39-year-old woman with three small children
who has advanced colorectal cancer and a life expectancy of six
months. The health authority balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient asked me, `Aren't my life and my children worth a
few thousand pounds?' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government created a group charged with
recommending whether cancer drugs like Taxol and Camptosar, and
those that treat illnesses other than cancer, should be used
nationwide. But the panel has not yet issued recommendations on any
cancer drugs. And when it does _ it is expected to recommend Taxol,
for instance _ this will be good news for some cancer sufferers,
but bad news for other patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is the prospect of a new and effective drug
that's going to help people suffering from cancer,'' said Stephen
Thornton, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, an advocacy
group for health authorities and hospitals, ``my colleagues running
health authorities are going to have to think, `What are we going
to stop doing in order to pay for that drug?'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What is to be done? Many health-care experts argue that if the
government is not willing to raise taxes, then it should allow more
private money into the system, perhaps introducing nominal charges
for visits to the doctor, for instance. Under one scenario, Britain
would move closer to a U.S.-style model, where richer people would
buy insurance and poorer people would have their bills paid for by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain is wedded to a National Health Service financed by
taxation, and any attempt to tamper with it would touch off a heavy
political fight.
</P>
<P>
   And few British experts are persuaded that the United States is
anything to emulate when it comes to health care. ``America doesn't
deliver much bang to the buck,'' said Dr. Anna Donald, a clinical
lecturer in health policy at University College, London. ``There
are definite problems in the U.K. but overall the health system
works reasonably well on a shoestring.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thornton, who heads the advocacy group, is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to attempt to meet the demands and the expectations
that people seem to have at the moment of a publicly funded health
care system, then we need a substantial increase in money,'' he
said. ``Some would say it is one of the cheapest services that
provides the best value for money. But that's debatable. It may be
that we're just providing cheapness.''

GORE, BRADLEY OFFER EDUCATION PLANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATTY REINERT 
and BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Democratic presidential candidates offered
competing education plans Wednesday, with Bill Bradley proposing
that parents be able to pull their children from bad schools and Al
Gore offering to make it easier for parents to save for college for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   A week after his opponent accused him of neglecting education,
Bradley also proposed Wednesday to help disadvantaged students and
improve teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced during a speech at University City High
School in suburban St. Louis, would increase federal Title I
funding from $8 billion to $16 billion per year and would triple
funding for charter schools, from $145 million to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   It would require all teachers either to have majored in the
subject they are teaching or to pass a state proficiency test in
that subject, and would give parents a report card on the
qualifications of their children's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has already received the endorsement of the two major
teachers unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan also would make schools bring students up to
grade level in reading and math or risk losing federal money, and
would allow parents to move their children to better public
schools, including charter schools, if the school they attend is
deemed ``low-performing'' two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   And if low performing schools don't clean up their act, he said,
he would shut them down and reopen them as charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past seven years, we've heard a lot of talk about
education, but too often the rhetoric hasn't been backed up by
action,'' Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, told about 500
students gathered in the school gymnasium. ``We have a minimum of
250,000 teachers in America that the Secretary of Education says
are unqualified, 'warm bodies,' he called them ... Warm bodies are
just not good enough for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore detailed a proposal designed to make it
easier for parents to pay their children's tuition bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal would build upon state plans, such as the Texas
Tomorrow Fund, that guarantee parents a set tuition if they invest
a certain amount of money over the years for their children's
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would expand these programs by letting parents use the
savings at out-of-state institutions, both public and private. The
Gore plan would eliminate any federal taxes on the income generated
by the savings plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My proposal would make it national and portable,'' Gore said
in an address at the Harold Bussey Center for Early Childhood
Education in suburban Detroit.``We should not be piling such high
burdens of debt on young college graduates who come out of colleges
and universities with the equivalent of home mortgage even though
they don't own a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides estimated the cost of the tuition plan would be $2
billion, which would cover the cost of eliminating the taxes on the
savings.
</P>
<P>
   The tuition plan is part of Gore's $115 billion 10-year
education plan that includes funding for universal preschool
education and subsidizing the interest on $25 billion in bonds to
build and repair schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sharp differences in his approach to education and
mine,'' Gore said of Bradley's plan.
</P>
<P>
   He chided Bradley for waiting so long to offer an education
proposal, saying 14 months of campaigning and three state primaries
have passed before his opponent offered a plan.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said his announcement Wednesday only expands upon
education proposals he has sprinkled through many of his speeches
throughout his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reject his idea, his thought, his criticism that I haven't
talked about education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also said Bradley's plan did not include universal
preschool and college tuition help for parents.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said a proposal he introduced in 1993 allows college
students to pay back federal school loans based on a percentage of
their future income.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley pointed out that Gore would spend more money on defense
than education, and mocked Gore's characterization of his own
education plan as making ``revolutionary'' changes in public
schools.

AUSTRIAN POLITICIAN DENIES NAZI LEANINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KLAGENFURT, Austria _ Joerg Haider, the most feared politician
in Europe, has a big brown teddy bear on his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a symbol of his ultraright Freedom Party, the
teddy bear is keeping with the image of a cuddly conservative that
Haider wants to project.
</P>
<P>
   Haider is charismatic, telegenic, and perpetually tanned. He
runs marathons in 3 1/2 hours, looks younger than his 50 years, and
brags that countryman Arnold Schwarzenegger is among his friends.
</P>
<P>
   But if Haider sees himself as a warm and fuzzy conservative,
many others see him as an extremist who has blamed foreigners for
most of Austria's woes, has been soft on Nazis, and has risen to
power by appealing to the worst instincts of the nation's 8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting here in his modest office in the provincial capital of
Carinthia, where he is governor, Haider professes to be stunned by
the opprobrium directed at him, including the decision by the US
and Israeli governments to temporarily withdraw their ambassadors
in protest after his party became the junior partner in the new
coalition government. The 14 other members of the European Union,
which Austria joined in 1994, have frozen bilateral meetings with
Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Belgians have canceled ski trips. Prince Charles of Britain
Wednesday called off a visit to Vienna. The French government is
appalled, and many Germans are terrified that Haider's success will
help the far right in their country.
</P>
<P>
   Haider says he is the victim of a smear campaign orchestrated by
his domestic political rivals and carried out by leftists
throughout Europe who resent his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our political adversaries in Europe say we handle immigration
in a xenophobic way. I reject that totally,'' he said Wednesday, in
one of his first interviews with an American newspaper after last
week's international outrage and street protests in Vienna. ``When
people say I'm a Nazi, it hurts me. It's an incredible attack.
People who know me and vote for me know I'm a real democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   As Haider tells it, he has been unfairly maligned, branded the
next Hitler even though he claims to have never uttered anything
that he meant to be pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   As the son of an unrepentant couple that joined the Nazis,
however, he has provided his enemies with considerable fodder to
level charges that he has sought to excuse Nazi atrocities and
minimize Austrian involvement in the Third Reich and complicity in
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, he said of Austrians who served in the German army
during World War II, ``Our soldiers were not criminals. At most,
they were victims.'' In 1991, he was forced to step down as
governor of Carinthia after saying the Third Reich had an ``orderly
employment policy.'' In 1995, he suggested that former SS officers
were ``decent people of good character,'' called the concentration
camps ``punishment camps,'' and said it was ``unfair'' that
taxpayer money went to Israel to compensate victims of the Nazis.
Last week, he said ethnic Germans who were expelled from what was
Czechoslovakia at the end of World War II were as entitled to
compensation as Austrian Jews who were persecuted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, after his party secured 27 percent of the vote in
Austria, setting the stage for it becoming junior partner in the
ruling coalition, Haider issued a blanket apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, some remarks have been attributed to me which
were certainly insensitive or open to misunderstanding,'' he said.
``I am personally sorry for this, firstly because I believe I hurt
the feelings of people who were themselves victims of Nazism of
whose relatives were, and secondly because the statements were not
in line with the personal values of tolerance and humanity which
are the basis of my political work.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Haider denied that his habit of saying something
controversial, or even outrageous, then apologizing for it is a
deliberate tactic or disingenuous. Instead, he portrayed himself as
a politician who is ``still evolving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I make mistakes. I am learning, I am changing,'' he said.
``It's a type of evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Haider's staunchest critics acknowledge he is a masterful
politician. Since he took over the Freedom Party in 1986, its vote
has risen from a paltry 5 percent to the 27 percent, making it
Austria's second-largest vote getter. But Haider rejects
suggestions that his popularity will spread to other far right
parties in Europe. He calls Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of the far
right National Front in France, a racist, even though Le Pen has
praised him.
</P>
<P>
   Haider sees his success as unique to Austria, a combination of
his populist messgage, his Clintonesque press-the-flesh
campaigning, and the complacency of Austria's conservative People's
Party and liberal Social Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two parties carved up all the power in Austria for 50 years.
The people support us to ensure that there is change in the
Austrian political system. We are agenda setters.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider's dire warnings about Austria being overrun by foreigners
are dismissed by others as alarmist. With an unemployment rate of
4.2 percent, Austria has one of the highest standards of living in
Europe. It has a retirement age of 57, and some trade unions have
threatened to strike if it is raised to 59.
</P>
<P>
   But Haider has tapped into a well of fear when he argues against
enlarging the European Union. Haider says Austria is willing to
take in refugees in need of political asylum, but he is
unapologetic about opposing the entry of any more ``economic
refugees'' seeking jobs. The European Union says about 750,000
non-Austrian citizens live in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a distinction between refugees and immigrants,''
Haider said. ``Refugees we have to protect. But we have to restrict
immigration. We have nearly one million foreigners. That's more
than enough. We are a small country. Austria is well off now, but
we want to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Haider insists that Austria's relative affluence and social
stability could disappear overnight if the European Union goes
through with its plan to admit as new members Hungary, Slovenia and
the Czech Republic, all of which border Austria. He says a flood of
immigrants would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against enlargement. But if we open our labor
market without a transition, there will be problems. The cheaper,
blue collar workers will come to Austria and take jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists his party's tough line on immigration is no different
than policies adopted by other European governments, such as
Germany. But even he acknowledges Austrians have not confronted
their role in the Third Reich with the same candor as Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a younger generation, we didn't deal with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Haider's party colleagues got six of the 10 Cabinet seats
divvied up last week, but Haider chose not to take one of them. He
said he promised his constituents in Carinthia that he would serve
out his term as governor, which ends in 2004. Some analysts say
Haider wants to keep his distance to see how the new government
fares, to position himself as chancellor in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Haider says many of the stories circulating about him are
malicious and untrue. British and French newspapers have routinely
reported that as a teenager, his fencing practice dummy had the
name of the Vienna-based Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal pinned to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's stupid,'' he said. ``I have no problem with Wiesenthal.
He has no problem with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesenthal does not admire Haider, but has said that he does not
believe that Haider is anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Others are less sure, and they worry that Haider's rhetoric and
his party's success has made it more socially acceptable to be
xenophobic, if not openly racist.
</P>
<P>
   Haider says he welcomed President Thomas Klestil's insistence
that he and the People's Party leader, Wolfgang Schuessel, sign a
pledge that Austria accepted its role in the Third Reich and that
the federal government ``works for an Austria in which xenophobia,
anti-Semitism and racism have no place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with those values,'' he said. ``I've got no problem
with that.''

<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy _ In the 1971 film ``La Mortadella,'' Sophia
Loren played a feisty would-be immigrant who is arrested by U.S.
Customs officials in New York for refusing to surrender a 20-pound
mortadella, the traditional pork sausage of Bologna. A cult classic
in Italy, the satire was aimed at what the director, Mario
Monicelli, called the ``authoritarian rigidity'' of American
society.
</P>
<P>
   After an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy in 1967,
Italian pork products were banned in the United States for decades.
Mortadella, however, has finally been freed. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture announced in the Federal Register last month that as of
Wednesday it would lift certain restrictions on pork and pork
products coming into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the mortadella ban had been greeted with incredulous
outrage and its lifting three decades later is a keenly felt
triumph _ even more than when the Prada yacht ``Luna Rossa'' beat
``AmericaOne''last weekend to become the first Italian sailboat to
qualify for the America's Cup finals since 1992. To
mortadella-makers in Bologna, in particular, the about-face by the
United States represents moral vindication after years of
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than unfair, the American ban seemed crazy,
absurd,'' said Gianni Ballotti, 45, a floor manager at the Alcisa
pork factory in Bologna, where a picture of John Paul II blessing
an 80-pound mortadella at the Vatican in 1995 hangs near the
entrance. ``We send mortadella to countries all over the world, but
not to the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   The loosening of American regulations is partly a testimony to
Italian persuasion (and that of their American lobbyists). But it
is also the result of a striking role reversal in world trade.
Thirty years ago, the United States stood as a citadel of rigorous
veterinary and health regulations that kept many foreign imports
humbly at bay. Now, the United States, under attack all over the
world for exporting genetically-modified food and hormone-treated
beef, is pleading for understanding _ and open markets _ from a
haughty and intransigent European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow imports of mortadella, a delicacy that
costs more than twice as much as the American processed meat sold
as bologna, will not greatly effect U.S. pork producers. (In 1999,
Americans consumed 332 million pounds of domestic bologna.) But
U.S. officials, who recently signed a Veterinary Equivalency
Agreement with their European counterparts that recognizes foreign
sanitation procedures, hope that their magnanimity on mortadella
will help advance negotiations in more contentious areas, including
hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see decisions made in Europe on the import of
meat and meat products that are based solely on science, rather
than politics or protectionism,'' explained Elizabeth Berry,
agricultural counselor at the U.S. embassy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   To some Italians, however, the American eagerness to rely on
science and, more precisely, a mutual recognition of domestic
research and testing, is based as much on expediency as reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has always hidden consumer protectionism behind the
mask of sanitary demands,'' Rino Brini, 80, president of the Alcisa
pork factory, which he co-founded in 1946, explained with a cynical
shrug. ``This is about trade wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Brini keeps on his wall a framed photograph of an Alcisa
mortadella posed against the backdrop of Arizona's Monument Valley;
he had smuggled the banned sausage into the United States in 1987.
Those small acts of defiance are common enough that the Armed
Forces Network regularly runs warnings to Americans overseas not to
bring home Cuban cigars or Italian mortadella.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella-makers look upon American-made bologna the way French
champagne-producers view Ripple wine _ with disgusted pity. ``I
couldn't even try it,'' Brini said. ``It looks so sad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Pliny wrote that the Emperor Augustus liked mortadella. Written
recipes for mortadella, which is made from ground shoulder of pork
dotted with bits of lard, date back to the 16th century in Bologna.
Mortadella can trace its roots in America at least as far back as
the early 1700s, when a French Dominican missionary, Jean Baptiste
Labat, wrote to friends that he had sampled bologna sausages in the
New World, noting that, ``nevertheless, they tasted better in their
country of origin.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Mariani, author of The Dictionary of American Food and
Drink states that the first time the word ``bologna'' was used in
print in the United States was in 1850. Pamela Goyan Kittler, a
California-based cultural nutritionist who specializes in ethnic
foods, said the first samples must have been introduced by Northern
Italian immigrants, but added, ``It was probably the German
immigrant sausage makers, especially Oscar Mayer in the early
1900s, who developed the technology to produce sliced packaged
meats, who really popularized bologna nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of the current mortadella ban was made possible by
the Veterinary Equivalency Agreement, which the United States began
negotiating soon after the European Union imposed its first ban on
hormone-treated beef in 1989. It was also helped by a 1997 decision
by the U.S. government that permits individual regions of a country
to export their local products if that region has been found to be
free of animal diseases. Until now, all Italian pork products were
banned because Sardinia still showed traces of African swine fever.
Bologna, and the rest of mainland Italy, however, has been free of
it for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as no products from Sardinia are used, then mortadella
can be imported,'' said Masoud Malik, a senior veterinarian for the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. He personally witnessed
Bologna manufacturers testing to ensure that their mortadella was
dry-heated to the required 69 degree Celsius required by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   As a Muslim, however, he does not eat pork, and could not sample
the mortadella, which struck Italian producers as tragic.
</P>
<P>
   But the path to mortadella's legalization was also paved in part
by the effort to free Parma hams, which were finally allowed into
the United States in 1989 after an intense lobbying campaign. David
Biltchik, a Washington-based consultant, worked with Italian
producers, scientists, diplomats and U.S. officials to devise tests
that would persuade the Agriculture Department that Parma hams,
which are cured for 400 days, posed no threat to American lives.
But pressure was also put on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Fielding, a former Reagan White House official turned
consultant, was called in 1987 to help coax his friends at the
Agriculture Department. ``It was a very passionate issue for the
Italians,'' Fielding recalled. ``They provided quite a contrast
with American bureaucrats, who just didn't feel the same emotions
about ham.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bologna, however, such feelings still ride high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy,'' said Franca Gandolfi, shopping at Bologna's
main outdoor market. ``This means when we got to New York City, we
will finally be able to eat something good.''

US PLANS LENGTHY ANTI-DRUG EFFORT IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's plan to fight drug
cultivation in Colombia includes supporting a push into southern
Colombia that will displace an estimated 10,000 people, and
providing a long list of military equipment likely to cost millions
of dollars in upkeep for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In a 21-page White House document obtained by The Boston Globe,
the administration outlined for the first time how $1.3 billion in
additional funding to Colombia over the next 18 months would be
spent.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of military commitment in the package raises questions
about the length of US commitment beyond 2001 and whether it would
aid Colombia's war against guerrillas as well as fighting cocaine
and heroin exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This aid is a downpayment on a multiyear strategy requiring
hundreds of millions of dollars a year,'' Senator Patrick Leahy, a
Vermont Democrat, said Wednesday. ``Yet the administration has not
explained in any detail what its goals are . . . at what cost, or
what the risks are.''
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, Congress is expected to debate the
administration's package to Colombia, already the third-largest
recipient of US foreign aid after Israel and Egypt. While support
from the Democratic administration and Republican leadership in
Congress would seem to ensure passage, there has been growing
concern among members of Congress and Pentagon officials about the
wisdom of deepening US involvement in Colombia's 40-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   If the assistance package is approved, much of the work would
take a year or more to complete, including the deployment of
helicopters, upgrades of radar systems, and training new antidrug
battalions.
</P>
<P>
   Barry R. McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy and a retired four-star Army general, has been
strongly arguing that the US needs to fight the burgeoning supply
of drugs in Colombia for well beyond the package presented to
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia is becoming the source of literally hundreds of tons
of cocaine and as much as six metric tons of heroin sloshing around
the United States every year,'' McCaffrey said in an interview.
``It's in our interest to stand with their democratic institutions
and not just a year. This ought to be multiple years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hammer, spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Wednesday that the administration would ``absolutely not'' become
involved in a counterinsurgency effort against Colombia's
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to say that on occasion if you have guerrillas
protecting coca fields that those'' US military ``assets can't be
used to take out the coca fields and the guerrillas will come into
harm's way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Adam Isacson, a senior associate at the Center for
International Policy, a liberal Washington think-tank, said it was
impossible to separate the war against drugs from the war against
guerrillas since guerrillas often protect coca and poppy fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start to call it a push into the region, to call it a
counter-narcotics package is dishonest at best,'' Isacson said.
``It's a smokescreen.''
</P>
<P>
   In the White House document, which has been distributed to some
members of Congress and their staff, US involvement is spelled out
in great detail.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, under the heading ``Push into Southern Colombia
Coca Growing Areas,'' $452 million would be spent on 30 UH-60
Blackhawk helicopters and 15 UH-1N Huey helicopters, as well as
upgrading 18 Huey helicopters already in Colombia. The helicopters
are to give greater mobility for three batallions of drug-fighting
troops.
</P>
<P>
   US advisers have already trained one batallion. The next two
``will be trained by US troops on temporary duty in Colombia''
beginning in March or April, allowing for deployment at the end of
the year, the document said. For those 2,700 troops, the
administration proposes spending $48 million to outfit them
completely, including weapons, ammunition, uniforms, fuel, and
meals.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's document also estimated 10,000 plantation
workers ``will be displaced by the eradication campaign. Displaced
persons will receive a 90-day emergency benefits package.''
</P>
<P>
   The package includes $31 million to help the displaced move into
legitimate farming and ``other legal economic activity'' as well as
giving them emergency shelter, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   Other pieces of the package include:
</P>
<P>
   --$35 million to upgrade Colombian Army airbases to accommodate
the new helicopters and build new bases.
</P>
<P>
   --$37 million for new ground-based radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   --$55 million in an unspecified ``classified program'' under the
title of intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   --$68 million to upgrade four US Customs P-3 aircraft's airborne
early warning radar.
</P>
<P>
   --$20 million for 15 new spray aircraft to eradicate coca and
poppy fields.
</P>
<P>
   --$38.6 million to build a new ``forward operating location'' at
Manta, Ecuador, to give US planes quicker access to Colombia.

HIGH COURT BARS USE OF EMBRYOS FATHERED BY EX-HUSBAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a one-page order that gives no indication of its
reasoning, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that
a 44-year-old woman cannot ignore her former husband's objections
and use frozen embryos created during their failed marriage to try
and have more children.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the state's highest court Wednesday immediately
becomes the leading case in an arena where advances in reproductive
technology have far outpaced legal concepts of family and
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal,'' said Boston University medical ethicist
George Annas. ``This could be a very important opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The court issued the brief order, minus its usual written
opinion, because the woman needed to know before she turns 45 in
June, the deadline for having the embryos implanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is profoundly disappointed,'' said her attorney, Gretchen
Van Ness, adding that the woman's hope of conceiving more children
is forever ended.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was not identified in court papers, has
7-year-old twin daughters conceived with the consent of the father
during their marriage. Van Ness said she does not yet know what
will happen to the embryos, which are stored in a Boston-area
fertility clinic vault.
</P>
<P>
   Her former husband had opposed the woman's plan in Suffolk
Probate Court, but was not part of the case before the SJC. His
last attorney, Paula H. Noe, said she is no longer in contact with
him, but predicted, ``I bet this guy is going to be celebrating
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe said the man, after a bitter divorce, did not want to father
any more children with his former wife and did not want to face the
financial, legal and moral responsibilities that would fall on him
if the frozen embryos were successfully implanted in the woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to attorneys and Annas, the decision in the case known
as AZ vs. BZ is only the third time a top state appellate court had
wrestled with the complex legal and moral issues growing out of
assisted reproductive techniques.
</P>
<P>
   However, until the SJC issues its written opinion _ and any
dissenting views _ it is unclear how far-reaching the ruling will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because there is so little law on the subject, any ruling
will be closely followed by other state courts, lawyers and
specialists predict.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a written opinion, Annas said it is clear
that the SJC has embraced the idea that both prospective parents
must have a voice in the use of frozen embryos. Technically, the
SJC affirmed Probate Court Judge Anthony R. Nesi's ruling in favor
of the former husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``No court has said you can use embryos to make a baby without
the concurrent consent and agreement of the would-be parents,''
Annas said. He added that until the embryo is implanted in the
woman, both mother and father have equal legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Susan L. Crockin, a lawyer who represents fertility clinics and
couples who use them, said assisted reproduction has achieved
stunning technical successes. But until courts and legislatures
catch up, people who use clinics and those that operate them face
an uncertain legal future.
</P>
<P>
   Crockin said Wednesday was the first time a top state appellate
court had confronted the question of what to do when a potential
mother tries to enforce an agreement that gave her control of
embryos if the marriage ended. By contrast, top courts in Tennessee
and New York have only addressed cases where divorced couples had
agreed to destroy or donate embryos if their marriage ended and the
woman later sued to gain custody of the embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology should be helping create families, not
lawsuits,'' Crockin said, adding that ``it would be in everybody's
interests'' if the courts or lawmakers start defining the rights
and responsibilities of participants in such nontraditional
conceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Nesi ruled in 1996 that the former husband was not bound by
agreements he signed during the years the couple spent trying to
get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Nesi said that circumstances had changed so dramatically _ the
divorce, the birth of twins, the possibility that the woman could
have more children with another partner or adopt _ that the former
husband should not be forced into fatherhood against his will.
</P>
<P>
   Van Ness said she and her client will review the opinion once it
is released and may seek further review before the US Supreme Court
if it appears the outcome may help other women in the future.

STUDY CITES OBSTACLES FOR WOMEN IN MEDICINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More women are becoming doctors and researchers but they still
don't climb the academic ladder as quickly as men.
</P>
<P>
   Women who graduated from US medical schools from 1979 to 1993
were 10 percent more likely than male graduates to pursue a career
in academic medicine, according to a study in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But between 1979 and 1997, the proportion of male full
professors was 34 percent while the proportion of female full
professors was steady at 12 percent, suggesting women remained at
the junior faculty, according to Lynn Nonnemaker, a sociologist
with the Association of American Medical Colleges and the study's
author.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nonnemaker found that women are also shying away
from full-time faculty positions. ``This change threatens even the
limited gains in the representation of women in academic
medicine,'' Nonnemaker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Catherine De Angelis, editor of the Journal of the American
Medical Association and who was dean and pediatrics professor at
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said Nonnemaker's
study, which is based on national data on all medical school
graduates, confirms what other studies have said about the
disparities between male and female professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is, there's progress; the bad news is, there's
not enough progress,'' said Joanne Ingwall, director of the Office
for Faculty Development at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center. ``Someone who starts as an instructor can die as an
instructor,'' Ingwall said.
</P>
<P>
   Ingwall, who is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical
School, said that Harvard Medical School and its affiliate
hospitals have been trying to change the gender disparity in
academic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The program at the BIDMC is only a year and a half old and
includes an initiative called Profile 2005, with the goal of
increasing the number of women, especially at senior ranks, to
match the average at all US medical schools, which is currently 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, the proportion of women faculty at Harvard
Medical School has grown from 14 percent, or 287 women, to 32
percent, or 1779 women.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, Ingwall said that among the Harvard-affiliated
hospitals, BIDMC has traditionally had the worse record for
promoting its faculty, including women. At BIDMC, 4 women are full
professors, or 6 percent of the faculty. At Harvard Medical School,
10 percent of full professors are women.
</P>
<P>
   Ingwall said that the best students in either gender take about
15 to 20 years to rise from instructor to full professor.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lynne M. Reid, professor of pathology at Harvard Medical
School and has served as a mentor to many junior faculty, said that
once out of school, people are often ignorant of requirements for
promotion, especially by women. ``Many of them think that if they
do what they are asked to by their immediate boss, they will get
promoted. But if that's all clinical responsibility, that's not
going to happen. To get to the senior levels, they have to apply
for grants and do clinical and academic research,'' said Reid.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the new programs, which include one-on-one
mentoring and lunch discussions ``demystifying the promotion
process,'' come in, said Ingwall. ``It used to be considered that
females couldn't have a male mentor, but that's not true,'' she
said, because they can offer expertise in career management in the
academic track.
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, its parent company
created an Office for Women's Careers in 1997. Later that year, MGH
opened a back-up child-care center, to help with one of the most
significant barriers of advancement _ juggling work and family. The
office has also formed a sexual harassment task force and started
research awards for promising young female investigators, said
Suzanne Metallo, associate director of the Office for Women's
Careers at MGH.

ADAM SANDLER WANTS YOU TO BE IN HIS MOVIE
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's your chance to spend the equivalent of an entire workday
jammed into bleachers, be told what to do and when to do it _ and
not receive a dime for your labors.
</P>
<P>
   But you will get to be in the same room as Adam Sandler and be
in a major motion picture set for holiday release. A Faustian
bargain? You might say that. The $20 million star of ``Big Daddy''
is, after all, playing Lucifer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of the New Line Cinema film ``Little Nicky'' are
looking for several thousand people to be part of a crowd scene in
the movie, which stars Sandler, Dana Carvey, Patricia Arquette and
Harvey Keitel. Participants will not be paid, but they'll get free
parking and will be served dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to come check it out, have a really good
time,'' said Cash Oshman, president of Audience Associates, which
coordinates crowd scenes for film companies. ``It won't be like a
normal film day, which is `hurry up and wait.' We'll make it a fun
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the ``hurry up and wait'' will be filled by
warm-up acts, food and door prizes. Maybe, if you're intensely
lucky, you'll come away with a trip to Vegas or some article of
autographed memorabilia (sweat socks? devil horns?).
</P>
<P>
   Filming takes place from 3 to 11 p.m. Tuesday, Wednesday and
Feb. 17 and 18 on the campus at California State University, Long
Beach. All participants must be at least 16 years old, and
reservations are required. No nudity is required of audience
members, and, just in case you're worried about contributing to the
moral downfall of our culture, the film is expected to carry a PG
or PG-13 rating. Even local Christian radio stations are shilling
for ``Little Nicky'' crowds.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Little Nicky,'' Adam Sandler plays the independent-minded
son of Satan, who tries to stop his two brothers from taking over
the world. The movie, a comedy directed by Steven Brill, is
scheduled for release during the 2000 holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   During the four days, crowds are needed as background at a
``pretty wild demonic basketball game'' _ as if there were any
other kind. Sandler and Carvey will both be on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one or two of the days, the Harlem Globetrotters are going
to be in this,'' said Oshman, ``but I don't know which days. And
with Adam, you never know who else might show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants can sign up either as individuals or as part of a
group for fund-raising purposes. Transportation is available for
groups of 40 or more people. The event will also feature
entertainment and door prizes. Information will also be available
on how people can register to become paid extras in other films or
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most extra casting companies charge $25 to $50 to sign up,''
said Oshman. ``Many of them will waive the fee if you've been to
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   For reservations, call (323) 653-2425. Or register online at
www.beinamovie.com. Seating is on a first-come, first-served basis.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows, come Christmas maybe you'll be able to spot your
mug amid the other 2,999 extras. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A Russian television station broadcast a videotape of
missing war correspondent Andrei Babitsky Wednesday in which the
journalist said he was safe, but unable to return home.
</P>
<P>
   For Babitsky's kin and colleagues, however, the video raised
more questions than it answered _ and Washington urged Moscow to
``come clean'' on the journalists' whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The dark and grainy video showed Babitsky, missing for more than
three weeks in wartorn Chechnya, sitting against a wall and holding
a handkerchief to his head. Babitsky said the video was filmed on
Feb. 6 but did not indicate where he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am relatively fine,'' Babitsky said, speaking slowly but
distinctly. ``The only problem is time. The circumstances are such
that I can not immediately return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all right here as far as it can be normal in a war. The
people with me are trying to help me,'' Babitsky said. ``I very
much want to go home. I want this to end as soon as possible. Do
not worry, I will come back home soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky, 35, a reporter for US-funded Radio Liberty,
disappeared on Jan. 15 after leaving Chechnya's capital Grozny,
where he was covering Russia's war against separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the Kremlin denied knowledge of his whereabouts but
later admitted that Russian forces in Chechnya had arrested him for
lacking accreditation to work in the war zone. Law-enforcement
officials in Moscow also said they suspected that Babitsky had
joined the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Kremlin announced last week that Babitsky had been
handed over to Chechen rebels in exchange for Russian prisoners of
war. A video released by the Russian government on Feb. 5 showed
Russian soldiers handing a distraught and disoriented Babitsky over
to unidentified armed and masked men.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread skepticism, the Kremlin insists that Babitsly
is with the rebels and that the Russian government is no longer
responsible for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official disagreed and urged Moscow to punish
``those guilty of wrongful acts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russian government is responsible for Mr. Babitsky's
safety and well-being and it is time for Russian officials to come
clean,'' James Rubin said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates have called the case an attempt by the
Kremlin to intimidate reporters working in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky's reports from Chechnya on high Russian troop losses
and the plight of civilians have challenged official statements
about the war and infuriated the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Corti, manager of Radio Liberty's Russian Service, said
that the Russian authorities ``have contradicted themselves from
day one'' regarding Babitsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have lied so much that that I wouldn't be surprised if
one of them says that Babitsky never existed,'' Corti said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that residents of Chechnya's Russian-controlled
city of Gudermes reported seeing Babitsky on Tuesday in the custody
of pro-Moscow militias. He quoted witnesses from the city as saying
that Babitsky's face was severely bruised and his clothing was
bloody. The report could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In the video broadcast Wednesday, Babitsky did not appear to
have been harmed. Nevertheless, it did little to reassure the
journalist's family, friends and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just terrible,'' Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila, said after
watching the broadcast. ``They show my husband sitting who knows
where with who knows whom saying he wants to come home but can't. I
don't know what to think.''

LULA WASHINGTON STAYS ON HER TOES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been one of those mornings _ no, one of those
years, for Lula Washington and her husband, Erwin.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours earlier, one of the family cars stalled, forcing
Washington to rent a set of wheels to drive to her Mid-City dance
studio.
</P>
<P>
   When the award-winning choreographer arrives, 45 minutes late
and apologizing profusely, her handsome young troupe is well into
its warm-ups, shedding clothes as they bend and stretch to Stevie
Wonder's ``As'' followed by a smattering of New Age harp.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling studio, which rents for a hefty $3,500 a month, is
homebase for Lula Washington Dance Theatre, though it wasn't
intended to be. Six years ago, the Washingtons were preparing to
inaugurate their dance company's new permanent residence in the
West Adams neighborhood when the Northridge Earthquake leveled the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Lula Washington Dance Theatre prepares to celebrate its
20th anniversary with a Friday performance at UCLA's Royce Hall,
its founder and namesake faces a paradox: Coming off a highly
successful year in which it toured 35 cities and reaped accolades
from The New York Times and other publications, the company is
still struggling to cope with financial straits stemming from the
1994 temblor.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Federal Emergency Management Agency awarded it a
$1.3 million grant, Lula Washington Dance Theatre is still wading
through bureaucratic red tape before it can start the rebuilding
process. Meanwhile, other commercial developers have been
ambitiously eying the vacant lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have a movie about the saga of this building,'' says
Washington, 49, managing a rueful laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But if the company's financial future still is on shaky ground,
Washington herself is determined to keep moving artistically.
</P>
<P>
   After working for most of her career in an Afrocentric dance
idiom that merges modern, jazz and tap techniques, Washington will
use the UCLA appearance to unveil ``Rites 2000,'' her first piece
set to a classical score. The roughly 30-minute, non-narrative work
_ another departure for Washington _ explores various life rituals,
including love and marriage, through the music of Vivaldi, Bach,
John Tavener and Stravinsky (though not the composer's ``Rite of
Spring,'' to which Washington's work is unrelated).
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin Ailey, before he died, told me I should do something
classical and I just brushed it off,'' Washington says, referring
to the modern dance icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Rites 2000' is almost a personal rite of passage in a sense
because it's me challenging myself choreographically to work to
classical music, because I've never done that before. I wanted to
see if I could connect to classical music, if I could put my
movement style to classical music. This is something outside of the
box for me, outside my comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA program also will include the world premiere of ``Death
and Eros'' by Donald McKayle, a choreographer whose works
Washington's company has performed frequently. (Both Washington and
McKayle recently were awarded $30,000 dance fellowships by the
James Irvine Foundation, which they partly used to develop these
new pieces.) Set to original music by Jon Magnusson, McKayle's work
is based on an Inuit tale, ``The Legend of the Skeleton Woman,''
about a fisherman whose love restores a woman to life.
</P>
<P>
   The evening will conclude with Washington's 1998 ``Mahal
Dances,'' which she describes as ``a fun, earthy piece'' set to
music by Taj Mahal. Later this year, the company will mark its
anniversary with additional performances at California State
University, Long Beach's Carpenter Theatre (March 18), the John
Anson Ford Amphitheatre (Aug. 5) and the Luckman Fine Arts Complex
at California State University, Los Angeles (Dec. 30).
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas native, Washington migrated to Watts with her family
when she was 5 years old. Raised in the Nickerson Gardens housing
project, she was the eldest of eight siblings, whose parents were a
Bethlehem Steel worker and a house cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school (where she met Erwin, her
future husband and the company's executive director), Washington
enrolled in junior college and took her first dance classes. It was
during that time she first saw Ailey's company performing at UCLA,
including his striking protege Judith Jamison. Washington says she
knew then she had to become a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like me,'' she recalls. ``I had only seen dance on
television, and there were no black dancers on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington went on to earn a master's degree in dance from UCLA
and to found Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre (as the group
originally was known) in 1980. Initially, it had been formed to
choreograph dances for a dance medicine symposium at Royce Hall,
but Washington persisted in keeping the company together after the
symposium ended.
</P>
<P>
   While the company has always been multiethnic, the
African-American experience has been the keystone of its aesthetic.
Washington's signature works include ``Tasting Muddy Waters,'' a
15-minute solo piece inspired by the life of the Gullah slave
descendants of the coastal Carolinas, and ``What About Watts?'' a
1996 piece triggered by her nephew's gang-related murder. A more
whimsical work, ``L.A. View,'' playfully spoofs local customs,
making use of Hula-Hoops and snatches of marathon dancing.
</P>
<P>
   During the company's recent outing at the Joyce Theater in
Manhattan, New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff praised its
``remarkably vivid mix of purity and dynamism.'' Kisselgoff also
noted the ``star presence'' of ``two eye-riveting performers,''
Nabachwa Ssensalo, and Tamica Washington, Lula and Erwin's
29-year-old daughter. A number of Washington's young performers
have since moved on to productive careers with other modern dance
companies and to Broadway shows like ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Washington and her husband, they remain hopeful they'll
be able to rebuild in West Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first moved in there, we had to climb over the drug
addicts,'' Washington says. ``So we were instrumental in cleaning
up that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if they can only get their sometimes inattentive hometown to
notice what the rest of the world already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it (L.A.) is such a busy place, in order for something
to have an impact, it's like television _ I can see why they have
commercials,'' Washington says. ``I think the arts have to be like
that. I think we have to be hitting on people all the time.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Constant monitoring needed to protect companies from hacker
attacks, experts say
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Unknown hackers with unknown motives Wednesday again
disrupted access to a string of popular Web sites. The third
straight day of attacks made Internet users uneasy and brought a
vow from Attorney General Janet Reno to stop the electronic
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   However, another government official said prevention of such
attacks ultimately rests with businesses and organizations that use
the Web. Protecting the Internet ''is not something that can be
done by any one agency,'' said Ronald Dick of the National
Infrastructure Protection Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has exposed the vulnerability of the Internet
economy,'' suggested Anita D'Amico, security consultant for New
York-based Applied Visions and former head of information warfare
at Northrup Grumman. ``It won't have a major impact on the economy,
but it points out the need to pay attention to security issues.
Companies spend more on five guards outside than all their
firewalls and protection systems.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the hackers hit Ziff-Davis' ZDNet and E-Trade
Group, blocking _ at least for awhile _ their use by legitimate
users.
</P>
<P>
   Datek Online Brokerage Services also reported an outage, but
late in the day ruled out a hacker attack as the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was little question that someone had embarrassed some
of the nation's top Web sites _ again. As in attacks Monday and
Tuesday, mysterious hackers apparently enlisted scores of
``zombie'' computers, which were commanded to send massive amounts
of data to the victimized Web sites, clogging traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The vandals apparently made no effort to manipulate or steal
information from those Web sites. But in what is known as a
``denial of service'' attack, they induced a flood of meaningless
data that paralyzed computers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, hackers temporarily shut down sites
operated by Yahoo, EBay, Amazon.com, Buy.com and CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the hackers' apparent intent is to ''disrupt
legitimate electronic commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick said the hackers face as much as 10 years in jail and fines
of up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers _ unlike spies or thieves _ are not in it for money.
Instead, they may see the flexing of cyber-muscles as fun,
entertainment or a matter of pride. Talk about hacking can be found
around the Internet, as can ``how to'' instructions.
</P>
<P>
   John Copeland, professor at the Georgia Tech School of
Electrical and Computer Engineering, said the software that makes
the vandalism possible automatically recruits more ``zombies'' to
the cause, while shrouding the identity behind the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's kind of disturbing is that the FBI has said a
15-year-old could be doing this,'' Copeland said. ``That says there
are some serious security issues with the Internet which the
economy is becoming dependent on.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that protection against such attacks starts by
protecting computers that may be targeted by hackers. Many probes
by hackers can be detected and stopped by anti-virus or firewall
software.
</P>
<P>
   Other products can handle more sophisticated intrusions. For
instance, Symantec makes a product called Norton Internet Security
2000 that prevents computers from being used as ``zombies.''
</P>
<P>
   But many users leave their computers undefended and connected to
the Internet or to corporate networks that are not protected. So
hackers can find plenty of computers to exploit _ and the more
powerful the machines, the more effective the vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   For an Internet company to be shut down means the loss of every
transaction that would have taken place, as well as revenue from
banner ads that would have appeared on the Web site. Worse than
that is reputation damage, said Harry Fenik, executive vice
president of Zona Research.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks are about ``losing prestige,'' he said. ``Companies
like Yahoo are saying to companies, 'Use us. Bank your life on us.'
Then they go away for half a day. This doesn't go over so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Web sites and Internet service providers that are targeted can
install software that looks for an unusual transmission _
especially one that is much bulkier than normal. They can monitor
constantly, hoping to shut off access to a malicious intruder.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink, the company into which Atlanta-based MindSpring
Enterprises merged, has a team that constantly monitors
transmissions, according to spokeswoman Kirsten Witt. ``We take
extreme measures to protect this network of ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Swindon, chief security officer at Healtheon/WebMD, said
companies must make security a constant concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to react extremely quickly. You have to have people
who are good at it, ready to make the necessary changes. But the
reality is that in a couple of seconds you can have hundreds of
thousands of requests placed at your doorstep. It pretty soon
builds to an avalanche.''
</P>
<P>
   He remains optimistic. ``The technology is getting better all
the time. In the future, there will be better mechanisms to prevent
this kind of attack.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, with the largest network in the Southeast, must be
vigilant in monitoring its own computers, as well as it large
Internet business. Unusually large transmissions are blocked, said
Ray Smets, president of BellSouth's Net unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But vandalism is a little like a virus,'' he said. ``You come
up with an inoculation but it if mutates, it may afflict you once
again.''

McCAIN SHARPENS ATTACK ON GOP HIERARCHY 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
and JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ As the race for the Republican presidential
nomination formally narrowed Wednesday, John McCain sharpened his
claim that his success had alarmed his party's hierarchy and its
lobbyist friends who back George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush turned briefly from his brawl with McCain to offer to the
country a series of civil justice reform proposals generally
similar to the ones he enacted in Texas in his first gubernatorial
term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The establishment is scared to death,'' the Arizona senator
told supporters in North Charleston. ``That's why you'll see more
of them trooping down here'' to campaign for Bush before the Feb.
19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``K Street, where the lobbyists live (in Washington), is
empty,'' McCain said. ``They're all down here campaigning against
me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments were aimed principally at Bush's support by
Carroll Campbell, the former South Carolina governor who remains a
political power in the state even though he has become one of
Washington's highest-paid lobbyists as an advocate for the
insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also reiterated his plan to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's civil justice reform plan would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bar from federal courts lawyers who file three frivolous
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   _ Subject a party to paying his opponents legal fees if an
attorney rejected a pretrial settlement offer and ultimately lost
the case or received a lot less than the settlement offer, as
punishment for continuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a client bill of rights that would allow clients to
challenge the reasonableness of their attorney's fees in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he had to fight trial lawyers to pass similar
legislation in Texas, and he expected the same type of opposition
at the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``This requires a candidate who's willing to stare them down,
and I'm for fairness, and I'm for balance,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has scoffed at the ``outsider'' claim by
McCain, who has been in Congress 17 years from Arizona and is now
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's remarks about Bush's establishment support came as
publisher Steve Forbes was set to drop out of the Republican race,
his second try at the White House, after finishing third Tuesday
behind Bush and McCain in the Delaware primary, which he won in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina contest is shaping up as critical for Bush
and McCain. For months, Bush held a substantial polling lead in the
state, but after New Hampshire's primary the race has narrowed
dramatically. A new Washington Post-ABC survey of likely Republican
voters found Bush ahead 48 percent to 43 percent. Others have shown
an even tighter race.
</P>
<P>
   As the two battle for South Carolina's 400,000 military retirees
and active personnel, Bush began to soften his earlier attacks on
McCain's support for veterans. McCain spent almost six years in a
North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he enjoys strong support among veterans, Bush said, ``The
veterans know I've been a leader, someone who can bring reforms.
McCain has had a distinquished career in the U.S. military and
we've got to recognize that,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia at midday, before a voters forum sponsored by the
state chapter of the American Association of Retired Persons,
McCain said one reason that Congress could not agree on a ``bill of
rights'' for customers of health maintenance organizations was
Republican reliance on ``big insurance and their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is president and chief executive officer of the
American Council of Life Insurance, with an annual compensation
package reportedly worth $2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was accompanied by Campbell as he toured the state by bus,
stopping in Newberry, Union, Gaffney and Rock Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carroll Campbell made his reputation, staked his claim, as a
great governor of South Carolina. I not only welcome Carroll
Campbell's support, I welcome Sen. Strom Thurmond's support as
well,'' Bush said of the 97-year-old senator who endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took McCain to task for his stance on campaign finances,
alleging the senator was being deceptive by calling for reforms but
relying heavily on special interest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing illegal about taking PAC (political action
committee) money. I take PAC money. He's been successful at taking
PAC money. My point is, it's one thing to say something; it's
another thing to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sponsored an unsuccessful campaign finance reform bill in
1996 that would have banned PAC contributions and voted for PAC
donation bans in 1990 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also accepts PAC money and has raised about five times as
much as McCain, or $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator said he has always accepted PAC money, and
did not dispute Bush's claim that he raised $318,000 in donations
from the groups. McCain is opposed to unlimited, unregulated ``soft
money'' donations; PAC donations are legal, constitutional and
limited, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also argued that McCain is breaking federal limits on how
much he can spend in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's taking matching funds, McCain would be limited to
$1.5 million. Bush's staff estimates he has spent about $2.4
million. But the federal rules are riddled with loopholes that
enable a candidate to spend more and there is no evidence McCain
has broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's organization is a force to be reckoned with in a
Republican primary. Some dissident Republicans, however, are
backing McCain at least in part because they see it as a way of
further reducing the Old Guards' influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has the potential for really damaging them,'' state
Sen. Larry Grooms said. ``They're beginning to lay their reputation
on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're arrogant,'' Barbara Leonard of Florence, a McCain
supporter and chairwoman of the Sixth Congressional District
Republicans, told The State newspaper recently. ``They take us for
grated and call us when they need us and want to use us.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's supporters include two of the state's leading GOP new
turks, U.S. Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does, McCain approached the lobbyist issue with some
humor, noting: ``They do spend a lot of money while they're down
here, so you should be glad. They live pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeated throughout the day a standard part of his stump
speech, saying the nation suffers because of the ``iron triangle''
of money, lobbyists and legislators.

use the UCLA appearance to unveil ``Rites 2000,'' her first piece
set to a classical score. The roughly 30-minute, non-narrative work
_ another departure for Washington _ explores various life rituals,
including love and marriage, through the music of Vivaldi, Bach,
John Tavener and Stravinsky (though not the composer's ``Rite of
Spring,'' to which Washington's work is unrelated).
</P>
<P>
   ``Alvin Ailey, before he died, told me I should do something
classical and I just brushed it off,'' Washington says, referring
to the modern dance icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Rites 2000' is almost a personal rite of passage in a sense
because it's me challenging myself choreographically to work to
classical music, because I've never done that before. I wanted to
see if I could connect to classical music, if I could put my
movement style to classical music. This is something outside of the
box for me, outside my comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA program also will include the world premiere of ``Death
and Eros'' by Donald McKayle, a choreographer whose works
Washington's company has performed frequently. (Both Washington and
McKayle recently were awarded $30,000 dance fellowships by the
James Irvine Foundation, which they partly used to develop these
new pieces.) Set to original music by Jon Magnusson, McKayle's work
is based on an Inuit tale, ``The Legend of the Skeleton Woman,''
about a fisherman whose love restores a woman to life.
</P>
<P>
   The evening will conclude with Washington's 1998 ``Mahal
Dances,'' which she describes as ``a fun, earthy piece'' set to
music by Taj Mahal. Later this year, the company will mark its
anniversary with additional performances at California State
University, Long Beach's Carpenter Theatre (March 18), the John
Anson Ford Amphitheatre (Aug. 5) and the Luckman Fine Arts Complex
at California State University, Los Angeles (Dec. 30).
</P>
<P>
   An Arkansas native, Washington migrated to Watts with her family
when she was 5 years old. Raised in the Nickerson Gardens housing
project, she was the eldest of eight siblings, whose parents were a
Bethlehem Steel worker and a house cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school (where she met Erwin, her
future husband and the company's executive director), Washington
enrolled in junior college and took her first dance classes. It was
during that time she first saw Ailey's company performing at UCLA,
including his striking protege Judith Jamison. Washington says she
knew then she had to become a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were like me,'' she recalls. ``I had only seen dance on
television, and there were no black dancers on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington went on to earn a master's degree in dance from UCLA
and to found Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theatre (as the group
originally was known) in 1980. Initially, it had been formed to
choreograph dances for a dance medicine symposium at Royce Hall,
but Washington persisted in keeping the company together after the
symposium ended.
</P>
<P>
   While the company has always been multiethnic, the
African-American experience has been the keystone of its aesthetic.
Washington's signature works include ``Tasting Muddy Waters,'' a
15-minute solo piece inspired by the life of the Gullah slave
descendants of the coastal Carolinas, and ``What About Watts?'' a
1996 piece triggered by her nephew's gang-related murder. A more
whimsical work, ``L.A. View,'' playfully spoofs local customs,
making use of Hula-Hoops and snatches of marathon dancing.
</P>
<P>
   During the company's recent outing at the Joyce Theater in
Manhattan, New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff praised its
``remarkably vivid mix of purity and dynamism.'' Kisselgoff also
noted the ``star presence'' of ``two eye-riveting performers,''
Nabachwa Ssensalo, and Tamica Washington, Lula and Erwin's
29-year-old daughter. A number of Washington's young performers
have since moved on to productive careers with other modern dance
companies and to Broadway shows like ``Ragtime.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Washington and her husband, they remain hopeful they'll
be able to rebuild in West Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first moved in there, we had to climb over the drug
addicts,'' Washington says. ``So we were instrumental in cleaning
up that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if they can only get their sometimes inattentive hometown to
notice what the rest of the world already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it (L.A.) is such a busy place, in order for something
to have an impact, it's like television _ I can see why they have
commercials,'' Washington says. ``I think the arts have to be like
that. I think we have to be hitting on people all the time.'' &QL;

$66 MILLION LATER, FORBES TO QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After spending more than $66 million on his elusive White House
dream, conservative magazine publisher Steve Forbes will drop out
of the Republican presidential race Thursday, winnowing the GOP
field to three.
</P>
<P>
   A day after he finished a disappointing third in Delaware's
Republican primary, Forbes abruptly canceled campaign events in
Michigan and returned to his New Jersey home. He is scheduled to
formally announce his exit from the race at a press conference in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' exit did not seem to promise major shifts in the GOP
race, which has come down to a contest between Texas Gov. George W.
Bush and Arizona Senator John McCain, with former Ambassador Alan
Keyes trailing far behind.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup poll conducted last weekend showed Forbes with just two
percent of the Republican vote nationwide. In South Carolina, home
of the next Republican primary on Feb. 19, Forbes has been stalled
below 5 percent in most polls.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Bush and McCain sought to claim the backing of
Forbes supporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may help us,'' McCain said in South Carolina Wednesday.
``We're already hearing from a lot of them that are coming on
board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll have a good chance to pick up a lot of his
support, and I look forward to working hard to pick up his
support,'' Bush said. ``He injected a lot of interesting ideas into
the discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes aides said he will not endorse any candidate, but that he
may in the future. Campaign manager Bill Dal Col dismissed
speculation that Forbes feels personal enmity toward Bush that
might prevent a future endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said Forbes decided to quit the race Tuesday night after
finishing third in Delaware, whose primary he won in 1996. Forbes
placed behind McCain, who did not even campaign in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Delaware marked the end of a rapid meltdown for Forbes, who
scored a triumphant second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses just
over two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes and his aides were ebullient as they left Iowa for New
Hampshire, blaring rock music aboard his chartered jet and talking
boldy of a three-way race with Bush and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes was unable to replicate the enthusiasm and
exceptional organization he built at great cost in Iowa. The next
week he finished third in New Hampshire's primary with just 13
percent of the vote, and his support waned rapidly nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his low poll numbers, aides said Forbes played an
important role in shaping the Republican party's agenda in recent
years with his call for a 17 percent flat tax, a constitutional
amendment banning abortion, and market-driven approaches to
reforming Social Security and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of issues wouldn't be in play right now if it weren't
for Steve Forbes,'' said campaign spokesperson Juleanna Glover
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col, meanwhile, flatly ruled out speculation that Forbes
might join the race for an open New Jersey Senate seat this year.
``It's not even a remote consideration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously known best as the heir to the publishing empire built
by his father, Malcolm Forbes Sr., Steve Forbes became an
unexpected addition to presidential politics in 1995 after deciding
his party lacked a sufficiently bold tax-cutter in its presidential
field.
</P>
<P>
   His candidacy made him the national standard bearer for
``supply-side'' economics, a theory which holds that huge tax cuts
will drastically accelerate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Forbes styled himself as an angry populist who
ridiculed the ``Washington elites,'' compared the tax code to a
Frankenstein monster, and vowed to purge the Capitol of lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes rode his flat tax plan to national notice in 1996, but
dropped out of that race after winning just two primaries, having
spent $37 million from his estimated fortune of $440 million.
</P>
<P>
   Barely pausing between campaigns, Forbes entered the 2000
presidential race with a new emphasis on morality and a strong
anti-abortion message. His hope was to unite a coalition of social
and economic conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But some political observers said Forbes succeeded only in
muddying his message, leaving religious conservatives skeptical of
his new moral focus and obscuring his simple flat-tax pitch.
</P>
<P>
   William Mayer, an associate professor of political science at
Northeastern University, said Forbes suffered from several
problems, including the fact that he has never held elective office
before and faced the challenge of running two consecutive campaigns
as an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've done it once, you look like more of a
professional, and it looks like a career move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer added that Forbes' flat-tax message was a hard sell in a
time of economic contentment.
</P>
<P>
   With his shy demeanor, Forbes also never showed a personal touch
that has been invaluable to successful candidates from Bill Clinton
to John McCain. Forbes often seemed at a loss to make simple small
talk when greeting voters, and he revealed few details about his
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col acknowledged Wednesday that Forbes, who spent at least
$29 million more of his own money on this campaign, had been
frustrated by a GOP race that has focused more on character than
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the environment,'' he said. ``The economy's humming
along, people are not focused on issues. It became more of a
biography race, and he's clearly more of an issues and an agenda
candidate.''

businesslike atmosphere. There are more CEOs and other executives
of the sporting goods industry.
</P>
<P>
   Where's Willie Mays when you need him?
</P>
<P>
   _ The lineup: The recognizable names who will appear today

Coach.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's lineup features U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong at Active
USA, San Francisco 49er Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott at Moretz Sports
and former baseball player Ken Griffey Sr. at Did You Sports.

track and field star Edwin Moses from noon-12:30 p.m., former
heavyweight champ Evander Holyfield from 1:30-2 p.m., former
Chicago Bulls center Artis Gilmore from 2-2:30 p.m. and the Seattle
Supersonics' Gus Williams from 2-2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Did you know ... : Some 55,000 people attended the Super Show
in 1986 while the top year for attendance was 1995, when 112,990
came through the doors.
</P>
<P>
   There were 37,564 buyers here in 1986, while 65,495 attended
last year. In '86, only 700 exhibitors came. Last year 3,232
displayed their merchandise. There were 200 requests for press
credentials in 1986 and 1,005 in 1999.

DOWN SOUTH, BUSH CAMPAIGN TAKES ON THAT DOWN HOME FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAFFNEY, S.C. _ Maybe it's the country music playing on local
radio. Or perhaps it's the billboards along the highway that ask:
``Troubled? Try prayer!''
</P>
<P>
   But ever since last week, when Governor George W. Bush arrived
here bruised from his New Hampshire primary defeat, the candidate,
his southwestern twang deepening each day, has seemed more at ease
in his surroundings than he ever was last month. And it's not just
that his ``dubyas'' are more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   He delights in ribbing supporters at public events more than he
did up north. He has, over the last two days, grown more expansive
in his responses. He has laughed aloud at his own jokes. Wednesday,
under sunny skies and 65-degree weather, he invited reporters to
join him for a jog.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is no doubt taking extra pains to show his lighter side,
consciously working to show voters he still believes he can win,
perhaps even indulging the good-natured ``good-ol' boy'' that was
much noticed last year _ but which seemed to vanish, along with a
chunk of his popularity, in New Hampshire last month. His 51
percent win in Delaware on Tuesday has clearly buoyed his spirits,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as he wanders from Christian colleges to country music radio
stations to barbecues, it appears South Carolina may itself be a
much-needed source of comfort for Bush. And from the moment the
Texas governor flew in _ noting, in his first speech after the New
Hampshire primary, the ``warmer'' climate _ it's been obvious the
campaign feels much more at home here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the South,'' said Karen Hughes, communications
director for the Bush campaign. ``I joke they understand our Texas
accents here.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his location, Bush can little afford to isolate
himself from the public and media as he did last month, given his
wide margin of loss in New Hampshire and a series of South Carolina
polls that show McCain pulling even with him in popularity. His
liveliness over the last two days could be as much a result of cool
political strategy as southern sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there are things Bush has not changed a bit.
He exercised in New Hampshire, too. His accent was faded, but
hardly gone. He even went out of his way to show his New England
sportsmanship, riding on snowmobiles and sleds in the days leading
up to the primary.
</P>
<P>
   But it was carried off with none of the ease Bush has exhibited
in recent days. Even in Delaware, where Bush faced friendlier
crowds, he still seemed to bristle at tough questions _ as opposed
to here, where Wednesday he addressed an array of tricky issues,
from the Confederate flag to abortion, with humor and force.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker Eskew, the Bush press secretary for South Carolina,
attributed the signs of southern comfort to the state's ``twangier
aspects _ and I mean that metaphorically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've noticed it from the beginning,'' Eskew said. ``When the
governor's here, he feels at home. He's welcomed. He's energized,
and he's feisty. If Governor Bush were campaigning in Wisconsin I
think we'd see the same degree of energy and optimism...but he's
been coming here since the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush has been coming here since the beginning of his
father's national political career. And in many ways, in the
age-old battle between Yankee politics and the rest of the country,
George W. Bush is far more evolved as a southern politician than
his father ever was.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush _ a Yale and Harvard graduate whose family spends
its summers in Maine _ faced accusations of carpetbagging during
his 1978 congressional run, he has not lived outside the state
since. Unlike his father, Bush spent his childhood years there. His
wife, Laura, was born and raised in Midland, Texas. But more than
anything Bush seems to have an internal southern ethos, one that
crowds in this conservative Republican state appear to respond to.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Nelson offers a striking example.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Nelson, an activist with the New York-based
immigration advocacy group Project USA, traveled to Londonderry,
New Hampshire to ask Bush a question about a particular trend in
legal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was stumped by the question. He paused and stammered. And
it seemed to set the tone for the rest of the town hall meeting:
Bush faced a series of harsh questions from a crowd of undecideds
and independents, many of whom barely clapped.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Nelson was back _ this time at Newberry College, a
small Lutheran school. Again, Nelson, 40, stood to ask Bush about
legal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, had the crowd behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't I see you in New Hampshire?'' he asked. ``I thought you
looked familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the laughter of the crowd, Nelson tried to ask his
question. Bush joked, ``What was my answer last time?'' Then, as
the questioner continued, Bush said: ``Nice to see you. You
through? Yeah, okay. Sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush laughed. Before launching into an explanation of his
views on immigration, he said, ``I'm teasing.'' The crowd roared.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Bush also continued to spar, via the media, with his
chief rival, Arizona Senator John S. McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to a year-old article from The Boston Globe, Bush
quoted McCain as saying he would never take money from a political
action committee during a presidential race. Then he issued a
statement showing more than $300,000 McCain has received in PAC
money so far. (Bush also accepts PAC money, and has raised about
five times as much as McCain, or $1.5 million.)
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, said he was misquoted and has never eschewed
PAC contributions. And he attacked Bush in return, saying that the
Texas governor is an ``unwitting pawn if he won't support reform''
of the campaign finance system. Later in the day, McCain, who came
under fire the day before for releasing what the Bush campaign
described as a negative ad, backed off from the line characterizing
Bush as a pawn.

   MCCAIN-DEMS (Columbia, S.C.) _ Though it is infuriating the
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush, Sen. John McCain has made enormous
strides toward the Republican nomination because of the help of

GERMANY MOVES TO OVERHAUL ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Germany Inc., the tightly knit economic machine that
built this country's postwar prosperity but has struggled of late
to remain competitive, took a giant step Wednesday toward
disbanding itself.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government approved draft
legislation that would slash taxes and open the way for German
corporations, particularly banks and insurance companies, to sell
off the extensive cross-holdings that have tended to hinder the
rise of open competition and a shareholders' culture.
</P>
<P>
   The bold step from the time-honored ``social market'' model
toward one that looks more market dominated clearly reflects the
new-found confidence of the chancellor, a Social Democrat who has
long wavered over economic reform. His popularity has been
increased by a financing scandal that has severely hurt the
Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 18 months into his four-year term, Schroeder is gambling
that his decisive measures to open and deregulate Germany will
revitalize the economy and bring down an unemployment rate that has
stubbornly exceeded 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The reform occurs as Germany's self-image is changing radically.
The crisis of the long-dominant Christian Democratic Party has
created an end-of-era feeling as an elaborate system of hidden
financing has come to light. In general, a new openness seems to be
taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step toward the modernization of the German
economy,'' said Michael Wolghast, senior economist at Deutsche
Bank. ``More transparency, more openness to foreigners, more scope
for private enterprise and the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the draft law, which goes before parliament this month,
corporate taxes would be reduced to 25 percent from the current 40
percent. Personal income taxes would gradually be cut to 15 percent
from 23.9 percent for the lowest-paid and to 45 percent from 53
percent for the wealthiest individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The term Deutschland A.G., or Germany Inc., arose from the
closed system of cross-holdings that saw banks and insurers holding
large stakes and board positions in the most diverse businesses
that in turn resorted to banks for loans rather than going to the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The system has been fortresslike in its hermetic insularity and
almost masonic in its obscurity. Wolghast estimated that the
cross-holdings were worth ``several hundred billion dollars.'' A
precise figure is elusive, because companies have tended to mask
the real worth of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, big corporations had been discouraged from selling
these holdings because they were taxed at a rate of about 60
percent for doing so. The measures approved by the government
Wednesday would eliminate that tax.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a result, it appears inevitable that the character of
Europe's largest economy will change as banks and insurance
companies begin selling their vast holdings and foreigners scour
the German market for opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Shares on the Frankfurt stock exchange, already at record
levels, soared Wednesday on anticipation that a wave of
acquisitions is imminent and that a reinforced chancellor now has
the authority to push the measures through a parliament where he
enjoys a comfortable majority.
</P>
<P>
   German culture has already been shaken in recent weeks by the
takeover of a pillar of the nation's industry, Mannesmann, by
Britain's Vodafone Airtouch, a $178 billion transaction that began
with a hostile bid by the British telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Such hostile corporate practices had long been seen as
Anglo-Saxon or American aberrations, unacceptable in the
traditionally more closed and clubby world of German industry.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by parliament, the measures would lead to an overall
cut in taxes of about $22 billion by 2005, on top of cuts of about
$15 billion already agreed on for this year. With less revenue
coming, and a soaring deficit, the government is sharply cutting
back state spending in a bid to dismantle what it has described as
a ``nanny state.''
</P>
<P>
   Small German industry and some state governments that will lose
tax revenue have been highly critical of the proposals, saying they
are too favorable to big banks and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not right that large insurance companies will take in
billions tax free, while states receive less,'' said Heide Simonis,
the premier of the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein.
</P>
<P>
   Some resistance is also expected from labor unions because the
old system of cross-holdings used to mean that banks often rescued
failing companies that would otherwise go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder now seems to have the conviction and majority to
ensure approval of the draft law. After hesitating for over a year
over what the ``New Middle'' that he promised in his election
campaign might be, he appears to have decided that it lies well to
the right of traditional German social democracy.

CELLUCCI OFFERS STATE-FUNDED SOLUTION FOR `BIG DIG' OVERRUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bracing for a state-funded bailout of the ``Big Dig,''
Governor Paul Cellucci says he will scrap a plan to give
Massachusetts drivers ``lifetime'' licenses, reimposing $33.75
renewal fees to raise cash.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also proposed the state pay off $650 million in
high-interest debt, to improve its fiscal condition in case further
borrowing is needed to meet the soaring costs of the $12.2 billion
project to remodel the city's Central Artery.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci described the measures Wednesday as part of ``an
insurance policy'' should the Big Dig need to be bailed out.
Massachusetts Turnpike, state Treasury and administration officials
are trying to devise a series of measures to close a
recently-announced $1.4 billion funding gap.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, former Governor William F. Weld and then Lieutenant
Governor Cellucci announced they would slash the five-year license
renewal fees from $33.75 to $2, which they said would free drivers
from unnecessarily high fees, creating what they called
``lifetime'' licenses. That plan was supposed to take effect this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci conceded the money from the fees _ expected to be
about $45 million _ is needed, due to the uncertainty of how to pay
for the Central Artery project.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sources told The Boston Globe still more Turnpike and
harbor tunnel toll increases may be announced to raise cash. Those
would be on top of those made public last week: doubling of the
tolls on the easternmost Turnpike extension, and raising harbor
tunnel tolls from $2 to $3 for cars and $3 to $5 for cabs early
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures under consideration include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cashing in earlier than planned on a Big Dig insurance
investment account worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   -- Using $100 million in cash from another turnpike account and
borrowing against those funds.
</P>
<P>
   -- Borrowing against revenue generated by the future sale of air
rights for development over the turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hasn't been ironed out is which ones do you do?'' said
one source with a seat at the negotiating table, adding that other
toll hikes may prove the the least politically popular, and
therefore the least likely, solution.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also said Wednesday he was told last autumn there could
be a Big Dig funding shortfall, but did not make the information
public because there were no precise numbers to share at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Turnpike Chairman James Kerasiotes warned him
broadly the pricetag of the project, then publicly reported at
$10.8 billion, was growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody knew the extent of it,'' Cellucci added.
``But we were straightforward with the people on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, State Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien said Wednesday if
Kerasiotes knew of the cost overruns earlier and did not disclose
them, ``that's fairly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the project's $1.4 billion shortfall was announced last
week, Cellucci has repeatedly said the Massachusetts Turnpike
Authority could handle the financing of the massive project it
oversees. The governor's remarks Wednesday signaled he may be
preparing to provide major state aid to the highway project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like the turnpike to be able to manage this,''
Cellucci said. ``But I'm not sure that gap can be closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he would reinstate the drivers' license fees this
week. The reinstatement does not require legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, the governor would need the Legislature to sign off on
the plan to use the $650 million in state funds to pay down some of
Massachusetts' debt load, which is so large it ranks third-highest
in the nation per capita.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's pay-down plan would draw $150 million from the
state's capital reserve fund _ which usually pays for emergency
repairs to buildings or bridges _ and between $200 million and $500
million from this year's expected budget surplus. Paying off the
higher-interest debt would save as much as $800 million in
principal and interest.
</P>
<P>
   Some saw the plan as a sign the governor could be bracing for an
even greater Big Dig shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests they are also apprehensive about further cost
overruns or want to be prepared for further cost overruns so they
can go to the (bond) rating agencies and have contingency plans,''
said Michael Widmer, executive director of the Massachusetts
Taxpayers Foundation, a fiscal watchdog group. Cellucci also said
he would still push for his $1.1 billion income tax cut on the
November ballot this year. However, saying the state could not
afford both, he denounced another ballot initiative that would give
motorists credits on their income tax for money spent annually on
tolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've reluctantly concluded we can't do both at the same
time,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the firestorm Wednesday, Cellucci's budget secretary,
Andrew Natsios, said Metro West commuters who drive to high-paying
Boston jobs could easily carry the burden of higher tolls.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators from towns west of Boston are attempting to rally
their colleagues to block toll increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can afford it,'' he said.

MALFUNCTION THREATENS TO DOOM A KEY SCIENTIFIC SATELLITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The largest U.S. scientific satellite, the 17-ton Compton Gamma
Ray Observatory, is in danger of premature death.
</P>
<P>
   After nine years in orbit, its instruments are still producing
floods of data about the most violent phenomena in the distant
universe, and probably could keep going for years. But one of the
spacecraft's three gyroscopes, which help keep the craft level, has
failed. Flight controllers may have to destroy the $600 million
Compton observatory before it loses another gyroscope and thus
becomes a possible hazard to populated areas when, uncontrollable,
it eventually dives through the atmosphere at the end of its useful
life.
</P>
<P>
   So NASA must make a difficult decision later this month: if
engineers cannot come up with a reliable alternative way to control
the atmospheric re-entry without one or both of the remaining
gyroscopes, the otherwise fully operational Compton observatory
will be commanded to make a controlled suicidal plunge back to
Earth in late March or April.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately seeking to save the spacecraft, flight controllers
and engineers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.,
are studying two promising methods for orienting the spacecraft in
the event of further gyroscope failures. One is to stabilize the
spacecraft by sending it into a slow spin before a re-entry
maneuver. Another is to rely on Sun sensors and magnetometers,
instead of gyroscopes, in orienting the spacecraft for re-entry.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Hubble Space Telescope, the Compton observatory was
not built to be serviced by visiting astronauts in the space
shuttle. In December, astronauts delivered new gyroscopes, among
other replacement parts, to the Hubble.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers expressed cautious optimism about the prospects of
coming up with an acceptable spacecraft-saving plan in time for a
meeting with NASA officials Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Kniffen, the deputy program scientist for the Compton
project, called both options ``realistic ideas,'' but said that
engineers might be hard pressed to develop and test the procedures
for such maneuvers before time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to take any risk on safety,'' Kniffen said in
an interview. ``If Goddard can't have tested procedures in place by
April, then the Compton will have to be brought down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The gyroscope failure, which occurred in December, has not
affected the spacecraft's normal operations. Even if a second one
failed, Kniffen said, Sun sensors and the magnetometer could be
used to orient the spacecraft for astronomical observations.
</P>
<P>
   But mission safety rules dictate that flight controllers must
always have the ability to direct the spacecraft's re-entry where
they want to, over a remote ocean far from people.
</P>
<P>
   Even though nearly all of the truck-size spacecraft would burn
up in the atmosphere, some debris could survive and be dangerous,
as in the case of a Soviet satellite that scattered wreckage over
Canada's Northwest Territories. The preferred aiming point for the
Compton, if it comes to that, would be in the wide, landless spaces
of the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an enormous loss,'' said Dr. Kevin Hurley, a
gamma-ray astronomer at the University of California at Berkeley
who is chairman of the Compton's scientific users' committee.
</P>
<P>
   Launched by a space shuttle in April 1991, the observatory has
already outlived its planned lifetime by seven years. It gave
astronomers their most sensitive and comprehensive views thus far
of the powerful radiations at the most energetic end of the
electromagnetic spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   The Compton provided the first reliable clues on the true nature
of those mystifying flashes of energy known as gamma-ray bursts,
some of which appear to come from the most powerful known cosmic
explosions. The spacecraft's four telescopes have also given
scientists new insights into the fascinating phenomenon of black
holes, objects with gravitation forces so power that nothing, not
even light can escape them.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley said the premature loss of the spacecraft would be a blow
to the field of gamma ray astronomy, which has grown and attracted
many young scientists because of the observatory. Although three
small spacecraft for gamma-ray astronomy are close to launching,
none is capable of monitoring the entire sky in the same wide
energy range. A low-cost craft named HETE-II is to be launched this
spring. A more ambitious replacement for the Compton is not
scheduled to be orbited until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers said they had been assured by NASA officials that
the scientific value of the Compton observatory is not being
questioned and that proposals to save the mission were being
thoroughly studied.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion was to raise the orbit of the spacecraft from 300
miles high to 500 miles, which would keep it in space for at least
a century. But this would merely throw the problem in the laps of a
future generation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Serious consideration was also given to the idea of having the
Defense Department shoot down the Compton as target practice for
anti-missile missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was floated and looked at carefully before the
anti-missile test in January failed,'' Kniffen said. ``The idea
died out after that.''

HILLARY CLINTON SCOLDS GIULIANI ON DRIFT TO RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is drifting to the right in an
apparent attempt to lure upstate voters and conservative money
nationwide _ and Hillary Clinton has made an issue of it.
</P>
<P>
   The provocation came with a fund-raising letter, in which
Giuliani wrote, ``Hillary Clinton further revealed her hostility
towards America's religious traditions when she attacked Gov.
George W. Bush's idea that we should look toward America's
faith-based charities more than government programs to address
social problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has shied away from attacking the mayor directly,
but Wednesday she made an exception, telling a crowd in Rochester,
``As a person of faith, I am appalled that he would make false
statements about me and my respect for religion, in order to raise
money for the campaign. ... I am outraged that he would inject
religion into this campaign in any form whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement released by her campaign further noted that Clinton
has never attacked Bush's proposal and that she explicitly supports
social work by religious charities, ``if it is done within the
Constitutional framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Several biographies of Clinton, including harshly critical ones,
have said that her social and political philosophy has roots in her
devout Methodist upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, Giuliani laughed off his opponent's
anger, saying he sent out the letter last October and still stands
by everything it says. ``It's the Clinton campaign that injected it
into the race. ... The reality is, nobody attacked her,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   News of the letter was first published by columnist Wayne
Barrett in Wednesday's Village Voice, then picked up _ and passed
around _ by Clinton's campaigners. Barrett wrote that his father, a
conservative Catholic, received it in the mail at his home in
Virginia last month, shortly before he died.
</P>
<P>
   The letter appears to be part of a general rightward drift that
Giuliani has been pursuing _ at least rhetorically _ since the
Senate campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week he attacked Clinton for playing Billy Joel's
``Captain Jack,'' a song that he described as glorifying the use of
drugs, at her campaign-launching event last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, replied that she did not
choose the song. It was played over the public-address system,
along with other Joel tunes, well before the first lady took the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The drift may have begun in the fall, with his repeated attacks
on the Brooklyn Museum of Art for exhibiting a painting that he
called ``sick'' and ``anti-Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising letter mentions his attempts to stop the
exhibit. The letter also contains various statements that would
surprise many of the mayor's more centrist supporters. For
instance, he complains about judges who ``have banned the posting
of even the Ten Commandments in our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He also states, ``I guess what I'm most angry about is how the
Clintons have attacked and belittled Ronald Reagan and his
legacy.'' He lauds Reagan's military buildup and his ``steadfast
commitment to the SDI anti-missile system.''
</P>
<P>
   The striking thing is that, until the Senate campaign, Giuliani
never tried reaching out to the more conservative wing of the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, Giuliani has outspokenly supported gay rights,
immigration rights, abortion rights, gun control, and even _ in a
departure from his otherwise consistent stance on free-market
economic theory _ rent control.
</P>
<P>
   He has not altered his stance on any of these issues. In fact,
he has resisted pressures from New York state's Conservative Party
to condemn partial-birth abortion. As a result, the chairman of the
Conservative Party, Mike Long, announced Monday he had given up on
offering his party's endorsement to the mayor and would seek
another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1974 has a Republican won statewide office without the
Conservative Party's support. Many independent voters, and even
quite a few Democrats who have problems with Clinton, have admired
the mayor for sticking to these principles.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of these independents may wonder at his adoption
of such Republican rhetoric now.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat, suggested
this may increasingly be a theme in Clinton's campaign. At her
announcement last Sunday, Rangel said New York needs a senator
``who will stand up to Trent Lott and Jesse Helms, not stand with
them.''

 &HT;    Major sporting companies missing from Super Show
 &HT;    By Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once again, some of the biggest names in sporting
goods and apparel will be sitting out the industry's biggest show
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok, Adidas and L.A. Gear are not headliners this year at the
Super Show, which starts today at the Georgia World Congress Center
and Georgia Dome. All three joined Nike in pulling out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, however, has decided to come back this year in a smaller
capacity to showcase its team sports garb. And although Reebok
International Ltd. does not have a booth, the company's Chief
Executive Paul Fireman spoke at a seminar Wednesday, prior to the
Super Show's official opening.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the absence of the big names, Georgia-based companies
still see the show as a prime opportunity to push their businesses
and check out the latest trends. Among them are Athlete's Foot,
Russell Athletic and Collegiate Licensing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``While a number of footwear people have pulled out, the Super
Show still provides us an opportunity to see what's happening in
the marketplace,'' said Robert Corliss, president of Kennesaw-based
Athlete's Foot Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlete's Foot has been named ``Trendsetter of the Year'' by
Sports Trend magazine, a trade publication in New York. The
magazine picked the company mostly because the chain with 700
stores is growing at a time when the industry isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Athlete's Foot had strong sales gains, and in metro Atlanta
alone the company added five new stores last year. At least six are
planned in 2000. Athlete's Foot will receive the award tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of major manufacturers should not cut into Super
Show attendance, said Mike May, a spokesman with the Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association, which sponsors the event. About 80,000
people are expected to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting goods manufacturers of apparel and equipment are
planning to preview their newest products and technologies,
merchandise that should hit store shelves over the next six months.
Retailers and their buyers, which make up 65 percent of attendees,
come to see the latest trends. Tommy Hilfiger is showing up for the
first time. The active wear designer has erected a
10,000-square-foot booth _ one of the largest at the show. The
company has its name etched on everything from sunglasses to
running outfits. The brand, now a household name, has become
popular with teens.
</P>
<P>
   Hilfiger's big push into sports products and large presence at
the show could be yet another sign of the shift in consumer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Its success comes at a time when other prominent names in the
sporting goods industry struggle. Chains such as Sports Town, Just
For Feet and JumboSports have gone out of business. Others,
including Venator's Foot Locker stores, are closing underperforming
locations. The downsizing has hurt the business of big
manufacturers like Nike.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Show runs through Sunday.

EX-ARGENTINE SOCCER STAR MAKES NEWS AGAIN, NOW IN CUBA

<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Diego Maradona, once the sensation of
the soccer world, was on the cover of one of Argentina's most
prominent political magazines, Noticias, last week. He looked
vastly overweight, his hair was dyed orange, and there was a huge
tattoo of Che Guevara on his right arm. Beside him was the
headline, ``Therapy Cuba Style.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Maradona, now 39, has made some of the biggest
headlines of his long soap-opera career. His choice of Havana for
his recovery from heart problems and cocaine addiction is viewed as
something of a propaganda victory for Fidel Castro's government and
its claims of superior medical services. His newest troubles have
prompted a new anti-drug publicity campaign by the government here.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, Maradona is at the center of the intersection of
Argentina's fast tracks of soccer, celebrity, politics and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona has been almost as much a political as a sports figure
in Argentina since the 1995 presidential campaign, when he appeared
in television advertisements and on the stump for President Carlos
Saul Menem, giving a vital push to his come from behind re-election
victory. Maradona and his manager, Guillermo Coppola, had close
relations with high officials in the Menem administration and
Menem's adult children, until Coppola was arrested on drug charges
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   So when Maradona said in a radio interview from Cuba the other
day, ``I would accept living with only half a heart in exchange for
seeing my country fully recover from bad government officials,''
his words were taken by commentators as a confession of someone in
the know.
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly a coincidence, but the very next day a former
federal judge, Hernan Bernasconi, was arrested on an Argentine
warrant in Brazil on charges of criminal association and
malfeasance involving his investigation of Coppola. At Coppola's
trial last year, it was determined that law-enforcement officers
who were working under Bernasconi had planted cocaine in a vase in
Coppola's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Coppola was exonerated, and Bernasconi was impeached and fled
the country as a fugitive. But Bernasconi says history will judge
him more kindly, and he told Clarin, the Buenos Aires newspaper,
from his Brazilian prison cell over the weekend, ``I am working
with some sociologists on a very detailed investigation into drugs
and power'' in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona has long admitted to having cocaine-addiction problems,
and in the early 1990s he was suspended from soccer twice for 15
months for drug use.
</P>
<P>
   His latest problems began just after the New Year's weekend,
when he was admitted to an intensive care unit of a Uruguayan
hospital with hypertension and an irregular heartbeat. Blood and
urine samples tested positive for cocaine, and the Uruguayan police
are investigating where Maradona obtained the drug.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to Cuba three weeks ago, he explained his choice as
a matter of solidarity with the Cuban revolution.
</P>
<P>
   On arriving at Havana, he said, ``I chose Cuba because of the
dignity of its people.'' Later in an interview with Radio Rebelde,
he said, ``I too am a rebel in this convoluted world.''
</P>
<P>
   With Buenos Aires in the dog days of summer and the political
and business elite away on vacation, the media void was filled with
rumors of about when Maradona and Castro would meet and what they
might talk about. The Cuban press coverage has been muted.
</P>
<P>
   But it took Maradona only a few days in Cuba to make headlines
by smashing a foreign journalist's car window with his fist after
having complained that reporters and photographers were following
him.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando de la Rua, inaugurated in December, is trying
to use the publicity surrounding Maradona's treatment to step up
efforts against a growing drug problem in Argentina's cities. Two
weeks ago, the federal government covered walls around Buenos Aires
with stark black-and-white posters that simply say, ``Damned
Cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, de la Rua agreed to meet Maradona's two young
daughters, Dalma and Yanina, who have asked that he speed the
paperwork on their passports so they can visit their father in
Havana as soon as possible. De la Rua said he would see what he
could do.

 &HT;    Lauren takes his drama darkly elegant
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ralph Lauren showed a fall 2000 collection Wednesday
laden with clothes the color of charcoal. When they weren't
charcoal, they were black. (Forty of the 59 outfits modeled in
Lauren's SoHo store were entirely, or predominantly, black.)
</P>
<P>
   When he went for color it was in muted tones: moss green, brown,
wine and dusky gold. Missing in this latest assortment of tailored
suits, pencil straight skirts, cushy sweaters and form-fitting
leathers were the invigorating colors like red and yellow Lauren
usually injects into his collections.
</P>
<P>
   The collection, he said, shows ``a modern sort of elegance that
is as sure as it is discreet.'' It was also for the wispy woman:
pants fit snug from the hips to the ankle; jackets cropped just
below the navel; knee-length skirts featuring high-gloss, skinny
belts meant to elongate the figure, not exaggerate its proportions.
</P>
<P>
   The collection's sense of adventure came from Lauren's interplay
of fabrics: Donegal tweeds, broadtail sheepskin, crocodile, marabou
and tapestried velvet all worked their way into the mix.
</P>

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS WINFREY'S WIN OVER TEXAS CATTLEMEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television talk show host Oprah Winfrey has won her second legal
battle against Texas cattlemen and her attorney speculated that the
war may finally be over.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans on
Wednesday upheld a jury's verdict that a Winfrey show about mad cow
disease did not defame cattle producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the decision,'' said Charles Babcock, the
Dallas attorney who defended Winfrey in an Amarillo federal
courtroom two years ago. ``They could appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court, but I can't imagine what in this case the Supreme Court
would have the slightest bit of interest in.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Isern, one of the attorneys for the Panhandle cattlemen
who sued Winfrey after a guest on her show alleged that American
beef was susceptible to mad cow disease, said he has not seen the
appellate court ruling, but would meet soon with his clients to
discuss their next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously disappointed,'' he said. ``But, we gained a
lot of ground with regard to the disparagement statue and that
could be a factor in whether we go on.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show aired, the cattle market in the Texas Panhandle
dropped significantly and remained depressed for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The cattlemen sued under an untested state statute known as the
Texas ``veggie libel'' law, which was written to protect food
products from false disparagement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson ruled, however, that the
case could not be tried under that statute, but would have to be
litigated as a conventional business defamation lawsuit, where the
standard of proof was much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Edith Jones of the 5th Circuit wrote that while she agreed
with the rest of the opinion absolving Winfrey of defamation, she
believes that cattle should be covered by the vegetable protection
law.
</P>
<P>
   However, Babcock said that because Jones agreed with the general
verdict, her opinion about the extent of the ``veggie libel'' law
cannot be used by the cattlemen to petition the appeals court to
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the appellate court agreed with the Amarillo,
Texas, jury that while the Winfrey show contained alarming opinions
and arguments about the safety of beef, the show did not contain
false statement and the opinions were based on fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stripped to its essentials, the cattlemen's complaint is that
the `Dangerous Food' show did not present the mad cow issue in the
light most favorable to United States beef,'' the court said.
``This argument cannot stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said the higher court's ruling ``reaffirmed the right
people have to opinions and they don't have to suffer liability for
those opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also is a reaffirmation of the fact that editing is what
editors are for,'' he said, ``and there is no obligation to edit in
a way that is most pleasing to cattlemen. It says the legal system
will not second-guess editing.''

COMMENTARY: LOOKING FOR VOTES ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wave goodbye to that fantasy of a more inclusive Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and John McCain have planted themselves on the
wrong side of the Confederate flag issue. And last week, there was
Bush in Greenville, S.C., happily touting ``our ideas, Republican
ideas, conservative ideas'' at Bob Jones University, which
maintains its perverse rules against the mingling of races and its
disgusting hostility to the Catholic religion.
</P>
<P>
   Love is fine at BJU as long as it doesn't cross the color line.
Bush's brother and sister-in-law _ Jeb Bush, the governor of
Florida, and his Mexican-born wife, Columba _ would have been
condemned and expelled from Bob Jones for having dared to fall in
love and marry.
</P>
<P>
   Nice place.
</P>
<P>
   The former head of the university, Bob Jones Jr., engaged in an
astonishing series of attacks on Catholics in the 1980s, asserting
that ``all the popes are demon-possessed'' and that Pope John Paul
II was ``the greatest danger we face today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The papacy,'' he said, ``is the religion of Antichrist and is
a satanic system.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday I asked a spokesman for the university, Jonathan
Pait, if the school had ever repudiated Jones' statements, or
backed off of them in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pait, ``There is a disagreement about what the
Bible teaches between Catholicism and Protestantism. And the
university takes a very strong stand that Protestantism is the
correct interpretation of Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked about interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is to be no interracial dating,'' he said. ``That is the
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked why the policy had been established, he replied,
``Because there is a held belief from way back in the institution
that that was biblically wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones has black students, but Pait said he didn't know how
many. He said the ban on interracial dating did not imply that the
school loved any of its students less. ``It doesn't matter to us
what The Washington Post or The New York Times thinks,'' he said.
``It's when I can look my black or Oriental or Indian or whatever
color brother or sister in Christ in the eyes and say, `I love
you.' That's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign appearance at Bob Jones reminded me of Ronald
Reagan's first major appearance in the 1980 general election.
Reagan chose to kick off his presidential bid in Philadelphia,
Miss., which just happened to have been the place where three civil
rights workers _ Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and James Chaney
_ were murdered in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   During that appearance Reagan told his audience, ``I believe in
states' rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's entanglement in the Confederate flag issue is not limited
to the controversy over the flag that flies over the Statehouse in
Columbia, S.C. Bush has his own controversy back home. Complaints
have erupted over displays of the rebel flag in public buildings in
Texas, including some public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the Confederate battle flag like to characterize it
as a cherished symbol of a benevolent and oh-so-civilized Southern
past, rather than a banner representing the twin abominations of
slavery and race hatred. They might want to take a look at the
Texas Ordinance of Secession, dated Feb. 2, 1861.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance declares that Texas was received into the
Confederated States ``as a commonwealth holding, maintaining and
protecting the institution known as negro slavery _ the servitude
of the African to the white race within her limits _ a relation
that had existed from the first settlement of her wilderness by the
white race, and which her people intended should exist in all
future time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance said Texas' ``institutions and geographical
position established the strongest ties between her and other
slave-holding States of the confederacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Benign?
</P>
<P>
   Civilized?
</P>
<P>
   For many years the Republican Party has been a haven for
reactionary, right-wing and racist elements in the society. Many of
its candidates have pandered to those elements.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much in the way of change that can be perceived on
the horizon.

BRADLEY, GORE SPAR OVER EDUCATION PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSITY CITY, Mo. _ Bill Bradley, who has been criticized for
weeks over his lack of a comprehensive education plan, proposed
Wednesday nearly $14 billion a year in new federal spending to
improve schools. He also ridiculed Vice President Al Gore's
education record as mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in turn, said that Bradley had been absent from the
education debate for months, and that Bradley had effectively
stolen some of his core initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, speaking to several hundred students and teachers in a
St. Louis suburb, not far from his boyhood home in Crystal City,
Mo., said his plan would require teachers to be fully qualified,
would hold schools accountable for meeting performance standards,
and would grant parents access to information about a school's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In his riskiest move, Bradley called for permitting parents to
withdrawtheir children from substandard public schools and enroll
them in better ones.
</P>
<P>
   But he stopped short of endorsing vouchers to permit public
school students to attend private schools. Gore has criticized
Bradley for supporting the plan on an experimental basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past seven years, we've heard a lot of talk about
education, but too often the rhetoric hasn't been backed up by
action,'' Bradley told the audience at University City High School.
``In far too many schools in this country, there is what amounts to
educational malpractice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded from Southfield, Mich., where he visited a
preschool and filled in the details of his plan to offer families
help in paying college tuition as part of his previously announced
$115 billion, 10-year education plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan, called the National Tuition Savings Program, would
allow individuals to buy an ``insurance policy'' that would lock in
the cost of today's college tuition at tomorrow's prices. Many
states already have such tuition savings programs, but Gore's plan
would make the accounts portable or interchangeable from state to
state, and would cover tuition costs at any participating public or
private college or university.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make it easier for parents to pay college
tuition,'' Gore told a couple of dozen parents, teachers, and
preschoolers at the Bussey Center for Early Childhood Education.
Gore was acerbic about Bradley's education initiative. ``Fourteen
months have passed in this presidential campaign and three states
have had elections now, and only today, for the first time in 14
months has Senator Bradley made his first speech on education,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, in a news conference after his speech, denied that he
had unveiled the education plan in response to Iowa and New
Hampshire exit polls that showed voters consider education to be a
top priority and Gore to be better able to address it. Bradley said
he had ``planned all along'' to stake out several major policy
positions in the five weeks between the New Hampshire primary and
the 15-state ``national primary'' on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when the country is actually paying attention to what
someone who would be president would do,'' Bradley said. ``This is
the best time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley reiterated his criticism of Gore for proposing greater
increases for the Pentagon than the federal education budget, and
said Clinton-Gore administration had a lackluster record on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last seven years haven't exactly brought revolutionary
changes to education,'' Bradley said. ``When you look at the cold
hard results, we still have too much mediocrity, too much failure,
and too much status quo in our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Bradley's plan calls for doubling funding for
Title I aid to low-income schools to $16 billion to $8 billion.
Under the plan, schools that receive the funding must raise student
testing standards and close the achievement gap between whites and
minorities within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each school would be required to provide parents with a ``report
card'' on its performance and the qualifications of its faculty.
And parents whose children attend poorly ranked schools would be
permitted to transfer to other public schools of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said some of the students who leave inadequate public
schools could transfer to public charter schools, for which he
proposed $500 million, more than triple the current budget of $145
million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley did not advocate vouchers. Gore, who has the support of
the nation's two largest teachers unions, the National Education
Association and the American Federation of Teachers, again
criticized Bradley Wednesday for voting for experiments with school
vouchers, an anthema to teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   The record shows that Gore indeed opposed school vouchers as a
member of Congress, while Bradley supported them seven times in
votes that always failed. But though Gore champions himself as
leader on education in Congress, only four of the 300 pieces of
legislation he introduced in his 16 years in the House and Senate
concerned education.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bradley sponsored 37 pieces of education
legislation among his 563 measures over the course of 18 years in
the Senate. Bradley repeatedly proposed resolutions and amendments
to increase the amount of Pell Grants awards to poor college
students and to restore cuts in education spending. Gore signed on
as a co-sponsor for two of Bradley's measures.

SEN. KENNEDY HAS PNEUMONIA, BUT WILL BE RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has been
hospitalized since Sunday with flu-like symptoms, has bacterial
pneumonia but is well enough to be released Thursday, his doctor
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's physician, Dr. Mark Abbruzzese, said the pneumonia was
diagnosed Wednesday and developed after Kennedy was stricken with a
viral infection that caused muscle aches, fever and chills.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Senator Kennedy was admitted, his X-rays were normal,''
Abbruzzese said Wednesday about the development of the pneumonia.
``Cultures, which were taken over time, were positive. This is a
normal progression.''
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old senator, who earlier had received a flu shot,
had no fever Wednesday for the first time since Sunday, Abbruzzese
said, and so he can be discharged from Sibley Memorial Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is taking antibiotics for his illness, and his bacterial
infection is not resistant to the medication, which is why the
senator is ``responding nicely,'' Abbruzzese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is already well on his way to recovery, but he will have to
rest for a few days,'' Abbruzzese said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's schedule this week is uncertain, said spokesman Will
Keyser. A conference committee that includes Kennedy had to
postpone a meeting on the patient's bill of rights legislation
until the week of Feb. 28, Keyser said.

AS HIJACKING ENTERS 4TH NIGHT, BRITISH POLICE SEE NO PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANSTED, England _ For a moment Wednesday afternoon, a handful
of hijackers emerged from the Afghan airliner parked forlornly on a
remote runway here. But it was a choreographed excursion, the
police said, for the simple purpose of collecting sandwiches to
feed the 150 or so people who are now spending their fourth night
on board.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers seized the Ariana Airlines Boeing 727 shortly
after it took off from Kabul on Sunday night, and forced it on a
hectic journey across central Asia and Russia before landing here,
outside London. They have made no political demands, the police
said, and negotiations have continued inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more optimistic than we were 12 hours ago,'' said Joe
Edwards, an assistant chief constable with the Essex police.
``Negotiations are where they should be, and we will carry on
talking as long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   The police confirmed that the four people who escaped on Tuesday
night by breaking the cockpit window and lowering themselves down a
rope were members of the crew: the captain, second captain, first
officer, and a flight engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, the police had been in near-constant radio
contact with the hijackers, who speak English and are believed to
number about 10. The hijackers cut off communications in the middle
of the night, though, apparently out of anger over the escape. At
one point, they pushed a steward out of the plane. He suffered a
minor cut on his head.
</P>
<P>
   At around 6 a.m., the police said, the hijackers, who appear to
be armed with handguns, started communicating again. ``Now we must
set about restoring the trust that we had and developing a rapport
again,'' said John Broughton, another assistant chief constable.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton insisted that the escape had not made matters worse.
``Any people who are released from the aircraft represent a
positive step,'' he told reporters in one of the department's
regular briefings at the airport police station.
</P>
<P>
   About nine crew members are left on board but the police said
they did not know whether any knew how to operate it, should the
hijackers suddenly demand to leave Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A representative from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
Hope Hanish, arrived at the airport on Tuesday night, but the
British government would not comment on speculation that the
hijackers were seeking asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Broughton said it was best not to speculate about motives. ``It
is possible that they may be listening to a radio, or that some
passengers have mobile phones,'' he said. ``We will not do anything
to put these people at risk.''

ISRAELI SECURITY SERVICE ABUSED PRISONERS UNDER INTERROGATION,
REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ An official report made public Wednesday said
Israel's Shin Bet security service had committed systematic abuses
while interrogating prisoners during the Palestinian uprising and
that its agents had lied about their actions in court.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, covering 1988 to 1992, appear to lend support to
longstanding assertions by prisoners and human rights groups that
the Shin Bet routinely mistreated Palestinian detainees, using
methods defined by the groups as torture.
</P>
<P>
   The scathing report, submitted in 1995 by the Israeli
comptroller at the time, Miriam Ben-Porat, was kept secret since
its presentation to a parliamentary subcommittee on intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   But following a recommendation by the Israeli Supreme Court, the
subcommittee released a summary of the report Wednesday, asserting
that there were no longer grounds for secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the court banned interrogation methods that human
rights groups have called torture, including violent shaking,
shackling in painful positions and covering the head with a
foul-smelling sack. Those methods had been sanctioned by a
government commission in 1987 as permissible forms of ``moderate
physical pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's report said that during the uprising,
interrogators regularly went further, violating the commission's
guidelines and the Shin Bet's own interrogation rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Shin Bet interrogation facility in Gaza, deviations
went on on a wide scale,'' the report said. ``There were also
deviations in other facilities to a certain extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The report added that ``veteran and even senior interrogators in
the Gaza facility committed serious and systematic deviations''
from the rules that had not been prevented by Shin Bet directors.
</P>
<P>
   Some interrogators ``lied during testimony before courts or
other investigative authorities, and there were those who lied in
reporting to superiors and to others in the Shin Bet,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The assertion by senior Shin Bet officials that truthfulness was
rigorously enforced in the agency ``was found to have no basis in
fact,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   During the uprising, assertions by Palestinians tried in
military courts that their confessions had been extracted under
torture were routinely denied by Shin Bet interrogators and
rejected by judges.
</P>
<P>
   Shin Bet chiefs did not put a stop to the abuses or punish the
offenders, reflecting ``effective acceptance of the deviations from
what was permitted during interrogation,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``Those responsible for the entire organization failed
seriously in their duty of carrying out Shin Bet activity according
to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Uzi Landau, a legislator from the rightist Likud party who
serves on the intelligence subcommittee, said there was no longer
any need to keep the report secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The comptroller's report deals with 10 years ago,'' he said.
``I have no doubt that under the current head of the Shin Bet, a
serious effort has been made to uproot these phenomena.''

 &HT;    Fashion as a media event
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Picture 2,000 members of the press _ including 500
photographers _ descending on New York City and you'll have some
idea of the frenzy here this week as the American fashion industry
kicks off its fall season. Shows are scheduled every hour on the
hour _ beginning at 9 a.m. and ending at 10 p.m. Parties go on
until 1 a.m. nightly. The event is known as ``7th on Sixth''
because New York's fashion district is located on Seventh Avenue;
the runway shows are on Sixth Avenue at Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   THEY LOOKED MARVELOUS
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's press kickoff was the first private party to be
held at the new Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American
Museum of Natural History. I spent quite a while talking to a group
of models hired for the occasion who were wearing outlandish
futuristic outfits they'd created themselves: One wore rubber,
metal and spikes; another just a G-string and some strategically
placed shiny beads. It wasn't until the next day that I learned
they were all men.
</P>
<P>
   DRESSING WELL IS THE BEST REVENGE
</P>
<P>
   It took me a minute to realize the pretty woman I was sitting
alone with in the VIP lounge was Ivana Trump. The lady in me
thought it best to give the woman her privacy, but the reporter in
me won out and I asked if we could chat for a while _ on the
record. Trump says she attends the shows to support her favorite
designers in New York, England and Paris, check off the fashions
she likes best, then makes an appointment at the showrooms to place
her order. She comes back a couple of months later for fittings.
``Somebody's got to do it,'' she laughed. She's a size 6 on the
bottom, 8 on the top.
</P>
<P>
   HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE WRIGHT BROTHERS?
</P>
<P>
   You won't get into any show without flashing your invitation:
The process is complicated and time-consuming. It begins with a
registration form followed by faxed requests to each designer. If
you're from a smaller city, like Dayton, you need to keep following
up with lots of phone calls. Begging sometimes helps.
</P>
<P>
   STRIKE A POSE
</P>
<P>
   At one of the Saturday morning shows, a model stopped midway
down the runway to answer her ringing cell phone. ``Honey, I can't
talk to you now. I'm on the runway doing the Pierre Garroudi
show,'' she said with great irritation. ``I'll see you later!''
Then she resumed her poker face and continued down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT, NO CLOTHES?
</P>
<P>
   There are three good reasons why it's preferable to have a seat
at a runway show. First, it's nice to sit down and get a load off
your feet. Second, you'll probably have a better view of the
fashions. Third, there's the goodie bags. Along with a program,
there's often a treat waiting on your chair: cookies, candy, a
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   STAR POWER
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities are always seated front row-center. You know
someone's been spotted when there's a sudden rush of photographers
around them. Bryant Gumbel and Danny Aiello showed up for Joseph
Abboud; at the Sean John show (he's Sean ``Puffy'' Combs), celebs
included Lil' Kim, Missy Elliot, director John Singleton, Russell
Simmons and his wife Kimora Lee, Andre Hurrell, rapper Jay Z and
Patrick Ewing. Jennifer Lopez was at a ``Saturday Night Live''
dress rehearsal.

DETENTION OF MUSLIM BUSINESSWOMAN IN CHINA PROMPTS U.S. INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Okla.)  (js) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Frustrated after six months of fruitless inquiries to
Chinese officials, U.S. legislators are mounting a public campaign
on behalf of a prominent Muslim businesswoman from China's Far West
who was jailed on vague charges of revealing state intelligence to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Rebiya Kadeer, 53, was detained Aug. 11 in Urumqi,
the capital of Xinjiang province, where she owned a department
store and a trading company. She was picked up just before she was
to meet visiting congressional staff members, who had invited her
to a private dinner. Later, two of her sons and her secretary were
detained.
</P>
<P>
   One son was released after three days. The other, accused of
supporting subversive activities, was sent without trial to a labor
camp for two years. The secretary was sentenced to three years in a
labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   Kadeer's trial was delayed and may take place in the next few
weeks, her family has been told.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Kadeer had been officially touted as a rags-to-riches
inspiration for her fellow members of the Uighur ethnic group. Now,
her arrest has highlighted China's troubled relations with the
Uighur Muslims, who are a dwindling majority in the province as
ethnic Chinese move in, and have been struggling to assert their
national identity.
</P>
<P>
   Kadeer's arrest has been condemned by international legal
monitors, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International,
because the case appears to be flimsy and the real target appears
to be her husband, Sidik Rouzi. He is an Uighur nationalist who
fled to the United States in 1996 and made radio broadcasts
critical of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The son who was detained and released in August, Alim Abdiryim,
asserted in an interview from Urumqi last week that his mother and
his imprisoned brother, Ablikim Abdiryim, 26, had done nothing more
than send published local newspaper articles about Uighur affairs
to their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was arrested because she was one of the most patriotic
members of our Uighur nationality and one of the people most
willing to help the poor,'' said Abdiryim, who is 24. ``The other
reason was because of my father, who they said was engaged in
counterrevolutionary activities in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Kadeer had been about to meet with the congressional
staff members, who were on an official tour, when she was arrested,
several U.S. senators and representatives have followed the case
closely.
</P>
<P>
   But letters and meetings with Chinese officials have yielded no
explanations. So Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., plans to seek wide
support this week for a congressional resolution calling on the
Chinese to release Kadeer, her son and secretary, and calling for a
U.N. human rights investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Roth, as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, will manage
the key trade legislation seeking permanent normal trade status for
China in connection with China's entry into the World Trade
Organization. He has strongly supported China's entry into the
trade body, but said he had been frustrated by Chinese stonewalling
on the Kadeer case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months of quiet diplomacy has achieved nothing,'' Roth
said in an interview Sunday, adding that he was worried by
indications that Kadeer would soon be put on trial. A guilty
verdict in Chinese security trials is virtually preordained.
Depending on how the court defines her transgression, Kadeer could
receive anywhere from a short sentence to more than 10 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   A separate resolution calling for the release of Kadeer, her son
and secretary was introduced last week by Sen. Paul Wellstone, a
Democrat from Minnesota and a frequent critic of China's human
rights policies.
</P>
<P>
   Splintered and lacking an internationally recognized leader like
the Tibetans' Dalai Lama, Uighur nationalists have received
relatively little international attention.
</P>
<P>
   Security forces in Xinjiang have periodically battled members of
a small, armed separatist movement that seeks an independent East
Turkestan, and scores of Uighur militants have been executed in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Chinese are also struggling to contain a much broader
effort by Uighurs to strengthen their sense of identity and their
economic status in the face of domination by ethnic Chinese and the
Communist Party. Outspoken intellectuals like Rouzi have been
jailed or have gone into exile, and publications about Uighur
history and conditions are tightly controlled.

   In the mid-1990s, Kadeer was praised as a bootstrap millionaire.
Born in poverty, married at 15, she amassed a trading fortune even
as she reared ten children.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party held her up as a product of its enlightened
ethnic policies. She was appointed to the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Congress, a prestigious national advisory
body, and was delegate to the U.N. conference on women, held in
Beijing in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Her star apparently began to fall after her husband left for
political asylum in the United States in 1996. Rouzi had been
imprisoned in the late 1960s for his role in an anti-Chinese
demonstration, he said in an interview last week from Oklahoma,
where he now lives. Then, in the mid-1990s, he published two
articles in Urumqi newspapers criticizing Chinese treatment of
Uighurs.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing arrest, in 1996 he moved to the United States. He
angered authorities further by broadcasting nationalistic messages
on Uighur-language programs of the Voice of America and Radio Free
Asia, U.S.-sponsored networks beaming into China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Kadeer's passport was revoked and the authorities froze
the funds of an organization she had started to aid Muslim
businesswomen. In 1998, she was removed from the national
consultative conference and publicly castigated for failing to
condemn her husband's broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was never involved in politics,'' Rouzi said last week of
his wife. ``But she loves the Uighur people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rouzi said he had stopped his radio broadcasts. Five of their
children live in the United States, while the other five remain in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Rouzi said the family had been told that Kadeer's case would be
brought to trial soon after the Chinese New Year holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The freed son, Alim Abdiryim, said relatives had been allowed to
visit their mother only once, on Jan. 5. ``She was in poor spirits
and said, `I'm innocent, get me out of here,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after her arrest, he said, the authorities said she had
been charged with providing foreign organizations with state
secrets and intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother is simply a businesswoman,'' Abdiryim said. ``She
doesn't know anything about state secrets or intelligence.''

 &HT;    One long victory lap: Six reasons why Tiger Woods' has won six
in a row
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ OK, it's getting ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Even Michael Jordan missed a shot at the buzzer once in a while.
</P>
<P>
   When will Tiger Woods lose a golf tournament? Is that your final
answer?
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Regis, your show already is outdated. Who wants to be
a billionaire? Surely it's Woods, who has won six PGA Tour events
in a row to tie Ben Hogan's 1948 number for the second-longest
streak and keep alive a quest to match Byron Nelson's record of 11
consecutive victories in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   And then what? A run at DiMaggio's 56 in a row?
</P>
<P>
   The next stop is La Jolla, Calif., beginning today in the Buick
Invitational at Torrey Pines Golf Club. Woods, the defending
champion, is the favorite on a course that rewards long hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The streak Woods kept alive so incredibly Monday at Pebble
Beach, where he came from seven shots back with seven holes to
play, has pushed the 24-year-old phenom into near super-human
status.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, while almost half of the CBS affiliates chose not to
televise the final round from Pebble Beach, more than 16 million
hits were recorded on PGATour.com during a five-hour stretch.
That's quadruple the usual amount.
</P>
<P>
   London bookmaker William Hill has cut the odds from 200-1 to
80-1 for Woods to win the Grand Slam _ all of golf's four major
championships _ this year.
</P>
<P>
   He has been installed as a 5-2 favorite to win the Masters; 3-1
at the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach; 3-1 for the British Open at St.
Andrews; and 3-1 at the PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club in
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Woods closed with a 64 on Monday, including a holed-out, 97-yard
wedge for an eagle on the 15th hole, to win by two shots. Matt
Gogel and Vijay Singh tied for second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've messed up coming down the stretch, but I also have the
confidence to know I've come from behind and edged someone out,''
Woods said. He has won eight times in a row when he is within five
shots of the final-round lead. ``You don't get as nervous knowing
you've done it before,'' he said. ``You know the feelings, know how
to handle them.''
</P>
<P>
   Since turning pro in August 1996, Woods has played in 72 events
and won 17. Since last fall, he has won all six PGA Tour events he
has entered. Taking the feat worldwide, he has won nine of 10 and
11 of his past 14 since the Memorial last June, including the
individual title at the World Cup and the PGA Grand Slam of Golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Arnold Palmer told The Golf Channel. ``He's
drawing a line, and it's going to be tough for anyone, as I see it,
to touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything that you said wasn't quite possible, he has pretty
much done,'' Sea Island's Davis Love III said. Love's $31,519 lead
over Woods on the career money list seems likely to be erased this
weekend
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a gift, like Nicklaus or Jordan,'' instructor Jim
McLean said. ``The great players _ they want the ball. It's so
obvious. He has that thing where he can make things happen that
seem impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen reasons make Tiger Woods so much better than
everyone else:
</P>
<P>
   1. Mental strength. It was part of his upbringing. While his
father, Earl Woods, can get carried away by calling him a
modern-day Ghandi, Tiger has been taught to fend off distractions
and to focus on winning. When Woods had a longer, wilder swing and
was low on course management, he had to play his absolute best to
win. Now, he's winning even when he isn't at the top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of it is mental,'' McLean said. ``I don't think
it's something you can make happen. It's a gift, and now he's
enhanced that gift with great technique. ... I think he goes into
these events full out, trying to win. He's always said he loves to
get in these situations where a lot of people are uncomfortable. I
really think he sees everything as nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   2. Perfect technique, flawless fundamentals. Woods claimed for
two years that his reworked swing _ which was shortened slightly
and shallowed out, with a more rounded plane _ eventually would pay
off with more victories. In 1998, he won one tournament, the
BellSouth Classic in Duluth, Ga. Woods also has worked tirelessly
on his distance control, especially with the short irons, and has
developed pace on shorter putts that early last year were being
gunned through the breaks. Beyond that, he uses shots in
competition that others are afraid to try on the range, such as the
``knockdown'' 3-woods he hit into the wind at Kapalua last month.
</P>
<P>
   3. Maturity. During his first two years on tour, Woods was being
coached to adopt Nike's on-the-cutting-edge, sometimes arrogant
image. But he has blossomed into a charming personality because of
a natural, professional maturity. He is saying and doing the right
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is making tremendous improvements personally,'' Palmer told
The Golf Channel. ``And I am one of his biggest critics _ and he
knows that. ... He's getting better and better all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Great strength. Officially listed at 6 feet 2, 180 pounds,
Woods is 20 pounds heavier than he was as a rookie in 1996 and has
the PGA Tour's most athletic build. Woods combines amazing
flexibility and strength to generate clubhead speed that usually
hits 130 mph _ at least 10 mph higher than most tour pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's blessed genetically with the opportunity to create more
power,'' instructor Peter Kostis said. ``The whole key to
developing plenty of clubhead speed is to be able to crank that
left shoulder around your spine as fast as possible. It comes from
the legs and hips, and his leg and hip speed is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   5. A new caddie. Woods and New Zealander Steve Williams have
become a fabulous team. While former caddie Fluff Cowan was a good
publicity tool for Woods in the beginning, he couldn't match
Williams for distance advice and reading greens.
</P>
<P>
   6. Vision. Woods underwent Lasik surgery in October to bring him
to 20-15 in each eye. Wearing contacts had bothered him for years
in cold or windy weather. Immediately after the surgery, Woods
claimed that ``the hole seemed bigger,'' and he said he could see
the line better on long putts. He hasn't lost since.

 &HT;    Nation's Cup turns bizarre
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even by African standards, the bizarre events
surrounding the African Nations Cup have been extraordinary. And
not just on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Today's semifinals pit Nigeria and South Africa in Lagos and
Cameroon against Tunisia in Accra, after a rash of upsets that
almost took out the heavy favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria avoided a quarterfinal exit Sunday by tying Senegal in
the final six minutes of regulation, then getting the winner in
overtime for a 2-1 victory. The goals came not from any of the
Super Eagles' high-priced European club stars, but 18-year-old
Julius Aghahowa, who plays in the Tunisian league. Co-host Ghana
was ousted by Tunisia, and pre-tournament favorite Morocco was
knocked out in group play, leading to the dismissal of coach Henri
Michel.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's harrowing news about the Ivory Coast team could
prove to be one more strike against Africa's bid to land the 2006
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   After being held in a detention camp for two days by the
country's military dictator, Ivory Coast players were
understandably reluctant to commit to further national-team play.
Players were taken captive by armed soldiers after their return
home because their early elimination ``dishonored'' the government
of Robert Guei.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we were living a nightmare,'' Marseille forward
Ibrahima Bakayoko said.
</P>
<P>
   With Africa's World Cup qualifying starting in just a few
months, European clubs hesitant to release players for purely
competitive reasons might have an even better excuse not to let
them go. Unless players beat them to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time I'm called,'' said Lassina Diabate, Bordeaux's
Ivorian midfielder, ``I'll think twice about going.''
</P>

   GOLD CUP: U.S. OPENS AGAINST HAITI

   North America's continental competition starts Saturday with the
U.S. meeting Haiti in Miami's Orange Bowl in the opener of the
CONCACAF Gold Cup. The Americans also meet Peru in Miami in group
play on Wednesday. The favorite in the 12-team event is Mexico,

   GERMANY: BAYERN RETAKES LEAD
</P>
<P>
   Bayern Munich moved back on top of the Bundesliga, three points
clear of Bayer Leverkusen, after Wednesday's 4-1 rout in a battle
between the league leaders. Stefan Effenberg and Mehmet Scholl
scored on either side of halftime, and Alexander Zickler put a goal
home for good measure in the 90th minute.... Also on Wednesday,
Hamburg kept pace in third place, five points behind Bayern, by
beating Stuttgart 3-1, as Tony Yeboah scored twice.... Changing
managers didn't have instant results for Borussia Dortmund, which
fell 1-0 to Wolfsburg on Wednesday in its first match under Bernd
Krauss. He succeeds Michael Skibbe, who was fired after a 1-0 loss
to Kaiserslautern over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND: HODDLE WINS DEBUT
</P>
<P>
   Former England manager Glenn Hoddle won his first match for
Southampton, 2-1 Saturday, over West Ham. Hoddle, who previously
managed Chelsea, was appointed last week as coach David Jones
awaits trial on child-abuse charges.... Aston Villa striker Dion
Dublin, who scored 13 goals before breaking a bone in his neck
before Christmas, has returned to practice.... Liverpool striker
Michael Owen will be out another month because of persisting
hamstring problems, but the club easily defeated Leeds 3-1 Saturday
without him to stay in fourth place. The Reds are tied with Arsenal
on points and play the Gunners on Sunday in a match crucial for
their respective European Champions League hopes.... Manchester
United took a commanding nine-point lead in the Premier League by
beating Coventry City 3-2 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   SPAIN: DJOROVIC SUSPENDED
</P>
<P>
   Celta Vigo's Yugoslavian defender Goran Djorovic has been fined
$18,000 and suspended indefinitely for refusing to play at left
back in Saturday's 1-0 loss to Rayo Vallecano.... Deportivo La
Coruna routed Real Madrid 5-2 to stay on top of Zaragoza by four
points, but the biggest surprise was a 1-0 home loss by Barcelona
to modest Basque side Alaves, which moves into fifth. The loss was
Barca's seventh, equaling the number of all of their setbacks last
season.

ANALYSIS: HEZBOLLAH DEALS SERIOUS BLOW TO MIDEAST PEACE EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DEBORAH SONTAG

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A tense state of anticipation gripped much of the
Middle East on Wednesday as Israelis and Arabs waited to see
whether the conflict in Lebanon would defuse or intensify and
revive active hostilities between Israel and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Israel once again bombed southern Lebanon, and Shiite Muslim
guerrillas continued firing mortar shells at Israeli outposts. An
Israeli soldier killed Tuesday was buried. And Israeli residents on
the northern border endured their second full day in musty concrete
bunkers, while Lebanese civilians spent their second day with only
sporadic generator-powered light and heat.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday it became clear: with the acquiescence or
assistance of Syria, guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God, in Lebanon have succeeded in setting back the
regional peace effort, which they oppose.
</P>
<P>
   They have pushed Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, a warrior
turned peacemaker, back into his warrior role, as he reluctantly
ordered a second day of bombings _ this time, limited _ in
retaliation for the guerrillas' killing of six Israeli soldiers in
the last two weeks. And in much of the Arab world they have recast
Israel as a suspect partner in peace _ if not a villain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah has taken actions that have deteriorated the
situation,'' said Martin Indyk, the U.S. ambassador to Israel.
Those interested in peace, he said, should ensure that ``Hezbollah
is not allowed to destroy the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Israel, the renewed fighting revived debate about the
purpose of Israel's presence in southern Lebanon, which was
questioned Wednesday even by soldiers stationed there _ a very rare
event. But it also underscored Israelis' skepticism about the peace
effort with Syria, making it all the harder for Barak to win public
backing if the negotiations resume.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis believe that President Hafez Assad of Syria is
responsible for the bloodshed in Lebanon, for using Hezbollah as a
proxy to press Israel into making concessions at the negotiating
table.
</P>
<P>
   Many have called for Barak, who has pledged to withdraw troops
from southern Lebanon by July in the context of an Israeli-Syrian
agreement, to pull out now, unilaterally. Such a move, they say,
would rob Syria of that lever.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Within Israel's political establishment, the violence in Lebanon
has also reinforced the preference of many dovish politicians to
make a priority of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, which is
also stalled. Barak and Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, another former general
who is a cabinet minister, have been almost alone in wanting to
give Syrian talks precedence, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and Syria on Wednesday traded recriminations for the
breakdown of peace talks into violence.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking character with his six-month-old government's oratory
of peace, Foreign Minister David Levy issued a fire-breathing
threat that ``the soil of Lebanon will burn'' if the guerrillas
launch rockets into northern Israel. The comment immediately
reverberated negatively through the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Syria sent out mixed signals. In Tishrin, a government
newspaper, the Syrians declared that ``the mask came off Barak's
face last night,'' and ``his real face, of bloodthirst, killing and
destruction, was revealed.'' But in the London-based Arab daily Al
Hayat, a senior official said Syria had asked Hezbollah to refrain
from firing Katyusha rockets at Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Arab officials say that even if Barak faced
public pressure to respond to Hezbollah's recent attacks, he should
have refrained from the bombardments that took the conflict outside
the war zone and involved civilians.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four years of stalemate, Israeli-Syrian peace talks
were revived in December at the highest level ever, with talks
between Barak and the Syrian foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In January a second round of U.S.-brokered negotiations between
Barak and Shara, in West Virginia, did not go well. Both sides went
home feeling that their needs had not been met, but the Syrians
were more unhappy: their one demand, that Israel withdraw from the
Golan Heights down to the June 4, 1967 border, had barely been
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a third round was scheduled for late January. But then an
Israeli newspaper printed the leaked text of a working paper that
summed up where each side stood. That text, called a draft treaty,
seemed to make clear that Israel had already wrung some concessions
from Syria, on security and opening of normal relations, while
Syria had not even gotten Israel to declare that it would withdraw
from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that Syria felt humiliated and exposed and
that its reluctance to continue talks then hardened into a
suspension of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Assad has not received the Westerners, diplomats and
back-channel conduits, who have gone to visit him in Damascus, a
senior U.S. official said, naming three. It is unclear whether
Assad, who has spoken by telephone with President Clinton, is ill
or in seclusion on the issue of peace, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely believed that Barak had helped nudge Assad back to
the table with his campaign pledge to bring Israeli soldiers home
from Lebanon by summer. Assad, it was thought, saw his ability to
ease Israel's exit from southern Lebanon as a bargaining chip for
regaining the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But many say they believe that ``what began as a trap for Assad
has become a trap for Barak himself,'' as one Western diplomat put
it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conflict intensified, Barak was already seen as bound
by his pledge to pull out the troops. Now he is believed to be even
more locked into it, and facing additional pressure to withdraw as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we need to move it up from July to March,'' said
Ran Cohen, the leftist trade minister, who visited the northern
town of Qiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Radio's well-known military reporter, Carmela Menashe,
said she and a senior newspaper columnist, Nahum Barnea, had been
pulled aside by soldiers on Israel's northern border, out of sight
of the military spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers in Lebanon almost always speak proudly of their role in
defending Israel's northern border. But these young men spoke of
the futility of their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Menashe broadcast their remarks without army approval, and their
powerful comments were repeated and discussed throughout the day
here.
</P>
<P>
   One said, ``The faster we fly out of here the better.'' Menashe
asked him why. ``You have to be here to understand,'' he replied.
``We'll never win this war. We're too big and cumbersome, while the
Hezbollah are small and elusive. We have no business here.''
</P>
<P>
   The other said: ``If we're going to leave anyway, why stay and
give them a few more dead? All of us are saying that we don't want
to be the last soldier to die in Lebanon.''

CHANCELLOR PROPOSES PAYMENT FOR AUSTRIA'S WARTIME SLAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Austria's new chancellor, trying to calm foreign fears
about his coalition with the rightist Freedom Party, presented his
government's platform to Parliament Wednesday and said he wanted to
compensate people forced into slavery in Austrian factories during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of wartime compensation was included in a
package otherwise fairly typical for a conservative European
government: tax cuts, plans to balance the budget, faster sales of
state assets, strong anti-crime measures and curbs on immigration.
The chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel, named a former president of the
Austrian National Bank as coordinator in charge of Nazi-era
compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
   Schuessel spent much of his speech addressing fears about the
Freedom Party and its leader, Joerg Haider, who is best known
abroad for his anti-immigrant stance and remarks interpreted as
defending the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Austria is a stable democracy, Schuessel pointed out
that it has very few anti-foreigner incidents, labor strikes or
violent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Austria has not changed in the last few days,'' he said.
He appealed to the international community to ``reconsider its
prejudices and pre-formed opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The government will press for former Nazi slave laborers, ``who
are after all at an age where they need help quickly,'' to get
payments, Schuessel said. Austrian companies that used slave
laborers would be expected to pay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement is ``potentially significant, but there
are many issues still to be dealt with,'' said Gideon Taylor,
executive vice president of the Claims Conference, an umbrella body
of 23 Jewish organizations that coordinates and negotiates claims
of Holocaust victims and their survivors.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of portraying itself as Hitler's first victim,
Austria has only in the last few years acknowledged its own debt to
Holocaust victims and begun to restore property seized by the
Nazis. Payments to survivors of up to $7,000 were treated as
compassionate aid, rather than as reparations owed. Also, Taylor
noted, most of the slave laborers in Austria were Poles, Czechs and
other eastern Europeans rather than Jews.
</P>
<P>
   As Schuessel spoke, about 1,500 officers surrounded the
Parliament building and blocked off traffic on the Ringstrasse,
Vienna's most famous boulevard, in anticipation of up to 20,000
protesters. But few showed up, and the cordoned-off area was
cleared earlier in the afternoon than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the other 14 nations of the European Union
threatened to isolate Austria diplomatically if Haider was invited
into a coalition government. Since that government took office on
Friday, Schuessel has been at pains to reassure Europe that it
wishes to remain part of the union and does not plan to oppose its
expansion to include eastern Europe. Haider had opposed European
expansion, but he also opposed Austria's own entry into the union
and has a history of changing his political positions to suit
changing circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday a spokesman for the French government said France
still ``wants to go further'' in isolating Austria, but recognized
that it had few allies, and proposed no specific measures.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she
felt reassured by promises from Schuessel and said the recently
summoned U.S. ambassador to Austria would return to Vienna this
weekend.

DICAPRIO'S TWISTED `BEACH'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Leonardo DiCaprio may be cute, but watching him undergo an
amoral education in ``The Beach'' is not a pretty sight.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't so much because Richard _ the vaguely alienated,
self-centeredly romantic tourist looking for fun and, maybe,
meaning in Thailand _ is one of the biggest rats ever mistaken for
a hero in a major motion picture. The bigger problem is the glib
actor's inability to make anything interesting out of the lying,
cheating, selfish, whining and potentially murderous hottie
(whatever will the little girls think?). The guy's creepiness has a
marshmallow core; when depths of jagged cussedness are called for,
DiCaprio just acts goofy.
</P>
<P>
   But the shallowness of the performance can't fairly be blamed on
the actor alone. It's of a piece with every other aspect of this
superficial, derivative and pretentious movie. And the piece's
inherent flaws go all the way back to Alex Garland's source novel,
which told the story better but still suffered from a fatal
combination of existential lightheadedness and bratty angst
tortuously molded to suit the sensibilities of today's young
adults.
</P>
<P>
   And like too much of Generation X-plus' cultural output, ``The
Beach'' keeps reminding us that their elders did it better. The
main touchstones here are ``Lord of the Flies'' and a constantly
referenced ``Apocalypse Now,'' with a little ``Bridge on the River
Kwai'' monomania at the climax. Mainly, it's yet another story
about white folks losing their bearings in the tropics. Only this
time, sillier; the whole thing plays like the rise and fall of a
Club Med managed by Colonel Kurtz.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Danny Boyle, the British flashmaster (``Shallow
Grave,'' ``Trainspotting,'' ``A Life Less Ordinary''), who seems to
be interested in addressing serious matters as insubstantially as
possible, the film starts off amusingly enough. DiCaprio's Richard
is knocking around Bangkok, complaining _ in the kind of voice-over
that filmmakers who know how to show what they're getting at don't
use _ that Western travelers come searching for unique, genuine
experiences but wind up doing the same, mostly inane things. Then,
on cue, an incomprehensible Scotsman (Robert Carlyle) leaves
Richard a hand-drawn sea chart before slitting his own wrists.
</P>
<P>
   The map shows the route to an unspoiled isle whose bewitching
beauty the dead guy had praised and cursed. Bewitched himself by
the female half of a young French couple, Richard convinces
Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to
venture with him to the possible paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Which they more or less find, once they work their way onto the
officially uninhabited island and past the fields of heavily armed
Thai pot farmers. A bunch of blissed-out expatriates have set up a
pleasure commune on the shore of a pristine lagoon, and the
newcomers are enchanted.
</P>
<P>
   But gee, guess what? Life at the beach isn't as perfect as it
seems. Though there is no official leader or ideology, a
tough-minded Englishwoman, Sal (Tilda Swinton), essentially rules
like a cult leader. Since the dope-growers value their privacy even
more than the tourists love their unspoiled resort, paranoia over
any newcomers finding the place looms large.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, you don't want to have any kind of medical problem at
the Beach, since Sal forbids doctor visits. And because the
beautiful lagoon, which is presumably the property's main
attraction, is infested with an unusually high number of man-eating
sharks, that particular rule is quite problematic.
</P>
<P>
   You start laughing at the movie when this becomes apparent, if
you aren't giggling already. The main plot point _ that everyone is
having so much fun at the beach they'll go to any lengths to
preserve their utopia _ just doesn't ring true. Lack of privacy,
jealousy, gossip and deprivation seem to be the main operating
principles, volleyball the top recreational activity. And you can
play volleyball on the mainland, with cold beer handy, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's more risible stuff, like Richard, exiled and alone after
everyone figures out what a jerk he is, doing dances with wolves in
the jungle and interpreting his dementia in videogame imagery.
That's a stab at intentional satire (some of the film's other
cultural lampoons, to be fair, hit their targets and are actually
funny). But it's also emblematic of ``The Beach's'' overriding
failure to address its theme _ the difficulty of getting real in an
increasingly wired, commercialized and alienating world _ in other
than virtual terms itself. &QL;

JUDGE EXONERATES US IN CANCER VICTIM EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A judge has ruled that the &UR;  &LR; federal government can't be
held liable for funding experimental nuclear treatments that killed
cancer patients in the 1950s and 1960s, even though the government
knew the victims were suffering ``undesirable'' side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Chief US District Judge William G. Young concluded Wednesday
that the families of four brain tumor patients -- including two
families who won an $8 million jury verdict last October against
Massachusetts General Hosptial and a retired neurosurgeon -- don't
have a case against the US government.
</P>
<P>
   While the US Atomic Energy Commission funded the cancer research
projects at Massachusetts General, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island,
N.Y., Young said it's not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act
because it didn't have ``day-to-day control'' of the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said attorney Anthony Roisman, who
represents the families George Heinrich and Eileen Sienkewicz, who
died at MGH in 1961, and Joseph Mayne and Walter Van Dyke, who died
at Brookhaven.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a federal jury in Boston awarded $8 million to the
families of Heinrich and Sienkewicz, concluding that MGH and its
former chief of neurosurgery, Dr. William Sweet, now 89, were
negligent and caused their deaths with painful nuclear treatments.
The jury found MIT wasn't liable for the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Heinrich and Sienkewicz were afflicted with fast-growing brain
tumors when Sweet and MGH administered boron neutron capture
therapy (BNCT). They were injected with boron, a chemical that
concentrates on brain tumors, then placed in a nuclear reactor at
MIT where they were exposed to a neturon beam.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment destroyed their tumors but also scorched healthy
brain tissue, hastening their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Similar experiments were conducted on Van Dyke and Mayne at
Brookhaven by Dr. Lee Edward Farr.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the (Atomic Energy) Commission was
aware of the nature of BNCT trials and the dearth of scientific
evidence to support Dr. Sweet and Dr. Farr's hopes for therapeutic
potential,'' Young wrote in his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Young noted that in 1968, the commission acknowledged ``the
results of the clinical trials were almost uniformly discouraging.
In addtion to the lack of evidence of significantly increased
survival time, there was evidence of undesirable irradiation
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Young said legal precedent established by the US Supreme
Court requires a finding that the government was involved in
day-to-day supervision of the projects in order for it to be liable
under the law.
</P>
<P>
   Young concluded that the boron treatments were ``one of the
unfortunate consequences'' of a national agenda to enlist private
researchers to help develop peaceful uses for atomic energy. But,
he said, it wasn't the result of detailed supervision by the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Miller, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said,
``We're pleased by the judge's decision today.''
</P>
<P>
   Roisman said he has yet to decide whether to appeal Young's
ruling. Young is currently weighing a request by MGH and Sweet to
set aside the jury's verdict against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Tort Claims Act as a law is not fair,'' Roisman
said. ``The government should be held legally liable, every time a
private citizen would be held legally liable for their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``These experiments never should have been conducted at all. But
for the government funding, there would have been no boron neutron
capture therapy.''

`THE TIGGER MOVIE' OFFERS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   A.A. Milne's ``Winnie the Pooh'' books feature such a wide range
of characters that just about any reader can find one to identify
with and love. There's Pooh's sweet simplicity, Piglet's
big-hearted timidity, Rabbit's bossiness, Roo's belief that he can
do big things and Eeyore's lovably gloomy pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Pooh'' fans could pick one character they'd most like
to be, I'd wager the majority would choose that exuberantly bouncy
tiger, Tigger, simply because he always looks like he's having so
much fun. But in Disney's wonderful new ``Pooh'' film, ``The Tigger
Movie,'' we find that being a Tigger isn't always as entertaining
as it appears. It's a great premise for a movie that is a sweet and
entertaining addition to the ``Pooh'' canon.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember his song in ``Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery
Day,'' Tigger revealed that ``the wonderful thing about Tiggers is
that I'm the only one.'' In ``The Tigger Movie,'' he discovers that
his singularity can be kind of lonely sometimes. (With lines like
``Half this bounce is 90 percent mental,'' he should seek out Yogi
Berra.) So Tigger determines to find his family, much to the
concern of his animal friends, who try to convince Tigger that, no
matter what, he has a family right there at the Hundred Acre Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's familial themes are certainly commonplace in Disney
animation, but writer-director Jun Falkenstein's creative use of
Milne's vivid characters makes the movie an enjoyable ride.
Besides, no one is coming to ``The Tigger Movie'' for fresh
insights. This is cinematic comfort food, and ``Pooh'' lovers _
young and old _ will find it delightful.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Pooh'' has remained a pretty constant presence on the
small screen, ``Tigger'' brings the animal characters back to
theaters for the first time in 17 years. (The movie is also the
first ``Pooh'' full-length feature film; 1977's ``The Many
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh'' collected three previously released
shorts.) The filmmakers have wisely decided to remain true to
illustrator E.H. Shepard's line drawings, giving the movie a look
that's decidedly old-fashioned, but charming (and appropriate) as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements have remained constant, too. Songwriters Richard
and Robert Sherman, who wrote all the music in the previous
``Pooh'' featurettes, have come up with several winning new songs.
The Shermans also wrote the movie's beautiful end-title song,
``Your Heart Will Lead You Home,'' with Kenny Loggins, whose 1972
hit ``House at Pooh Corner'' remains a favorite with diehards.
</P>
<P>
   The new music, which features the Shermans' inventive wordplay
(the team composed many of Disney's best-known songs, including the
``Mary Poppins'' score) is often accompanied by imaginative
animation. The best sequence has Tigger wildly envisioning his
family tree; at the other end of the emotional spectrum, Pooh
sweetly sings a lullaby to some bees so he can savor some honey.
Those two songs show the range of this fine family film. Each of
Milne's beloved characters has some time in the spotlight (that
slow-talking sad sack Eeyore gets the best laughs), and the movie
tempers Tigger's manic energy with quiet scenes involving gentle
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, you don't have to love Tigger (or any of the ``Pooh''
characters for that matter) to enjoy this engaging movie. And
you'll leave with a decided bounce in your step. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Geneva have re-created a primordial form of matter
that physicists believe last existed in abundance when the universe
was an exploding fireball only a fraction of a second old.
</P>
<P>
   The new material is a highly compressed gas of the particles
called quarks and gluons, the building blocks of ordinary particles
like the protons and neutrons within all the atoms in the universe
today. The long-sought achievement might be compared to the first
splitting of the atom to reveal its individual parts.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement will be announced on Thursday at CERN, the
European particle physics laboratory where the work was carried
out. The finding moves experimental physics closer than it has ever
been to the presumed moment at which the universe came into being
and could help cosmologists better understand the driving forces
behind the primordial explosion itself. The matter's existence
confirms one of the most abstruse of all predictions by theoretical
particle physicists.
</P>
<P>
   Quarks, and the gluons that powerfully bind them together, are
normally joined to form protons and neutrons and cannot be shaken
loose individually no matter how hard pairs of the ordinary
particles are smashed together. To create the new material, the
scientists have, in effect, compressed and heated a ball of protons
and neutrons so that they melted into their constituent quarks and
gluons, which then floated freely in a laboratory for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does indicate that a new state of matter is created,'' said
Dr. Johanna Stachel, a physicist at the University of Heidelberg in
Germany who is the spokesperson for one of the multinational
collaborations that operates a large particle detector, called
NA45, at the Geneva laboratory. ``This new state we think the
universe was in until about 10 microseconds after the Big Bang, and
then crystallized into the particles as we know them now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Bang is the colossal explosion in which most
cosmologists believe the universe was born, some 15 billion years
ago. A microsecond is a millionth of a second.
</P>
<P>
   The laboratory's experiment, said Dr. Michael Turner, a
cosmologist at the University of Chicago, ``helps take us back to
when the universe was a soup of the most fundamental particles we
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the tight connection to cosmology, said Dr. Edward
Shuryak, a physicist at the State University of New York in Stony
Brook, the Geneva laboratory's achievement is being called the
``Little Bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Known more technically as ``quark-gluon matter,'' the material
is also a boon for theoretical physicists, since one of their basic
theories, called quantum chromodynamics, had predicted that the
bizarre state should exist. In the 1970s, Shuryak was among the
first to explain its unusual properties.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists know of six different types of quarks, which go by
the somewhat whimsical designations up, down, charm, strange, top
and bottom. Pairs and threesomes of quarks bind together to make up
ordinary particles of matter. Protons, for example, consist
primarily of two up quarks and one down quark, while the less
common particles called kaons consist of a strange quark and either
an up or a down.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the strength with which gluons bind quarks together turns
out to be weak when the quarks are close together and increasingly
powerful when they are more distant from one another, as if they
were connected by elastic. ``You can never get a quark in your
pocket,'' Dr. Shuryak said.
</P>
<P>
   Shuryak and others eventually came to the surprising conclusion,
however, that quarks could roam free if enough protons and neutrons
could be heated to a temperature about 100,000 times higher than
the center of the sun and compressed to a density roughly 10 times
that of an ordinary atomic nucleus. The crucial point is that small
clouds of quarks effectively screen one another from the gluon
force of more distant quarks, cutting the elastic connections.
</P>
<P>
   The equations of quantum chromodynamics are so bewilderingly
complex that the theoretical properties of quark-gluon matter can
be explored only on the world's largest computers.
</P>
<P>
   To test whether this state of matter can exist in reality, the
scientists in Geneva used their Super Proton Synchrotron to
accelerate lead nuclei to an energy of 33 trillion electron volts.
Traveling at nearly the speed of light, those nuclei were smashed
into a stationary lead foil to produce hot, dense matter in the
resulting collisions.
</P>
<P>
   After a fleeting existence, the quark-gluon matter should then
cool and condense back into ordinary matter and explode in a hail
of thousands of ordinary particles. Seven different particle
detectors examined the residue of millions of lead collisions for
evidence that the quark-gluon matter had in fact been created.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sort of a criminal court procedure, where you have proof
by circumstantial evidence,'' said Dr. Reinhard Stock, a physicist
at the University of Frankfurt who is the spokesperson for a
collaboration centered on a detector called NA49.
</P>
<P>
   The fingerprints of the deed are clear, said Stock. They include
the detection of many more particles that contain strange quarks
than an ordinary particle smash-up would produce, and fewer
particles containing charm quarks. Those are just the indications
that were seen by the Geneva laboratory's detectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have opened the door,'' said Dr. Claude Detraz, the
laboratory's director of research, calling the new results
``compelling evidence that we have created a new state of matter in
which quarks are `deconfined.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cosmologists believe that much of the character of the universe,
and perhaps the fury of the Big Bang explosion itself, was
determined by a series of so-called phase transitions like the
coalescence of ordinary matter from the quark-gluon plasma.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a concrete illustration of how cosmologists can
benefit from accelerators, which can recreate the conditions that
existed during the earliest moments of the universe,'' said Turner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although quark-gluon matter is rare, physicists theorize that
small amounts of it may be generated when energetic particles from
space called cosmic rays crash into planetary bodies like Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sets the stage for much more powerful
experiments, expected to begin this spring, using the Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider at the federal Brookhaven National Laboratory in
Upton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Those experiments will initially collide gold nuclei with 10
times higher energy than CERN has mustered, said Dr. Thomas Ludlam,
a physicist who is an administrator of the scientific program at
the Brookhaven collider. The experiments should produce an even
more exotic entity called a quark-gluon plasma and allow for much
more intensive study of the substances, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you're trying to discover steam and you can make a
few little puffs of steam,'' Ludlam said. ``But with a better
pressure cooker you have enough time to stick a thermometer in and
discover the thermodynamic properties of steam.''

ANTI-EU FERVOR GROWS IN SWITZERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Resentment against what is viewed as European Union
meddling in Austrian affairs has given isolationist groups in
Switzerland an unexpected lift. After months of trying, opponents
have quickly gathered enough signatures to try to derail
long-planned Swiss ties to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   A petition for a referendum with 70,000 signatures was delivered
last week to the governing council in the capital, Bern,
accompanied by a donkey draped with the European Union flag, a
field of blue with a circle of yellow stars.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of 11 groups, including two right-wing parties, said
they had gathered the bulk of the signatures last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never had a dictator and we don't need to have one now
from Brussels,'' said Flavio Maspoli, an official in a right-wing
party.
</P>
<P>
   The drive for a referendum has been led by Rudolf Keller, a
former member of Parliament who, at the height of the controversy
over Holocaust victims' money in Swiss banks, called for a boycott
of American and Jewish companies. (He later backed down from the
statement.)
</P>
<P>
   As recently as early last month, Keller and his supporters had
attracted only half the number of signatures needed to force a
referendum _ 50,000. And it looked as if the effort had failed.
</P>
<P>
   But a surge in signers from the eastern part of Switzerland,
closest to Austria and considered the most conservative region, has
forced the government to set the voting date for May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Contention over neutral Switzerland's links with neighbors has
been simmering for a decade. In 1992, the country voted against
joining an economic grouping tied to the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, views appeared to have shifted in favor of closer
ties, in the face of prodding from the central government and
changing economic realities. Polls now show that two-thirds of
Swiss support closer relations with surrounding countries. But the
referendum will be the first time that sentiment is measured at the
ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the center-left government was threatened by a
better-than-expected showing by the country's most nationalist
party, the People's Party, led by Christoph Blocher, in elections
held after a series of unflattering disclosures about Switzerland's
actions in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss are quick to say that Blocher's brand of nationalism is
less strident than that of Joerg Haider, who has taken his
far-right Freedom Party into the government in Austria. But the
Austrian situation has drawn adamant commentary here that the
European Union is interfering.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sanction a country solely because of the political
composition of its executive is a serious and unacceptable
precedent,'' Eric Hoesli, editor of a daily in Geneva, Le Temps,
wrote in a front-page editorial on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the European Union here insist that by spurning
Austria the organization has shown that it is not democratic enough
and is too big and bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   One organizer of the petition drive, Bernhard Hess, said that
realization caused voters to sign for a referendum that would
decide by a simple majority whether Switzerland should adhere to
bilateral accords with the European Union. The Parliament has
already approved the accords, which are to take effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiated over four years, they are seen as a steppingstone to
eventual membership. The agreements would ease tough border
controls and immigration rules and eliminate trade barriers. In an
unusual alliance with the conservative groups, Swiss
environmentalists oppose the accords, in part because they would
allow 40-ton trucks on trans-Alpine routes.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the accords, which include many businesses, banks
and unions, see them as crucial for Switzerland to gain access to
the vast European Union market.
</P>
<P>
   Economics Minister Pascal Couchepin pledged to lead the fight to
win approval of the accords, which he maintains would allow
Switzerland to be treated as an equal but would not require the
country to be involved with decisions from Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Taking note of the donkey that delivered the signatures in Bern,
Couchepin said, ``It's necessary to know whether the donkey
represents those seeking the referendum or those fighting it.''

 &HT;    Gender equity: Georgia Capitol tackling Title IX concerns
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and David Milliron
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In his Stone Mountain office, Richard Foxworth is
mapping strategy. If changes aren't made, it could lead to parents
filing federal Title IX complaints against the school districts in
DeKalb, Fulton and Clayton counties.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer and father of softball-playing daughters has
championed gender equity in Georgia high schools. He brought
successful cases against Oconee and Polk County school districts in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more complaints filed here in Georgia,''
Foxworth said. ``I'm talking with parents who have legitimate
concerns about the way their district treats female athletes.
People are fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear of gender equity lawsuits, in part, is why state Reps.
Kathy Ashe (R-Atlanta) and Stephanie Stuckey (D-DeKalb) introduced
the Sports Equity Act of 2000, which is to come up for a hearing
today before the full House Judiciary Committee. The state's top
female high school athletes will be honored this morning at the
Capitol as part of a lobbying effort, involving several Olympians,
to coincide with national Women and Girls in Sports Day.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require local school systems to issue annual
reports on their athletics programs _ specifically, information
regarding expenditures and participation rates for each gender _ to
the state Department of Education. Schools or systems failing to
comply would risk having state funds withheld or their teams banned
from postseason play.
</P>
<P>
   Schools already risk losing federal funds if they fail to comply
with Title IX, the federal law mandating comparable sports
resources for men's and women's athletics. But no one monitors
Georgia public schools _ not the state Department of Education or
the Georgia High School Association, the private group that
oversees extracurricular activities. Nor does the federal
government monitor school systems; instead, it usually acts only
after a complaint has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed state companion law to Title IX was introduced
after an eight-day series in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
``The Gender Gap.'' The series showed that Georgia public high
schools routinely relegate female athletes to lower standards _
enough to result in lawsuits, if Title IX were monitored in the
state. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights
has the authority to conduct unannounced compliance reviews, and
officials have discussed the violations found by the newspaper. But
Art Manigault of the OCR's regional office in Atlanta said its
agenda is set for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we would do in the state of Georgia, it would be in
our next fiscal year,'' Manigault said. ``But we have had
discussions on (the AJC findings).''
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution analyzed participation levels, funding,
quality of facilities and coaching support for high school boys and
girls sports _ and foundinequities to be commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   _ 64 percent of boys play competitive sports, while 36 percent
of girls play.
</P>
<P>
   _ 75 percent of local salary supplements for coaching goes to
support boys sports; 25 percent goes to girls programs.
</P>
<P>
   _ 95 percent of so-called ``extended-pay'' coaching supplements
_ in which coaches are paid for extra weeks beyond the regular
school year _ goes to boys sports.
</P>
<P>
   _ 86 percent of the dollars from legislative grants aimed at
supporting high school sports over a five-year period were directed
to projects in which the primary beneficiaries were boys sports.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's sponsors fear an outbreak of legal action against
Georgia schools, unless something is done to remedy the disparities
in the public-school athletics programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't start making changes legislatively, we'll have to
be changing them eventually through the courts,'' Stuckey said.
Lamar Daniel, a retired OCR investigator and a Title IX consultant,
said he would expect a majority of the legal action to center on
metro Atlanta schools, rather than in small communities, where the
AJC investigation uncovered the worst inequities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's discontent in the more rural areas, but people feel
like they're challenging football by filing a (Title IX)
complaint,'' Daniel said. ``It's like you're filing against your
neighbor, and it's not a popular issue. People in metro Atlanta
haven't been living here forever. They may not even know anybody on
the school board.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel was lead investigator on the Title IX complaint filed
against the Oconee County school district, where the high school
was required to add additional girls sports. He points to the
school's state championship in football this past fall, along with
success of Oconee County's girls sports, as proof that schools can
have successful football programs and still comply with Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our athletic programs have not suffered from providing
additional sports for females,'' Oconee County superintendent Tommy
Warren said. ``In fact, our overall athletic program has improved
as a result of adding the new sports. Our female athletes have
received numerous athletic scholarships to colleges, and our
booster club has expanded to include a representative from every
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clayton County, where Foxworth is advising Scott Lowry, who
has a daughter at Mt. Zion High and another at M.D. Robert Middle
School, the district last month created a task force to look into
its Title IX performance. For several years, Lowry and Yao Seidu,
whose daughter attends North Clayton High, have lobbied school and
district officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's a stall tactic or if they're trying to
get something accomplished,'' said Lowry, recently appointed to the
task force.
</P>
<P>
   School board Chairman Mark Armstrong initially called for the
creation of the task force during a Jan. 3 meeting. The task force
is likely to have 12 to 15 members, including each of the nine
board members or their representatives and several district
administrators. No meetings have been scheduled yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make some improvements,'' said Bob Brannon, county
athletics director and a task force member. ``We're going to look
at where we stand and see what is the best and quickest way to make
those improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   If passed by the Legislature, the ``Sports Equity Act of 2000''
would apply A to Z scrutiny to the state's 323 public high schools
that field teams.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 1308 is patterned after the law passed in 1994 by
Florida, where girls' participation in sports increased by 24
percent in 1997-98, and football has maintained its popularity.
However, an attempt by Georgia to pass a less-comprehensive equity
bill never made it out of committee five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been very pleasantly surprised by support we've gotten
from the most unlikely places,'' Stuckey said. ``We've had a quite
a few people we didn't think would be supporting the bill tell us
their daughters had told them they better sign on.''

INDIAN POLITICIAN FINDS ANOTHER TRIAL IN JEWELS' GLARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Jayalalitha Jayaram, while not India's most
credible politician, is surely its most ornamented. For the past
week, a judge in a criminal court in Madras has been busy with the
laborious task of cataloging her jewelry collection.
</P>
<P>
   Five big suitcases full of precious necklaces, rings, bangles,
icons and earrings are under heavy guard. Each gemstone must be
counted. One elegant waistband holds 2,389 diamonds, as well as 18
emeralds and 9 rubies that form the plume in a peacock motif.
</P>
<P>
   Normally Jayalalitha, a former movie star known best here by her
first name, would be proud of an ostentatious display that beckoned
the national limelight. When she was chief minister of the state of
Tamil Nadu, from 1991 to 1996, plywood cutouts of her image _ eight
stories high _ were erected at main intersections in the state
capital. Posters portrayed her as a Hindu goddess.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case the jewels are considered accessories to
alleged crimes. Under public corruption laws, Jayalalitha is
charged with having amassed wealth far beyond her known sources of
income. As chief minister, she received a monthly token pay of
about 2 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the judge continued to mark evidence for the
trial, the audience sustained its ritual of oohing and aahing as
items were taken from the final suitcases, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds seemed to adorn everything. There were 189 on a
pendant, 132 on a necklace, 116 on a bracelet, 8 on a nose stud.
There were also magnificent curios: five gold crowns, two golden
swords, a golden likeness of Jayalalitha herself.
</P>
<P>
   The court workers were distracted, witnesses said. They passed
the jewelry back and forth, gaping and whispering. At one point, a
defense lawyer complained to the judge, ``Your honor, the staff are
just staring at the jewels and wasting time.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge, S. Sambandam, replied, ``If you want, you can have a
closer look too.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge has not always been that patient. Last Thursday he
disciplined a court typist who broke decorum and clasped a diamond
necklace around his shirt collar.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha has not been present for these jewelry displays. The
head of a powerful state party, the All India Anna Dravida Munetra
Kazhagam, she has been out campaigning for state assembly
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she is involved in so many legal proceedings that
attendance at each one would be difficult. Not long after she was
voted from office in 1996, the government of her political
adversaries filed eight corruption cases against her. Some of her
property was confiscated, including the jewelry lying loose in her
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha, 51, has said these prosecutions are politically
motivated, a not altogether unreasonable complaint in a state where
the politicians tend to be mythic and the politics sinister. But
the cases have continued to move through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she won one and lost another. In an alleged scheme to
sell off intentionally undervalued government land, charges against
her were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, she was convicted in the so-called Pleasant
Stay Hotel case, where she was accused of having favored a
developer in violation of construction codes. For this misdeed she
was sentenced to one year in prison, which so outraged some
followers that they attacked dozens of government buses. Three
students were burned alive when their vehicle was struck by a
gasoline bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in yet another courtroom, Jayalalitha was granted her
freedom while the Pleasant Stay case is appealed. But more
prosecutions loom. She is expected to be charged soon in an
incident that occurred last spring, when, her former accountant
says, she thrashed him with a high-heeled shoe, leaving him
hospitalized with an eye injury. He says he was beaten because he
refused to sign a statement accepting responsibility for falsified
tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite all her legal problems, she's still a very important
player,'' said Mahesh Rangarajan, a political analyst. ``Her
following is very devoted, especially women and the poor. And she's
very shrewd. She's hard to count out.''
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant in the extreme, clad in flowing capes, Jayalalitha
sometimes has the look of an oversized doll in a souvenir shop. But
she does not lack wile _ or gumption.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jayalalitha who brought about premature national
elections last year by withdrawing her support from the governing
Hindu nationalist-led coalition. Now, however, that coalition _
rebuilt with allies that include her Tamil Nadu enemies _ is firmly
in power.
</P>
<P>
   Jayalalitha needs friends in high places, and she may have had
that in mind when she made some of her jewelry acquisitions. Among
the dozens of diamond rings, bejeweled ear studs and silver coins
was a striking gold key chain. Embossed on it was the face of
Lakshmi, the fickle Hindu goddess favored by those most in pursuit
of worldly prosperity.  &QL;

 &HT;    Advertisers scale back athlete endorsements
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The traditional use of sports figures to promote
products and industries is undergoing a change, and the recent
spate of negative publicity involving athletes seems sure to speed
the process.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, producers of consumer goods and companies aiming
to polish their corporate images are turning to new media and other
approaches _ such as sponsoring events, whole sports and even teams
_ rather than rely on individual athlete endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   That was a consensus of thought this week among sports agents
and promotions specialists as they joined thousands in Atlanta
today for the start of Super Show, the sports industry's largest
trade event. The show, which runs through Sunday, is being held at
the Georgia World Congress Center and Georgia Dome. It is not open
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion on athletes as corporate spokespeople comes in
the aftermath of murder charges against Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis
and Charlotte player Rae Carruth, and a stream of lesser incidents,
including the uproar over insensitive comments by Atlanta Brave
John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Sports specialists allow that athletes probably do more good
deeds and support more community activities with their time and
money than the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   But the deeds and sterling performances of players like Portland
Trailblazer Steve Smith, Atlanta Brave Tom Glavine and Atlanta Hawk
Dikembe Mutombo are often overshadowed by reports of other athletes
involved in crimes or loutish behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is true or not, there is a perception that athletes
are out of control, and to some extent events seem to bear that
out,'' said Steve Woods, an Atlanta agent who has represented
Toronto Raptor Kevin Willis and Cleveland Indian David Justice.
Woods teaches classes about the sports industry at Clark Atlanta
University.
</P>
<P>
   Though companies have generally relied less on individual
endorsements, a handful of gilt-edged sports figures, who are star
performers and quality people, have become much more valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the people in the Michael Jordan mold _ people like
Derek Jeter, Wayne Gretzky, Grant Hill and others,'' said Kevin
Lovitt, an agent for team sports players at IMG, the giant
Cleveland sports and entertainment agency.
</P>
<P>
   Agents say others in that category are golfer Tiger Woods; Ray
Allen, the Olympic player on the Milwaukee Bucks; and rising stars
Kobe Bryant and Vince Carter in professional basketball and Terrell
Davis in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Reames of Nike, however, says nobody is looking for
another like basketball's Jordan, a voice that stands above the
crowd when it comes to promoting corporate images.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have changed because we recognize that it is harder than
ever to reach the market with a single approach, because the market
is more complex,'' Reames said. ``Tiger Woods may be the hottest
name in golf, but we cannot be sure of reaching the snowboarders
and the X-games audience through a golfer, even a Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike, on another level, is now dividing its investments among
all the media, most notably a growing investment in the Internet
through its new site www.whatever.nike.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding that the Internet is a crossroads where many
active people can be found,'' Reames said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is not even the only golfer backed by Nike, others being
Paul Azzinger and Nick Price. Rae Carruth, the Carolina football
player charged with murder, had an endorsement contract with Nike
but the company dropped him when he was suspended by his team and
the league as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still use some key individuals,'' said Nancy Moss, director
of global marketing for Reebok. ``Stars like Allen Iverson, an
exciting performer in basketball, and Venus Williams, a great icon
performer in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we realize that since 80 percent of the shoe-buying public
buys for style or fashion reasons rather than performance, we need
other ways to promote and sell products.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, one of the big investors in image, still uses
athletes in ad campaigns like the ones for Sprite, where San
Antonio Spur Tim Duncan and Detroit Piston Grant Hill are
prominent. But investments are made elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been inclined to place our emphasis on global sports
like the Tour de France, the World Cup and the Olympics, and whole
sports like the NBA, NASCAR and the Powerade role with the National
Hockey League,'' Coca-Cola spokesman Scott Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola made headlines last year when it withdrew its
endorsement of the World Wrestling Federation because it ``crossed
the line in terms of content.'' In response, the nation's largest
professional wrestling organization scaled back the story lines of
``Smackdown!,'' its nationally broadcast weekly program.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of marketing athletes and guiding their conduct has
fallen more squarely on agents of various kinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been a special challenge marketing football
players, because they have been hampered in projecting personality
_ they play masked and in helmets,'' said Spencer Iverson, an
Atlanta agent who represents about a dozen players, including
Randall Godfrey, the Georgia alumnus and Dallas Cowboy linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in a room full of players and others, and often
nobody would recognize the players individually,'' Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
   Agents work with the leagues and others to help underline for
players the importance of excellence on the field, first, and care
of their bodies and their images, Iverson said.
</P>
<P>
   The professional leagues and the NCAA, clearly responding to an
erosion of confidence, produce elaborate warm and fuzzy filmed
stories about their players, which run often during network game
broadcasts. Other young players, like Kevin Garnet of the Minnesota
Timberwolves, have been showcased abroad as representatives of the
basketball league.
</P>
<P>
   No program has been more focused and eye-catching than the NBA
``Player Quality Control'' series, featuring players like Vlade
Divac and Chris Webber, who had personal problems of his own before
he was traded from Washington to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of the shifting imagery of players has been
evidence that negative images need not stay that way, and positive
qualities can overshadow negative ones in the same player or
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Stories about his children out of wedlock have dogged boxer
Evander Holyfield, but in many instances this has been overshadowed
by his devotion to community activities in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an eye-opener, Latrell Sprewell, last prominent as an
angry basketball player who choked his New York Knicks coach, now
is featured in a network television advertisement selling sports
apparel. He's packaged as a free spirit who does things his way.

McCAIN HELPED BY SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATS  
(rk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In all of South Carolina, there is surely no
more prominent or ardent a supporter of Democrats than Samuel J.
Tenenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he has given thousands of dollars to Democratic
candidates, serving as the inaugural chairman for two Democratic
governors. He was a Paul Tsongas delegate to the 1992 Democratic
National Convention, and has served in high-ranking positions in
several campaigns. His wife, Inez, is the state superintendent of
schools, and is on Vice President Al Gore's campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in ten days, for the first time in his life, Tenenbaum will
cast a vote in a Republican presidential primary here. And like
thousands of other Democrats and independents across South Carolina
and the country who are transforming this year's presidential race,
he will give that vote to Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy thing for a yellow-dog Democratic like me to
do,'' said Tenenbaum, vice president of a large steel company in
Columbia, the state capital. ``And I don't even agree with
everything he stands for. But McCain has a moral compass, a real
sense of maturity. He's the only one who seems to understand what
this country is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is infuriating the campaign of Gov. George W. Bush,
McCain has made enormous strides toward the Republican nomination
because of the help _ even if short-lived _ of non-Republicans like
Tenenbaum. In open-primary states like South Carolina, any voters
can participate in the primary, and many experts estimate that from
10 to 30 percent of those voting on Feb. 19 will be voters crossing
over party lines. Even in closed primary states, like Massachusetts
and California, many Democrats are switching their party
affiliations, and officials attribute the shift to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Bush campaign does not want to be seen as
discouraging the new voters, it is trying to use the affinity of
Democrats for McCain against him with the Republican Party's core
conservatives. A new radio advertisement for Bush in South Carolina
links McCain with liberal Democrats, ``union bosses and the liberal
media.'' Local talk radio shows have been flooded with calls
complaining that the coming primary is being ``poisoned'' by
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we have done to build up the Republican Party is
being threatened this year by people who do not have the best
interests of the party at heart,'' said Tucker Eskew, Bush's
spokesman in South Carolina and a longtime political operative
here. ``A man like Sam Tenenbaum is antithetical to everything this
party stands for, and I think this alliance between the
limousine-liberal Democrats and the McCain campaign is distorting
the intent of real Republican voters.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be little the Bush campaign can do to stop the
onslaught of crossovers. The Democratic Party here has canceled its
primary and will hold only caucuses on March 9, which are not
expected to draw many voters. Democratic elected officials from
around the state say they expect many of their constituents to
support McCain, and are not even trying to talk them out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe how many friends and family members of
mine are going to be voting in the Republican primary,'' said state
Rep. Joel Lourie, who represents the Columbia suburbs and comes
from a long-established Democratic family. ``John McCain has really
hit a chord here. Even my wife, who's pro-choice and opposes his
school-voucher plan, is still going to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Becky Lourie, said she admired McCain's character,
even though she disagreed with him on several issues. She said it
would be her first vote in a Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Bush campaign in South Carolina is being hurt
by a system that its supporters themselves set up in 1980. The
state has open primaries because Republican leaders _ such as
former Gov. Carroll Campbell, now a prominent Bush supporter _
wanted to attract conservative Democrats to their party. Now,
however, McCain is attracting a very different kind of Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought it would be a party builder, and in fact that's
exactly why the state Republican Party has grown so strong,'' said
Neal Thigpen, a political science professor at Francis Marion
University in Florence and a Republican who helped design the
system in 1980. ``The idea was that once people voted in a
Republican event, they would stay in the party. But now they're
getting Democrats and independents who are way to the left of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trey Walker, McCain's national field director, said the influx
of crossovers would ultimately be healthy for the party, just as
the so-called Reagan Democrats of 1980 helped make the Republicans
a majority in the state by switching parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the volunteers in our campaign are people who have
never been active in a campaign before,'' said Walker, formerly the
executive director of the state Republican Party. ``He's the best
thing to happen to this party since Ronald Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean, however, that voters who vote in the
Republican primary will remain loyal in November. Many Democrats
and independents, including Tenenbaum, say they aree not sure they
will support McCain over the Democratic nominee in the general
election. In Massachusetts, where state officials have been flooded
with calls from voters wanting to change their party affiliation or
register as a Republican for the first time, many voters have made
it clear they plan to switch back immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   William F. Galvin, the secretary of the commonwealth of
Massachusetts, called it ``the dance of the seven veils,'' and said
he would be distributing extra party registration cards at the
March 7 primary in Massachusetts for people wanting to switch back.
</P>
<P>
   ``On their way out they can say, `it was a nice visit to the
Republican Party but now I'm going home,''' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In California, where primary voters must be registered in a
party in order to have their votes count toward selecting
delegates, the McCain campaign was hoping to register tens of
thousands of non-Republicans as Republicans before next Monday's
deadline. In New York, voters who are already registered cannot
switch parties until Nov. 8, but anyone who is not registered to
vote can select a primary to vote in by Friday. Elections officials
said today that some Democratic voters were annoyed to learn they
cannot vote for McCain in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   One limiting factor for crossovers in South Carolina is the 50
to 60 percent of Democratic voters who are black, a population
segment where McCain has made few inroads. Several black elected
officials said McCain's statement that the Confederate battle flag
is to him a symbol of heritage would make it unlikely that blacks
would vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may get some support, but not much,'' said state Sen.
Darrell Jackson, a Columbia Democrat. ``His position on the
Confederate flag is not one that will endear him to black people.''
</P>
<P>
   But interviews in Fairfield County, a mostly black area north of
Columbia that cast 63 percent of its vote for Bill Clinton in 1996,
found several black residents who were at least considering voting
in the Republican primary for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard choice for me,'' said Arthur Adams, the butcher at
the Food Kitty in the small town of Ridgeway, who served as an Army
paratrooper in Vietnam. ``I've always been a Democrat, but I like
McCain. He was a POW and that means a lot to me. I just don't
know.''

   Sleek, simple and easy to use.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a throwback to an earlier age when television
commercials hawked space-age-design electric ranges and
bullet-nosed vacuum cleaners, but the phrase is resurfacing to
describe a new class of computers called Internet appliances that
are so, well, sleek, simple and easy to use that they barely seem
to qualify as computers.
</P>
<P>
   As the category suggests, Net appliances _ with cute names like
i-opener, I-Brow, I-Station and Qubit Web Tablet _ act more like
microwaves than mainframes. Push a button, and they are on, up and
running. And you don't have to be a computer science major to keep
these things humming. Actually, Internet appliances don't have
moving parts, so they don't hum, rattle or rumble.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about these friendly machines guiding NASA probes or even
navigating the intricacies of your income taxes. These computers,
endowed with modest microprocessors and even more modest memory and
onboard storage, are aimed squarely at getting consumers cheaply,
quickly and almost effortlessly onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For ease of use, most of these computers will come with
factory-set function keys that literally put weather, e-commerce,
news and other Internet services like e-mail and virtual address
books at the user's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   On the first appliance to appear on the market, the $299
i-opener, there is even a function key for pizza. Press it, and the
machine's 10-inch, color screen pops up a Web site, complete with
an order form, for a local pizza parlor. Other devices have preset
e-commerce sites to deliver everything from music CDs to steamed
mussels.
</P>
<P>
   This new wave of PC-lite Internet machines is arriving on a wave
ushering in what many computer experts are calling the post-PC age,
in which access to the Internet's goodies will no longer be
exclusive to conventional computers. Other devices, like
WebTV-style set-top boxes, handheld personal data assistants like
the Palm VII, Web phones and even game consoles like Sega's
Dreamcast, will increasingly give users quick, easy access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel, Compaq, Acer and several other companies, big
and small, are preparing to offer Internet-only terminals by the
summer. Many are expected to cost from $200 to $400, and some may
even be given to consumers free in exchange, for example, for
signing up for broadband Internet service to connect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new category of candy that the consumer is going to
no doubt find irresistible,'' said Michael Dunstan, senior manager
of the Acer America Corp., which this summer will release the
I-Station, an inexpensive Internet-only terminal with a bright
liquid crystal display color screen and a wireless keyboard, as
well as a sister machine sold as one of the MSN Web Companion
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Internet appliance manufacturers are trying to reach the almost
48 million American households _ almost half of all the nation's
households _ that do not have computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to target that 48 percent,'' said B.J. Riseland,
product manager at Microsoft Network, which will soon release an
Internet appliance. ``We've found that people don't have computers
for a couple of reasons: cost and complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to a PC, it is a fairly easy purchase,'' said Marc
Warshawsky, manager of information appliance platform development
for Compaq. ``I would say that these kinds of products have a great
amount of appeal to the so-called offline world, people not
involved in the PC world or the Internet world.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the machines do not have hard drives, so they are not
capable of storing very much on their limited flash memory. None of
the machines aimed at American markets have input devices like
CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or even floppy drives, so playing Tomb Raider or
making a spreadsheet in Microsoft Office will have to wait for the
full-function personal computer to boot up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The personal computer has a lot of functionality that a lot of
people don't necessarily need,'' said Bryan Ma, consumer device
analyst for the International Data Corp., a consulting group that
tracks global technology information.
</P>
<P>
   Ma said he was optimistic that Internet appliances would become
mass market devices because consumers are increasingly unwilling to
pay for expensive and hard-to-maintain computer bells and whistles,
features that many never wanted anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all they want to do is go on the Web,'' Ma said, ``then an
information appliance might be all they need.''
</P>
<P>
   But Riseland, echoing the sentiments of other Internet appliance
makers, said that the appliances are not intended only for the
technological have-nots. Manufacturers hope that Internet
appliances will also serve as convenient companion technologies to
people who are happy with their computers but want a faster, easier
way to go online. Many makers of Internet appliances, after all,
are heavily invested in the future of personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   A simple way of understanding the difference between an Internet
appliance and a personal computer, Dunstan of Acer said, is to
think of a PC as a kitchen stove that can do lots of things _ bake,
cook, fry. Then think of an information appliance as a coffee
maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can brew coffee on a stove, but you can do it a lot easier
with a coffee maker,'' Dunstan said. ``That's the whole idea. An
Internet appliance does one or two things really, really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Martin and her husband, Chuck, were among the first to buy
an i-opener, just before Christmas last year. They did so because
they didn't like bothering with the family's home computer, a
10-year-old Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin, a 39-year-old homemaker, said the family, which
includes two children, uses the i-opener ``a lot more'' than it
used the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   ``We check it for weather or the news,'' she said, ``and all we
have to do is hit a button and it tells us what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Martin, senior pastor of Fellowship of the Hills Church near
his family's home in Austin, Texas, said he thinks of the Mac and
the i-opener as separate kinds of devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to do anything from play games to create documents,
I go use the Mac,'' Mr. Martin said. ``If I want to just send
e-mail, check someone on the Web, order tickets, call out for
pizza, I do it on the i-opener. On that machine I don't have to sit
down and wait for it to boot up, get the right program and wait for
a few windows to open up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Martins keep their i-opener on a countertop between the
living room and the kitchen. ``I'm on it all the time,'' Ms. Martin
said. ``I imagine myself as Jane Jetson.''
</P>
<P>
   The i-opener, made and managed by Austin-based Netpliance, has
paid a bit of a price to be the first Net appliance on the market.
The i-opener's keyboard is attached with an unslightly Y-cable for
anyone wishing to use an optional mouse rather than the
keyboard-based pointer.Several other soon-to-be-offered Internet
appliances use wireless keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, setting up the i-opener is almost as simple as
plugging in a telephone answering machine. Several users said they
were surprised to discover that once the machine was plugged in to
the telephone and power lines, it automatically dialed its access
numbers and configured itself in a few minutes.

 &HT;    Atlanta officials traveling to Florida, Ohio as part of double
slaying probe
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The murder investigation that has landed NFL star Ray
Lewis in jail has taken Atlanta homicide detectives to Miami-Dade
County in South Florida and to Akron, Ohio, to pursue more leads.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the city's Criminal Investigations Division
said Wednesday that a homicide investigator is in Miami working
with Metro-Dade police to question someone who may have been riding
in Lewis' stretch limo the morning Jacinth Baker and Richard Lollar
were stabbed during a fight in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Police traveled without an arrest warrant, the investigator
said.
</P>
<P>
   A homicide investigator was dispatched to Akron on Tuesday to
question the victims' relatives, the investigator said. Detective
Washington Lacy of Akron police confirmed the Atlanta investigator
was there.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two homicide detectives went to Baltimore, but
returned to Atlanta after questioning Lewis acquaintance A.J.
Johnson. Police had said Johnson and Kwame King, a high school
football teammate of Lewis', also may have ridden in the football
star's limousine on Super Bowl night.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a former football player at the University of Maryland,
has denied he partied with Lewis on Super Bowl weekend. He said he
was questioned by Atlanta police and has since hired an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   King, on the other hand, has not spoken to police, said his
Atlanta attorney, Bruce Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate he will be questioned by the prosecution and
Lewis' attorney,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Lollar's relatives in Ohio said they plan to attend a
bond hearing for Lewis scheduled for Monday at 9 a.m. in Fulton
County Superior Court in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be at all of them,'' said Lollar's cousin, Charita
Lollar-Hale, as she sat in the West Akron home of her grandmother,
Joyce Lollar. ``I just want to hear what happened. If I didn't have
to go to court, I wouldn't go back.''

   The i-opener delivered on its promise to provide quick and easy
access to the Internet. The pre-set function keys quickly fetched
weather and news information over a standard telephone line and a
built-in 56K modem. Only occasionally and after many hours of use
did the machine freeze. Pressing the Hang Up key and letting it
reconnect to the Internet solved the problem in a couple of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The i-opener, which uses an operating system that is a variation
of Linux, had no trouble playing streaming audio and then playing,
for example, Internet radio through its tiny, built-in speakers.
But it could not play streaming video, locking users out of some of
the hottest offerings on the World Wide Web. Officials for i-opener
said the device is not equipped to handle streaming video, but
later versions of the machine are more likely to.
</P>
<P>
   Munira Fareed, director of product marketing for Netpliance,
said the i-opener, which weighs about 5 pounds and relies on 32
megabytes of random access memory and 16 MB of flash memory, uses a
lot of compression technologies to manage its data. And much like
the WebTV set-top box, i-opener automatically goes online
periodically to update and store information like weather and news
that consumers are likely to want very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   By caching the information, Fareed explained, the i-opener does
not have to go online every time someone presses the weather key.
</P>
<P>
   With some mostly minor variations in style and feel, most of the
Internet appliances to be released this year will probably have a
flat, laptoplike monitor, a keyboard and a 56K modem. Some will be
equipped to accommodate high-speed broadband access.
</P>
<P>
   David Armitage, chief executive and founder of Qubit Technology,
is banking on a wireless variation on the theme: the Qubit Web
Tablet is scheduled for release by July. Looking very little like
the competition, the Qubit is basically a handheld touch screen
with a few buttons on its border. When a user touches virtual
buttons on its 10-inch, color LCD screen _ much like using an
automated teller machine _ the device uses radio waves to
communicate with a separate module about the size of two packs of
playing cards that will connect to the Internet through either a
56K, digital subscriber line or cable modem. Indoors, the device's
range will be about 250 feet, Armitage said. The Qubit can be
seated in a recharging cradle that also houses a pullout, wireless
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the Qubit Web Tablet is expected to be about $400
when it reaches retail shelves by Christmas, Armitage said. But
consumers are more likely, he said, to be introduced to the
2.5-pound Qubit by way of a telecommunications or cable company or
Internet service provider using it as part of a service package.
The Qubit will be able to use most ISPs, including America Online
and MSN, unlike some of the other devices, like the i-opener, which
uses only its own Internet provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is not to use the information appliance as a Trojan
horse for becoming an Internet service provider and then lock you
in,'' Armitage said. ``I want to deliver an experience that is
different from a PC to homes that may already have an ISP and may
not want to switch.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether consumers will shop and browse the Web with
a wireless touch-screen pad or even buy a stripped-down,
Internet-only computer is a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The honest answer,'' said Dunstan at Acer, ``is that it is an
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, computer hardware and software designers widely
agree that the near future will be one marked with
Internet-connected devices practically everywhere and always ready
to offer a virtual hand. Lamar Potts, vice president of marketing
for Be, said in the next couple of years the average American can
expect to own an Interned-connected stereo, kitchen appliances like
toasters and refrigerators. And all of the devices wordlessly
chatting with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Communications, a technology consulting group, projects
that by 2002 the average American household will have 2.7 online
devices.
</P>
<P>
   In time, said Potts, ``you are going to have one literally in
every room of your house.''

SHARES FALL ON WORRIES OVER RATES AND INTERNET INTRUDERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks fell sharply Wednesday as technology issues,
which have been strong recently, fell.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Nasdaq composite index, which had posted seven
consecutive gains, and the Dow Jones industrial average lost ground
in the same session for the first time since Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were weighed down by a variety of factors, including
rising interest rates, word that European antitrust authorities are
investigating Microsoft and more attacks involving cyberspace
security that prompted Attorney General Janet Reno to call a news
conference to announce intensified action against Internet
intruders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the event that helped spook today's market,''
said Timothy M. Stevenson, a senior portfolio manager at First
Capital Group, referring to disruptions of two hours at ZDNet and
30 minutes at Internet broker ETrade Group.
</P>
<P>
   After posting a gain of 33 points early, the Nasdaq index
tumbled in late morning and ended with a loss of 64.26 points, or
1.45 percent, at 4,363.24. The Dow Jones industrial average gave
ground from the start and finished with a loss of 258.44 points, or
2.36 percent, to 10,699.16.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was down 30.02 points, or
2.08 percent, to 1,411.70.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest casualties was Microsoft, a component of all
the major indexes, which slumped 5 15/16 to 104.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology stocks are starting to slump,'' said Daniel C.
Mathisson, a senior trader at D.E. Shaw. ``We saw a pretty
incredible run-up but we're now seeing a lot of selling for the
first time in about two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The breadth of the day's decline was evident in the decline of
27 of the Dow's 30 stocks and 394 of those in the S.&AMP;P. 500.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market weakened for longer maturities pressuring
financial stocks, with American Express down 6 7/16 to 156 9/16 to
pace the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks suffered from prospects that some producers will
raise output. Drug stocks were mostly lower by one to two points
but Merck, the subject of an article in The Wall Street Journal
about its expiring patents, skidded 4 1/16 to 71].
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, hit by an engineers' strike, fell 1 13/16 to 39.
</P>
<P>
   But it was technology, which powered the Nasdaq to its latest
record on Tuesday, whose reversal captured much of the attention.
Besides Microsoft's big loss, Amazon.com fell 2~ to 80\, eBay
dropped 5} to 164. Intel dropped 4 3/16 to 104| and Yahoo fell 10
13/16 to 362 5/16. IBM dropped 1 7/16 to 117].
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which reported surprisingly strong earnings and a
stock split after the market's close on Tuesday, finished Wednesday
at 128 13/16. That was 4 points ahead of Tuesday's official close
but down from 131 5/8 at which it had settled in after-hours
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the selloff in technology, many analysts remained
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The market ``is just taking a breather,'' said Steven M.
Frenkel, chief investment strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann, citing
what he believes will be ever-larger productivity gains ahead for
the American economy. ``I would buy all these dips.''
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo, which reported better-than-expected earnings, climbed
11/16 to 34, while Allstate fell 2[ to 19 7/8, a new low, after
reporting an earnings decline and being downgraded by Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange surpassed the
billion-share mark as nearly twice as many issues fell as rose,
2,017 to 1,028. There were 182 new 52-week lows compared with 101
new highs. Nasdaq volume was 1.77 billion shares.

`SNOW' COULD LEAVE YOU COLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The snow in ``Snow Day'' falls in Syracuse, N.Y., where snow
isn't all that rare. Doesn't matter. It could have fallen in July
in Miami, and it still wouldn't have made the movie interesting.
</P>
<P>
   This Paramount/Nickelodeon co-production appears to be trying to
synthesize one of the innocuous Disney comedies of the '60s and
'70s with standard-issue contemporary grossness. It also appears to
be oblivious to the fact that television, including Nickelodeon,
provides more lively family comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Which is too bad, because ``Snow Day's'' premise _ that anything
can happen on a snow day, when schools are closed and kids are free
_ had potential for imagination and magic. What happens to the
movie's Brandston family, however, is pretty run-of-the-mill.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age Hal (Mark Webber), our narrator, seizes the opportunity
to pursue his crush on the most sought-after girl in school
(Emmanuelle Chriqui), with the help of a platonic friend (Schuyler
Fisk), who carries her own torch for Hal. Hal's little sister,
Natalie (Zena Grey), does battle with the evil Snowplowman (Chris
Elliott), in an effort to get a rare second snow day (in scenes
that are, when you stop to think about it, kind of creepy). Little
Randy (Connor Matheus) tries to regain the attention of his
workaholic mother (Jean Smart). And Tom (Chevy Chase), the
Brandston patriarch, is a low-rated, buffoonish weather forecaster
trying to regain his dignity _ a metaphor, it would seem, for
Chase's entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Any movie that makes you feel sorry for Chase and Elliott is off
to a bad start, and its misuse of punk pioneer Iggy Pop (as an Al
Martino-loving ice-rink DJ) and underuse of '70s cult star Pam
Grier (as Chase's boss) just further the embarrassment level of the
adult actors. Grier's part, in itself, isn't that bad, but what
happened to that career resurgence she was going to get from 1997's
``Jackie Brown?''
</P>
<P>
   The young actors come off better, and the movie earns extra
credit for giving Chriqui's character an understanding heart and
sweet personality, rather than turning her into some nasty-tempered
snob (the same can't be said for her on-again/off-again jock
boyfriend, who's pure stereotype). Another thing going for it:
Despite multitudes of snowballs at his disposal, director Chris
Koch avoids the easy gag of having someone take a hit in the crotch
_ although he does include a fat, flatulent character, whose
gas-passing steps in whenever the writers can't think of a punch
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' suffers that kind of underwriting throughout;
although it's a movie about the joys of a bonus day off from
school, it often makes school look more entertaining. It's not
worth cutting class for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' is rated PG for some Nickelodeon-level swearing and
gross-out gags. &QL;

 David Mermelstein writes about music for The New Criterion.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It must have seemed like such an inconsequential decision back
in 1939. By barring Marian Anderson from singing at Constitution
Hall simply because she was black, the Daughters of the American
Revolution were merely following Washington custom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this single act of discrimination would have an impact far
beyond the capital's cultural life. It would, in fact, light a
slow-burning fuse, one that set off an explosion in late 1955 when
another black woman _ Rosa Parks _ refused to move to the back of a
Montgomery, Ala., bus.
</P>
<P>
   Like Parks, Anderson did not meekly accept the injustice. Having
been refused the DAR hall, she sang instead at the Lincoln
Memorial, to a crowd of 75,000 on Easter Sunday. The scene is
indelible: the modest but unbowed contralto, standing at the temple
to the Great Emancipator, singing ``America.''
</P>
<P>
   That image stands at the center of a new documentary, ``Aida's
Brothers and Sisters: Black Voices in Opera,'' which will be shown
on Wednesday in PBS's ``Great Performances'' series. The program
charts the complex history of black Americans and their struggles
to enter the musical mainstream. Unfolding without benefit of
narration, the documentary allows those who helped break the color
barrier, and those who followed in their wake, to relate the story
in their own fashion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers, Jan Schmidt-Garre and Marieke Schroeder, have
assembled a roster of witnesses that includes Anne Brown, who in
1935 created the female lead in ``Porgy and Bess''; Camilla
Williams, the first to record that role in its entirety; Betty
Allen, a friend of Anderson and the president emeritus of the
Harlem School of the Arts; Grace Bumbry, the first black to sing at
the Bayreuth Festival; and the sopranos Shirley Verrett and Barbara
Hendricks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the array of vintage film clips in the program is the
particularly gratifying one of the soprano Leontyne Price singing
before a DAR gathering 43 years after the organization barred
Anderson.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the story of the black ascent in American concert and
operatic life began well before the Lincoln Memorial concert.
Though thwarted by fierce prejudice, Elizabeth Greenfield and Marie
Selika, both born slaves, had significant careers during the 19th
century. And Sissieretta Jones, dubbed the ``Black Patti,'' in
reference to the celebrated soprano Adelina Patti, performed before
four American presidents and at Madison Square Garden before
retiring in 1916. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike white singers from the late 19th century on, none of
these early black divas left a recorded legacy. ``The most
regrettable aspect of any discussion of black opera singers is that
there may have been black singers as great as Melba or Patti, but
we'll never know for sure,'' said Rosalyn Story, the author of
``And So I Sing: African-American Divas of Opera and Concert,''
which the filmmakers relied on heavily for their work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, it is true, was the first black to sing at the
Metropolitan Opera, in 1955, preceding the baritone Robert McFerrin
(the father of Bobby) by three weeks. And that milestone, coupled
with the legendary Easter Sunday concert, assured her iconic status
in the annals of social as well as musical history. But others were
staking claims in opera contemporaneously with Anderson, and even
before her.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, whose 1951 recording of Bess remains a benchmark, made
her debut at the New York City Opera in the title role of ``Madama
Butterfly'' in 1946, nearly a full decade before Rudolf Bing
allowed Anderson to grace the Met stage. Unmentioned in the
documentary is the tenor Roland Hayes, who died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   A recitalist who performed from World War I until 1972, he was
the first black singer to appear with a symphony and the first to
bring spirituals to predominantly white audiences.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The importance of religion in establishing and supporting black
singers can hardly be underplayed. In the film, the bass-baritone
Simon Estes and Hendricks draw direct links between their
musicianship and their faith. ``The ability to express the
suffering in a Mozart aria is something that I learned from singing
spirituals,'' Hendricks says. Verrett calls these songs of sorrow
and faith ``America's music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams chimes in with a mini-primer on spirituals,
deconstructing ``Nobody Knows the Troubles I've Seen'' in the
process. ``You can't sing a Negro spiritual and be proper,'' she
says wryly.

   Of course, no account of blacks in opera is complete without
reference to ``Porgy and Bess'' and the lingering controversy as to
whether Gershwin's folk opera (even that term invites argument)
helped or hindered black singers. Allen, who ran the Harlem School
of the Arts for more than a decade, confesses that she at first
``loathed'' the work. And Bumbry terms it ``an insult'' to black
people, a curious comment coming from a woman who sang Bess at the
Met just 15 years ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. In the film, Bobby McFerrin says that Gershwin
should be applauded for an honest attempt at understanding the
black experience. Apart from this program, Peter Hemmings, the
executive director of the Los Angeles Opera, called the piece ``a
great help to black singers, because it has given them substantial
work over many years.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Story, who appears in the documentary,
largely agreed with Hemmings, referring to the 1985 Met production
in which Bumbry starred as a ``pivotal point'' in the history of
black singing. With the nation's premiere opera house suddenly
committed to employing scores of black singers, an unrivaled
showcase emerged for black talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put black people on the minds of those who hire for
opera,'' Story said. ``And so they got jobs, at least for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   But Story, who is herself black, sees black success on the
operatic stage as something that requires continued cultivation.
Like most observers, she thinks overt racism is not much of a
factor anymore. Yet that alone, she says, won't guarantee the
gains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the '60s now, when people made an extra point of
including people of color,'' she said. ``We don't have that kind of
spirit now. Opera is not removed from that, and hiring for opera is
a very subjective thing. So with the exception of extraordinary
talents like Jessye Norman and Kathleen Battle, who are going to be
hired regardless, if you're not necessarily thinking about black
people, they can be easily overlooked.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, too, senses that fewer blacks are visible on opera
stages today than, say, 10 years ago. ``I don't want to take a
position on that subject,'' she said by telephone from Germany.
``But I do wonder why there are so few young black singers at the
moment.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hemmings, whose business is hiring opera singers, will have none
of it. ``I honestly don't think about what color people are when
we're casting,'' he said. ``Nor do I feel that it's important that
we should have black singers merely because they're black singers.
We have a black resident artist at the moment, but we don't have
him because he's black. We have him because he's a good singer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the last word _ if there is a last word on this
tangled subject _ really belongs to black artists themselves, for
no one better understands the impact of race on their work.
Hendricks, for one, freely admits that her color has fed her
musicianship. Yet she is quick to point out that she considers art
universal and ``not worth breaking down into little categories.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stand onstage and sing Schubert,'' she said in a recent
conversation, ``I don't sing it as a black woman, I just sing it.''

VERMONT CLOSE TO ADOPTING EQUAL RIGHTS LAW FOR GAY COUPLES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG      
c.2000 N.Y.Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the first strong signal of how Vermont lawmakers
will address the issue of gay marriage, a pivotal committee polled
its members Wednesday and found them leaning heavily toward
guaranteeing equal rights and benefits to gay and lesbian couples,
but not letting them legally marry.
</P>
<P>
   Eight members of the Judiciary Committee of the state's House of
Representatives spoke in favor of a ``civil rights package'' that
would create the most extensive domestic partnership system in the
country, while three spoke in favor of including same-sex couples
in the state's marriage law.
</P>
<P>
   Those favoring domestic partnership tended to emphasize that it
was a politically feasible compromise, given the divided sentiment
about gay marriage in the state; those favoring marriage stressed
that ``separate but equal'' was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   None of the members favored trying to defy the Dec. 20 ruling by
the Vermont Supreme Court that gay couples must be granted the same
treatment as heterosexual spouses in everything from inheritance
rights to health insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In that ruling, the court left it up to the Legislature to
determine how it would equalize the treatment of gay couples:
whether through marriage or domestic partnership. The court
retained the right to revisit the issue, and gave the Legislature
an undefined ``reasonable period of time'' to forge a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many Vermonters have been debating the issue, and
the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have held two public
hearings. The House committee has also heard a range of witnesses,
from religious leaders to experts on the history and law of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But until Wednesday's emotional session, its 11 members had
stayed largely mum about their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the three who backed legal marriage, was Steve Hingtgen, a
representative from Burlington, who argued: ``For all those who
have come before this committee preaching hate in all its poor
disguises, whether with a bible, a law degree or Ph.D. in hand,
those who have filled our ears with hate, they will not be sent a
message of rebuke by this committee by us choosing domestic
partnership. The hateful will have been strengthened by our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pursuing the domestic partnership path validates the hate.
Going with domestic partnership validates the bigotry. It does more
than validate it. It institutionalizes the bigotry and
affirmatively creates an apartheid system of family recognition in
Vermont.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas A. Little, the committee's chairman, argued:
``Leadership requires a keen sense of what ought to be done in the
context of what can be done, what is achievable. Leadership
untempered by careful assessment of the world we live in is not
sound leadership. What is achievable in this General Assembly and
this body politic this year is a broad civil rights bill _ and
speaking for myself, that does not cross the threshold of marriage.
This will deliver the essential civil and legal rights inherent in
our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee will try to finish drafting a domestic partnership
bill by the first week of March, and send it to the House floor.
Senate leaders have promised quick action on the bill, so Vermont
could pass a domestic partnership law by the end of its legislative
session in April.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee's vice-chairman, Rep. William J.
Lippert Jr., said the committee session was so emotional Wednesday
that ``there were some people in tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippert, who backs gay marriage, added: ``I'm disappointed we're
not doing marriage. But I also want to emphasize that if our
committee and Legislature adopt a comprehensive domestic
partnership bill, it will be the single most forward-looking piece
of legislation for gay and lesbian people in the entire United
States, and this is still very big news.''

 &HT;    McCain stoutly defends stand against abortion
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ Anti-abortion groups stepped up their attack
on Arizona Sen. John McCain on Wednesday, while McCain trotted out
new endorsements from prominent religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   A new radio ad from the South Carolina Citizens for Life tells
listeners, ``If you want a strongly pro-life president, then don't
vote for John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, campaigning in Greenville, called the attacks
``vicious'' and said he has ``a 17-year pro-life voting record.''
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Life has endorsed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain have expressed similar views on the issue, with
both generally opposing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said the real reason for the criticism is that
anti-abortion and other interest groups oppose McCain's efforts to
overhaul the system of political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The groups fear their ability to participate in the political
process would be compromised, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to attack me, then that's their privilege to do
so. I wish they would tell the truth, but if they don't, it's not
going to bother me,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the McCain campaign was concerned enough that it
announced that McCain had been endorsed by several local Christian
Coalition and Citizens for Life officials.
</P>
<P>
   He received the endorsement of Greenville Mayor Knox White, a
former Carroll Campbell protege. Campbell, a former South Carolina
governor, is aligned with the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also got help from an unexpected source. The head of the
National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League said it is
ludicrous to suggest that McCain is anything other than strongly
opposed to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain has a record that is starkly anti-choice,'' said
Kate Michelman, NARAL's executive director. ``His record speaks
volumes about the role government should play in a woman's private
reproductive life.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's contention that it is campaign finance reform rather
than abortion that is driving the actions of Citizens for Life and
the National Right-to-Life Committee meshed with a theme he
repeated several times Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting to retain his label as the candidate of reform, McCain
suggested that Bush was being used by special interests because of
the Texas governor's opposition to banning soft money, unlimited
donations to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him as an unwitting pawn,'' McCain told reporters. ``If
he won't support reform of the system, then he becomes part of the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, McCain tried to back off the remark, saying he just hopes
Bush realizes that the system being set up is ``a very bad thing.
If you get too much money into any campaign, it will cause
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say Governor Bush is _ quote _ an unwitting
pawn. All I want to say is I really wish Governor Bush would
realize this is a bad situation for America and he would stop it,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Greenville's City Hall, McCain again hit Bush as the
candidate of Washington insiders, saying ``the entire Washington
establishment'' is campaigning in South Carolina for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told supporters they are in for an unpredictable 10 days
before the Feb. 19 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to go on a wild ride, hitch on because we're going
places that we don't know we're going ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Bush surrogates in South Carolina this week were Sen.
Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.). He campaigned for Bush with Sen. Phil Gramm
of Texas, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma and Sen. Tim Hutchinson of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, in a telephone interview from Washington, said 44
Republicans in the Senate endorsed Bush rather than their colleague
because McCain ``often swims in an entirely different direction
from his party.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited McCain's support for the 1998 tobacco bill, which would
have increased a pack of cigarettes by $1.10, and the campaign
finance bill, as well as his opposition to a disaster relief bill
that contained money for Georgia farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He even tried to stop funding for the Centennial Olympics,''
Coverdell said. ``Sam (Nunn) and I had to fight off two attempts to
undo support from the Department of Defense.''

HOMOSEXUALITY, UNITY AMONG LECTURE TOPICS FOR MINISTERS WEEKS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sin and suffering, homosexuality, Christian unity and ministry
in an electronic age are among lecture topics this week during
Ministers Weeks in Fort Worth and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers from throughout the nation are attending the annual
lecture series at Texas Christian University's Brite Divinity
School in Fort Worth and at Southern Methodist University's Perkins
School of Theology in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barbara Brown Taylor, an Episcopal priest in the
Diocese of Atlanta, delivered the Wells Lectures on sin and
repentance at University Christian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who has lectured at Yale, Princeton and Duke
universities, is the author of seven books, including ``When God Is
Silent,'' ``God in Pain,'' ``Home by Another Way,'' ``Teaching
Sermons on Suffering'' and the forthcoming ``The Luminous Web:
Essays on Science and Religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tex Sample, retired professor of church and society at St. Paul
School of Theology in Kansas City, Mo., and author of ``Blue Collar
Ministry,'' lectured on ``Prophetic Ministry in an Electronic
Age.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Myers, professor of religion at Duke University, discussed
``Women in the Old Testament.'' Myers is editor in chief of
Houghton Mifflin Co.'s ``Women in Scripture: A Dictionary of Named
and Unnamed Women in the Hebrew Bible, Apocrypha and New
Testament.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lectures at Dallas' Perkins School of Theology addressed
the volatile subject of the role of gays and lesbians in the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicist Charles E. Curran, SMU's Scurlock professor of human
values, spoke on ``A Catholic Approach to Moral Theology and
Homosexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dialogue on the Bible, Theology and Homosexuality,'' was be
the theme of the Jackson Lecture by Richard B. Hays of Duke
Divinity School and Victor P. Furnish of Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Mark Trotter, senior pastor of First United Methodist
Church of San Diego, and Maxie D. Dunnam, president of Asbury
Theological Seminary, presented the Fondren Lecture on ``Building
Bridges Under Icy Waters _ The Church and Theological Diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Preaching on Controversial Issues; The Preacher as Subversive
Sage,'' was the topic of the Peyton Lectures by Alyce M. McKenzie
of Perkins.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer Arias, former bishop of the United Methodist Church in
Bolivia, delivered the Barton Lecture, titled ``On Diversity:
Theological and Otherwise _ A Hispanic//Latino Perspective.''

`SMOKE' SIGNALS A CHANGE FOR CAMPION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that Kate Winslet could ever be at peace.
Her dark, probing eyes and perpetually pursed lips give her an aura
of indignant defiance, which cracks only when she breaks into one
of her wide smiles. Even then, you sense that any joy would cause
Winslet's mind to race to the point of insomnia. So when her
character, Ruth, is serene at the beginning of ``Holy Smoke!'' _
dancing blissfully in an Indian ashram _ you know that the peace
can't last. It doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the feeling that ``Holy Smoke!'' is saying anything
with a straight face. Our first clue that this isn't about Indian
culture is the sound of Neil Diamond's ``Holly Holy'' blaring on
the soundtrack as Winslet and others whirl. And then Jane Campion's
name comes up as director, and you know that this is one of
Campion's stories about what happens when people try to mess with
an independent-minded woman.
</P>
<P>
   At face value, ``Holy Smoke!'' isn't very good _ it's short on
coherence and long on silliness _ but that doesn't mean it isn't
entertaining. Campion, perhaps tired of the restraints she put on
herself with ``Portrait of a Lady'' and ``The Piano,'' really lets
loose here, and part of the fun is wondering what she'll do next.
</P>
<P>
   She briefly flirts with the Eastern-Western culture clash, even
though Ruth's home country _ Australia _ and India aren't even in
different hemispheres. When Ruth's mother (Julie Hamilton),
concerned that Ruth has sold her soul to a charismatic cult leader,
comes to India to con her into going back to Sydney, Mum is
appalled at what she sees: The Delhi streets, crowded and filthy,
are a far cry from the cookie-cutter trimness of Mum's Sydney
suburb. They hardly seem more dirty or overpopulated than the
family's Australian living room, though, which is a zoo of
eccentric relatives and, yes, a pet sheep.
</P>
<P>
   But the set-up scenes are a bit of a red herring. The movie
really begins when Harvey Keitel, as an ``exit consultant'' hired
to deprogram Ruth, strides in like the Marlboro Man, sporting
cowboy boots, jet-black clothing and hair, shades, mustache and
soul patch, and showing off by twirling luggage carriers toward
surprised passengers at an airport. Keitel's character, P.J.
Waters, even gets his own Neil Diamond theme song: the dime-store
existentialist classic ``I Am, I Said.''
</P>
<P>
   But P.J.'s entrance is a long way from where he will wind up at
the end of the movie. When, with the family's help, he abducts Ruth
and takes her to a desert hideaway to drive the cult out of her,
she turns out to be more than his match, and they begin to feel a
reluctant attraction. Here, the movie starts turning into
Deprogrammers Are From Mars, Cult Members Are From Venus. Except
that, gradually, Ruth begins flipping the traditional male-female
(and older-man/younger-woman) roles. Wait'll you see where that
leads them.
</P>
<P>
   Campion's movie, Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Magnolia'' and Tim
Robbins' ``Cradle Will Rock'' _ two movies as different from each
other as they are from ``Holy Smoke!'' _ are part of an odd
subgenre: the control-freak mess, ambitious movies made by
directors who are obsessive about getting their points made. ``Holy
Smoke!'' is all over the place, but Campion always knows exactly
where she's taking it; even the Outback skies and landscapes look
art-directed, as if Campion had added a coat of paint to the desert
to shade it to her liking.
</P>
<P>
   Campion makes it clear that although Ruth might be under the
influence of a guru, she's still the most individualistic person in
the movie; everyone else is defined by the logos on their clothing.
Sophie Lee, who nearly steals the movie as Ruth's shallow
sister-in-law, even changes the polish on her talonlike nails to
match her outfit of the day. Winslet, on the other hand, gets to
the point where she doffs her clothes completely.
</P>
<P>
   Winslet, whose response to the monstrous success of ``Titanic''
has been to dabble in risky movies like this and last year's
``Hideous Kinky,'' has received a lot of praise for this
performance. (Although The New Yorker's Anthony Lane panned the
movie, he practically wrote Winslet a mash note for her acting.)
It's a gutsy performance, all right, and Winslet rips into it, but
she deserves kudos merely for pulling it off with a straight face,
as it gets increasingly ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   People who balked at the self-serious pretentiousness of ``The
Piano'' might be glad to see that Campion has made a lateral move
to self-mocking pretentiousness with ``Holy Smoke!'' Her gifts for
imagery and imagination might make it worth a peek. But its key
insight _ that certain types of men could benefit from being a
little more sensitive _ is the type that you can get from any
magazine rack.

BIG WEST SEEKS HIGHER PROFILE
</HEADLINE>
 WEST PACKAGE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge joins a conference in
transition, one that enjoys a strong tradition in several sports
but wants more widespread recognition. It also has grown tired of
schools coming and going and wants to build around a group of
similar institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Big West Conference already is powerful in
women's volleyball, softball and baseball. But unless fans are
familiar with those sports, chances are there's little or no
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Dennis Farrell knows a conference's national
identity is based on how well its football and men's basketball
programs fare. The Big West doesn't sponsor football and needs to
improve its men's basketball programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aspire to be nationally competitive in baseball, volleyball
and softball. Those are realistic,'' Farrell said. ``We want to
enhance our position in men's and women's basketball and men's and
women's soccer. ... We want to be the strongest non-football
conference in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how does it achieve this lofty goal? Actually,
it's no secret. The schools need to win. To do that, they need to
recruit well, beat as many established programs as possible and get
as many teams into the NCAA tournaments as possible.
</P>
<P>
   And they need to do these things consistently.
</P>
<P>
   To beat the traditional powers, you need the recruits. Yet how
do you outrecruit the traditional powers to get the athletes you
need to beat those powers?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a greater burden to overcome,'' Pac-10 commissioner
Tom Hansen said. ``(They) are a little bit out of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen suggested upgrading facilities. He said USC and
Washington, which play in the two worst Pac-10 arenas, are building
or renovating.
</P>
<P>
   Another suggestion, this one from West Coast Conference
commissioner Michael Gilleran: Hire coaches who can bring in those
elite athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a creative, gifted and talented coach who can
inspire, you can make things happen,'' Gilleran said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the easiest way to national exposure is through
television.
</P>
<P>
   TV or not TV
</P>
<P>
   From 1981-96, Nevada-Las Vegas played in the Big West, and won
an NCAA men's basketball championship in 1990. Soon after, ESPN
included the Big West as part of its college basketball ``Big
Monday'' package.
</P>
<P>
   However, UNLV left the Big West in 1996 and with it went ESPN.
The conference never has enjoyed the same exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Big West has a six-game package with ESPN and a
two-game package with Fox Sports Net, plus the men's and women's
basketball conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been difficult,'' Farrell said. ``We've never had
the package the Pac-10 or Big Ten or Big 12 has.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the networks aren't interested in expanding the coverage _
and won't be until the Big West proves it can draw viewers as UNLV
did.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinton, Fox Sports Net's vice president of programming,
said it goes back to the need to regularly beat the big-time
schools and go deep into the NCAA Tournament. National ranking
helps, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sinton said the Big West should examine Gonzaga. That WCC school
reached the NCAAs a year ago and beat Minnesota, Stanford and
Florida before falling in the Elite Eight to eventual champion
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonzaga did a great job and opened a lot of eyes,'' Sinton
said. ``But if they don't come back again for four to five years,
people will forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Long Beach State has won 14 consecutive games. The
49ers could be this seasons's Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Why Northridge? Numerous schools _ UNLV, Boise State, San Jose
State, Fresno State, Hawaii, North Texas and Arkansas State, to
name a few _ have come and gone, leaving the conference in a
constant state of flux. Farrell expects Idaho and Utah State to
eventually leave and find a football-playing conference, so the
search is on for schools who share the athletic, academic and
geographic makeup of the existing members.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell says Northridge is a natural fit. Not only is it part of
the same system as Fullerton, Long Beach and San Luis Obispo, it
also is geographically close to these other schools, and it brings
in the highly populated, athlete-rich San Fernando Valley into the
fold.
</P>
<P>
   As for national exposure, Northridge or UC Riverside won't
immediately be of much help. It's up to all the schools to share in
the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need strong basketball. We want to be televised,'' Long
beach State president Robert Maxson said. ``We want to pay
attention to the other programs. We thing the conference is made up
of schools and sports that Californians care about.''

YOUNG LOVE, BAD DECISIONS COST TWO WOMEN DEARLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amy Ralston Pofahal and Kemba Smith look older than their years,
which is understandable when you're locked up in the same place
every hour of every day, and your thoughts are your worst enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Lines have taken up permanent residence under Pofahal's eyes and
across her forehead; when she sobs, she looks pitiful. Smith simply
looks disgusted and disoriented. Her eyes water quickly, her voice
cracks, her face droops, especially when the topic is her son, 4,
who tells Catherine Crier and a Court TV camera crew: ``Jail is for
bad people. But Mommy isn't bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not how federal prosecutors view Smith, a
woman they're convinced was not only bad but awfully stupid, not
only in terms of her involvement with drugs and illegal activity
but in loving her drug-dealing boyfriend _ all to the tune of a
24-year-sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Pofahal got 24 years, too, for three counts of importing and
distributing the designer drug Ecstasy, as well as money
laundering, all start-up businesses of her hubby, who landed only
four years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad decisions?'' says a former congressman interviewed in
``Crime Stories,'' airing at 9 p.m. Monday on Court TV, the network
trying to broaden its appeal. ``She made quite a few of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Their cases resurface again, just in time for Valentine's Day,
under the cute-but-sorrowful title ``Prisoners of Love,'' since
they are the poster women for love gone terribly awry.
</P>
<P>
   Crier's presence doesn't lend a lot of credibility here _ she
still reminds me of someone impersonating a newsperson _ but the
drama surrounding the subjects is compelling all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Pofahal and Smith are among the women hit with stiff mandatory
minimum sentences to federal prisons because of their blind _ and
amazingly naive _ loyalty to significant others who were breaking
the law.
</P>
<P>
   Enacted in 1986 to fight off the rising crack epidemic, the
strict law handcuffed judges who might have seen something
different in the cases of Pofahal and particularly Smith, something
that might have encouraged the judges to toss out their convictions
or at least lower their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Pofahal was 18 when she moved to Dallas in 1979 from small-town
Arkansas, seeking a modeling career and a man with a sizable bank
account. She was one-for-two. At age 25, she met Sandy Pofahal, a
44-year-old millionaire attorney with his hands in dirty cookie
jars, most of them involving a multimillion-dollar clandestine
international Ecstasy empire.
</P>
<P>
   They married in 1985 and lived the high life in plush Highland
Park. It's no doubt that Amy's jet-set lifestyle was fueled by
Sandy's profits from his illegal business empire. When he was
arrested in 1989, Sandy and several co-defendants were charged in a
wide-ranging conspiracy, but he worked out a deal to cooperate with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Amy was left dangling. She'd already lied to federal prosecutors
trying to make a case against her husband and had hidden and
transported large quantities of money to keep him afloat. She ended
up with 24 years, no parole.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, Sandy, the head of the operation, snagged just a
four-year sentence. He's now back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's boyfriend, found dead in a hotel room, wasn't as lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Smith met Michael Peter Hall at Hampton University; he was
another older guy (he was 29, she 18) charming a younger,
impressionable woman. They fell in love, and by the time he was
first arrested for drug dealing, Smith was convinced he'd been
railroaded.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't been, of course, and before long, Smith was pulled
deeper into his world of money and abuse and murder. Pregnant and
suicidal, Smith finally left Hall and returned home to her parents
in Richmond, Va., hoping to cut a deal with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   It was too late. Shortly after Hall was found dead, prosecutors
faced with no defendant targeted Smith as an active participant.
Rather than take her chances with a sympathetic jury, Smith pleaded
guilty to money laundering, lying to federal authorities and
conspiracy to distribute 255 kilograms of crack.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and her lawyer thought she'd get 24 months. They were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pofahal, Smith never even lived in luxury off the drugs
Hall was peddling. Now her son, Amani, is being raised by her
parents. He sees her every two months.
</P>
<P>
   Photos show the two smiling and hugging. It's heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime Stories'' uses sources from Families Against Mandatory
Minimums, a former congressional staffer and a Georgia congressman
who sees the law only in black and white to explain what still
doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.
</P>
<P>
   Nonviolent offenders are taking the fall, and they are usually
scared out of their wits while involved in abusive relationships.
While not all such offenders are innocent, even hard-liners like
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Georgia, must see that when lower-level
participants get far more time than the conspiracy leaders, the
system is out of line.
</P>
<P>
   But members of Congress don't want to be labeled soft on crime.
Instead, they seem willing to see these women victimized twice _ by
their men and by the system.

U.S. HOPES TO EXPAND SANCTIONS AGAINST SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to tighten pressure on the Yugoslav
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the Clinton administration said
Wednesday that it supported a plan to expand some sanctions against
Belgrade while allowing resumption of some commercial airline
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective sanction so far, according to many officials,
has been the little-publicized tool of refusing travel visas to
Milosevic's political and financial supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan of tougher sanctions announced by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, the number of associates of Milosevic
officially barred from traveling to the United States and the
nations of the European Union would be increased from the current
600, perhaps as much as 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also backed a plan, to be presented to the
European Union's general affairs council in Brussels on Monday, to
strengthen enforcement of a ban on banking transfers from
Yugoslavia to European capitals, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state made the announcement at a joint
appearance here with the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   In response to requests from the struggling opposition parties
in Serbia, the ban on flights by airlines of European Union
countries would be suspended for six months. If free and fair
elections were not held in Yugoslavia within six months from the
lifting of the ban, the concession on the flights would be
``automatically'' withdrawn, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   How to undermine Milosevic, who has been indicted by the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, while unifying the
squabbling factions of the opposition has been a subject of
considerable debate within the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has let it be known in recent weeks that one of her
most fervent hopes for the remainder of her term is to see the end
of Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   A recent round of political killings in Belgrade has encouraged
some administration officials to speculate that Milosevic's regime
may implode. The Yugoslav defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, was
shot and killed on Monday as he was eating dinner in a Belgrade
soccer club. Last month, the Serbian paramilitary leader and close
associate of Milosevic, Zeljko Raznatovic, was shot dead eating
dinner at the Intercontinental Hotel in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of these killings and whether they were masterminded
by Milosevic is still unclear. But what does seem clear is that the
dominant black-market economy in Serbia and fights over who
controls it are resulting in increased tensions within ruling
circles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In that respect, officials said, the visa ban on close
associates of Milosevic _ many of them accustomed to high living in
European capitals and on checking up on their foreign investments _
has been most effective. Some of these associates appear to be
complaining that Milosevic's rule is hurting rather than benefiting
them.
</P>
<P>
   By tightening the screws with the tougher travel ban, the
administration hopes that further cracks will emerge in the
Belgrade government.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, the administration had rejected proposals by
European countries to lift the ban on civilian airline flights to
Belgrade. Such an easing would open the door to lifting other
sanctions, administration officials argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said Wednesday that the airline flights would be
permitted because they had been requested by the opposition
parties. The secretary has met twice in recent months with leaders
of the Serbian opposition, and her aides are in daily contact with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are making very clear that the sanctions are going to
be targeted, expanded and tightened against those from the regime
that are not allowing the people of Serbia to express their will,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and the United States have comparable
regulations banning bank transfers from Belgrade, but enforcement
has been lax in Europe, the State Department said. The European
Union had pledged to increase its staffing to monitor and stop such
transactions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But how effective these banking sanctions would be remained an
open question. ``It's like squeezing jello,'' one official said.

 By JOHN MARKOFF    c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Internet's greatest strength has proved to
be its most disturbing weakness.
</P>
<P>
   As attackers aiming a barrage of data overwhelmed some major
commercial Internet sites for a third day, the global network's
administrators scrambled Wednesday to find a way to protect it and
trace the culprits.
</P>
<P>
   But the network's designers acknowledged that the attacks
exploited the same attributes of the Internet that over the last
five years have made it one of the world's most effective engines
for commercial and technical innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fundamental consequence of an open system,'' said
Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor who has written on the
Internet's social and legal aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent episodes in which Web sites were defaced or credit
card records were stolen from an online music retailer, this week's
attacks have not involved stolen or altered data. But in a world of
growing dependence on the Internet, even being denied access to an
Internet web site like Etrade can have an economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Internet veterans muse about potential technical
disasters in an increasingly interconnected world. What has been
seen so far is not the Internet's Vietnam, they say, but only an
alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are nightmare scenarios that are real, but that's not
where we are,'' said David Clark, an MIT professor who was one of
the Internet's original designers.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, finding ways to contain anti-social acts in such a
system _ one that by its very design permits anonymous behavior _
without compromising its openness is proving increasingly thorny
for network designers, law enforcement officials and civil
libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have run into a situation where the attackers are
coordinated and organized but the people who have to respond _ both
companies, Internet service providers, and most particularly law
enforcement agencies _ are fragmented,'' said Mark Rasch, a former
U.S. federal prosecutor who is currently a vice president at Global
Integrity, a computer security consulting firm based in Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   This week's attacks have exploited a set of software programs
developed over the last year, computer security experts said
Wednesday. Known variously as Tribe Flood Network, Trinloo and
Stacheldraht (German for ``barbed wire''), the programs first
identify individual computers on the Internet with specific
security flaws, then use those computers as launching pads for an
orchestrated attack.
</P>
<P>
   Like the sorcerer's apprentice, the programs allow a small group
or even an individual to squirt a giant firehose of data at one or
many targets, inundating a Web site's computers with data.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is not easy to identify the person holding the
hose. In some cases, the malicious programs systematically falsify
the network addresses from which the data is sent.
</P>
<P>
   But although the consequences of these programs are harmful, it
is just this kind of novel intervention that the Internet was
designed to make possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Clark and two other MIT computer network
researchers, Jerry Salzer and David P. Reed, first described one of
the Internet's most powerful aspects: that it was a simple network
_ or even a ``stupid'' one, as it was later described by David
Isenberg, then an AT&AMP; T Bell Labs researcher _ in contrast to the
more centralized, or ``intelligent,'' and tightly controlled
telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   The very simplicity of the Internet, they wrote, made it a
platform for innovation in ways that a more centralized and tightly
controlled network could never evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade the Internet has served as a virtual
laboratory for new ideas _ from low-cost communications systems
that have redefined telephone, radio and television, to business
methods that have remade industries like stock trading, auctions
and bookselling.
</P>
<P>
   But that same power for innovation can be redirected upon the
data network that is simultaneously remarkably resilient as well as
extremely vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a network owner of a specific network wants to add some
kind of cool feature it doesn't matter in an internetworked
world,'' said Isenberg. Because there is no central point of
control, as on other networks, ``you have the control way out on
the edges, and anyone can do anything,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet pioneers are concerned that incidents such as
this week's attacks may lead to increasing calls for government and
law enforcement intervention into the structure of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, for example, the Clinton administration began
circulating a plan for an extensive software system monitoring
government computers, and possibly those of private industry, to
protect data networks from intruders.
</P>
<P>
   The network, known as the Federal Intrusion Detection Network,
or Fidnet, alarmed civil libertarians who said it could potentially
be used to curtail privacy in the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger of any terrorism is not so much in the act
itself as the overreaction,'' said Robert Frankston, a computer
researcher who is the co-inventor of the spreadsheet. ``The
Internet has enabled rapid economic growth because it has made it
difficult to prevent disruptive innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   And he suggested that the Internet becomes more secure as it
experiences attacks and its administrators reconfigure it to repel
invaders _ ``just as our immune system is strengthened by exposure
to disease.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, some veteran law enforcement officials said there
was no simple centralized solution to these kinds of attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that if you're smart about this there is no
trail for law enforcement to follow,'' said Scott Charney, who
until recently was the Justice Department's top computer crime
official and who is now a partner at Price Waterhouse. ``There are
obvious privacy implications. The real question is how strong a
response do you want.''
</P>
<P>
   The best response, several computer security experts said, will
be to strengthen the security of individual computers on the
Internet. That would make it more difficult for the automated
programs that now take over many systems to find systems to
exploit.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deplorable number of people have not secured their
computers,'' said Stephen Wolff, executive director of the Advanced
Internet Initiatives Division at Cisco Systems. ``We need to think
globally, but act locally.''

FBI STARTS PROBE AS VANDALS ATTACK MORE WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer vandals struck more of the nation's top e-commerce Web
sites Wednesday as the FBI launched a full-scale investigation and
urged tighter corporate defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Companies including online shopping and news service ZDNet and
the ETrade Inc. brokerage service reported electronic strikes that
blocked customers from calling up the companies' Web sites
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week several other major Web companies reported
similar so-called ``denial-of-service'' attacks. Such acts aren't
new, and financial losses from the assaults seemed minor.
</P>
<P>
   But the boldness and scale of the intrusions came as e-commerce
companies have begun to gain a wide following, and the shares of
many fell Wednesday amid the uncertainty generated by the
intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   The assaults showed how much more work is needed to make the
Internet a truly reliable and secure medium for transactions. One
FBI official pointed out that the crippling attacks could have even
been launched by a 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts say the vandals appear to to be using
sophisticated new software tools like those known as ``Tribal
Flood'' and ``Trinoo'' that are able to target a company's hardware
with a swarm of electronic signals from hundreds or even thousands
of other machines, rather than from just a few other locations.
</P>
<P>
   Such techniques could create more powerful disruptions and slow
the growth of electronic commerce. In Washington, the FBI called
upon companies to check their own computers to see whether they had
become unwitting conduits for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, ``security is a community effort,'' said Ron
Dick of the FBI's computer-security division. ``It's a matter of
the community policing itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said it appeared millions of
computer users have been affected so far by the attacks, which she
said ``appear to be intended to interfere with and disrupt
legitimate electronic commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick and others said the agency had identified no strong
suspects responsible for the attacks, or what might be their
motives. He also declined to rule out causes, since tools to launch
them are available over many Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not take much technical expertise to use,'' Dick said.
``A 15-year-old kid could launch these attacks. This is not
something that it takes a great deal of sophistication to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers could face a maximum penalty of five to 10 years in jail
and up to a $250,000 fine, or in some cases ``twice the gross loss
to the victim,'' Dick said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said they are checking whether weak security
measures on the government's own civil or military computers might
have allowed them to be used to convey the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually any company's computers might also be used to convey
the attacks, partly because software to guard against such uses can
cost thousands of dollars to install, said Alex Samonte, chief
engineer of the SiteSmith Web operations company in Santa Clara,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't see a lot of gain; they just saw a lot of
resources being spent,'' he said. Campaigns like the current one
make it more likely hardware administrators will finally begin to
act. The problem, he said, ``has never been quite as public or
blatant.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever launched the attacks earlier this week also struck
online retailers Amazon.com and Buy.com, as well as auction giant
eBay and the popular Yahoo.com portal site.
</P>
<P>
   The companies were able to restore their services in a few hours
and said financial losses were minor. They also said the attackers
didn't obtain customer data, such as credit-card numbers, that
could lead to more trouble for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief result was difficulty for some of our customers in
logging on,'' said Patrick Di Chiro, vice president at ETrade Group
Inc. in Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The company noticed an ``external effort to tie up our lines''
early Wednesday morning, he said, which lasted about two hours and
meant about one in five customers couldn't log on to the company's
main page.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade has about 2 million customers overall; Di Chiro declined
to say how many tried to log on during that time period Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At ZDNet, a unit of San Francisco-based Ziff Davis Inc.,
spokeswoman Martha Papalia said the company noticed about 70
percent of the sites it operates weren't accessible from 7:10 a.m.
to 9:35 a.m. Technicians rapidly began to install a software fix,
but Papalia said it wasn't clear whether that work ended the
problem, or whether the attacks ceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no sense of where they're coming from,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of some of the attacks did harm the image these
companies aim to project of operating robust businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having your site available 24 hours a day is critical to
having the right customer experience,'' said Barry Bycoff of the
Netegrity security firm in Waltham. ``Not having it up gives the
other company a tremendous opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies including Datek Online also reported problems
receiving some traffic via the Internet Wednesday, though the
online brokerage, based in Iselin, N.J., said it didn't believe the
issues were related to the denial-of-service attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials Wednesday said they were reviewing logs kept
by victimized companies to try to determine the sources of the
attacks. They declined to discuss if they suspected where the
attacks originated, though they mentioned foreign-based Internet
companies as a possible source.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Marcinkiewicz, spokeswoman for the FBI's Boston office,
said a report Wednesday wasn't correct that computers in the Boston
area seemed a major source of the attacks. ``I don't think there is
anything that indicates that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Vranesvich, founder of AntiOnline Ltd., a software-security
publisher in Pittsburgh, said he suspects the attacks are the work
of a group of people. The tools to carry them out, he said, only
became widely available last October, and would take time for
anybody to install and lay the groundwork for the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't so sophisticated, since they could have downloaded
sophisticated tools,'' he said. ``What is impressive is the scale.
I haven't seen anything this big since the FBI site was brought
down.''
</P>
<P>
   In that incident, a hacker apparently used similar
denial-of-service tactics to flood the agency's own public Web site
and cause it to be shut down for days. No charges have been filed
in that case, an FBI spokeswoman said.

   ATLANTA _ Rick Ahearn is a Republican advance man of legend, a
veteran of presidential campaigns all the way back to the '60s, a
seasoned warrior of the campaign bus and master of the sound bite
backdrop. He was the aide standing next to President Reagan the day
he got shot.
</P>
<P>
   As he waited for a shoeshine in the Boston airport the day after
his candidate, Steve Forbes, finished a lackluster third in the New
Hampshire primary, Ahearn was also a puzzled man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there aren't as many conservatives in New Hampshire as
there used to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Forbes campaign moved on resolutely to Delaware, which the
conservative publisher won in 1996. But Forbes' efforts to rally an
anti-tax, anti-Washington, anti-abortion base within the party
proved no more effective there than in New Hampshire. He finished
third Tuesday behind Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent nothing in
Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a gigantic hike in the ante as the March 7 mega-primary
nears, Forbes decided to fold, canceling campaign events Wednesday
and scheduling a news conference today to announce his withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The early results this year could easily be a case of too many
conservative candidates. Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer all
plowed the same Iowa cornfields looking for religious
conservatives. All the Republican candidates, in fact, called
themselves conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes' exit leaves Keyes as the only candidate leaning
overtly to his party's right. Even if the flat-taxers and religious
conservatives have become a splintered and ineffective force within
the party, they still generate enough votes to make a big
difference in the unfolding battle for the heart of the Republican
Party. Do the hard-core conservatives split toward McCain, current
darling of the media they distrust, or to the candidate whose
family name has been on the other end of every intraparty battle
they have waged for decades?
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush's tax plan, though not the total revamp Forbes
called for, should have greater appeal to many Forbes voters than
McCain's more modest reduction. Bush also has pursued connections
with the religious right that give him an advantage over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   What McCain has going for him is the powder smell of insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform is by no means a settled question among
conservatives, despite its branding as a liberal issue. McCain has
identified himself as a budget cutter, even questioning the
sacrosanct ethanol subsidy. And he has collected a set of enemies
that recommend him to those of an anti-Washington bent.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has situated himself in the sweet spot of American
politics. He has simultaneously been more outspokenly critical of
the Clinton administration than Bush has, while defining himself in
opposition to and drawing the resentment of Republicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic swings in polls across the country since McCain's
New Hampshire victory illustrate the power of this
pox-on-both-houses insurgency. But if he is to pull off the most
dramatic upset of this young century, everything _ including the
few votes that might have gone to Forbes _ has to break his way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Wednesday that
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had injected religion into the race for U.S.
Senate, adding that she was ``appalled'' that Giuliani had attacked
her in a fund-raising letter for what the mailing called her
``hostility toward America's religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The same letter, signed by Giuliani, also complained about
``liberal judges'' who ``have banned the posting of even the Ten
Commandments in our public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, her face taut, said: ``I am outraged that he would
inject religion into this campaign in any form whatsoever. And to
do it in a way to raise money for his campaign is something that he
should take responsibility for.''
</P>
<P>
   She made her remarks at a hastily called news conference on
Wednesday morning in Rochester, then repeated them later in the day
to more than 1,500 students and faculty members at Syracuse
University. Afterward, she delivered a speech outlining the
education legislation that she said she would introduce as a
senator, including bonus pay for good teachers and college
scholarships for students who commit to teaching for at least four
years in what she called ``high needs'' schools.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the letter that dominated her campaign on the third
day of a bus trip across upstate New York after her official
announcement of her candidacy on Sunday. And although Clinton, a
Methodist, appeared genuinely angry as she responded to the letter,
her campaign staff was jubilant to have caught Giuliani, a Roman
Catholic, in the kind of fund-raising appeal to religious
conservatives that they hope will backfire as he seeks votes in a
state with more Democrats than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani defended the letter during an afternoon news conference
at City Hall in Manhattan, saying that ``not only do I stand by the
letter, I'd like everyone in New York state to read the letter.''
He elaborated on some points in the letter, saying teachers should
be permitted, but not required, to post the Ten Commandments in
their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The Ten Commandments, he added, are ``part of Western
civilization,'' and ``if teachers want to emphasize what is in it
and talk about it, there shouldn't be some kind of inquisition that
they can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani declined to answer a question about how often he goes
to church, saying that religion is ``personal to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page letter, which did not mention Giuliani's more
liberal positions favoring abortion rights, gay rights and gun
control, was first disclosed in an article in the Village Voice
that was posted on the publication's Web site by Tuesday afternoon.
By Tuesday evening, Clinton's campaign staff was engaged in a
flurry of telephone calls about how to react.
</P>
<P>
   At 8 a.m. on Wednesday, Clinton's staff met with her in her
Rochester hotel room as she read the text of the entire letter. By
9 a.m. she had her news conference in a corridor of the hotel. By
10 a.m., in a replay of the kind of rapid response that the
Clintons are known for, Clinton's staff not only had copies of the
letter available for reporters, but also the text and introductions
of a 1996 speech that Clinton delivered to a national convention of
Methodists in which she talked passionately of her religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In that speech, Clinton was introduced by Bishop Richard B.
Wilke, the pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Little
Rock, Ark., who said the first lady had been a Sunday School
teacher, a youth worker and a ``vibrant and vital'' member of his
congregation. Clinton then recounted her childhood as an active
member of the First United Methodist Church of Park Ridge, Ill.,
and her time as an adult at the Foundry United Methodist Church in
Washington, D.C., where she worships many Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church was a critical part of my growing up,'' Clinton
said in that speech. ``And in preparing for this event, I almost
couldn't even list all the ways it influenced me, and helped me
develop as a person, not only on my own faith journey, but with a
sense of obligation to others.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mayor dismissed the first lady's attacks on him as Clinton
campaign spin, and said the letter was old news because it was
mailed out in October during his battle over the Sensation exhibit
at the Brooklyn museum. His campaign advisers would not say on
Wednesday how many copies of the letter were sent out, who they
were sent to or who wrote it.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani's staff has said in the past that Richard Viguerie,
the direct-mail marketer who rose to prominence by working for
conservative candidates in the 1980s, had produced many of the
mayor's recent mailings. The staff has also said that some of the
language in the mailings had to be toned down.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The letters have in any case been enormously lucrative for
Giuliani. Last month his campaign announced that his campaign had
raised $12 million, of which 40 percent came from direct mail and
quite a bit of which came from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's criticism of Giuliani seemed to signal that her
campaign is entering a new phase in which she will be more directly
critical of the mayor and not leave it to surrogates, like her
press secretary Howard Wolfson, to make daily attacks. Earlier,
Clinton had criticized the mayor's demeanor, saying he was angry,
in an effort to portray him as being temperamentally unsuited for
the Senate.

WHITE HOUSE RAISES EXPECTED COST OF MEDICARE DRUG PLAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ore., N.Y.)   (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House now says President Clinton's
proposal to provide Medicare coverage of prescription drugs will
cost 35 percent more than it estimated just seven months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, when Clinton unveiled his plan to offer drug
coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries, he said it would cost $118
billion over 10 years. In his new budget request to Congress this
week, he put the cost at $160 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's basic proposal has not changed, the White House
estimate of its cost has shot up. White House officials said
Wednesday that they had revised their estimate to reflect several
factors, including a realization that the use of prescription drugs
by the elderly and the prices of new drugs were rising faster than
they first assumed.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increases in drug spending help explain why millions
of elderly Americans want government help with the costs and why
some members of Congress are apprehensive about establishing new
drug benefits. Critics of the Clinton proposal said that the first
White House numbers were too low and that the revisions show the
government must move carefully in designing Medicare drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the cost estimates had increased, Chris Jennings, the
health policy coordinator at the White House, said Wednesday:
``We've had another year of experience, during which drug
utilization and costs have increased. We included that experience
in our new projections.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jennings said, the administration's earlier
estimates did not adequately account for the cost of providing drug
benefits to Medicare patients in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton offered his proposal last summer, the
Congressional Budget Office said he had grossly underestimated the
costs. At a Senate hearing in July, Dan L. Crippen, director of the
budget office, testified that Clinton's plan would cost $168
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even well-run private health plans report that their drug
spending has been increasing by 15 percent to 18 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the basic Medicare drug benefit that Clinton proposed
last year, he is now asking Congress to set aside $35 billion to
help protect Medicare beneficiaries with extremely high drug costs
in the years 2006 to 2010. Clinton did not say exactly who would be
eligible for such assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the White House cost estimates underlines the
difficulty of predicting the course of drug spending at a time when
scientists are continually developing new drugs to prevent and
treat disease and improve the quality of life. Economists have
developed rules of thumb to predict how small changes in variables
like economic growth and unemployment will affect federal spending
and revenues. But they say they have no reliable models to predict
drug spending.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the Senate Budget Committee _ Olympia J. Snowe,
R-Maine, and Ron Wyden, D-Ore. _ said Wednesday that they would
seek money for Medicare drug benefits as part of the budget
blueprint for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Their approach is different from Clinton's: it would offer
consumers a wide range of private insurance policies to cover drug
costs. The government would offer to pay at least 25 percent of the
premiums for insurance covering the drug costs of any Medicare
beneficiary, with larger subsidies for lower-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe and Wyden said they had been working closely with the
White House and Senate Republican leaders. They described their
proposal as a middle ground between the Clinton plan and more
conservative schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the ranking Democrat
on the Finance Committee, which has authority over Medicare, has
endorsed the approach proposed by Snowe and Wyden.
</P>
<P>
   Snowe and Wyden said Congress should authorize Medicare drug
benefits this year, even if lawmakers could not agree on a
comprehensive overhaul of the entire Medicare program. In addition,
they said, senators generally agree that the federal government _
specifically, the Health Care Financing Administration _ should
have little or no direct role in operation of the drug insurance
program.
</P>
<P>
   Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said few insurance companies would want to
offer free-standing policies to cover drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like providing insurance for haircuts,'' because
so many elderly people need prescription drugs, Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   But Snowe said she believed that some insurers would offer drug
coverage to Medicare beneficiaries, with the federal subsidies
envisioned in her bill.

 &HT;    Bush, McCain scramble for Forbes' backers
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Republican Steve Forbes is expected to announce
today that he is giving up on what has been called a six-year long,
$66 million vanity campaign through two different election cycles.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser said Forbes made a tentative decision to quit the
presidential race over the weekend but had hoped for a better
showing in Delaware this week in case Arizona Sen. John McCain were
to score an upset victory in South Carolina and scramble the
political mix. But Forbes' fate was sealed when McCain beat him in
Delaware without even campaigning there. Forbes' formal exit from
the race leaves McCain and Texas Gov. George W. Bush scrambling for
his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out where Forbes' backers might wind up is complicated
by the two tags that can be hung on the wealthy publisher who
largely financed his own campaign. Supporters of Forbes the
reformer intent on rearranging the Washington reality might
gravitate toward McCain, whose campaign is based on the reform
message. Supporters of Forbes the conservative tax-cutter might
tilt toward Bush, the darling of the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate endorsement is expected from Forbes, who becomes
the seventh GOP contender to quit the race. Five have endorsed
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, champion of the flat tax, had damned McCain and Bush as
``timid tax-cutters,'' but he reserved most of his vitriol for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, getting the Forbes' family fortune off his case may be
more valuable than picking up support from former Forbes
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' attacks on Bush included ads featuring the founder of
the little-known Texas Taxpayers for Accountability, saying Bush's
record on taxes ``is a record of broken promises.'' Forbes also
assailed Bush by bringing a former and a current member of the
Texas State Board of Education to Iowa and New Hampshire to
criticize Bush's record on education.
</P>
<P>
   Though Forbes dedicated a good bit of his five daughters'
inheritance to attacking Bush, the Texas governor said Wednesday he
thinks he has a solid shot at signing up Forbes' supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I will have a good chance because, clearly in the race
now, I'm the conservative candidate vs. Senator McCain,'' Bush said
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, Bush already was trotting out some ex-Forbes
backers. At the South Carolina Capitol, state Reps. Liston Barfield
and Dwight Loftis said Bush aligns most closely with the
conservative values they liked in Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign also moved quickly to try to look like the
place to be for ex-Forbes supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Republicans think my tax cut ... is far more conservative
than Governor Bush's tax cut,'' McCain said. ``I think (Forbes'
backers) will head in our direction, and I'll welcome them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, McCain put some ex-Forbes supporters on display in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to join John McCain's team and am looking forward to
getting the word out to South Carolinians that he is the strongest
pro-life candidate in the race,'' said Lois Eargle, Horry County
auditor and chairman of the county's Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' best showing this year was second place, with 30 percent
of the vote, in last month's Iowa caucuses, in which McCain did not
compete. Forbes finished third in New Hampshire and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Polls in the coming crucial battles in South Carolina (Feb. 19)
and Michigan and Arizona (both Feb. 22) show tight races in which
Forbes' supporters could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Top Forbes' strategists believe Bush and McCain each have a shot
at a portion of Forbes' supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A common Forbes voter was someone who was interested in
changing Washington, who wanted an outsider who was going to shake
up the political structure,'' said Bob Haus, Forbes' senior
political adviser in Iowa. ``But they also are a very conservative
lot, interested in tax reform, pro-life and issues like Social
Security and health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Young, Forbes' senior political adviser in New Hampshire,
saw the same kind of split among Forbes backers in his state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidate who wants to attract the Forbes vote is going to
have to deliver a conservative message and give the Forbes voters a
feeling he is actually going to act on these words rather than just
put forward platitudes,'' Young said. ``And Bush has a weakness in
that people have a hard time believing that it won't be more of the
same under him. Even if his message is more conservative, there is
some doubt about his sincerity in that regard.''

 &HT;    NATIONAL SUMMIT AIMS TO NARROW RIFT BETWEEN AFRICANS AND AFRICAN
AMERICANS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international and (k)
commentary categories.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 13
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Despite their close historical ties,
misunderstandings and stereotypes have created a rift between
African Americans and Africans living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But if organizers of the first National Summit on Africa have
their way, some of these will be cleared up and relations between
the groups will improve.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing Africans and African Americans together for the Feb.
16-20 summit here, organizers also hope to increase understanding
of Africa and improve U.S.-Africa trade. In addition, they hope to
educate all Americans, regardless of race, about the vast continent
that some refer to as the ``Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans don't know anything about Africa, except
Tarzan, Jane and wars. And most Americans don't know that Africa
matters,'' said Leonard H. Robinson Jr., the summit's organizer.
``Africa is portrayed as the glass is half empty, not as the glass
is half full. We want to portray Africa in a way that it hasn't
been portrayed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a high-ranking State Department official in the Reagan
and Bush administration, conceived the idea of the summit several
years ago at a White House conference on Africa. He has traveled
extensively there over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The National Summit on Africa has invited nearly 1,800
representatives from all 50 states, as well as leaders from six
African countries. Their goal at the summit is to draft and adopt a
plan of action that will help guide U.S. foreign policy makers in
their relations with Africa, a vast continent of 54 countries, 800
million people and roughly 1,000 languages.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and former South
African president Nelson Mandela have said they will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes contentious relations between Africans in the United
States and African Americans exist because some have skewed
impressions of each other, said University of Connecticut professor
Michelle Williams, an Atlanta native.
</P>
<P>
   Some Africans think African Americans dislike them and believe
that they are lazy, she said. Likewise, African Americans often
feel the same way about Africans, she added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said African Americans sometimes perceive
Africans as arrogant and believe they have superior attitudes
toward their counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many African Americans still think of Africa as having no
modern conveniences, and everybody lives in grass huts,'' said
Williams, who teaches African American studies courses.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes that Africans and African Americans hold of each
other are rooted in misunderstandings, not malice, because they
have been isolated from each other for hundreds of years,
historians believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been conditioned'' to dislike and be ashamed of
Africa, said Patricia Dixon, an African American studies professor
at Georgia State University. During slavery, blacks were
brainwashed to believe that Africa was a primitive place that was
inhabited by savages, she said. Some historians believe this
brainwashing caused many slaves who were brought to America to
develop a historical amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans and others are still being brainwashed by the
white-controlled media, said Dr. Sandra Jackson, director of the
Center for the Culture and History of the Black Diaspora at DePaul
University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare, she said, that major American publications and
television programs show African cities with gleaming office
buildings, mansions, hotel resorts, luxury cars or African men and
women dressed in designer business suits using cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the media focuses on the bizarre, the corruption, the
violence and nothing on the regular African people,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, African Americans are portrayed negatively in the
African media, said Georgia State University professor Makungu
Akinyela. He said African Americans often are presented as
gangsters, drug dealers, welfare queens or murderers. And when
African students come to America, he said, they are cautioned by
their white sponsors about associating with black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others like retired professor Bernard Magubane, who
returned to his native South Africa in 1997 after teaching for
nearly 30 years in the United States, said in a telephone interview
from Johannesburg that he sees no problem with African and African
American relations. And it's normal for groups of people to
disagree, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the attitude of ordinary Jews in New York, they
have the same stereotypes, that the Israelis are arrogant and
etc.,'' he said. ``At the personal level, people may have a
personal experience, but at a larger historical level, you begin to
understand why those stereotypes came into being.''
</P>
<P>
   Erku Yimer, executive director of the Ethiopian Community
Association in Chicago, disagrees. He said ``once we come here, the
behavior African Americans show to Africans is not conducive to
establishing a good relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Summit on Africa may help improve African and
African American relations, but it is not the only solution to the
problem. The key is to begin educating young people at home and
from the time they start school, said Dixon, who was not exposed to
African history until graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the African American community to neglect Africa is to, in
effect, neglect its own existence and its own future and its
continent,'' Robinson said. ``Economically, politically,
culturally, the richness of the combination, the potential power
that (the African and African American) community could have
bridging across the Atlantic Ocean is just mind-boggling.''

 &HT;    NATIONAL SUMMIT AIMS TO NARROW RIFT BETWEEN AFRICANS AND AFRICAN
AMERICANS
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (i) international and (k)
commentary categories.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 13

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Despite their close historical ties,
misunderstandings and stereotypes have created a rift between
African Americans and Africans living in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But if organizers of the first National Summit on Africa have
their way, some of these will be cleared up and relations between
the groups will improve.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing Africans and African Americans together for the Feb.
16-20 summit here, organizers also hope to increase understanding
of Africa and improve U.S.-Africa trade. In addition, they hope to
educate all Americans, regardless of race, about the vast continent
that some refer to as the ``Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans don't know anything about Africa, except
Tarzan, Jane and wars. And most Americans don't know that Africa
matters,'' said Leonard H. Robinson Jr., the summit's organizer.
``Africa is portrayed as the glass is half empty, not as the glass
is half full. We want to portray Africa in a way that it hasn't
been portrayed before.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a high-ranking State Department official in the Reagan
and Bush administration, conceived the idea of the summit several
years ago at a White House conference on Africa. He has traveled
extensively there over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The National Summit on Africa has invited nearly 1,800
representatives from all 50 states, as well as leaders from six
African countries. Their goal at the summit is to draft and adopt a
plan of action that will help guide U.S. foreign policy makers in
their relations with Africa, a vast continent of 54 countries, 800
million people and roughly 1,000 languages.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and former South
African president Nelson Mandela have said they will attend.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes contentious relations between Africans in the United
States and African Americans exist because some have skewed
impressions of each other, said University of Connecticut professor
Michelle Williams, an Atlanta native.
</P>
<P>
   Some Africans think African Americans dislike them and believe
that they are lazy, she said. Likewise, African Americans often
feel the same way about Africans, she added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said African Americans sometimes perceive
Africans as arrogant and believe they have superior attitudes
toward their counterparts in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many African Americans still think of Africa as having no
modern conveniences, and everybody lives in grass huts,'' said
Williams, who teaches African American studies courses.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes that Africans and African Americans hold of each
other are rooted in misunderstandings, not malice, because they
have been isolated from each other for hundreds of years,
historians believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been conditioned'' to dislike and be ashamed of
Africa, said Patricia Dixon, an African American studies professor
at Georgia State University. During slavery, blacks were
brainwashed to believe that Africa was a primitive place that was
inhabited by savages, she said. Some historians believe this
brainwashing caused many slaves who were brought to America to
develop a historical amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans and others are still being brainwashed by the
white-controlled media, said Dr. Sandra Jackson, director of the
Center for the Culture and History of the Black Diaspora at DePaul
University in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare, she said, that major American publications and
television programs show African cities with gleaming office
buildings, mansions, hotel resorts, luxury cars or African men and
women dressed in designer business suits using cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, the media focuses on the bizarre, the corruption, the
violence and nothing on the regular African people,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, African Americans are portrayed negatively in the
African media, said Georgia State University professor Makungu
Akinyela. He said African Americans often are presented as
gangsters, drug dealers, welfare queens or murderers. And when
African students come to America, he said, they are cautioned by
their white sponsors about associating with black Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others like retired professor Bernard Magubane, who
returned to his native South Africa in 1997 after teaching for
nearly 30 years in the United States, said in a telephone interview
from Johannesburg that he sees no problem with African and African
American relations. And it's normal for groups of people to
disagree, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the attitude of ordinary Jews in New York, they
have the same stereotypes, that the Israelis are arrogant and
etc.,'' he said. ``At the personal level, people may have a
personal experience, but at a larger historical level, you begin to
understand why those stereotypes came into being.''
</P>
<P>
   Erku Yimer, executive director of the Ethiopian Community
Association in Chicago, disagrees. He said ``once we come here, the
behavior African Americans show to Africans is not conducive to
establishing a good relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Summit on Africa may help improve African and
African American relations, but it is not the only solution to the
problem. The key is to begin educating young people at home and
from the time they start school, said Dixon, who was not exposed to
African history until graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the African American community to neglect Africa is to, in
effect, neglect its own existence and its own future and its
continent,'' Robinson said. ``Economically, politically,
culturally, the richness of the combination, the potential power
that (the African and African American) community could have
bridging across the Atlantic Ocean is just mind-boggling.''

`HOMICIDE:' LIFE AFTER DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tim Bayliss was the most interesting TV character of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' detective _ played by Kyle
Secor, who reprises the role this weekend in ``Homicide: The
Movie'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday on NBC) _ defeats all comers. The
hilarious idiot Homer of ``The Simpsons,'' the self-absorbed
``Seinfeld'' cast, the disgruntled and tragic Andy Sipowicz of
``NYPD Blue,'' the short-skirted shrew Amanda Woodward of ``Melrose
Place'' _ none of these could come close to Bayliss for depth and
complication, even though they were all more familiar names. The
more these characters stayed the same, the more Bayliss changed.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to know Bayliss to enjoy Sunday's ``Homicide''
movie, but it helps, because the Baltimore-based series recounted
his journey, and the movie brings it to a sort of conclusion. When
the show began in January 1993, Bayliss was a baby-faced rookie,
filled with idealism and enthusiasm. He was paired with a more
experienced partner, Frank Pembleton _ played by Andre Braugher
with enough evangelical furor to make Samuel L. Jackson cower and
repent _ who grew to respect him, but bickered with him as if they
were trapped in a divorce-bound marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, the idealism withered, with Bayliss haunted by his
inability to solve the murder of a little girl. Bayliss became a
seeker, throwing himself into a fling with a borderline
nymphomaniac, studying Buddhism and exploring his bisexuality. By
the series finale in May 1999, Bayliss had turned 180 degrees,
executing a serial killer who had been freed on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
   When that final episode was taped, ``Homicide's'' producers
weren't even sure whether it would be the final episode, so it was
left open-ended. ``Homicide: The Movie'' is an attempt at closure,
but it tries far too hard. It promises to bring back everyone who
was ever a regular on the show, even the detectives who were killed
off, and it delivers. But perhaps it shouldn't have made that
promise in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   It apparently begins in the near future, because when the series
ended, homicide Lt. Al Giardello (the scenery-chewing Yaphet Kotto)
had declined a promotion to captain. That was only a few months
ago, and now he's running for Baltimore mayor on a platform that
includes legalizing all drugs (a contrivance, since this idea was
never mentioned in the series). The opening credits are barely over
when Giardello is gunned down in an assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   This provides an excuse for a musical montage reintroducing us
to all of the show's surviving detectives, including Bayliss (now
sporting a grizzled beard and indulging in the meditative sport of
fly-fishing) and Pembleton (now a lecturer at a Catholic school).
It's a quick sign that the movie isn't going to live up to the
series, as the news is spread via cell phone and ear-whispers in
scenes that begin to look a little silly. Most of the detectives,
retired or not, flock to find out who tried to kill their beloved
former boss _ who was the reason many of them retired in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   What made the series special _ at least until Braugher left at
the end of the 1997-'98 season _ is on view in the movie: Its sense
of place (it was always filmed on location in Baltimore), its
complex characters, its use of rock music to illustrate points, its
emphasis on dialogue over plot, even its pretentious hand-held
cameras and jumpy editing. Much of what ``The Sopranos'' gets
praised for now, ``Homicide'' did first, but perhaps because of its
low ratings or its lack of a huge hype machine, it went ignored by
all but a loyal cult following and several vocal TV critics (the
original series airs in reruns on Court TV, for those who missed
its glory days or those in need of a refresher course).
</P>
<P>
   But the movie is too concerned with old-school considerations.
It's like a reunion: Supporting characters walk in, do their bit,
and leave; the first half lacks focus because the writers are too
busy figuring out ways to wedge a one-season coroner or a state's
attorney into the plot. NBC made a strange decision in scheduling
this as a sweeps-month ``event;'' the movie is a Valentine's
weekend gift to ``Homicide's'' fans, but anyone who ignored it
during its seven-season run is going to be baffled by all the
returning faces. What makes NBC think a movie will draw large
ratings when the series never did?
</P>
<P>
   It's not until the second half that the movie settles on a key
confrontation between Bayliss and Pembleton, performed with
apparently improvised intensity by Secor and Braugher. Pembleton's
Catholicism was always a big part of his character, even if he
often had doubts about what God was up to; this scene turns him
into a reluctant-priest figure, as Pembleton tries to close his
ears to an inevitable Bayliss. It's the scene that makes the movie
worth watching, but it's only one scene.
</P>
<P>
   The second half does hold other surprises, including an ending
that's hard to see coming. But the movie smacks of faded glories,
and other fascinating characters _ Reed Diamond's corrupt cop Mike
Kellerman, Richard Belzer's conspiracy-freak John Munch _ come off
underwritten or forced. When NBC pulled the plug on ``Homicide'' at
the end of the '99 season, many observers believed that the show
had lasted one season too many. The movie, despite occasional
strong moments, merely prolongs these death throes.

L.A. NOIR OR COLLEGE COMEDY, THE GENRE IS REAL LIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Michael Sragow writes about movies for Salon.com. He is writing a
biography of the director Victor Fleming.  
 By MICHAEL SRAGOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They always want you to do what they've seen you
do before,'' says Curtis Hanson, who last directed (and co-wrote)
that extravagant blend of slam-bang police saga and character
study, ``L.A. Confidential.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new film, ``Wonder Boys'' (opening Feb. 25), Hanson has
outwitted Hollywood's powers that be. With the help of his star,
Michael Douglas (``the motor of this movie''), he has taken Michael
Chabon's ebullient novel, set in and around an English department
at a Pittsburgh college, and come up with a different kind of
movie. It's a pothead picaresque, a contemporary screwball
comedy-drama with a mellow emotional tang.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas plays the middle-aged creative-writing teacher Grady
Tripp, a once-hot novelist unable to complete his latest work. (He
is currently on Page 2,611.) Tobey Maguire co-stars as Tripp's most
formidable student, James Leer, a weirdly talented prevaricator
poised to overtake his mentor in accomplishment and glory.
</P>
<P>
   But the director insists that his film is only partly about
writers confronting ``past promise and future success, and chances
for renewal.'' This movie, says Hanson, ``isn't all about writing;
it's about characters who (italics)think(end italics) that it's all
about writing. And they find out that it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson has never been a wonder boy, at least not in the sense of
enjoying an overnight sensation. Although he has had his share of
commercial triumph (with the 1992 evil-nanny thriller ``The Hand
That Rocks the Cradle''), it took him decades to reach the
forefront of American moviemakers.
</P>
<P>
   He started out as a screenwriter (notably for the 1978 suspense
film ``Silent Partner''), turned director with exploitation films
and youth movies like the engaging comedy ``Losin' It'' (1983) and
had his breakthrough as a writer-director with the skilled
Hitchcockian pastiche ``The Bedroom Window'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   It was just three years ago that ``L.A. Confidential'' raised
Hanson to master-craftsman status. This simultaneously sweeping and
incisive adaptation of James Ellroy's epic period crime novel took
home all the major critics' awards in 1997 and won Hanson and his
co-writer, Brian Helgeland, the Academy Award for best adapted
screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that happened, says Hanson, ``I had worked too long
and hard to attain a position that would allow me to make movies I
wanted to make'' to let the burden of success derail him.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sense, Hanson (italics)is(end italics) a wonder
boy _ or maybe a wonder man. Speak to him about great novels or
movies, and you get intelligent enthusiasm raised to the level of
awe. Unlike generations of film school and video store movie brats,
he is a gifted autodidact who never separated his love for
moviemaking from his love for all types of storytelling and who, as
a high school dropout (from Tarzana, Calif.), learned his way
around a film set as a photographer and journalist.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when some pictures he took of Faye Dunaway helped
win her the female lead in ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' Hanson had the
leverage to hang out during the filming in Texas and interview
Arthur Penn and Warren Beatty. The editor of ``Bonnie and Clyde,''
Dede Allen, became his editor on ``Wonder Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman of the UCLA. Film and Television Archive (the
first one to be appointed), Hanson was busy mounting a Billy Wilder
retrospective while completing post-production work on ``Wonder
Boys.'' Hoping to arouse interest in the program among students
whose collective memory dates back to ``Reservoir Dogs,'' he was
co-host for a recent series of double bills with present-day film
school idols: on the final night, David O. Russell (``Three
Kings'') helped him introduce ``Sunset Boulevard'' and ``The Lost
Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   That back-and-forth approach informs his moviemaking. ``L.A.
Confidential'' did justice to Ellroy's juicy material about the
collision of power, celebrity and economic development in Los
Angeles of the 1950s. But it used all that fresh content about
L.A.'s underbelly (and Hanson's novel ideas about ambience and
lighting) to revive the heightened, stylized world of adult drives
and emotions where many of Hollywood's classic melodramas took
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thrill of making `L.A. Confidential,''' Hanson
recently said over dinner in West Hollywood, ``was that I got a
phone call from Billy Wilder inviting me to meet him at his office.
And as soon as I walked in he said, `Next you want to do a comedy,
right?' And I said, you're right, how did you know? And he said: `I
felt the same way after I did `Double Indemnity' and `The Lost
Weekend.' The trouble is, getting them to let you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Wilder, whose comedy credits range from ``Some Like It
Hot'' to ``Kiss Me, Stupid,'' ever made a movie like ``Wonder
Boys,'' in which the slapstick complications keep getting pushed to
the side to make room for psychological complexities. Its
characters are as stoned and libidinous as they are literary, yet
Hanson keeps them moving according to a woozy kind of clockwork.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's randy gay editor, Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey Jr.),
comes visiting and sniffing for the long-promised manuscript;
Tripp's wife leaves him; Tripp's mistress, the college chancellor
Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand) _ who is married to the head of
the English department, Walter Gaskell (Richard Thomas) _ announces
to Tripp that she is carrying his baby.
</P>
<P>
   All this happens right before the kickoff of a campus literary
festival (``WordFest''), which features speakers like a wily
blockbuster writer known as ``Q'' (Rip Torn). Before long, Tripp's
protege, Leer, shoots the Gaskells' blind bulldog and steals
Walter's prize possession: the jacket Marilyn Monroe wore when she
married Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is not just some gimcrack farce. Hanson says, ``When
I was about to launch into the project, people said, `You're smart
to do something so different,' which on the surface it is. But it
was very similar to `L.A. Confidential' in the degree of emotional
involvement I had with all these characters. Each has a yearning
for family and a fear of family. They're all wrestling with what
the hell they should be doing with their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrillers Hanson made as a director for hire before ``L.A.
Confidential'' were also filled with doppelgangers, illusion versus
reality games and troubled relationships and marriages _ all the
stuff of identity-crisis comedy and drama.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson patterned these ingredients to lend texture to the plots,
and to give actors like Rob Lowe (in ``Bad Influence,'' 1990),
Julianne Moore (in ``The Hand That Rocks the Cradle'') and Meryl
Streep and Kevin Bacon (in ``The River Wild,'' 1994) bouncy
subtexts. In his most recent films, though, these elements bubble
up, naturally and unpredictably, from a rich and humanistic take on
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Confidential'' was a box office disappointment, but it
upped Hanson's standing with actors, who admired the performances
he got from the likes of Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger. ``They
looked at the performances in some of my other films, and began to
see a continuity,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this (italics)can(end italics) mean is that you have
better success with actors when you're trying to get them into your
project. But in this case it meant that Michael Douglas was
interested in the `Wonder Boys' script, and communicated that
interest to me. I read it based on that, with Michael in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The book's Tripp is obese and classifies himself as ``homely.''
So, as Michael Chabon said by telephone from Berkeley, the novelist
assumed from the start that ``whoever they got was going to look
different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased when it became Michael Douglas because he would
get the movie made, but the more I thought about it the more I
realized he had this kind of character in him,'' Chabon continued.
``I thought back to `The China Syndrome,' where he played kind of a
longhair, and to `The Streets of San Francisco,' where even though
he was playing a cop he was loose and rangy, and you thought there
might be a joint in the breast pocket of his tweed jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson understood that Grady Tripp was not just emotionally and
intellectually adrift: he was a benign, accepting man who
endeavored to help James Leer as an unconscious tryout for
fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of this character keys into the difference between
Michael and his father, Kirk,'' says Hanson. ``There's a
vulnerability Michael has _ a softness, if you will _ that he's not
afraid to expose, along with a humor, and a lightness. I thought he
could be funny without working at it. That's what convinced me he
could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   What clinched the deal for the superstitious Hanson was that his
own first name popped up twice in the novel, along with a character
based on H.P. Lovecraft, whose ``Dunwich Horror'' he had adapted in
1970. Plus, the actress Elizabeth McGovern had once advised Hanson
to work with the screenwriter Steve Kloves _ she said, ``You're
both serious, but you both make me laugh'' _ and Kloves' name was
on this script.
</P>
<P>
   Kloves is best known as the writer-director of ``The Fabulous
Baker Boys'' (1989); he had never before done an adaptation. And
because of the novel's gamboling form and pothead hero, a lot of
writers would have agreed with Chabon that ``it wasn't the most
obvious candidate for a movie.'' But Kloves says that this lack of
obviousness made it seem obvious to him, ``because I love the films
of the late '60s and early '70s.''
</P>
<P>
   Chabon encouraged him to make the material his own, even if it
meant deleting whole sections in an effort to focus the action and
keep it both absurd and believable on-screen. (To those who have
read the book, it registers as an in joke that Tripp's eccentric
Jewish in-laws are now proper Yankees who live in a house that is
``a great place to wake up on Christmas morning.'') Intense script
work continued when Hanson entered the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Kloves says: ``Curtis is more naturally drawn to being clear
than I am. But he's clever about clarity. He doesn't hit the
audience on the head 17 times. And he goes to great depths when he
thinks about a scene. When he presents ideas, he thinks them
through _ he knows how they will affect the fabric four scenes
down.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the trims and changes, the story is still a
loosey-goosey fable about the perils to maturity that lurk in the
adolescent quasi-bohemia of a college campus. (It is quite an
achievement for a director who never finished high school.) The
film says that life as well as literature is about holding to hard
choices. And that is how Hanson makes his movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' starts with Tripp reading a student's story,
then beginning his voice-over narration _ over his own voice. It's
as if the filmmaker is signaling, ``Pay attention!'' Hanson hoped
the movie would seem ``unthought-out,'' but also wanted every
detail to add to the total effect.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it made more sense to him for the self-dramatizing
James Leer to be a fan of Douglas Sirk and William Inge (``another
wonder boy'') than a devotee of Frank Capra, as he is in the book.
And the film's visual poetry is the kind that sneaks up on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly just Pittsburgh in the winter,'' says Hanson. In a
typically beautiful, unstressed nocturnal car shot, the viewer
sees, in the director's words, ``the furnaces and the factories of
Pittsburgh glowing behind James Leer, the one whose future lies
before him,'' while darkness shrouds the driver, Grady Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   As a Bob Dylan buff since childhood and a devotee of his score
for ``Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,'' Hanson thought that Dylan's
work would be an ideal musical expression of Tripp's taste and
character. Luckily, Dylan was a fan of ``L.A. Confidential.'' He
visited the ``Wonder Boys'' editing rooms, and watched an hour and
a half of rough-cut footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day a little package arrived with a CD in it,'' Hanson
recalls. ``Can you imagine? I popped it into the player and heard a
song with Dylan's unique imagery, about being `in love with a woman
who doesn't appeal to me,' and success, and things out of the movie
that are also things he knows more about than any of us.'' (In
addition to Dylan's song, Hanson built the score around nine
singer-songwriters, including Leonard Cohen and Neil Young, and
used three other Dylan numbers.)
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, Hanson told Chabon that the best director for his
novel would have been Hal Ashby (``The Landlord,'' ``Shampoo''),
because of his embrace of humanity in all its quirks and failings.
Yet Hanson seems more like Ashby's mentor, William Wyler: he
charges every frame in a way that sets off the vitality of his
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' leaves you with a gallery of eloquent faces,
from the fuzzily anxious Douglas and the sometimes haunted,
sometimes goofy Maguire to the effervescent Downey, who brings to
his part the comic charisma of the young Jack Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Hanson's adept handling of large, diverse ensembles _
even more than his yen to tell engulfing stories _ may be what
gives his latest films their depth and dash. It is as if, by
playing straight with the living figures in front of him, he is
staying true to what he sees as the ultimate theme of ``Wonder
Boys'': ``Without life,'' he says, ``there (italics)is(end italics)
no art.''

   But like many well-intentioned unions, this ended in divorce.
Cal State Northridge will spend next season, its fifth, in the Big
Sky and then leave in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   As the conference bids goodbye, it can't help but feel the
experience was mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't totally dissatisfied,'' conference chief of staff
Ron Loghry said.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge and the Big Sky hooked up out of necessity: There
weren't many Division I-AA football-playing schools out West. The
Big Sky had lost Boise State and Idaho and was down to six schools.
Loghry said the conference thought it needed at least eight, so it
invited Northridge, Sacramento State and Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   It could have invited Southern Utah but passed because it found
the Los Angeles media market more desirable than Cedar City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was frustrated that Northridge failed to upgrade
its football stadium. Each year, the conference gave CSUN an
extension to get it done, and each year nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northridge was faced with some very difficult challenges,''
Big Sky commissioner Doug Fullerton said.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading the football stadium wasn't the only one. By
association, the conference suffered black eyes every time
Northridge made negative headlines, including:
</P>
<P>
   - The decision to cut four men's sports.
</P>
<P>
   - The arrest of women's basketball coach Michael Abraham on
federal drug trafficking charges.
</P>
<P>
   - The investigation into the football program that led to the
firing of coach Ron Ponciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we had a real understanding,'' Loghry said.
``Doug made the comment. He felt bad for them: `Everything seemed
to happen at once.' There were times it wasn't great news.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some positive moments, however. Loghry said the
Matadors' strength in sports such as track and field caused other
member conferences to elevate their programs to compete with CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the conference thinks it's better this marriage
didn't last.

<P>
   In July 1998, the dancer and choreographer Bill T. Jones began
to think about making an evening-long work for himself. He was 46
at the time and in 25 years of performing in the company he and
Arnie Zane started, he had never done a solo of this magnitude. He
called the piece ``The Breathing Show,'' and, with Janet Wong, his
rehearsal director, he began to select the music and experiment
with movement. The dance, which can be seen this week in New
Jersey, had its premiere in Iowa City last October, but Jones still
considered it a work in progress. He continued to refine the
elements of the piece, which incorporated singing, talking, film
and, of course, dancing. Following are excerpts from Jones's
journal of that process, begun before the premiere and completed
during a European tour with his company in November.

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've done a number of interviews about ``The Breathing Show''
and am always asked, why now? One reason is that I am still able to
warm up, pass the small boundary of pain, stiffness and discomfort
and lose myself in the act of dancing. Entering into the body daily
is like entering cold water, so unappealing initially, so
exhilarating once the adjustment is made. Since Sunday's open
rehearsal I've heard several responses to ``Breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many used the term beautiful; some say inspired. Yet there is,
as expected, a certain grouping of approval around some parts and
not others. Some found the Shubertcold and remote. Someone thought
it too long. In viewing the tape, I too had to wonder if it was not
a tad uninteresting. ``TB Arranged,'' the second section, is
generally more engaging. Perhaps it is the eclecticism of the music
selection; or that I speak, giving textural support to the
evening's conceptual goals. Or perhaps it's the orange costume.
</P>
<P>
   Is it ``The Ghost in the Machine'' section, in which I solicit a
starting point from the audience and go into a go-for-broke
improvisation? Could it be the beauty of Daniel Roumain's violin,
or the song I sing at the end? And what about the final adagio to
Mozart? Do I succeed in directing the music's sinewy, sensual,
shimmering introspection and ecstasy through my gravity-bound body?
Does the work live in the memory of the spectator? In the heart? &QL;

<P>
   I began my warm-up ritual lying on the stage. Warm-ups depend on
these quiet, horizontal times when the body doesn't have to fight
gravity. Here one rids oneself of all angles, aspiring instead to
be soft, fleshy circles. The breath is the guide and the truth
teller. My lower back and hips have become a constant source of
concern over time. Was it the wild plunges into aikido roles on
bare hardwood floors in the '70s when we had just discovered
contact improvisation? More likely it is inevitable physiological
change exacerbated by the unnatural demands of choreographing,
rehearsing and, of course, performing. My thoughts and anxieties
fill me like a team of wild horses.
</P>
<P>
   After the show: I am prostrate on the dressing room floor. The
premiere finished minutes ago and I am pondering the dilemma I find
myself in: there is no personal payoff in this sequence of events,
no catharsis, no orgasm. Without my glasses I couldn't tell, but I
hear the audience jumped to its feet at the end of Mozart. And yet,
I am still asking, where is my satisfaction? &QL;

   I have heard indirectly that Nigel Redden, the director of the
Lincoln Center Festival, had some reservations about ``The
Breathing Show.'' Well, it seems, for the most part, he didn't like
it. Though it increased in interest for him as the evening
progressed, he was left wondering about the lack of
edge/confrontation in the work. He feels I am too respectful of the
Schubert music, the projection screens look meager and save for the
improvisation in ``Ghost in the Machine,'' the evening was
pointless and tepid.
</P>
<P>
   If the show is not ``hot and winning,'' is it worth doing? I've
always believed that any action done with a sufficient level of
consciousness and commitment is never wasted. However, can I afford
emotionally or professionally to have my most essential asset, my
own performance, suffer such devaluation? I don't think so. What
are my options? Cancel the show? Impossible and cowardly. Rework
the existing material even though we are beginning a demanding
tour? This is the only option. &QL;

   It's Halloween. Everywhere there are pumpkins, witches in black
hats, straw, candle flames. Mohammad Khatami, the president of
Iran, speaking of globalization the other day, said that it was the
new form of colonization; globalization meaning Americanization. Am
I, like Halloween, a cultural export? I suppose I am.
</P>
<P>
   We went to an Anselm Kiefer show. Here is an artist mesmerized
by history, grappling with magnitude, time and the fragility of
being. Like him, I wrestle with a sense of minuteness in a
grotesquely huge and impersonal cosmos. My insignificance is all
the more galling because of the burden of self that hounds me,
compels me to make connections between my insides and the ocean
outside.
</P>
<P>
   But part of me takes pleasure in doing a pointless thing _
dancing. I've heard that Georgia O'Keeffe said there came a point
when she decided that what she thought was true. If this is
accurate, it must have been a profoundly liberating moment for her.
If what I present onstage is my brand of thinking, then can I say I
have come to believe it is true?

 &HT;    Bush incorporates tort reform into campaign
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hoping to reinforce his new ``reform'' message
with an issue that was a winner in his campaign for governor six
years ago, Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush on
Wednesday unveiled a plan to curb frivolous federal lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the way that Texas courts assign blame and award
damages in lawsuits involving civil wrongs known as ``torts'' was
one of Bush's four main themes in his 1994 gubernatorial contest
against Ann Richards. In 1995, he helped guide seven tort reform
bills through the Texas Legislature. Although the specifics of
those measures differ from Wednesday's proposal, the overarching
goal is the same: make it harder for plaintiffs to win high-dollar
damages against companies, doctors and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   To counter Arizona Sen. John McCain's surge, the Bush campaign
this week began referring to their candidate as a ``reformer with
results.'' The tort reform issue fits neatly into that theme, since
Bush indisputably followed through on his 1994 campaign promise. In
doing so, he overcame the trial lawyers, a powerful Democratic
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, our courts aren't serving people, they are serving
the lawyers,'' Bush said. ``Frivolous lawsuits are threatening jobs
and delaying access to the courts for those who have legitimate
claims.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates worry that the changes would make it
easier for businesses to get away with selling products and
services that hurt people. Ralph Nader accused Bush of ``cozying up
to corporate power-brokers and wrongdoers'' for campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan includes stiffer penalties for lawsuits determined
by judges to be frivolous, including a ``three strikes, you're
out'' rule for lawyers who repeatedly file such claims. It also
would require parties who reject a pre-trial settlement offer, and
who ultimately lose their case or receive substantially less at
trial, to pay the other party's costs, including legal fees. The
plan would make it easier for cases to be moved from state to
federal courts, which are generally viewed as friendlier to
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also proposed a ``Client's Bill of Rights'' that would
allow federal courts to hear challenges to attorneys' fees. A
vociferous opponent of the $3.3 billion fee that Texas paid private
lawyers in the state's tobacco lawsuit, Bush would force private
attorneys to return any ``excessive'' fees to government. He also
pledged to issue an executive order prohibiting federal agencies
from paying contingency fees.
</P>
<P>
   In unveiling his plan at a roundtable discussion with small
business owners at Newberry College in Newberry, S.C., Bush argued
that Texas tort reforms have saved consumers and businesses nearly
$3 billion since 1995. Fewer large insurance claims have translated
into lower insurance rates for consumers, businesses and doctors,
he says. Business groups say the changes have boosted the Texas
economy by transforming the state from the ``lawsuit capital of the
world'' into a place where the civil justice system is predictable
and consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Litterst of the National Federation of Independent
Business applauded the Bush plan, saying that even the threat of
lawsuits can put small companies out of business. But some question
the benefits of tort reform in Texas, and worry about taking it to
the federal level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The savings are going to doctors, manufacturers, and big
business, but consumers are seeing very small savings if they're
seeing any at all,'' Dan Lambe of Texas Watch, a research group,
said of the 1995 changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lambe referred to a recent report by former Texas insurance
commissioner J. Robert Hunter that suggests the state's tort reform
efforts have had a minimal impact on insurance rates. The report,
for the Consumer Federation of America, said premiums for coverages
affected by tort reform increased 8.2 percent from 1995 through
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says that thanks to a flood of frivolous claims,
``legitimate cases are getting lost in clogged courts.'' But Joe
Sanders, a University of Houston law professor, noted that while
huge settlements in isolated cases attract attention, it's ``very
difficult if not impossible to determine whether we're having a
litigation explosion.''

 UNDATED: is true?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this point ``The Breathing Show'' induces feelings of
confusion, inadequacy and anger. I want to feel warmth, love, pride
and power. Do thoughts ever do that? Is that what truth does? I
don't think so. Or I don't believe so. What stupid irony: even as I
curse language, it's words that I turn to to solve the problem of
blankness, the incompleteness that plagues my solo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 1. Bologna, Hotel International &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company has just rejoined me after four months' hiatus. I am
touched by how committed they are. We did a slow, thorough class
with heavy focus on floor work, stretching and breathing as an
antidote to the long flight and jet lag. I talked about the history
and conceptual goals of the new piece, ``You Walk?'' I invited each
of the dancers to create evocative ``captions'' that could at once
suggest choreographic treatment and perhaps serve as directional
aids for the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Wong; Gregory Bain, the production director; Miki
Takahashi, the lighting supervisor; Bjorn Amelan, the associate
artistic director and my companion, and I went to a coffee shop to
discuss ``The Breathing Show's'' dilemma. Yes, we will shorten the
Schubert to three lieder, inserting ``Floating the Tongue'' between
the second and third lieder. And because it is a bit lame without
Daniel on the violin, we will take ``Gardening'' out completely. I
will substitute ``Ionization,'' to the Varese score. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 4. On the train to Rome &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company was in good spirits this morning when we arrived in
Bologna at Arena del Sol for class and rehearsal. It is clear that
the dancers need to see me doing the material. We have been
learning an eight-minute study I improvised four years ago. There
is a tape of my original performance, but it is a questionable
teaching tool. Therefore, I depend on Janet's filtering and
defining collaboration. I use improvisation because it catches me
at my most animal, most un-self-conscious and most bold. There are
difficult and peculiar coordinations I pull off because they are
spontaneous and free of concern for effect or technique. These are
the most inventive and the most difficult to recapture. Here is my
truest contribution to contemporary dance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 5. Rome, Hotel Lucarno &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We were picked up by a representative from RomaEuropa Festival
and taken by taxi through the purgatorio of midday Roman traffic to
a press conference. I was submerged in dread and despair at the
prospect of having to discuss ``The Breathing Show.'' This forum,
with its demand for clarity, focused personability and showmanship,
was a challenge I felt unprepared to meet. But I did.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly interesting question: ``You have referred to
contemporary dance and modern dance, but nowhere do you refer to a
particular style or technique. What is your feeling about training
and style in relationship to traditions in dance?''
</P>
<P>
   I answered in two ways. First I repeated my response to Carla
Fracci's comment, ``We must now say no to much contemporary
practice and return to tradition.'' I assume that this great
classical dancer means classical dance. I said: ``Classical dance
has never been my tradition. Yes, it remains an important training
tool, but I feel I am more essentially related to classical modern
dance, modern dance and the avant-garde of the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, I try to make movement free of my mythology and
psychology, so the dancers can speak bravely and deeply of their
own truth. My method assumes that everyone, if well prepared,
allowed to feel safe and provided with an appropriate form, will
speak to the great themes of life, death, fear, love, desire. This
idealistic, democratic notion is at the heart of much modern
work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 7. Rome, Teatro Olympico &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last night's performance of ``Breathing'' was certainly
``hotter'' and more engaged. There was a large audience, but
because of technical delays, half of it was forced to wait standing
outside in steady drizzle. From this inauspicious beginning the
show took off. ``Ghostcatching'' engaged everyone. But
``Ionization'' has not felt really good lately; I am not sure why
it works sometimes and not others. Maybe when movements originate
in improvisations free of audience, there is a tendency to soup
them up, really show them off, in performance. This blocks true
revelations and insights. But Mozart, after so much projecting of
personality, was a pleasure. I know now why it is at the end. Here
is the pure land, my movement, the space and the music. I must
trust more the path getting to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 10. London, Sadler's Wells &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my dressing room, about 20 minutes before curtain. The new
Wells is handsome indeed. London does not really agree with me and
has been difficult for some time. Maybe that explains my low energy
with fatigue in the legs and feet, sluggish ungenerous sense of
myself in the space. Yes, we did walk a lot today in the New Bond
Street area. However, didn't we have a long walk on both days of
Rome performances? There I felt rip-roaring and ready, even with
the terrible tech rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   I've decided to drop ``Ionization'' tonight (6 minutes), replace
it with the dance-monologue ``21'' (about 15 or 20 minutes). Am I
mad? Probably, but here in this most language-conscious culture, I
long to go on that verbal movement journey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 11. London, headed to Heathrow &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's barely 7:15 a.m. London is noisy, polluted and gray, but I
feel great. After the dreary thoughts of low energy and poor focus,
the show amazed even me. The stage looked beautiful and the
projections have never been more beguiling. I was assured by Janet
(whose face I read as well as her words) that my performance was
relaxed and eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing to perform ``21'' was exactly what this engagement
called for. The narratives concerning my brother Boot's rebellion
and then mine, my wanderings, his prison life, his death, his
ashes, Arnie's ashes, Mama in my garden, all as harrowing,
confessional and demanding as ever, but leavened by good timing,
humor and an effective juxtaposition of movement. This is not an
easy work for anyone. The applause was robust and spontaneous. As
an encore I danced Blossom Dearie's ``Manhattan'' and it was like
being in love with London.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Brossman, director of the Theatre du Chatelet, came
over from Paris to check out the show, but his attendance was kept
from me lest I should be anxious and/-or disappointed. He loved the
evening and is planning to take it to the Chatelet in May. &QL;

<P>
   Company rehearsals for ``You Walk?'' have been exciting. Sharing
old and new material with this thirsty group illuminates what the
true life force of the dance company is. Solo rehearsals are
another matter. We onstage never witness the chemistry of our live
performance. We learn of it later, through electronic recording
and/or spectators' response. Video is the only way for me to
experience my own work.
</P>
<P>
   It's curious and unsettling, but I feel ``The Breathing Show''
only began to come alive when I decided to speak and to allow
myself to improvise transitions with anecdotes, jokes, random
observations, the stuff of my personality. Isn't personality a bit
like the back of one's head: essentially oneself, but more often
than not, experienced by others? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milan hums, moves full of self-involvement, arrogance and style
like Manhattan. There was a press conference yesterday for the
company's performances here at the Festival del Teatro Europa.
According to the director of the Piccolo Teatro, our participation
is highly regarded in this most theatrical of European festivals.
Why? I gather it is because of my perceived identity as a dance
artist whose concerns transcend the confines of dance. There were
the usual questions concerning my retreat from socially engaged
themes. I had to correct one journalist by declaring yet again that
I have never made a work about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to grapple with what my dance is becoming, the
discussion invariably ambles into vagueness wherein terms like pure
dance and abstraction are thrown about and ultimately discarded as
inadequate. I might have appeared irascible as journalists
scribbled madly, looking for the sound bite that read like
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   I said that though I am not old, I am no longer young, and
therefore inevitably reflect on what will be my legacy. At this
point in time it seems to me that only form lasts. It's sobering
and bothersome to realize that people, many filled with good will,
cannot hear or see me free of the aura of HIV and the supposed
death sentence it represents. So it comes as little surprise that a
young woman with a video camera and a loving, troubled expression
inquired why I, ``a successful and effective artist'' with so much
to be proud off, should be troubled by death. In her mind my
concern about legacy is fueled by concern about imminent death.
</P>
<P>
   A dancer is injured so I will step into ``D-Man'' tonight, a
part I have not performed in some time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later about 8:10 p.m., Teatro Lirico &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In my dressing room, poor light, bad air. The dancers are
understandably concerned about tonight's show as it is their first
true company concert in many months and this is a significant
festival.
</P>
<P>
   On the phenomena of repertory: ``D-Man in the Waters,'' from
1989, stands as an important marker in my life and career. It's
perhaps more insistent in its importance than I would prefer. I
have on several occasions attempted to retire it and yet it is a
bread-and-butter work, portable and guaranteed to please. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nov. 19. Milan, Grand Hotel Plazza &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Had our second show last night and judging from the applause,
the very chic, well-heeled audience seemed to like it. An Italian
journalist told me that the audiences here are still not accustomed
to modern dance. What do they mean by contemporary dance? Cool
formalism? Dance theater? The social-political dance as protest? Or
any dance that is grounded in intellectual precepts? It seems the
dance that enjoys the greatest acceptance are entertainments like
``Stomp!,'' Pilobolus or operatic spectacles like Pina Bausch. &QL;

   Caught up with some of the press notices from Sadler's Wells. In
two of them, the writers were by turns mildly praising and
distancing themselves from the work. One headline reads, ``The Life
of a Black Man.'' The writing is smug and superficial even as it
tries to be dispassionate and analytical. Distaste sits on my lips
like salty spit. I realize once again just how difficult it is for
these people to see me as other than a dangerous minority to be
held at arm's length. There was a great deal of attention given to
my persona and how hypnotized the audience had been by it and too
little attention to the rest of the evening. I did my best
performance of ``21'' ever. Neither of the two writers mentioned
that the work was conceived almost 20 years ago. Lest I lose myself
in complaint, I must remember that by English standards, these were
positive reviews. &QL;

   The Groos Saal at Spuiteater is one of the most intimate spaces
I performed in in some years. The house, holding about 350 seats,
starts at the edge of the playing area and climbs sharply up and
away.
</P>
<P>
   Last night I had intended to include ``Floating the Tongue,''
but the sound check was so poor that I decided to postpone it. When
that section of the evening rolled around, I started talking about
the piece and ended up doing a shortened version. I described
Mirza's floating the tongue in Zen meditation and invited the
audience to try it. With low lights in the auditorium and my poor
eyesight, I can't say who, if any, actually tried. Later the
festival director remarked how surprised he was that the audience
``allowed'' me these liberties.
</P>
<P>
   I am pleased to say that there is something in the nature of
``The Breathing Show'' that puts people in an amiable mood, so they
laugh easily. Each of ``Floating the Tongue's'' phases was met with
laughter and applause. It was as if they were delighting in a
parlor trick. Tonight I will once again encourage the audience to
try the exercise before I begin. &QL;

   Last night's ``Breathing Show'' was only about 60 percent
filled, which dampened my enthusiasm, but the audience warmed
considerably as the evening progressed. Solo performing has served
at least one vital function so far. I've been made acutely aware of
mental and emotional oscillations that affect my mood, my
perception of events, people and circumstances. I am sometimes
temporarily overcome with feelings of uncertainty and enmity that
arise with a perception that I am being watched with cold judgment
and/or condescension. While this can be true and is always a part
of life and performance, I must acknowledge that much of this
perception is my projection brought on by certain mental and
emotional habits. Dancing to Schubert's lieder is a constant battle
to balance this situation as I set about performing the material.
In general, when I am unhappy performing, the ad-lib material,
designed to open myself more to the moment, becomes a chore.
</P>
<P>
   There was a first last night: someone took me up on my bluff
invitation to come up and dance with me. A young woman, longing to
do it, was pushed forward by her boyfriend. I announced that the
only rule was that I could not look at her until the dance was
completed. She was brave and fluid. I watched our shadows cross,
dodging in and out of each other. The moment culminated in my
lifting her over my back and head, then folding her down in a
crouch on my right thigh where she whispered, ``Is that enough?'' I
held her longer than either of us expected, then set her gently on
the floor. In a courtly manner we made our way downstage, my eyes
still averted, and at last confronted each other with a bow before
she returned to her seat. It was a brave, deep moment, offering no
surprises, but full of excitement. She was a fine-boned, pretty
young woman in black nubby sweater, long black wool skirt and black
Doc Martens. Her pleasant open face gave me a look at once
challenging and questioning: ``Did I do well? Was it what you
wanted?'' &QL;

   After the Hancher Auditorium premiere of ``The Breathing Show,''
I was depressed and despairing at just how unsatisfied I had felt
with the evening. Now, having injected songs, ad-libbed
transitions, more of my personality, I feel more complete at the
end of each show. More satisfied. Dancing an encore to Blossom
Dearie's ``Manhattan'' is like sharing a warm cup at the end of a
meal: I am replete _ for a while. Watching the company perform is
different, but not greatly. Here, too, there is a sense of
fulfillment. Is it rightness? When the audience relaxes and
approaches the climax with us in ``D-Man,'' what is the
satisfaction? Maybe it is some simple social bonding. Or maybe it's
an affirmation of our/my place in the great impersonal sea of
humankind.

EYEWITNESS TO DIALLO SHOOTING TESTIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The spelling of SCHRRIE in 2nd graf is cq.) 
(js) 
 By JANE FRITSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A neighbor of Amadou Diallo's testified
reluctantly for the defense Wednesday that she heard someone say
``Gun!'' just before the four police officers accused of his murder
began firing at him as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment
building a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was testimony that the lawyers for the police wanted greatly,
but it came at a price. The woman, Schrrie Elliott, said on
cross-examination by prosecutors that she saw the four officers get
out of their car with their guns drawn and, without shouting any
warnings, begin firing at Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he fell down immediately?'' asked Donald Levin, a
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they continued shooting when he was down?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she replied with a sob.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers were taken by surprise by that testimony and
spent much of the day trying to repair the damage. In interviews,
they acknowledged that calling her to the stand had been a gamble,
since they had never interviewed her and were uncertain what she
would say. All they knew about her was that in a television
interview last year she had said that she had heard someone say,
``Gun!'' and that Diallo remained standing after a substantial
number of shots were fired. Both statements would bolster their
argument that the officers were justified in shooting 41 times
because they feared for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But even on those two points, Elliott seemed to backtrack
Wednesday, saying that it could have been Diallo, not one of the
officers, who said ``Gun!'' and that he fell to the ground
immediately after the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the lawyers persuaded Justice Joseph Teresi to allow
them to treat her as a hostile witness, meaning that the defense
lawyers can cross-examine their own witness, which they will do
when they recall her on Thursday. The ruling also entitled them to
see her grand jury testimony and reports of interviews with the
police.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, who had decided not to call her as their
witness, had not been required to turn over the statements because,
before the trial began, two judges had ruled that they would not be
helpful to the defense and that, therefore, the defense was not
entitled to them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Eric Warner, the chief prosecutor, declined to
comment on the day's events, but said, ``We don't set traps for
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Also outside court, Stephen Worth, a lawyer for one officer,
Edward McMellon, said, ``The district attorney has done everything
possible to put a roadblock between us and the word `gun.'''
</P>
<P>
   Elliot had spoken to the prosecutors but refused to talk to the
defense lawyers, and they were forced to subpoena her for her
testimony. She is expected to be the only eyewitness to the
shooting, and the only witness, other than the officers themselves,
to testify that someone said ``Gun!''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever damage she may have done to the defense is outweighed
by that testimony, several defense lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun part is very, very important,'' said John D. Patten,
who represents Officer Sean Carroll. ``It's extremely important,
and that's why we called her. We weighed our risks and we think
there's enough upside here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lawyers said that the 50 or so pages of reports about
Elliott that were turned over Wednesday would help them undermine
or clarify some of her more damaging statements when they call her
as a hostile witness Thursday. They also hope to be allowed to show
her television interview and cross-examine her about the apparent
contradictions between what she said then and her testimony
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers declined to say whether they would ask Elliott about
her criminal record. She said Wednesday on the witness stand that,
``I've had my dealings with the law before.'' But they were not
allowed to ask her about her arrest record because lawyers are not
permitted to impeach their own witnesses. In the end, Patten said,
``We may not be wise to discredit her.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott was among seven witnesses called by the lawyers for the
defense as they began their attack on the prosecution's case. The
first, Sgt. Peter Schumacher of the Internal Affairs Division, was
called to raise questions about the testimony of two of Diallo's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   One, Debbie Rivera, had testified that she had not yet gone to
bed on the night of the shooting and had looked out the window to
see four men in street clothes standing around a double-parked car.
A few moments later, she said, she heard two bursts of gunfire. But
according to his police report, Schumacher said that when he
interviewed Rivera the next evening, she said she had been sleeping
and was awakened by the shots.
</P>
<P>
   The other neighbor, Thomas Bell, had testified that he noticed
Diallo as they were both walking down the street about 30 minutes
before the shooting, but was not afraid of him. Schumacher said he
wrote in his report that Bell told him the following night that he
had ``kept a watchful eye'' on Diallo because he made him
``nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   On cross-examination, Schumacher acknowledged that he had not
taken verbatim notes of the conversations, and that Bell might not
have said ``kept a watchful eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Another defense witness, Diallo's landlord, Deenauth Bassit,
testified Wednesday that he was awakened by the gunfire but
remained in bed for about 30 minutes until a police officer came to
his door. When he went out to look at the body in the vestibule,
Bassit said, the light there was on but the one above the front
steps was off. Several prosecution witnesses had said it was on at
the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   On cross examination, Bassit said he had been confused when he
told investigators several days after the shooting that the outside
light had been on that night.

The trouble with `The Tigger Movie'? Happily, there is none 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does anyone not like Winnie the Pooh and his forest friends?
With Pooh's popularity, which has held steady for generations, it's
surprising we haven't been inundated with big-screen Pooh
adventures. But ``The Tigger Movie'' marks the first time in a
couple of decades that Pooh and pals have been in theaters. It was
a long time coming, but the new adventure doesn't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Tigger has always said it, and we've always believed it: The
wonderful thing about Tiggers is that he's the only one. But this
time, the exuberant tiger begins to hope he's NOT the only one of
his kind. Tigger wonders if he has a family out there somewhere _ a
whole gang of grandparents and uncles and cousins who are just as
bouncy and ``stripedy'' as he is. So he takes off through the
Hundred Acre Wood in search of his family tree.
</P>
<P>
   The search, of course, involves examining actual trees, trying
to find the ``most gigantical, stripedy'' one that must hold the
Tigger family. Tigger's friends try to help, but the gang has never
had too much brain power, even collectively. ``Now that I think
about it, I don't remember a Tigger making quite that sort of
sound,'' Pooh muses after he and Eeyore and Piglet discover a pond
full of hopping, croaking frogs they think must be Tigger's family.
They search, but they don't find any more Tiggers. And the
one-and-only Tigger becomes discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Pooh, Piglet and the gang try to help their friend, but their
plans inevitably backfire. Once Tigger figures out what they're up
to, he runs out the door into a fierce winter storm and only after
facing adversity does he learn that his family's been right in
front of him the entire time _ his family of friends.
</P>
<P>
   There's something comforting about Winnie the Pooh and his pals.
You know what to expect: Pooh will always be sweetly simple and
endlessly kind, Eeyore will always be likably morose and
fatalistic, Tigger will always be bouncy and full of malapropisms.
Usually, this two-dimensional type of characterization makes for a
weak story, but the flat characters make the film predictable in a
warm and fuzzy way.
</P>
<P>
   These fuzzy friends project an innocence and a gentle humanity
that make them irresistible. And in ``The Tigger Movie,'' they do
show more depth. Anger and hurt, love and concern make the
characters real, and those emotions pull together a story that
offers entertainment and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Pooh stories have always been about the power and necessity of
friendship, and ``The Tigger Movie'' is no different. But the movie
carries this theme beautifully, and that's what makes it such a
wonderful thing.
</P>
<P>

audiences. &QL;

SMUGGLERS OF CHINESE IMMIGRANTS REFINE TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chinese smugglers who use cargo containers on freighters to
bring immigrants illegally into the United States are back. But
this time, their tactics have grown more sophisticated _ and
potentially more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, immigration officials took 15 Chinese stowaways
into custody on Los Angeles' Terminal Island. All had made the
passage across the Pacific in a hard-topped container specially
equipped with secret doors, lights and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said the discovery was the first evidence
that smugglers are turning to hard-topped containers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a signal that they are trying to figure out a new way
to smuggle people in,'' said Sharon Gavin, spokeswoman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's Western regional office in
California.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first container smuggling in a month after a rash of
soft-topped container smuggling on the West Coast in December and
January.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials had warned that the smugglers were likely going to
change tactics away from soft-topped containers, but not quit. The
profit is too high, they said. Indeed, the 15 people caught in Los
Angeles agreed to pay up to $60,000 apiece to get to America.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had cut two doors, each 3 feet by 2 feet, on the
container's sides. Hinges were placed inside. Paint and epoxy
applied outside the container camouflaged the doors, Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the immigrants _ 14 men and a 16-year-old boy _ had
lights and fans powered by car batteries. They had bottled water,
canned juice and produce to drink and eat. There were four
30-gallon containers for waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very sophisticated effort,'' Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   In December and January, more than 140 Chinese stowed away on
eight different ships that arrived at West Coast ports from Hong
Kong. Four ships arrived at Seattle. On one, three of the 18
stowaways died during the voyage. The cause of death is still being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Smugglers used soft-topped containers in December and January.
Their plan was that after the container was unloaded, the
immigrants would cut their way out of the soft top and escape.
</P>
<P>
   In a hard-topped container, immigrants are essentially entombed
with no way of getting out until someone outside opens it or unless
someone cuts a secret door.
</P>
<P>
   The container that carried the 15 stowaways had been loaded on
APL's President Polk on Jan. 23 in Hong Kong, supposedly carrying
toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always troubling when any third party uses your system
for purposes that we didn't intend,'' said John Pachtner, a
spokesman for APL (formerly American President Lines), at its
Oakland, Calif., headquarters. ``All carriers are working with the
authorities to try and address this ongoing issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In several recent cases, INS agents had been tipped off about
the smuggling and were waiting on the docks for the container ship
to arrive. In some cases, agents even could ask for the container
by its serial number.
</P>
<P>
   But the President Polk arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday
morning without the INS waiting for it. The immigrants got out of
the container apparently unseen. Security officers found them
Saturday night wandering around Terminal Island, Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 immigrants were in an INS detention center in Lancaster,
Calif., Wednesday. Like the other stowaways, they are from China's
coastal Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   The container smuggling stopped after Jan. 11. INS agents
working with Hong Kong authorities had found out which ships were
carrying stowaways. American agents also hoped that bad publicity
from arrests and deaths would dissuade others from stowing away on
containers.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the government of Hong Kong launched a program to
inspect all soft-topped containers and use carbon-dioxide and heat
detectors to find stowaways.
</P>
<P>
   Large cargo ships carry only a handful of soft-topped
containers, making inspections easy. But vessels like the President
Polk can carry thousands of 20-and 40-foot hard-topped containers,
so detection has become more difficult, Gavin said.
</P>
<P>
   She said INS officials also worry about the safety of stowaways
on hard-topped containers. Secret doors may not operate. There may
not be any doors. The stowaways could be left on the dock in a
locked, hard-topped container to suffocate.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 stowaways remain in detention in the Seattle area. They
are expected to seek asylum and will likely have asylum hearings
over the next two weeks.

 &HT;    New TNT chief hired from Coke
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting is about to land one of
Coca-Cola's top marketing executives, and a leading sports marketer
nationwide, to lead cable channel TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Steve R. Koonin, Coca-Cola's vice president for consumer
marketing, is expected to be officially named today as TNT's
executive vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Koonin will assume day-to-day control of a channel with 77
million subscribers that is routinely ranked among the top five in
terms of viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Koonin's assignment is to build recognition of the channel as a
brand _ just like he did during his 14 years at Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bring the ability to build a brand,'' says Koonin, 42. ``My
job is to take TNT to the next level, make it one of those 11
channels that people keep coming back to and call home.''
</P>
<P>
   Building TNT as a brand is part of a larger strategy within
Turner Broadcasting. The company is now trying to extend the
influence of its many channels. Turner Broadcasting executives want
viewers to tune into TNT not for any particular show but for the
brand cachet of the channel itself. They want that cachet to extend
beyond television.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to build an emotional attachment to TNT, CNN and
TBS, much the way it exists today for Coke or NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tough assignment, given the ever-growing number of new
channels on cable systems and on direct broadcast satellite
services. Indeed, there are 200-plus channels today, although no
system carries every one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Koonin's arrival marks the completion of a reorganization of
Turner Broadcasting's top entertainment channels. In the fall, the
company announced that it would create the new position of
president of general entertainment networks, which would oversee
the previously independent channels TBS and TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley J. Siegel, who had been president of TNT, was named to
the new position. In November, Siegel named Dennis Quinn executive
vice president and general manager of TBS.
</P>
<P>
   With TNT, Siegel is trying to reposition the channel with
upscale families looking for high-quality programming. He says that
Koonin has the grasp of popular culture and television to do that
for TNT.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most creative thinkers I know,'' said Siegel,
who has known Koonin for the past five years. ``Not only can he
dream up really big ideas, but he can implement them, too.''

 &HT;    Confidential Coke documents released
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Airing its dirty laundry in public is not what
Coca-Cola wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   But the company had little choice after a federal judge ruled it
had to release confidential documents about its shortcomings on
workplace diversity to the plaintiffs in a racial discrimination
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just handing over those papers to the plaintiffs'
attorneys, however, the company Wednesday made them available to
reporters covering the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great deal of attention has been focused on these documents,
and we want to make sure the information is put in the proper
context,'' said Coca-Cola spokesman Ben Deutsch. ``It is a critical
self-analysis of the company's diversity efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri described the release of
these documents as ``the litigation equivalent of the fall of the
Berlin Wall. You fight us over these documents for 10 months and
then you blast fax them to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the information is an internal report by Carl
Ware, the company's highest ranking black executive. The 1995
report, which was given to then-President M. Douglas Ivester, was
put together after Ware met with four other senior African-American
executives at the company.
</P>
<P>
   In summarizing their collective experiences at Coke, Ware's
report said:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some African-Americans are viewed inappropriately as lacking
the skills and intelligence to succeed in certain aspects of the
business. This can create a difficult working environment that
hinders, rather than facilitates, growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even when African-Americans were few in number, an informal
network was operating to provide ``sanity checks'' for them, which
involved comparing their experiences. This allowed many of them to
retain their ``psychological health.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The ability to depersonalize prejudicial behavior, as well as
diplomacy and resourcefulness, were common tools used by the Ware
group members. ``Instances were mentioned where members had been
humiliated, ignored, overlooked or unacknowledged,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that accompanied the release of the documents
Wednesday, the company acknowledged that it needs to improve its
diversity record.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the company has taken some actions since that report was
written, we are not where we want to be where diversity is
concerned,'' Jack Stahl, president-designate, said in the
statement. ``We must and will make accelerated progress. ... A
diverse workforce is critical for our people and our business.''
Stahl currently co-chairs the company's Diversity Advisory Council
with Ware.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch, the company spokesman, said Ware's report was written
so Coca-Cola could examine the experiences of successful
African-American executives. As a result, he said, the company
``could better understand potential barriers and develop and
implement recommendations for success for minority executives.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Ware's report, another senior black executive, Paul
Graves, wrote a memo on diversity. In this ``highly restrictive,
highly confidential'' memo, Graves said:
</P>
<P>
   _ There is a perception among African-American employees that a
number of highly educated and trained black employees have received
``unfavorable treatment.'' This has created the impression within
the company that it is a ``high risk environment for high potential
and aggressive African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   _ There is no evidence that the company, in the absence of laws
requiring affirmative action, has a commitment to achieve more
diversity. He cited a lack of strong leadership from the top.
</P>
<P>
   Graves is now vice president for human resources for Africa and
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Coke also released a 1998 memo from Ingrid Saunders Jones, vice
president of corporate external affairs, to Ivester, who by that
time was chairman. In it, Jones, a black woman, shares the
difficulties she has faced in being equally recognized among her
peers at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes those `invisible moments' are driven by chauvinism
and power ... sometimes by subconscious dismissal of those who are
different ... sometimes by pure and absolute disrespect ... and
sometimes as a result of a lack of consciousness,'' Jones wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In a short response, Ivester told Jones he would like specific
examples of her experiences. He also agreed to her request to
periodically meet with her.
</P>
<P>
   But Mehri, the plaintiffs' attorney, said ``the documents show
that the senior African-Americans earnestly and constructively
raised these issues to Ivester, but he ignored these red flags. Now
(chairman-designate) Doug Daft has the opportunity to make amends
for the past wrongs through the settlement process and set a gold
standard with respect to diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri was referring to the court-ordered mediation sessions
aimed at trying to settle the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The highly publicized suit was filed by eight current and former
employees who allege that Coca-Cola has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
They are seeking class-action status to represent more than 2,000
black salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the allegations.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Anonymous assaults on major Web sites continued
spreading Wednesday as computer vandals crippled a major online
brokerage and at least two media sites, the Justice Department
pledged to find those responsible and computer experts questioned
whether any reliable defense against the attacks existed.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of what increasingly appeared to be a well
planned and tightly coordinated siege by a single individual or
group, the impact of the attacks grew. In addition to damaging
commerce at the targeted sites, they began slowing traffic
throughout the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, while pledging a vigorous pursuit
of the persons responsible, also acknowledged that they remained
unknown to authorities, having well covered their electronic
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned e-commerce companies across the Net _ many of whose
publicly traded shares dropped in value Wednesday as investors
tried to understand the implications _ began taking extraordinary
measures to protect their Web sites from becoming targets.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, computer security experts said the complex, anonymous
nature of the attacks made them difficult to trace or stop.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said the attacks appear to have been weeks or
months in the planning, since they require clandestinely loading
software onto dozens, if not hundreds, of computers around the
Internet. When those programs were activated this week, the host
computers were transformed into platforms for launching the
attacks. In almost all cases, experts said, the owners of the
computers never knew _ and still may not know _ that their machines
had become cogs in the attack machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to believe there are thousands of these tools out
there waiting for the launch button to be pushed,'' said David M.
Remnitz, chief executive of IFsec LLC, a New York-based information
security company. Suggesting that the attackers already had the
infrastructure in place for the attacks to continue indefinitely,
he added, ``I don't see any reason why they would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the FBI had opened a criminal investigation, but she
and bureau officials acknowledged that they had no strong leads and
that they had heard no credible claims of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we are not aware of the motives behind these
attacks'' the attorney general said, ``but they appear to be
intended to interfere with and to disrupt legitimate electronic
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have disrupted the Internet as a whole in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote Systems, a company that measures the reliability and
performance of Web sites, reported Wednesday that during the
attacks, it took 8 seconds to call up a typical Web site's home
page, nearly twice the time required during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While government and computer industry sources continued to
acknowledge Wednesday that they could not be certain that the same
group or individual was behind the attacks, they said the nature of
the assaults seemed too similar to be coincidental. In each case,
the targeted Web site was so flooded with meaningless data that the
company's computers became paralyzed and unable to serve customers.
</P>
<P>
   What began with an attack on the popular Yahoo portal site
Monday, spread Wednesday to Zdnet.com, a media site, and Etrade,
one of the largest online brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one other major site appears to have been targeted.
Although the Internet media company CNet declined to comment
Wednesday, its network service provider reported detecting an
attack on the company's sites Tuesday afternoon but managed to
provide enough of a defense to avert crippling damages.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Di Chiro, spokesman for Etrade, based in Menlo Park,
Calif., said the company planned to deal ``one on one'' with
customers who asserted they lost money by not being able to access
the site to place trades.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro said following the assaults Monday on Yahoo and Tuesday
on Buy.com, a retail site, and Ebay.com, an auction site, Etrade
began discussing what measures might be taken to defend the site
against a similar attack. Although he said unnamed measures were
taken, the company was unable to prevent the attack. But the
company did have several contingency plans in place, including
directing visitors to an alternate Web site, which Etrade
advertised over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the attacks have been difficult to counter is
that finding the perpetrators and cutting them off requires a
cooperative, concerted effort between the targeted Web site and its
network service provider, the company that connects the site's own
computers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vixie, senior vice president of Internet services for
AboveNet, a network service provider whose clients include eBay and
CNet, said the attackers appeared to be have installed widely
available software that, when secretly planted on other people's
computers, flood the target site with useless streams of
information and instructions to do meaningless tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said AboveNet was hit with as much as 800 megabits of
``spurious traffic,'' a level that could cost the company $400,000
a month to transport if it continued at consistent levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would cost us $400,000 a month just because some teen-ager
with a $300 Linux box doesn't like one of our customers,'' said.
``It makes us a little testy.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier incarnation of this type of attack emerged two years
ago, but new illicit software has circulated that makes them easier
to launch and more difficult to defend against. The attacks
themselves have intensified in the last nine months, striking not
just the well publicized major sites, but also smaller sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, a federally
financed computer security organization based at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, along with private computer security
firms have released numerous warnings in recent months describing
the attacks and suggesting ways to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dick, chief of the FBI's Computer Investigations and
Operations Section, acknowledged that tools for this type of
attack, known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack, are so
readily available on the Web that the attacks could have been
launched by a 15-year-old. ``It doesn't take a great deal of
sophistication,'' Dick said. ``In a relatively short of period time
an unsophisticated intruder or unsophisticated computer user can
take advantage of not only the U.S. government, but also
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, purposely disrupting computer networks is a
felony punishable for first-time offenders with a jail term of up
to five years and a $250,000 fine, plus assessment of damages. But
Dick repeatedly said the FBI had no hope of solving the crime
without ``help from the entire community'' _ meaning primarily the
various Internet service providers, or ISPs, whose servers were
used to pass the data from the attacker to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with FBI to track the source of the attacks,''
Vixie said, echoing similar statements from officials at Yahoo and
Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said there were several measures sites could take to
protect themselves, including increasing their capacity to handle
traffic, using operating systems that can sift out malicious
traffic and installing the latest security patches that prevent the
sites from being commandeered to launch attacks on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   But he also added: ``This level of alertness is not sustainable.
We are hoping that there will be a technological or legal solution
so we can go back to building our network rather than defending
against attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   AboveNet and other Internet service providers have begun
filtering out suspicious traffic, but that, they said, is an
approach that must be continuously adjusted as attackers change
their means of assault.

TALKS STALL AT BOEING, AND ENGINEERS GO ON STRIKE
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   More than 16,000 engineers and technical workers at the Boeing
Co. went on strike Wednesday after contract negotiations broke down
over wages and health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, only the second in the last 56 years for the
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace union,
was not expected to hurt Boeing's near-term ability to deliver
planes.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were clearly skittish. Shares of Boeing dropped
4.9 percent, or $2 a share, to close at $39. The Dow Jones
industrial average plunged 258.44 points Wednesday, but analysts
believed that Boeing's setback was heightened by investor angst
over its union squabble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing was a down stock on Tuesday in a weak market,'' said
Sam Pearlstein, a research analyst with ING Barings. ``It's
somewhat of a surprise that investors are this nervous about the
strike, given that it shouldn't hurt Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also noted that the walkout could hardly be called a
surprise. Boeing, which has about 197,000 employees overall, has
been in tense negotiations with the union, which represents 22,000
engineers and technical workers at the company, since last October.
A strike had become increasingly possible during the last few
weeks, when the two groups could not agree on several key points,
including bonus pay and reductions in health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's engineers have wanted guaranteed wage increases and a
bonus plan similar to the one the company granted last year for its
machinists. As a group, the machinists should receive bonus pay of
about $4,400 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machinists received a nice bonus,'' said Charles
Bofferding, the executive director of the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace. ``But we're supposed to be
happy with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Boeing believes that it has conceded to several of
the union's demands. The company has proposed to set up three funds
for merit raises. The engineers would receive increases averaging 8
percent during the first year of the contract, while technical
workers would receive about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not offered a bonus in either of our two proposals,''
said Peter Conte, a spokesman for Boeing. ``But we're offering to
improve their salaries through the salary adjustment funds. About
97 percent of the engineers received a salary adjustment last year
through the existing fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had not taken a strike by Boeing's engineers as a
serious threat to the company. Boeing's engineers are paid $63,000
annually while the technical workers are paid about $45,000. The
union's last strike against Boeing lasted for only a day, leaving
many analysts to believe that this walkout would also be short
lived.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be the case, the engineer's union has gained
strength among its members in recent months. Six months ago, only
30 percent of Boeing's engineers and technical workers were members
of the union, but the count has since climbed to 63 percent,
according to Bofferding.
</P>
<P>
   Union members were also vocal at Wednesday's walkout. Many of
them left the Boeing offices chanting, ``Take back Boeing. We are
Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bofferding predicted late Wednesday that 80 percent of the
union's membership would honor the strike, but it was unclear how
many engineers had actually left their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts remained confident that Boeing could maintain its
production of planes for several weeks or longer if its engineers
remained on strike. But it was unclear from Boeing and the
engineers union just how long the strike would continue.
Negotiations between the two groups have yet to be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem is that we get no respect from the
company,'' Bofferding said. ``They're just refusing to bargain. The
machinists negotiated with the company when they were at a weak
time. Boeing just wet their pants and emptied their pockets.''

GOT A FREE TRICYCLE AT AGE 3? SUSPENDED

<P>
   Erick Barkley, St. John's. Jamal Crawford, Michigan. JaRon Rush,
UCLA. Kareem Rush, Missouri. Andre Williams, Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Call them the NCAA Five, not the Fab Five. And also know they
are victims of a sinful system and an organization that has less
heart than the Tin Man.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley and Crawford are serving suspensions handed down by the
NCAA. So is JaRon Rush. His brother, Kareem, and Williams are
finished serving time in the NCAA penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   Here are their ``crimes:'' Barkley traded cars with a friend.
Crawford, with his mother's permission, lived with a benefactor
while he attended high school in Seattle. The Rush brothers
accepted money and gifts from a summer Amateur Athletic Union
coach. Williams had his prep-school tuition paid by a man who has
helped dozens of other needy students improve their lot in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people who govern our sport do not have
empathy for the socioeconomic backgrounds of the youngsters playing
our sport,'' said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who is good friends
with St. John's coach Mike Jarvis. ``The word empathy is not
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has targeted basketball and summer recruiting. As part
of the cost-cutting frenzy of the 1990s, a summer recruiting period
was established. In a three-week period in July, coaches can
one-stop-shop for recruits at events around the country where teams
of high school players compete. Smaller schools in particular love
the opportunity to see hundreds of players at one time.
</P>
<P>
   This move de-emphasized recruiting during the school year and
emphasized recruiting in the summer. And the summer scene is
controlled by shoe companies and a number of questionable
characters. In Kansas City, for instance, Myron Piggie ran an AAU
team that featured the city's best players and played all over the
country. Piggie also was on Nike's payroll. The Rush brothers
played for Piggie's team. For that, they've paid a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley is being punished because he swapped cars (his 1996 Jeep
Grand Cherokee for a 1995 sports-utility vehicle) with an old
friend who the NCAA suspects could become Barkley's agent.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA objects to Seattle businessman Barry Henthorn
purchasing a $12,000 1988 Mercedes for Crawford and giving him
thousands of dollars in cash, plus free living arrangements, when
Henthorn was not Crawford's legal guardian. Henthorn says he is not
a Michigan booster and had nothing to do with Crawford's school
selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a bad dream,'' Crawford said. ``I didn't do
anything wrong, so I can't feel responsible for what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you did, Jamal. You were blessed with athletic talent. And
that talent, which helped set you apart in high school and which
could earn you millions as a professional, is a curse when it comes
to dealing with the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the NCAA rule in question: There must be no
``preferential treatment, benefits or services because of the
individual's athletics reputation or skill or pay-back potential as
a professional athlete, unless such treatment, benefits or services
are specifically permitted under NCAA legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Any parent of a newborn should be on the alert. If your child
has aspirations of becoming a scholarship athlete, you must avoid
any possible violations for 18 years or so. Big Brother is
watching. And as far as the NCAA is concerned, it doesn't matter if
a gift giver has absolutely no ties to a school nor influences an
athlete's matriculation decision. No good deed will go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, a former president of the National Association of
Basketball Coaches, used the words ``communism'' and ``Gestapo'' to
describe the NCAA. Strong words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray I see the day when there is no NCAA,'' he
said. ``This is about America. This is about human rights, the
right of each individual. This is about what has torn our country
apart, which is greed, which is money and which is power.''
</P>
<P>
   Seton Hall coach, guard
</P>
<P>
   working out differences
</P>
<P>
   When he was at Duke, Tommy Amaker developed a special
player-coach relationship with Mike Krzyzewski. As the Blue Devils'
point guard, Amaker was an extension of Coach K on the court. Now
that he's a head coach, Amaker is experiencing the player-coach
relationship from the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   Amaker became Seton Hall's coach three seasons ago. He inherited
a talented point guard, Shaheen Holloway, who averaged 17.3 points
per game as a freshman. Holloway was expected to blossom under the
instruction of Amaker, who had honed his coaching skills as an
assistant at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   But this relationship has been rockier than Pamela and Tommy
Lee's. Under former coach George Blaney, Holloway was The Man in an
up-tempo attack. When Amaker took over, he wanted the Pirates to
slow the pace. That meant Holloway had to become more of a floor
leader, less of a stat-sheet stuffer.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last night's game at Rutgers, Seton Hall was 16-4
overall and 8-2 in the Big East Conference. Monday night, the
Pirates won at Syracuse for the third consecutive season. Barring a
complete collapse, Seton Hall will be playing in the NCAA
Tournament for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Amaker knows that Holloway's growth as a leader and a player is
a major factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning, and he's the most important piece in the
puzzle,'' Amaker said. ``He's been everything for us. We go as he
goes. He knows it. He's producing, and he's been unselfish. He's
the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10 Holloway averaged 15 points a game as a sophomore
and 9.3 points last season. This season, not including last night,
Holloway is averaging 12.6 points and 6.2 assists. Surprisingly,
his 5.3 rebounds per game lead the team. A career 35.5 percent
shooter _ 28.1 percent from 3-point range _ he is shooting 44.8
percent this season and 37.2 percent on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is still the same,'' Holloway said. ``From day one, my
ultimate goal was to make the NBA, and that hasn't changed. I'm not
focused on it right now. If I do what I've got to do for the team,
then that'll speak for itself. I just want to get in the
Tournament, and win. When you win games, you've got a better chance
of doing things you want to. The more games we win, the more it'll
be helpful for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Above the rim
</P>
<P>
   The Big East Conference becomes a 14-team basketball league
split into two divisions next season with the addition of Virginia
Tech. The main complaint of coaches, though, is that the last-place
team in each division won't play in the 12-team Big East tourney in
Madison Square Garden. Commissioner Mike Tranghese leaves little
hope that the tourney format will change. ``If you can't play
yourself into a position of being one of the top 12 of 14 spots,
you've got bigger problems in your program than not going to New
York City,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland hopes sophomore center Lonny Baxter continues to
produce. In his past three games, Baxter averaged 26.3 points, 8.3
rebounds and 3.3 blocks. The Terrapins, benefitting from a
well-balanced offensive attack, won all three. ``What's helped
Lonny is we've done a better job of getting the ball inside and
Juan Dixon and Terence Morris have scored pretty consistently from
the perimeter,'' Maryland coach Gary Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Michigan State played host to defending national champion
Connecticut on Saturday, the Spartans got a special pre-game pep
talk. Muhammad Ali walked into the locker room and said three
words: ``Play like champs.'' Michigan State did, turning the
visiting Huskies into chumps. Final score: 85-66. ``It was just one
of those storybook days,'' Michigan State coach Tom Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson sophomore guard Will Solomon leads the Atlantic Coast
Conference in scoring at 21.1 points per game and is among the
leaders in minutes per game at 35.8. ``I've said this before, and
I'm quite certain it's a statement that will hold up: Will Solomon
is the finest-conditioned athlete that I've had a chance to coach
in 26 years, and that probably includes close to 15 NBA players and
a slew of wonderful, wonderful, fine-conditioned players.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast breaks
</P>
<P>
   Trash talk
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State coach Larry Eustachy on his team's narrow margin for
error:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not nearly a national contender. I've talked a lot about
winning this conference to our team, but not in the media. I tell
the team that if we do A, B and C, we can beat anybody. But come
on, we're starting a 6-6 post guy and a 6-4 \Rpower forward\S.
We've got seven guys \Rwho play most of the minutes\S. We've just
been very fortunate in some areas, and some things have worked
out.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA sophomore center Dan Gadzuric on his inconsistent play:
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem is mental. I'm in a daze, and I have to get
out of it fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest coach Dave Odom on how Duke's dominance has affected
the Atlantic Coast Conference:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to me because the rest of the league hasn't
stood to the standard Duke is setting right now. As a league, we've
got to do a better job. That's nothing derogatory toward Duke. Duke
has done their job. The rest of us haven't. We've got to stand up;
we've got to do better. Duke is setting a very high standard right
now, and the rest of us better get ourselves in gear.''
</P>

FIRMS WON'T SAY WHETHER THEY WERE INSURED FOR WEB ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With WEB-ATTACK, WEB-ATTACK-FBI) 
(bl) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yahoo, eBay and other companies whose Web sites came under
attack this week would not say Wednesday whether they carried
insurance to cover their losses.
</P>
<P>
   The few insurers that specialize in e-commerce often request
that clients not discuss specifics of the policies, which were
developed over the last couple of years, for fear of inviting
attacks. The policies protect against damages to systems and data
and to losses suffered by customers of the Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   But insurance experts say many of the biggest and best-known
companies do not have such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot shots of the Internet are focused on their business
models _ getting venture capital money, getting their brand and
their product out there,'' said Emily Freeman, who is in charge of
cybercoverage at Marsh &AMP; McLennan Cos., the insurance broker.
``They're not thinking about insurance _ risk management.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh &AMP; McLennan, working with four big insurers _ American
International Group, Chubb Insurance, Lloyd's of London and the
Zurich Group _ offers coverage of up to $250 million. Premiums
start at $10,000 to $20,000 for $1 million in coverage and diminish
proportionately as the coverage increases.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh and other insurers said they knew of no claims having been
made on the new insurance. It addresses some of the same concerns
as standard business coverage like business interruption. But in
standard coverage the triggering events for policies are often
physical: an explosion, say, or a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, online coverage focuses on intangibles that are not
usually covered: the theft of electronic data, for example. ``The
cyberattack is not covered under the standard business-interruption
policy because it is not considered a physical intrusion,'' said Ty
R. Sagalow, who is in charge of the new insurance field at AIG.
</P>
<P>
   Online coverage protects not only against assaults, he said, but
for accidents or mistakes on the part of an insured client. One
example, he said, would be if an employee innocently sent out an
e-mail containing a virus that shut down another business.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most insurers are staying out of online business
coverage, in part because everything about the field is so new that
it is hard to predict just what will go wrong _ and how far wrong.
That makes it hard to figure out how much to charge in premiums.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main selling points of the insurers is that their
coverage is not just passive recovery of losses, but helps
customers correct security problems to prevent future attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Norris, an underwriter specializing in cyberbusiness
coverage at Lloyd's of London, said a pre-emptive insurance policy
could help a company make sure that an ``intrusion detection
system'' is in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security software providers that we work with would
provide that,'' Norris said, ``along with anti-virus software and
well-configured fire walls.'' The insurance company conducts a
threat analysis, he said, and provides specialists to take
corrective measures.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Norris said, decisions on insuring online operations are
not made at the highest levels of a company. ``The board's interest
in the Internet is to grow the bottom line,'' Norris said.
``Securing the Internet is not perceived as helping to grow the
profits, but as an expense.''

NINE-TOED DEION SEEKS NEW DIGS AFTER DALLAS PLAYS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a big-name week in the local jock kingdom for coming
and going.
</P>
<P>
   Coming: One freak.
</P>
<P>
   Going: One ungrateful fraud.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what about Dennis Rodman, and there's a ton of
``what'' on his tattooed rsum, there's no fraud involved. This
freak is an open book, and an easy read. Strange, but easy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the Worm did Dallas last night, another worm had already
laid the groundwork for his departure from the local sports scene.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-Toed Deion made public comments this week that I assume
ended his lovefest with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. Be advised,
however, of no guarantees. Jerry rarely admits mistakes,
particularly mistakes where he played the fool for five long years.
</P>
<P>
   Take notes here, Mark Cuban. The player is never your friend.
</P>
<P>
   No jock in sports history has ever been treated better by an
owner than Nine-Toed was by Mr. Jones. But in the end, it was all
about fraud, and fraud is the life story of Deioness in
professional sports. Nine-Toed is the epitome of me, myself and I.
</P>
<P>
   Why Jones allowed himself to be used and abused ... Oh, well,
the chuckles you now hear are from those who think they were on the
other end when a hardball businessman like Jones was doing the
using and abusing.
</P>
<P>
   For five years, Nine-Toed collected just under $30 million in
cash from Jones for services rendered on the football field. Until
this season, Sanders earned his money when he played. Except he
didn't play often enough to justify that kind of financial reward.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the 1999 season, and even before the football disaster
was over, Sanders first insulted Jones by agreeing to return to
baseball as a full-time player. Which would make him part-time with
the Cowboys again. Jones read about that baseball decision in the
newspaper. There wasn't even the courtesy of Deioness first
informing Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, Nine-Toed delivered more public insults.
</P>
<P>
   What he said was typical: Don't blame him for anything that went
wrong with the Cowboys. That he always did his job. That the
failures were elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were at least three losses last season _ New
Orleans, the Jets and the Colts _ when Deioness' failures at
cornerback played a significant role in close defeats. But Sanders
is blessed with selective memory.
</P>
<P>
   Moving along with his comments, Nine-Toed advised us that since
the Cowboys were no longer a Super Bowl contender, then playing
here was beneath him. Therefore, it was his decision that he should
leave.
</P>
<P>
   One other shot was delivered right at Jones, this when Sanders
was critical of the offensive hires for Dave Campo's new coaching
staff. Even if Deioness is right, common decency says he should
have kept his mouth shut out of loyalty to Jones, if nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   All of this stuff coming from Nine-Toed at this time, was mainly
a cover-up. He realizes that if the Cowboys release him June 2, as
expected, then he can twist it by saying the release was a result
of him having said goodbye in early February.
</P>
<P>
   Why June 2? By waiting until then, the Cowboys soften the
salary-cap blow attached to Sanders. But even then, they will still
be docked $2.2 million in 2000 and $3.2 million in 2001. Because of
Jones' foolishness over Deioness, the cost continues for two years,
even with Sanders gone.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Deioness who played four quarters in the Pro
Bowl a year ago after missing regular-season games in December 1998
with a mysterious toe ailment. And then this year, Sanders did
everything to avoid the Pro Bowl, including mysterious knee surgery
the week before that game. This medical ``excuse'' still allowed
Nine-Toed to collect a $1.5 million contract bonus from Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A personal opinion is the Cowboys would not have won their last
Super Bowl without Jones having lured Sanders to Valley Ranch with
a $13 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But in the four years since, the luxury of paying so much to a
cornerback backfired immensely. Still, however, the Jerry paychecks
continued to line Sanders' pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Since money is all that Nine-Toed understands, there should have
at least been a personal appreciation of Jones. The class way to
handle all this would have been to shut up and leave. But as we
already knew, Deioness is totally void of class, and he proved it
again.
</P>
<P>
   I'll take the freak anytime. You can have the fraud.

CELLUCCI ADVISERS PROPOSE STIFFER HMO REGULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Cellucci administration _ perhaps in reaction to
criticism that the governor has been largely silent on urgent
health care policy issues _ is proposing broad new regulatory
initiatives to prevent another debacle like the Harvard Pilgrim
Health Care crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, as outlined in an eight-page memorandum to
Governor Paul Cellucci from two of his top policy advisers, amounts
to a candid acknowledgment that market forces have failed in health
care, and more state regulation is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be greater oversight of the financial resources
of health care organizations doing business in the commonwealth,''
declares human services secretary William D. O'Leary and consumer
affairs director Jennifer Carey in their memo.
</P>
<P>
   Among the suggested policy options are requirements that health
maintenance organizations keep minimum financial reserves and a
state insolvency fund for troubled health plans. The memo also
proposes that state regulators develop ``red flags'' to indicate
``when cash flow starts to become problematic'' for either insurers
or hospitals and other care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's reform effort comes at a time when House
Speaker Thomas Finneran and Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly have
called for special commissions to tackle the state's pressing
health care problems.
</P>
<P>
   The memo deals with far more than proposals to prevent another
Harvard Pilgrim problem. It represents the launch of an ambitious
effort to reform the state health care system from top to bottom.
It encompasses new measures to regulate health insurance and the
relationships between HMOs and caregivers, proposals to make
consumers more sensitive to the cost of health care, and a
suggestion that the state set priorities on what new medical
technologies it can afford _ a realm otherwise known as rationing.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also seeks a study by a nationally known health
economist ``to help determine why Massachusetts' health care costs
are so much higher than those in the rest of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're putting a lot on the table here,'' O'Leary said
in an interview. ``The main question will be: How do we prioritize
the action steps?''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's health reform agenda ``is ambitious in
terms of the full scope of the effort, there's no question about
that,'' said Stuart Altman, a professor of health policy at
Brandeis University who has agreed to lead a task force in the
administration's reform project.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, Altman added, ``says: `Let's take a comprehensive look
at what we could do to prevent financial meltdowns in the
future'.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Glynn, chief operating officer of Partners Healthcare,
said the administration's reform effort ``is very important because
people are worried that, in our preoccupation with solving the
immediate Harvard Pilgrim crisis, we may overlook the more
fundamental structural problems of an under-resourced health care
system in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for a major effort to find the ``true cost'' of
hospital services so that the state might determine reasonable
hospital payments _ a potential return to the ``old days'' before
1991 when Massachusetts had a hospital rate-setting commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many providers are asking the state to intervene by regulating
prices,'' the memo to Cellucci said, ``either through approving
(insurance) premium levels or through hospital rate-setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Dreyfus of the Massachusetts Hospital Association noted
there is irony in the current situation, since hospitals had
successfully lobbied in the early 1990s to deregulate the industry.
``There's no question there is increasing support in the hospital
community for reopening the question of regulation,'' Dreyfus said.
``It's clear we need to further regulate HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's reform effort, said one hospital industry
official, signals ``that the Cellucci administration is waking up
to this health care problem. The governor has been kind of absent
in this Harvard Pilgrim problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has come under criticism for not foreseeing
and acting on the mounting fiscal troubles of Harvard Pilgrim,
which was forced into state receivership Jan. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospitals tried to warn the Division of Insurance about
Harvard Pilgrim in the fall and no one would listen,'' one Boston
hospital executive said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the state's largest health insurer was still
uncertain Wednesday _ whether it might be rehabilitated as a
nonprofit insurer, sold to a for-profit company, or liquidated.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials continued to express uncertainty Wednesday
about what they would tell Reilly about their willingness to grant
10-year tax-exempt loans to Harvard Pilgrim, reportedly at a
proposed interest rate of 10.3 percent. Reilly has asked for an
answer from potential investors by the close of business Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Two major hospital systems, Caritas Christi and University of
Massachusetts/Memorial, have publicly indicated their unwillingness
to sign the ``surplus notes'' that the state is looking for to put
Harvard Pilgrim on its feet. The state and its investment banker
have told potential investors they need $175 million in loans.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining potential hospital investors Wednesday received
written guidelines from Reilly about the kinds of group discussions
they may engage in without violating antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   That notification is important, hospital sources said, because
it permits them to develop a joint position on whether to invest in
Harvard Pilgrim's rehabilitation, and under what terms.

FORBES QUITS, AND BUSH AND MCCAIN JOCKEY TO ATTRACT HIS
SUPPORTERS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also REPUBS-FORBES) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Steve Forbes abandoned his quest for the
White House on Wednesday after spending $35 million on it, further
sharpening the already intense South Carolina showdown between Gov.
George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain in the race for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' decision followed his third loss in three outings this
primary season, in Delaware on Tuesday night. Although he won the
state four years ago and campaigned energetically there again this
year, he finished behind not only Bush, who had stumped there, but
even McCain, who had not even set foot there.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said privately that Forbes bowed to reality when,
looking at the primary calendar, he could not find a state where he
would finish first or even win 25 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   His withdrawal, which he is expected to announce formally in
Washington on Thursday, set off a scramble for his endorsement and
those of social conservatives who backed his candidacy. Bush, who
had never masked his distaste for Forbes, praised him Wednesday,
saying he had introduced ``very interesting ideas into the
political discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   And McCain said of Forbes' supporters, ``I think they'll head in
our direction and we welcome them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers predicted that they would pick up most of
Forbes' support because, they said, his conservative, anti-tax
themes more closely matched the governor's than the senator's. They
also said they would breathe easier because Forbes had been the
only candidate who could match them dollar for dollar. For months,
they had braced for an onslaught of harsh attack commercials from
him.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements never surfaced, Forbes' aides said, because
they feared the spots would backfire like his caustic attacks on
Bob Dole did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's advisers, noting that Forbes drew from independent
voters in New Hampshire and Iowa who liked his anti-establishment
message, insisted that they would gain as much as Bush from the
publisher's exit from the race. That may be true more in the
upcoming contests, including the one here, where independents can
vote in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   For all the competition for Forbes' support, his withdrawal may
not be extraordinarily consequential because, more than anything,
it further clarifies what had already escalated into a
two-candidate competition. In fact, polls showed that Forbes'
support was so narrow in states like South Carolina that the
allegiance of his backers would only make a difference if they
swing in one direction _ and if the contests are particularly
close.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bill Dal Col, Forbes' chief strategist, echoed many
Republican strategists who said the race had grown so fiercely
competitive that the publisher's endorsement would be a mere
sidelight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the race is now being defined by McCain, who is closing
in on Bush in polls here and in pivotal states like Michigan and
California. And now, even Bush's advisers acknowledge privately
that if McCain, building on the publicity he has received since his
landslide victory in New Hampshire, wins in the Feb. 19 primary
here, he could be hard to stop in subsequent contests in Michigan
and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this is rolling along it's just beyond endorsements,''
Dal Col said in an interview. ``You've got McCain becoming the
anti-Clinton and it's just rolling.'' He said Forbes could not
compete because the race has turned not on issues but personality _
not Forbes' strong point.
</P>
<P>
   Polls of voters in the early contests show that Forbes' voters
look like Bush's on the issues. They are quite conservative, and
generally favor making all abortions illegal and repealing the tax
code. But those surveys also show that the Republican electorate
has voted this year more on character than ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it stays character and bio, he's gone,'' Dal Col said of
Bush. ``John will blow him away. If McCain wins South Carolina,
don't you think he'll just blow him away in Michigan?''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief strategist, voiced confidence that his
candidate would prevail, but conceded in an interview that the
battle had turned unexpectedly combative. Mindful of the fact that
the primary is less than two weeks away, Rove said the governor
would pound away at his newly honed message as a reformer. ``We've
got to be conscientious because we've got 10 days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' withdrawal was so abrupt that his commercials were still
running on television here Wednesday. But his departure, and that
of Gary Bauer last week, leaves only one Republican whose central
theme is social issues: Alan Keyes. But Keyes, a former State
Department official who registers only single digits in the polls,
is not considered a serious competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Paul M. Weyrich, one of Forbes' most prominent conservative
backers, lamented the lack of choices left. ``It is regrettable
that the candidates who have raised important issues have not done
well,'' he said. ``It is indeed a commentary on the culture of our
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., who backed Forbes, said he and other
social conservatives feel they have no where to go because they do
not consider McCain or Bush ``strong, consistent, committed
conservatives _ there's no one that excites them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the sentiment at a retreat of House Republicans in
Pennsylvania over the weekend, Barr said, ``There was palpable
worry on the part of several members who were there who had been
supporters of Bush but were seriously worried about his ability to
sustain the nomination. The primary in South Carolina will be the
key.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to slow McCain's gains _ and make clear that their own
operation was not unraveling _ the Bush campaign aggressively
promoted the governor's first place finish in the Delaware primary
as a huge triumph. Rove even cited Bush's victory in the caucuses
in Alaska on Jan. 24, which campaign officials had barely mentioned
in the past. ``Bush has won three and lost one,'' he said. ``You
should be asking the McCain campaign if it could sustain a fourth
loss out of five.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's 2-to-1 win over McCain in Delaware was quickly
eclipsed by Forbes' decision to quit _ and by the fact that McCain
placed second there even without campaigning in the state. By
contrast the Bush campaign had been running advertisements in
Delaware for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Bush campaign's drive to make amends with Forbes,
Jack Kemp, the former Housing Secretary who has endorsed Bush,
lauded Forbes on Wednesday. He said Forbes, an old friend, ``would
make a great secretary of treasury _ or trade rep.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush camp had struggled to not appear panicked, McCain
has appeared so confident about his prospects that on his campaign
bus on Tuesday he entertained questions from reporters about
whether he would include a Democrat in his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   At first he seemed inclined to; then he backed off the idea.

FBI'S BOSTON CHIEF MAY BE HEADED FOR NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After commanding the FBI's Boston office through three
punishing years of scandal over its tight ties to gangsters like
James ``Whitey'' Bulger, Barry W. Mawn may be rewarded for his
grace under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn's name is on a short list to be named an assistant director
of the FBI, heading its New York office, sources confirmed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Mawn, 54, declined to comment on the
possibility that he might replace the retiring Lewis D. Schiliro in
New York, the FBI's largest field office and the only one headed by
an assistant director. Schiliro's predecessor, James Kallstrom, a
native of Worcester, became a household name during the TWA Flight
800 crash investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of returning home in December 1996 to take over as
special-agent-in-charge of the Boston FBI office, Mawn was
weathering an onslaught of controversy, much of it rooted in the
free-wheeling decades of the 1970s and 1980s when the office's
focus was on destroying the New England Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   The mild-mannered, well-liked Mawn was forced to decry the
abuses of the past _ from agents taking bribes and sipping wine
with gangster informants like Bulger, to allegedly protecting them
from prosecution _ while defending the present day office and the
250 agents under him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mawn and US Attorney Donald K. Stern who asked for an
independent team of investigators and prosecutors to probe possible
wrongdoing by law enforcement officers after an initial, internal
probe cleared them.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Mawn who was forced to douse speculation again and
again that his agents were not really interested in finding Bulger
_ a fugitive since January 1995 _ because they feared what he might
say if caught.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger's handler, retired FBI Agent John Connolly, was indicted
in December for obstruction of justice and racketeering _ for
allegedly tipping off Bulger to his impending indictment.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Director Louis Freeh, who would undoubtedly play a major
role in selecting the next New York office chief, learned firsthand
last year what it's been like for Mawn when Freeh faced reporters
and was peppered with questions about why Bulger wasn't on the
FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. A short time later, Bulger made the
list.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch defender of his agents, Mawn lashed out in a letter to
the editor of The Boston Globe in December, protesting a cartoon
that maligned the bureau. In the letter, Mawn cited the dangerous
work in rough seas his agents had been performing to recover the
wreckage of EgyptAir 990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Globe consistently highlights the FBI in alleged or
perceived misconduct matters, yet hardly ever mentions the FBI in
our daily accomplishments in white-collar crime, organized crime,
terrorism and violent crime,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mawn, a Woburn native, headed the Newark and Knoxville FBI
offices before Boston. He headed an antiterrorism task force in New
York in the early 1980s, according to a spokeswoman.

HIGH COURT BARS USE OF EMBRYOS FATHERED BY EX-HUSBAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Changes day of ruling to Tuesday.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a one-page order that gives no indication of its
reasoning, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that
a 44-year-old woman cannot ignore her former husband's objections
and use frozen embryos created during their failed marriage to try
and have more children.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the state's highest court Tuesday immediately
becomes the leading case in an arena where advances in reproductive
technology have far outpaced legal concepts of family and
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big deal,'' said Boston University medical ethicist
George Annas. ``This could be a very important opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The court issued the brief order, minus its usual written
opinion, because the woman needed to know before she turns 45 in
June, the deadline for having the embryos implanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is profoundly disappointed,'' said her attorney, Gretchen
Van Ness, adding that the woman's hope of conceiving more children
is forever ended.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who was not identified in court papers, has
7-year-old twin daughters conceived with the consent of the father
during their marriage. Van Ness said she does not yet know what
will happen to the embryos, which are stored in a Boston-area
fertility clinic vault.
</P>
<P>
   Her former husband had opposed the woman's plan in Suffolk
Probate Court, but was not part of the case before the SJC. His
last attorney, Paula H. Noe, said she is no longer in contact with
him, but predicted, ``I bet this guy is going to be celebrating
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe said the man, after a bitter divorce, did not want to father
any more children with his former wife and did not want to face the
financial, legal and moral responsibilities that would fall on him
if the frozen embryos were successfully implanted in the woman.
</P>
<P>
   According to attorneys and Annas, the decision in the case known
as AZ vs. BZ is only the third time a top state appellate court had
wrestled with the complex legal and moral issues growing out of
assisted reproductive techniques.
</P>
<P>
   However, until the SJC issues its written opinion _ and any
dissenting views _ it is unclear how far-reaching the ruling will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, because there is so little law on the subject, any ruling
will be closely followed by other state courts, lawyers and
specialists predict.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of a written opinion, Annas said it is clear
that the SJC has embraced the idea that both prospective parents
must have a voice in the use of frozen embryos. Technically, the
SJC affirmed Probate Court Judge Anthony R. Nesi's ruling in favor
of the former husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``No court has said you can use embryos to make a baby without
the concurrent consent and agreement of the would-be parents,''
Annas said. He added that until the embryo is implanted in the
woman, both mother and father have equal legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Susan L. Crockin, a lawyer who represents fertility clinics and
couples who use them, said assisted reproduction has achieved
stunning technical successes. But until courts and legislatures
catch up, people who use clinics and those that operate them face
an uncertain legal future.
</P>
<P>
   Crockin said Wednesday was the first time a top state appellate
court had confronted the question of what to do when a potential
mother tries to enforce an agreement that gave her control of
embryos if the marriage ended. By contrast, top courts in Tennessee
and New York have only addressed cases where divorced couples had
agreed to destroy or donate embryos if their marriage ended and the
woman later sued to gain custody of the embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology should be helping create families, not
lawsuits,'' Crockin said, adding that ``it would be in everybody's
interests'' if the courts or lawmakers start defining the rights
and responsibilities of participants in such nontraditional
conceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Nesi ruled in 1996 that the former husband was not bound by
agreements he signed during the years the couple spent trying to
get pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Nesi said that circumstances had changed so dramatically _ the
divorce, the birth of twins, the possibility that the woman could
have more children with another partner or adopt _ that the former
husband should not be forced into fatherhood against his will.
</P>
<P>
   Van Ness said she and her client will review the opinion once it
is released and may seek further review before the US Supreme Court
if it appears the outcome may help other women in the future.

 &HT;    Georgia manufacturer to make socks for Stanley
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's largest sock maker has gotten a foot in the
door with tool giant Stanley Works.
</P>
<P>
   Chipman-Union Inc. has landed a three-year licensing agreement
to develop, make and distribute a line of Stanley work socks.
They're expected to hit retailers' shelves in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Chipman-Union, based just outside Dalton in Union Point, Ga.,
did not disclose financial terms but said that the deal was a
significant addition to its licensing business. The company also
makes socks branded as Adidas, Odor-Eaters, Florsheim and Stride
Rite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our branding strategy is to find brands that uniquely serve
consumer needs,'' said Alan Brumbaugh, president and chief
executive of Chipman-Union. ``Stanley is a great name as far as a
work product, and that allows us to sell a high-grade work sock to
the contractor market.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's and women's socks will be targeted at mass
merchandisers such as Target, Brumbaugh said. Chipman-Union also is
approaching Atlanta-based Home Depot, Lowe's Cos. and hardware
retailers, too.
</P>
<P>
   The socks are part of a new branding initiative for Stanley, the
largest U.S. maker of hand tools. The New Britain, Conn.-based
company has been putting its name on apparel and accessories such
as tool bags, gloves and hunting knives.
</P>
<P>
   Union-Chipman, which has annual sales of about $100 million, has
a foothold in a growing niche. The sock sector is a rare bright
spot in the general pallor of the U.S. textile industry. Consumers
are spending more on casual wear, and that has spurred the sales of
socks. Plus, a wave of new specialty products for essentially every
type of sport has hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   New technology allows manufacturers to make socks faster with
less labor. Union-Chipman is stepping up production by 50 percent
to keep up with demand. A new knitting plant in Greensboro, N.C.,
can crank out 840,000 pairs of socks a week. That's on top of about
1.7 million pairs a week at plants in Union Point and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The socks themselves are getting high-tech, too. Union-Chipman
just unveiled a sock for Adidas with ``ripple technology'' that's
designed to prevent blisters.
</P>
<P>
   The company also recently struck a deal with Sports Illustrated
for Kids to make socks for the magazine's new product promotions.
The Sports Illustrated line will start selling at Wal-Mart this
summer, Brumbaugh said.

 McCAIN CAMPAIGN RECEIVING HELP FROM DOZENS OF LOBBYISTS  
(See also McCAIN-DEMS) 
(sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Sen. John McCain appears, via satellite from
Charleston, S.C., at a $500-a-person fund-raiser here on Thursday
night, he will probably repeat his vow to ``break the Washington
iron triangle of big money, lobbyists and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a message that should fall flat inside the ballroom at the
Willard Hotel, just a few blocks from K Street, the capital's
influence-peddling corridor. The event is expected to raise
$250,000, and was organized by a 46-member ``Victory Committee''
made up of 33 lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those lobbyists say they are giving for the traditional
reason _ access to a powerful senator who just might become
president. But several other lobbyists insisted this week that they
support McCain, R-Ariz., not because they are attempting to curry
favor with him as the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee,
but because they agree with him that the capital's culture of money
and power needs to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is totally broken,'' said Karen Watson, a lobbyist
for the satellite company, Echostar, which began lobbying in
Washington four years ago. ``We came into the system and saw how
totally beholden it is to the entrenched, moneyed interests of the
old guard. You can't be a scrappy competitor like Echostar and not
come out in support of Senator McCain's message of reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his stunning, 19-point victory over Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas in New Hampshire last week, McCain has been attacked by Bush
as a hypocrite for talking about the need to eliminate the
influence of special interests' money at the same time that his
campaign is ``crawling with lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most recent campaign reports show that Bush has received
nearly five times as much money from lobbyists as has McCain,
$526,603 to $116,675. Vice President Al Gore has received $592,603
from lobbyists, the most among the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are dozens of powerful lobbyists who are assisting
McCain's campaign by helping him raise money or offering political
and policy advice. Some are doing it while they continue to
represent an array of clients with interests before McCain's
Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign manager is Richard H. Davis, a partner in the
Alexandria, Va., lobbying firm, Davis, Manafort &AMP; Freedman. Davis
has taken a leave of absence from the firm to lead the McCain
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Manafort &AMP; Freedman is one of the most ubiquitous lobbying
firms, with a client list that has ranged from GTech, the nation's
largest supplier of services and systems to state lotteries, to the
Republic of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Manafort &AMP; Freedman was hired by the Nigerians in March
1998, at a time when the country's dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, was
engaged in an aggressive public relations and lobbying campaign to
persuade Americans that he was the leader of a progressive emerging
democracy. Human rights groups had portrayed Abacha as a ruthless
and corrupt dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' firm has continued to represent Nigeria, which now has a
democratically elected leader.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, a press secretary for the McCain campaign, said
on Wednesday night that Davis did not actually work on the Nigeria
account, that it was handled by a partner, Paul Manafort.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Davis, who was the chief White House liaison to the
Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Reagan
administration, was drawn into a controversy about political favors
at the housing department. Questioned by a congressional committee,
Davis denied directing the department to provide assistance to
housing projects linked to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as McCain weighed a White House bid, he reached
out for advice from Kenneth M. Duberstein, a former White House
chief of staff in the Reagan administration, and former Rep. Vin
Weber of Minnesota. Both continue to play important advisory roles
in McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying firm where Weber is a partner represents a list of
blue-chip clients, from the Boeing Co. to Microsoft. Many of the
companies are involved in issues before McCain's Commerce
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein's roster of clients, in the publishing,
transportation and telecommunications industries, is nearly as
impressive. But in an interview, Duberstein said that he supported
McCain, whom he called a friend for more than 20 years, because he
believed firmly in the candidate's message of changes in the
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think too many people are too comfortable with the status
quo and they want to keep a system that no longer works,''
Duberstein said. ``Virtually everyone detests going to
fund-raisers, virtually everyone detests raising all this money.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, records show, the Duberstein Group has opposed
positions taken by McCain. For instance, the firm represents the
Transportation Institute, which promotes American shipping
interests and opposes efforts by McCain to open up domestic ports
to foreign-flagged cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Buse, the staff director for the Commerce Committee, said
that lobbyists do indeed donate money to McCain with the
expectation that the contributions will help their clients. He
knows, he said, because he hears it, often, from the lobbyists
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pick up the phone and they say, `Look, I've helped your
boss a lot in this race or I was just at some fund-raiser,''' Buse
said. ``And literally we have said: `I don't want to hear that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Buse said that lobbyists had become angry over such responses,
but that the message was finally getting through. ``We take their
money, but they know that they are not getting anything from John
McCain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democratic staff members of the Commerce Committee say they
agree that McCain does not appear to be influenced by political
contributors and that they believe his commitment to campaign
finance reform is genuine.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who raises money for McCain is necessarily
interested in fomenting change in the fund-raising system. Another
motive is the need to remain close to a powerful committee
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, McCain has reaped a considerable amount of
contributions and fund raising help from lobbyists for the regional
telephone companies. He has proposed legislation to open the $80
billion long-distance market to the regional companies at the
expense of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the regionals, US West in Denver, was the leading
contributor to McCain's House, Senate and presidential campaigns
from 1981 through last June, according to data compiled by the
Center for Political Integrity, a watchdog group in Washington.
Lobbyists for two other regional telephone companies, Ameritech and
BellSouth, are on the Victory Committee for Thursday night's
fund-raising party.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the fund-raising committee, however, are lobbyists who
represent AT&AMP;T and the company ranks as the largest contributor to
both political parties and as McCain's third-largest giver over his
poltical career.
</P>
<P>
   And he is getting fund-raising assistance from lobbyists who are
quite pleased with McCain's position that the current moratorium on
Internet taxation should be made permanent. George Vradenburg of
America Online, Rhett Dawson of the Information Technology Industry
Council and Kent Knutson of Microsoft are assisting McCain's
campaign.

2 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE SLAIN IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The captain of a high school football team and his
girlfriend were shot to death late Tuesday as they unloaded
groceries in front of the girl's house in a quiet residential
section of Northeast Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of the two youths _ Andre Wallace and Natasha Marsh,
both 17 _ led Wednesday to additional counselors and extra security
measures, including searches, at Woodrow Wilson High, in an
affluent area of Northwest Washington, where the two were seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were looking into the possibility that
the shooting was linked to a fight, which students said involved
Wallace, at a basketball game where he was a spectator on Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was a teaching assistant at a local elementary school, a
member of Woodrow Wilson's jazz and marching bands, and a star
defensive back on the football team as well as its captain. Marsh
was in good academic standing, officials said, and participated in
several extracurricular activities, including a special program in
business and finance.

NORTHRIDGE TAKES POSITIVE STEP
</HEADLINE>
 PACKAGE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After years of financial instability,
disorganization and scandal, Cal State Northridge athletics has
some good news.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   The move to the Big West Conference gives the athletic
department a chance to balance its budget, to play regularly
against teams from the Los Angeles area, and most importantly,
gives the Matadors an identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my vantage point, certainly I think it is a decision in
the right direction,'' CSUN Athletic Director Dick Dull said. ``I'm
convinced it is the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Dull, there are three great advantages in getting
out of the Big Sky and into the Big West.
</P>
<P>
   First, the department can define itself with an emphasis on
sports (baseball, softball and women's volleyball are examples)
that intently by Southern Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Second, by joining a conference in which almost every member
school is part of the state's public education system, Northridge
can be part of the greater good. An athletic director at Big West
member Long Beach State is more sympathetic to CSUN's strengths and
weaknesses than an AD in Montana _ especially when it comes to
compliance with the Cal-NOW agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Third, travel time is slashed. On a recent trip for games at
Sacramento State and Weber State, the men's basketball players
missed three days of classes. They'll miss half that much when they
can travel by bus to Irvine and Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, doing some bus travel is cheaper than flying
airplanes to Idaho and Montana,'' Dull said. ``But we're not doing
it because of the financial considerations. Student-athletes belong
in class as much as they can, and playing in a California
conference, it will ... definitely eliminate some missed class
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletes are the greatest benefactors of this move, and they
should be.
</P>
<P>
   The women's volleyball team can now promise a top-notch Orange
County recruit she will play in front of family and friends. The
same can be said for men's and women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows how many players Northridge has lost in the last five
years because 17-year-olds from the Southland have no desire to
play in Bozeman, Montana, or Pocatello, Idaho? The connection to
Los Angeles is important for Northridge, which has become
increasingly isolated among L.A.-area college sports fans because
of the conference in which it plays.
</P>
<P>
   The program this move especially benefits is men's basketball.
The men's team, in the midst of its best Division I season, won't
play on national TV this season _ unless it makes the Big Sky
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   However, teams from the Big West, including sub-.500 programs
like UC Santa Barbara and Cal State Fullerton, regularly play on
ESPN's ``Big Monday'' and additional regional telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   More exposure for the men's _ and women's _ basketball teams
means more excitement, which makes it easier to draw larger crowds.
Eventually, Dull would like to see Northridge build a basketball
arena. He's also like to see students lining up at the ticket
office hours before a big game.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just in basketball, though, from which regional
rivalries will grow. More than 2,000 people showed up for the
Matadors' men's soccer game against UCLA last fall, and that's
almost as much as the football team drew playing against the likes
of Idaho State and Weber State.
</P>
<P>
   When Dull was hired last spring, this was one of his major
tasks, to steer Northridge out of the Big Sky and into the Big
West. He did that; Dull met Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell
several times and stayed in contact with the presidents of the Big
West schools.
</P>
<P>
   Dull was an excellent lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   So were several people behind the scenes, most notably Grace
Collins, an assistant athletic director in charge of the
department's finances, and Louanne Kennedy, the school's interim
president who forced the issue when she took over last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing that the Big West Conference will allow
us to do,'' Dull said, ``is that from an institutional standpont,
we'll have the opportunity to define our program and not have the
conference do it for us.''

   BILL-JONES-DANCE (Undated) _ In July 1998, the dancer and
choreographer Bill T. Jones began to think about making an
evening-long work for himself. He was 46 at the time and in 25
years of performing in the company he and Arnie Zane started, he
had never done a solo of this magnitude. He called the piece ``The
Breathing Show,'' and, with Janet Wong, his rehearsal director, he
began to select the music and experiment with movement. The dance,
which can be seen this week in New Jersey, had its premiere in Iowa
City last October, but Jones still considered it a work in
progress. He continued to refine the elements of the piece, which
incorporated singing, talking, film and, of course, dancing. By

   BOILER-ROOM-FILM (Undated) _ In the '80s, presented with merger
mania and junk- bond madness, Hollywood produced movies like the
polished ``Wall Street'' and the glossy ``Working Girl,'' films
about the nexus of big money and big morality. Now the current
Money Moment, this dot-com expansion, or bubble, or souffle, or
whatever it turns out to be, has its first opus: ``Boiler Room.''
It's the story of Seth, a young man played by Giovanni Ribisi, who,
in a misguided effort to placate his demanding father, takes a job
as a broker trainee at a hip-deep-in-fraud Long Island securities
firm _ the overheated, testosterone-driven, 100-phone-line, folding
table, boiler room operation of the title. By Jamie Malanowski.

   WONDER-BOYS-FILM (Los Angeles) _ They always want you to do what
they've seen you do before,'' says Curtis Hanson, who last directed
(and co-wrote) that extravagant blend of slam-bang police saga and
character study, ``L.A. Confidential.'' In his new film, ``Wonder
Boys'' (opening Friday), Hanson has outwitted Hollywood's powers
that be. With the help of his star, Michael Douglas (``the motor of
this movie''), he has taken Michael Chabon's ebullient novel, set
in and around an English department at a Pittsburgh college, and
come up with a different kind of movie. It's a pothead picaresque,
a contemporary screwball comedy-drama with a mellow emotional tang.

   KADOSH-FILM (New York) _ In the bedroom of an ultra-Orthodox
couple in Jerusalem, a man rises, takes three steps, washes his
hands, and recites the morning prayer, thanking God for preserving
his soul all night, and for not having created him a woman.
``Kadosh,'' the new film by the Israeli director Amos Gitai, 49,
which opens on Wednesday at the Film Forum, begins with this
intimate view of the rituals Orthodox Jewish men perform each day.

   BACH-PRELUDES (Undated) _ The Well-Tempered Clavier'' appeared
in two installments during the first half of the 18th century. The
style and content look back in time, as Bach often did, but there
is something futuristic about how these pieces are used. Musical
progress, like any other kind of progress, goes in circles, and in
the year 2000 we seem to be overtaking the 18th-century world that
the 19th century left in its rear-view mirror. These 48 preludes
and fugues in all the major and minor keys have little to do with
public virtuosos, stages or audiences. Like a lot of Bach's work _
especially the music written, or at least assembled, toward the end
of his life _ the ``Well-Tempered'' makes statements, advances
theories, pulls together bodies of knowledge. By Bernard Holland.

it. Yet for more than 10 years he has been part of a small team of
scholars doing important research into the songs of Gustav Mahler.

aged more shockingly than Joni Mitchell's. The craggy alto on
``Both Sides Now,'' her intermittently magnificent new album of
standards (including two of her best-loved original songs), is so
changed from the sweetly yodeling folk soprano of her earliest
albums that it hardly seems possible the two sounds could have come
from the same body. In refusing to fight or try to camouflage the
ravages of time, Mitchell belongs to an interpretive school that
includes Billie Holiday and Frank Sinatra, whose vocal
deterioration brought them greater emotional depth and realism. By

   JAZZ-IMAGE (Undated) _ Most big-picture conversations about jazz
these days come down to the same question: how can it become
important again? The answer has to be more than
once-every-five-years phenomena like Cassandra Wilson or Diana
Krall. Jazz needs what rock has had since the '80s, an organized
proliferation of termitelike hipster activity wherever there are
young people playing and listening. There needs to be better music
education. There need to be more clubs booking jazz where people
under 25 feel welcome. And there needs to be a thriving
independent-label record business, one that plots the daily graph
of where jazz musicians are heading. By Ben Ratliff. (Moved). &QL;

exhibitions in London and Paris. The titles of the shows are
already revelatory. ``The Story of Time,'' which runs through Sept.
24 at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich in east London, is
an almost didactic review of how time has been measured and
interpreted by different cultures through the ages. In contrast,
``Le Temps, Vite,'' or ``Time, Quickly,'' at the Georges Pompidou

Musem in Manhattan since 1997, shows us that the term crafts

INVESTMENT GROUP MAKES BID FOR BEN &AMP; JERRY'S

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade Inc. received a buyout offer last week
from a group that calls itself a ``socially responsible''
alternative to the giant multinational companies seeking to acquire
the quirky ice cream company.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look shows that the group, led by Meadowbrook Lane
Capital, includes a venture-capital firm, Chartwell Investments,
which previously had submitted its own proposal to take control of
Ben &AMP; Jerry's. And a list of investors submitted by the group
includes the Hain Food Group, which is 20 percent owned by the H.J.
Heinz Co., the packaged food company best known for its ketchup. A
Hain's executive said Wednesday that his company's name should not
have been listed, and it was not interested in acquiring Ben &AMP;
Jerry's, which is based in Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The list, which includes a few well-known individuals _ like
Anita Roddick, president of the Body Shop International, a natural
skin-care and cosmetics chain _ does not say how much financing
each person or group would supply for the proposed takeover.
</P>
<P>
   But the Meadowbrook group was described in a front-page article
in The Wall Street Journal on Friday as a ``white knight'' that
would preserve Ben &AMP; Jerry's commitment to its social mission and
other unusual company policies, like making many of its products in
Vermont. The article said Ben Cohen, one of the company's founders,
was delighted that an investor group was trying to find a way to
keep the company independent.
</P>
<P>
   According to a copy of a letter dated Feb. 4 on Meadowbrook Lane
Capital letterhead that was supplied to The New York Times, the
group is offering $32 a share, or $268 million, for Ben &AMP; Jerry's,
which would also get a new board and a new chief executive and
become a private company.
</P>
<P>
   A group of socially conscious investors could have great appeal.
Over the last two months, nonprofit groups, franchise owners and
others have vocally opposed a takeover of Ben &AMP; Jerry's, saying a
new corporate parent would not have the same commitment to social
causes, like helping the homeless and saving the rain forest, which
Ben &AMP; Jerry's has displayed. After the ice cream company announced
on Dec. 2 that it had received an offer and that the board would
consider it, one person started a Web site urging people to fight
any deal by buying the company's shares, which could be used to
vote against a sale. Vermont politicians also have insisted that
Ben &AMP; Jerry's should remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, a day after rallies were held around the country by
many owners of Ben &AMP; Jerry's ice-cream stores to protest a
takeover, the company received a proposal from Chartwell
Investments that would have dissolved the board of directors and
replaced it with one controlled by Chartwell executives, in
exchange for a $30 million to $50 million investment. A Chartwell
executive said the group usually invests in basic industry. In its
proposal, it cites investments in truck stops and airport parking
lots among past successes.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Feb. 4, Ben &AMP; Jerry's received the proposal from
Meadowbrook, for $32 a share for all 8.36 million shares. That
offer tops the $31-a-share stock swap proposed by Dreyer's Grand
Ice Cream Inc., the Oakland, Calif.-based ice cream maker, on Feb.
2, according to documents provided to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever PLC also has offered to buy Ben &AMP; Jerry's, at a price
that one person familiar with the company said was $40 a share. A
spokesman for Unilever, which owns the Breyer's ice-cream brand,
refused to comment, as did spokesmen for Dreyer's and for Chartwell
Investments.
</P>
<P>
   In its offer, Dreyer's proposed operating ``as two autonomous
companies managed completely independently but with common
ownership.'' The advantages include sharing costs on distribution,
which has been a continuing problem at Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben &AMP; Jerry's has made two big mistakes over the course of its
history,'' said Jeffrey G. Kanter, an analyst with Prudential
Securities. ``It doesn't have its own distribution capability, and
the second mistake was severing its relationship with Dreyer's.''
That allowed Dreyer's to compete against Ben &AMP; Jerry's with brands
like Godiva, Starbucks and Edy's Dreamery, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Meadowbrook proposal would take Ben &AMP; Jerry's private,
replacing the current board with one composed of ``leaders of the
socially responsible investment community as well as from the food
and financial industries.'' A separate board of advisers would
focus on making Ben &AMP; Jerry's ``the most active socially
responsible company'' in the country. Meadowbrook says it would
continue financing the Ben &AMP; Jerry's foundation and set up a
venture capital fund to foster other companies with similar values.
Meadowbrook also aims to broaden the business by putting the Ben &AMP;
Jerry's name on additional products through licensing, acquisitions
and other arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   A senior executive at Hain denied that the company was part of
the investor group. ``We as a company are always looking at
acquisitions that fit with our mission, which is natural and
organic,'' said Gary M. Jacobs, Hain's chief financial officer.
``They talked to us, but they should not be using our name. We did
not authorize them to use our name. We are not part of any proposal
or anything with regard to Ben &AMP; Jerry's.''
</P>
<P>
   The investor list notes that all the parties have signed a
nondisclosure agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me individually, what is attractive about the possibility
of being involved with investing in Ben &AMP; Jerry's is that it is one
of the premier values-based companies in the U.S.,'' said Bob
Barton, chief executive of Catalyst Financial Group, who is among
the investors on the list. ``At the same time, it has the
possibility to grow its stock and increase the earnings for its
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Ben &AMP; Jerry's did not return calls seeking
comment Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When word spread in December that Ben &AMP; Jerry's was mulling a
takeover offer from an unidentified suitor, one analyst joked that
the company should come out with a new flavor, Capitulation Crunch,
to reflect the latest development in the company's saga. Ben &AMP;
Jerry's share price fell $1.128, to $25.50 each, in Nasdaq trading
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock price has mostly languished for the last
seven years. It went public in 1986, topped out at $30.50 a share
in 1992, and slid as low as $12 in 1997. That year, Ben &AMP; Jerry's
said it would hire a new chief executive officer and conducted a
much-publicized, nationwide search before settling on Robert
Holland, a McKinsey Co. consultant. After less than two years, he
was replaced by Perry D. Odak, the current chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Odak, whose compensation includes thousands of Ben &AMP; Jerry's
stock options, revised many aspects of the company in his first 18
months on the job. He redesigned the containers, pushing the
portraits of Ben and Jerry off the lid and onto the back, and
introduced an unbleached-paper container that was thought to be
more environmentally friendly. He also discontinued some products,
like the Peace Pop, that were thought to have outworn their
welcome, and introduced new flavors like Dilbert's World Totally
Nuts, licensing the comic-strip character Dilbert.

CLINTON PURSUING MILLIONS TO PUSH EARLY `ISSUE ADS'

 By JOHN M. BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, still the Democratic Party's
marquee attraction and chief fund-raiser, is soliciting millions of
dollars in soft money donations to pay for an aggressive,
party-financed advertising campaign that will begin immediately
after the Democratic presidential nominee emerges from the primary
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements being planned are similar to the
controversial and much criticized ``issue ads'' in the 1996
election that were financed with $46 million in Democratic National
Committee soft money, the large unrestricted donations from
corporations, unions and individuals that political parties are
allowed to collect for so-called party-building efforts. The issue
ads were thinly veiled Clinton-Gore spots that critics said
violated a federal law prohibiting party-financed advertisements
that advocate election of a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission considered a complaint
challenging the legality of the ads, but took no action. The early
use of issue ads were considered instrumental in establishing an
early lead for the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The president's central fund-raising role is part of a
Democratic plan formulated over the last year to try to counter
Republican financial advantages. Democrats are confident that their
agenda is more appealing than the Republicans' and want to make
sure they have the money to advertise it on the airwaves as soon as
the compressed primary season ends in March.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to appear at 35 to 40 Democratic National
Committee fund-raising events in the first three months of this
year that are expected to raise $20 million. Clinton, who is in
Texas for three fund-raising events Wednesday, has kept up a steady
schedule of big-money appearances to underwrite an early spring
advertising campaign and other party efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan is based on the assumption that the two
Democratic presidential candidates _ Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley _ will exhaust all of their resources in
the flurry of primaries in early March. Democratic officials expect
Gore to be their nominee and assume that Bush will survive to win
the Republican nomination, despite the unexpectedly strong
challenge from Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic committee is concerned that Gore will be broke
while Bush will have millions of dollars left in the bank to get a
jump on general election campaigning this spring. By underwriting
party advertisements with soft money, the Democratic Party could
help keep Gore's campaign message on the air.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What the president and I tell donors,'' said Edward G.
Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic Party, ``is that we
need the money to be competitive in the period from April 1 to Aug.
15.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that the party expected to match its
effort of 1996, when Clinton began an early series of television
advertisements that helped bury the Republican nominee, Bob Dole,
long before the fall campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential election cycle, the Democrats spent
$46.5 million on early issue ads that prominently featured
President Clinton and hope to nearly match that sum this year. The
Republican National Committee also ran issue ads on behalf of Dole,
though the Republicans spent only about $18 million and their ads
began much later.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Backus, the Democratic committee's press secretary,
said that the money that the party was raising this winter will be
used for a variety of activities. The party is building an
extensive computerized database of voters, establishing a presence
on the Internet and planning broad grass-roots efforts in the 15
states the party considers presidential toss-ups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to use all of the weapons in the arsenal,''
Backus said. ``This is not money exclusively going toward issue
ads. It is going toward Democrats winning in 2000 and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said it would be impossible for the Democrats to ``match
the Republicans dollar for dollar; we can't.'' Rendell added, ``But
we cannot be off the air, we cannot be without a presence, we
cannot be without a response in those critical months.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials are delighted that Bush has found himself
in a scrap with McCain and believe he will come to regret his heavy
spending on early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush spent $37 million last year and came in second
in New Hampshire,'' Rendell said in a telephone interview from
McAllen, Texas, where Clinton held two fund-raisers Wednesday.
``It's clear proof that the people with the most money don't
necessarily win.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats each complained to the Federal
Election Commission in 1996 that the other party had violated the
law on using soft money to pay for candidate advocacy advertising.
But the commission ruled that the law was ambiguous and declined to
take action against either party. The Justice Department, after
months of study, said it found no grounds to appoint an independent
counsel to investigate the fund raising or spending practices of
the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same consultants who designed the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign ads also created the party issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, Clinton will be the Democratic Party's strongest
money magnet. In 1998, he raised $19 million for the party; last
year he harvested $22 million, despite the impeachment trial and
the 10-week war in the Balkans, which forced the cancellation of a
number of fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been aided until recently in his fund-raising
efforts by the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Gore. But
with both of them fully engaged in raising money for their own
campaigns, Clinton has had to step up the pace of his party
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, one Democratic fund-raiser who insisted on
anonymity said, Clinton struggled to raise the kind of sums that
the party had come to expect from him. Indeed, the president was
asked to do several extra fund-raisers just to keep pace with the
party's goals, this fund-raiser said.
</P>
<P>
   But late in January, after Vice President Al Gore's victory in
the Iowa caucuses, the haul from Clinton's fund-raising appearances
returned to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, it looked pretty desperate,'' the
fund-raiser said. ``As Gore has done better, we're getting some of
that old momentum back.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides say that Clinton does not consider fund raising a chore,
but rather his obligation as leader of the Democratic Party. And
the fact that he is not now running for office _ for the first time
in 24 years _ has clearly had a liberating effect on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a good time,'' he said Tuesday night at a big-donor
affair at the Hay Adams Hotel near the White House. ``I feel like
the cat that ate the canary some days.''

Fein political representatives sit in government leaves it no
choice but to suspend the new Ulster administration Friday and
reimpose direct rule from London.

   FRANCE: SCIENTOLOGISTS FIGHT BACK
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Scientology says it will try to enlist other
groups in its fight against a parliamentary commission that has
suggested it should be banned. The church says it will hold a
public hearing in March and invite 172 churches and groups it says
have been attacked by the commission ``to tell us how the climate
of religious persecution has affected them.'' The commission said
Scientology was among a group of cults that reject democratic norms
and should be outlawed.

   FRANCE: LE PEN LOSES OFFICE
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the far-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen,
has been told he will be stripped of his two elective offices
because of a court decision banning him from public office for a
year. Le Pen has 15 days to object before the cabinet makes the
decision final. Le Pen, 71, who was found guilty of assaulting a
female Socialist official, said he would fight the ruling.

   Karina Yapor, a 17-year-old backup singer for Gloria Trevi, a
Mexican rock star, testified in Chihuahua state that Trevi's
manager, Sergio Andrade, had sired a son with her when she was 14
years old. The couple later abandoned the child. But Yapor denied
Andrade had raped her, testimony that lawyers said would probably
prevent his prosecution on felony sex charges. Mexico has requested
the extradition of Andrade and Trevi from Brazil.

   NIGERIA: 17 DIE IN OIL FIRE
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen people died in Ogwe, eastern Nigeria, when a fire
erupted in a pit where they had been siphoning fuel from a
pipeline. People routinely sabotage pipelines to sell fuel on the
black market in the Niger Delta, the oil-producing area that has
been kept in extreme poverty. In October 1998, 700 people
collecting spilling fuel died in an explosion in the town of Jesse.

   With the government threatening to crack down on political
violence, the opposition stepped up its attacks on President Robert
Mugabe and the proposed constitution scheduled to be put before
voters this weekend. The Movement for Democratic Change, which says
the new charter would give Mugabe too much power, accuses him of
inciting some of the political violence that has flared in recent

leaders is not acceptable. Several leaders of the Khmer Rouge,
whose rule in the 1970s left hundreds of thousands dead, are living
freely in Cambodia. Hun Sen, a former Khmer Rouge official himself,
wants to retain control of trials. The United Nations wants an
international panel.

THE WRITER'S GAME: DEADLY THREAT, RELUCTANT TOUGH-TALKING HERO

   ``The Lion's Game'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by Nelson DeMille &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fiction &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $26.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along with Clive Cussler, Nelson DeMille ranks just below Tom
Clancy on the prestige scale of authors who write technology-based
fiction about superguys saving the world from near-certain doom.
DeMille books hit bestseller lists the first week they're in
stores. ``The Lion's Game,'' which brings back tough-talking,
bullet-dodging John Corey, is typical DeMille: snappy dialogue,
PG-rated sex, rampant evil afoot and lots of dead bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Corey, somehow surviving DeMille's last shoot-'em-up, has moved
from the New York Police Department to a government anti-terrorist
task force. Predictably, he's not pleased to be assigned to the
Middle East bureau; he'd rather hunt Irish terrorists and enjoy
Dublin pub life.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Asad Khalil, a Libyan terrorist who asks for asylum and is
sent under guard to America aboard a transcontinental flight. It's
really a dastardly plot; en route, Khalil _ known in terrorist
circles as ``the Lion'' _ kills all 300 people on board. After the
plane lands in New York City (on autopilot, with all the attendant
technology thoroughly explained by DeMille), the Lion eludes Corey
and company to embark on a further killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   Corey pursues, pausing occasionally to romance Kate Mayfield,
his supposed task-force mentor, who finds herself attracted to a
guy with lots of scars and a well-earned reputation for talking
back to his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   It's all superficial fun, of course. Nobody could be shot as
much as Corey without dying, or insult his employers so much and
not get fired. DeMille isn't offering literary fiction. This is a
book a few hundred thousand people will buy and read to get their
minds off their troubles, not to learn any important life lessons.

   ``Life Is So Good'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   by George Dawson and Richard Glaubman &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Autobiography &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $23 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, a feature story in the Star-Telegram introduced
readers to 99-year-old George Dawson. A grandson of slaves, he went
to school for the first time in his life at 98 _ to learn to read.
</P>
<P>
   Now 101, Dallas' Dawson is a celebrity of sorts. That original
Star-Telegram story, published all over the country via the
national wire services, elicited a flood of responses. One was from
Richard Glaubman, an elementary-school teacher in Washington state,
who wanted to write Dawson's biography as an inspirational book for
children. After spending time with the elderly gentleman, though,
Glaubman decided they should collaborate instead on a full Dawson
autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   The result, ``Life Is So Good,'' suffers from a certain
unevenness. Glaubman works hard to present the story in Dawson's
own voice, which is best described as ungrammatical but seasoned
with common sense. Dawson's ruminations on everything from diet (he
eats what he feels like eating, but not too much of it) to money
(worrying about having enough of it spoils a good day) to getting
along with others (he doesn't judge, lest he be judged) are
occasionally mesmerizing, as are several early chapters about being
put to work at age 8 to help support his struggling farm family.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also annoying information gaps, perhaps fewer of
them for local readers. We can guess, for instance, that Dawson's
boyhood home of Marshall is the town in East Texas, but the state
is not identified until well into the book. Dawson's early life, up
to his first marriage and relocation to Dallas, are painstakingly
detailed, but the next seven decades of his existence, up to his
deciding in 1996 that it was ``his time'' to learn to read, are
skimmed over with a few paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   It is frankly shocking to read Dawson's plain-talk description
of how a young black man was lynched by a Marshall mob in 1908 when
he was wrongly accused of having sex with a white girl. It hurts to
share the 15-year-old's loneliness when he is hired out by his
father to work on a white man's farm, since the Dawson family
desperately needs extra income. And it's fun to go with the newly
mature George Dawson to New Orleans, where he lives and works
awhile and discovers the fun of listening to jazz and squiring the
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   But the message here is one of hopeful perseverance. The
Dawson/Glaubman team makes the point over and over that Dawson
never intentionally avoided school. As the oldest child in a large
family, it fell to him to work while younger siblings got the scant
education available to blacks in the early 1900s. Afterward, he was
a husband and father who had a family to support _ but who, for
years, fooled his own children into thinking he could read so they
would do their homework and, eventually, graduate from high school
and go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   Now George Dawson continues to work toward his GED, getting up
at 5 a.m. and walking six blocks to a neighborhood school. He still
lives by himself (having outlived several wives) and is mildly
offended by any suggestion he can't get around or think as well as
he once did.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest value of ``Life Is So Good'' is its
unspoken premise that heroes come in all ages and situations.
George Dawson deserves the attention he is getting, not just for
his own sake but as a reminder that no one is ever too old to set
new goals and accomplish them. He and Glaubman have written an
interesting, imperfect book. .MDRV/.MDNM/ (Visit the

FINE MOVE, BUT WHAT ABOUT NORTHRIDGE FOOTBALL?
</HEADLINE>
 BIG WEST PACKAGE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ (begin ital)We will play football until the end of
time.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   That was the promise Cal State Northridge interim-president
Louanne Kennedy made Wednesday upon CSUN accepting an invitation to
join the Big West Conference in 2001. By moving to the Big West,
CSUN severs ties with the Big Sky Conference, its home since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   From an athletic department standpoint, it's a great move for
Northridge. Across the board, its sports programs will flourish
against better competition and in a conference with more name
recognition then the Big Sky.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Valley fans know Long Beach State and UC Santa
Barbara. But Northern Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   The basketball team will benefit most. The increased exposure of
playing in a predominantly California conference will enhance
recruiting, boost attendance and possibly expand efforts to
construct a new on-campus arena. Look at Long Beach State, which
plays at the Pryamid, one of the finest on-campus facilities in the
country. It's not out of the question for the same thing to happen
at Northridge, given the recent move.
</P>
<P>
   Now baseball has a conference affiliation, and a secure, bright
future. Three years ago CSUN dropped baseball, along with four
other men's sports teams, to meet gender equity requirements and
provide funding for other teams that compete in the Big Sky.
Baseball ultimately rose from the dead, and has competed as an
independent the last three years. Now the Matadors are aligned with
top-notch programs like Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for other Northridge programs, such as softball
and women's basketball. The move to the Big West benefits everyone,
which is why Kennedy and athletic director Dick Dull were so
ecstatic when the conference voted to extend an invitation. Kennedy
couldn't fax the acceptance form in fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   One small problem.
</P>
<P>
   The move throws the future of the football program into
disarray. The Big West will discontinue football after next season,
leaving the Matadors with no conference affiliation. Next year,
CSUN will play as an associate member of the Big Sky. Beyond that,
no one really knows.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy wasn't being coy. She and Dull fully expect the football
program to live on. Both indicated Wednesday that CSUN is not
shfting the emphsasis away from football in favor of basketball,
even though the Big West fancies itself as a basketball conference
and that CSUN now must reduce its football scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really trying to do is provide revenues to all the
other programs in a relatively fair manner, as fair as we can be,''
Kennedy said. ``We have no intention of de-emphasizing football.''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But if football does stay on, some major questions need to
be addressed, such as:
</P>
<P>
   Where will the Matadors play?
</P>
<P>
   In what conference, and against whom?
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, and most importantly, why?
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that Dull and Kennedy are being diplomatic when
they say football figures just as prominently at CSUN as
basketball. But that's just rhetoric, empty words to facilitate
members of the program and its fans.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, football takes a major blow in this move. After the
2000 season, it has no conference affiliation, less money and
scholarships to work with, no set schedule and no specific plan.
</P>
<P>
   Other than it will play until the end of time.
</P>
<P>
   Competing as an independent seems the most likely strategy for
now. But that's a short-tem solution. It would be unfair and
unrealisitc to expect fans to get behind a team that plays for
little more then the temporary thrill of a Saturday afternoon
victory. No league championship, no real hope to land a postseason
berth?
</P>
<P>
   Where's the fun in that?
</P>
<P>
   One alternative, something Kennedy hinted at on Wednesday, was
the possibility that Northridge could join another conferecne for
football only. Not a bad idea, but what conference plays Division
I-AA fotball in the West? One, the Big Sky, and that's no longer an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy even discussed the possibility of forming a separate
football conference, and this makes some sense. After all, the Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo football team, a current Big West member,
faces the same uncertainty as CSUN after next season. Perhaps Cal
Poly and Northridge can convince Sacramento State (Big Sky) and UC
Davis (Division II) to join forces to create a new conference.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, football is in Kennedy and Dull's vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``We going to continue to play Division I-AA,'' Kennedy said.
``We think that with the kind of activity that's gone on this year
around conference affiliations that we're hoping that the
opportunity to affiliate with another (Division I-AA) conference
will be there at some point for us in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a thought: Why not forget about football altogether.
It's a drastic thought, to be sure. But now is as good a time as
any to concede that football will never be more then an
afterthought at Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The last five years have shown that to be true. Certainly, the
Matadors have achieved moderate success since joining the Big Sky,
but nothing special, and certainly nothing the community chose to
latch onto.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to the Big Sky was expected to be a boost for Northridge,
but nothing changed much. In that time money has been spent on
football at the expense of other programs, three coaches have left
or been fired, there was an NCAA probe, the stadium CSUN hoped to
build never materialized and fans did not come to games in large
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Current coach Jeff Kearin is a good man and a talented coach.
This is not a reflection on him. He will land a job elsewhere no
matter what happens. But maybe it's time for Northridge to pull the
plug on football once and for all, then use the extra money to
upgrade other teams.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday Cal State Northridge changed the course of its
future.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that future should not include football.

EUROPEAN OIL TALKS ARE DISPUTED; STOCKS THRIVE ANYWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Two of Europe's second-tier oil companies, ENI of Italy
and Repsol-YPF of Spain, are looking to dance, but seem unable to
agree on a flamenco or a tarantella.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of both companies accused each other Wednesday of
circulating reports that have appeared recently in Spanish and
Italian newspapers, and were repeated in The Wall Street Journal
and The Financial Times Wednesday, that ENI, Italy's largest oil
and gas group, was in talks to merge with Repsol-YPF, the largest
Spanish oil and gas company.
</P>
<P>
   The reports continued to drive up the share price of both parent
companies. Officially, ENI said it would not comment. In Madrid, a
spokesman for Repsol, Jose Maria Garcia-Perote, said that since
word of a possible merger first circulated, Repsol ``has denied any
type of agreement or alliance or merger with ENI.'' Similarly, in a
note to the Spanish stock market regulator, Repsol said ``there
does not exist any agreement for a merger or integration with ENI,
nor with any other petroleum company.''
</P>
<P>
   This does not preclude an alliance between the two companies or
an eventual merger. In recent months, both have come under intense
pressure to gain the size and reach needed to compete on the global
oil market, which has been swept by a wave of consolidation. Last
year, Exxon and Mobil merged to form Exxon Mobil Corp.; two French
rivals, TotalFina and Elf Aquitaine, have agreed to merge; BP
Amoco, born in merger, is seeking to acquire ARCO, though the
Federal Trade Commission is challenging the move.
</P>
<P>
   Repsol moved last year to increase its size, acquiring YPF, the
largest oil producer in Argentina. But with a combined stock market
value around $24 billion, Repsol-YPF remains relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   For ENI, the situation is more critical. Last summer, its chief
executive, Vittorio Mincato, began negotiations toward a merger
with Elf Aquitaine. But those talks were thwarted after Elf's
domestic rival, TotalFina, began an ultimately successful hostile
bid for the company. ENI's share price has drifted downward, losing
about 12 percent in recent months, until it caught an upwind early
this week on the rumors of a possible merger with Repsol. That was
reinforced by reports that the Italian government had succeeded in
shielding ENI from the full force of European gas-market
deregulation, which was threatening to deprive ENI of its gas
operations, a cash cow. On Tuesday, ENI's shares gained about 9
percent, easing a little Wednesday; Repsol was up both days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ENI is considered a vulnerable company that has suffered from
directionless management. Mincato, an ENI veteran who proved an
able cost-cutter in the early 1990s as head of the group's
chemicals division, has not done as well since taking the top job
in 1998. The position of chairman has changed hands twice in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``ENI is under pressure, not Repsol,'' said Keith Morris, an
analyst at BNP Securities in London.
</P>
<P>
   For ENI, a deal with Repsol would probably save its managers
their jobs. Gian Maria Gros-Pietro, the present ENI chairman, said
in an interview published Wednesday in the daily Il Giornale:
``With Exxon or Shell, just for the sake of an example, ENI would
disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   For Repsol, the prospect of an unwanted approach by ENI appears
distasteful. Gros-Pietro was at pains in the interview to dispute
the idea that his company was seeking to control Repsol. ``When we
study alliances, we don't talk of control, but of industrial
plans,'' he said. ``In a case in which ENI allies itself with a
smaller group, it does not necessarily have to acquire control.''
He did not elaborate on how such a relationship might be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ENI, with a valuation on the Milan Stock Exchange of almost
$44 billion, is almost twice the size of Repsol. Moreover, while
Spain sold its remaining 10 percent equity interest in Repsol in
1997, it retains the right to veto strategic moves until 2005; the
Italian treasury continues to hold a 36 percent stake in ENI.

TO OUTLAW GAY GROUP, SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY BAN CLUBS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARBARA WHITAKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORANGE, Calif. _ Under the protection of a court but in defiance
of a school board's wishes, a group of gay teen-agers held their
weekly lunch-hour meeting Wednesday in an empty classroom at El
Modena High School here.
</P>
<P>
   But whether they will ever do so again remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In a fight that has roiled this conservative suburban community
and drawn attention from legal scholars across the country, the
Orange Unified School District is seeking to ban the group,
contending that it is inappropriate because it deals with issues of
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Now, faced with a lawsuit and a judge's preliminary injunction,
the district is considering a new approach: whether to vote
Thursday to ban all 38 noncurricular clubs, including the Black
Student Union and the Gentlemen's Club, as a way of halting the gay
group's meetings. Only one other school district, Salt Lake City,
has taken such an approach and a lawsuit against that district is
still moving through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached a point in this process where the board faces
a range of options,'' said Judith Frutig, a spokeswoman for the
board. ``On one hand, they could stop the lawsuit or on the other
they could press forward with the knowledge that this case will
likely go as far as the Supreme Court. So they have a lot to
consider.''
</P>
<P>
   As a demonstration of the passions that the dispute has
inflamed, adult and student protesters, some of whom had come from
as far away as Salt Lake City, exchanged verbal insults outside the
school Wednesday afternoon. The police were called in to break up
the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   For gay students and their parents, the board's decision in
December to deny the group's application to establish a club is no
less than a violation of free speech. For some straight students
and their parents and some board members, the primary subject
matter is inappropriate for a school organization. At least one
board member contends that homosexuality is a sin and that
permitting a group to meet on campus condones it.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in response to a lawsuit by the group's student
organizers, a federal district judge, David O. Carter, ordered the
board to allow the group to meet until the case could get a full
hearing and he criticized the school district for failing to
protect gay students from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the club's existence arises as gay rights
issues play out across the country on several other fronts: in
Vermont, legislators are considering whether to grant domestic
partnership rights to gay couples, while a California ballot
initiative will ask voters to reaffirm that the state should only
acknowledge heterosexual marriage. Illinois is considering a law
that would offer special legal status to gay victims of violence.
</P>
<P>
   But while those legislative and legal fights have attracted more
attention, schools across the country are increasingly wrestling
with similar kinds of sweeping issues. As studies show that gay
youths are revealing their sexual orientation at younger and
younger ages, a growing number of teen-agers are forming gay rights
support groups.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled by the Gay, Lesbian and
Straight Education Network, more than 600 gay alliance clubs now
exist in middle schools and high schools across the country. In a
handful of cases, school boards have considered moves to stop the
groups from meeting, but have backed down as court actions were
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average age at which students self-identify as lesbian and
gay has dropped dramatically over the last 20 years,'' said Jon W.
Davidson, a supervising lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, the country's largest and oldest lesbian and gay
legal rights organization. ``High schools are having to deal with
this issue whereas they didn't in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dispute here, the school board cited the state education
code in denying the group's application. The board said the code
had strict requirements on how, when and by whom sex education and
related courses are taught on school grounds. It said it would be
inappropriate for students to lead discussions on such sensitive
topics as sexuality and sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The school board announced its decision after the group filed a
lawsuit in November charging that the board was illegally delaying
action on the application. The suit cited the Equal Access Act of
1984, the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteeing equal protection and
other civil rights laws. The 1984 act provides that schools
allowing groups to meet in extracurricular clubs cannot deny
certain groups to meet because of the content of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was passed by Congress at the urging of
conservative groups pushing for religious meetings in schools, but
it has since become an effective tool for gay rights groups seeking
similar privileges.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when Carter issued his preliminary injunction
ordering the district to allow the students to meet as the case
moves through the court, he carefully examined the student's rights
under the law, ultimately finding that the board must ``give
plaintiffs all the same rights and privileges that it gives to
other student groups.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his ruling, the judge also found that there was a
strong indication that the students were being harmed as a result
of being denied their First Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs have been injured not only by the board's excessive
delay, but also by the inability to effectively address the
hardships they encounter at school every day,'' the judge wrote.
``Some students at El Modena do not even feel safe using the
school's restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since Carter's ruling, the atmosphere for gay
students at El Modena has been tense, student organizers said. When
they arrived at school on Monday, gay students said the campus was
littered with prank gay-recruitment fliers. ``Come on Elmo, don't
be shy! You're either gay ... or you're bi,'' read the fliers,
which showed two men naked from the waist up.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Colin, a 15-year-old who helped found the gay club, said
the idea for the club arose from the savage beating death in 1998
of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of
Wyoming who was targeted because of his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Student organizers say their goal is to promote tolerance among
and for gay and straight students at the school. A survey by the
Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network found that 91 percent
of students polled by their organization regularly heard homophobic
comments at school. More than two-thirds of gay respondents said
they had been verbally, physically or sexually harassed on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The El Modena group said that it hoped to raise public awareness
and promote tolerance by providing a safe forum for discussion of
issues related to sexual orientation and homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to stress the need for people to put aside their
personal prejudice and agree to treat everyone with respect when
the situation calls for it,'' the group wrote, noting that no one
needed to disclose their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But school officials and some parents say they fear the students
are being used to promote the agenda of national gay advocacy
groups and express concern about the group's mission.

NATWEST IS SAID TO CONCEDE IT WILL BE BOUGHT BY ROYAL BANK OF
SCOTLAND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain's third-largest bank, National Westminster Bank
PLC, privately conceded defeat Wednesday in its effort to stave off
a hostile suitor, Royal Bank of Scotland, executives close to the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   At a NatWest board meeting Wednesday morning, the British bank
reversed its steadfast opposition to merging, acknowledging that
the Royal Bank of Scotland's 22.8 billion pounds ($36.9 billion)
bid would prevail, the executives said. NatWest had been battling
hostile bids by both the Royal Bank of Scotland and its crosstown
rival in Edinburgh, the Bank of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It is now increasingly likely that the Royal Bank will be able
to claim victory by Feb. 14. Valentine's Day is the deadline for
NatWest shareholders to tender their shares.
</P>
<P>
   While the board of NatWest is not in favor of formally
recommending the bid to the company's shareholders, the executives
said, the bank is considering alternatives that would effectively
signal to the market that it was giving up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its acknowledgment of defeat, the NatWest board remains
convinced that its stand-alone strategy would yield more growth for
the bank in the years ahead, and it is unwilling to fully endorse
the Royal Bank's offer, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear Wednesday night how NatWest would alert
shareholders of its new position without throwing its support
behind the Royal Bank's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said NatWest could issue a statement as early as
Thursday outlining its interest in making the transition period
during a merger with the Royal Bank as graceful as possible.
</P>
<P>
   NatWest has come under increasing pressure to succumb to a
friendly merger with the Royal Bank. Over 30 percent of NatWest
shareholders have already decided to back the Royal Bank,
executives on both sides said. NatWest's second, third and
fifth-largest shareholders _ Merrill Lynch's Mercury Asset
Management, Schroders and Standard Life Assurance _ have already
come out in support of the Royal Bank's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such momentum behind RBOS that it could get 50
percent,'' regardless of the position of NatWest's board, said Tom
Rayner, an analyst at SG Securities in London. ``They are clearly
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Royal Bank's predicted victory, shares of the Scottish
bank fell 14.2 percent, or 149 pence, to 904 pence, effectively
wiping 2.4 billion pounds from its cash and stock offer. Analysts
said the drop off of Royal Bank's share price is a direct result of
what they call the ``winner's curse'' _ the massive number of new
shares the company will have to issue to pay for NatWest, a bank
twice its size.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Bank's bid, which it raised at the last minute last
Monday, is now worth 2.54 pounds less a share than the Bank of
Scotland's offer, though it includes a larger cash component. The
Royal Bank said it would pay 0.968 share of its stock plus 4 pounds
in cash for each NatWest share. The Bank of Scotland's offer is for
1.75 of its shares and 3.56 pounds in cash for each NatWest share.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Wednesday, shares of the Bank of Scotland jumped 9.4
percent, or 57.5 pence, to 670.5 pence, as investors speculated
that it would be the next takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Natwest and the Royal Bank of Scotland declined to
comment. A spokesman for the Bank of Scotland could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts commented that even if NatWest gave up the fight, it
won concessions from both banks. Sir David Rowland, chairman of
NatWest, ``shouldn't be unhappy,'' Rayner said. ``He has squeezed a
substantial amount of cash out of them for shareholders,'' he said
referring to both banks' revised bids that included increased cash
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the bank is most likely to cede to the Royal Bank of
Scotland, technically, NatWest could remain independent if no one
bank gets a majority of the tendered shares. But, analysts said,
Sir David would almost have to give support to one of the Scottish
banks because his own mandate has evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Rowland's going to say, `The rules are the
rules,''' Rayner added. ``It would be pretty hard for Rowland to
continue running independently without real support from
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a deadlock among shareholders, it is unclear which
bank would prevail under British takeover codes.
</P>
<P>
   All three banks have come forth with ambitious plans to squeeze
billions in savings from NatWest operations. The British bank has
fervently argued that the synergies claimed by both Scottish banks
are illusory and that the costs associated with merging would be
too high. Both Scottish banks point to the NatWest's low return on
capital, and say that superior management, as well as synergies
from merging, would yield much better results.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Bank is advised by Merrill Lynch International, Goldman
Sachs International and Noble Grossart. NatWest's advisers are J.P.
Morgan and Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. The Bank ofScotland is being
advised by Credit Suisse First Boston Europe and Morgan Stanley.

   New Attacks on Web Sites Send Share Prices Lower
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous assaults on Web sites continued spreading as computer
vandals crippled a major online brokerage firm and at least two
media sites. The Justice Department pledged to find those
responsible, but computer experts questioned whether any reliable
defense against the attacks existed.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of what increasingly appeared to be a well
planned and tightly coordinated attack by a single individual or
group, the impact of the intruders grew. In addition to damaging
commerce at the sites, they began slowing traffic throughout the
Internet. The shares of publicly traded companies dropped as
investors tried to understand the implications of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Big Thing at Loch Harris
</P>
<P>
   The shares of Loch Harris, a company that often seems to have
grand plans and no revenue, surged to $4 this week on the
announcement that a subsidiary has developed a land mine detector
that is to be tested in Croatia. In the last three years, the
company announced that revenues were expected from businesses as
diverse as solar water pumps, oil production and cattle genetics.
But it has raised money mostly through an unusual financing method
that relies on current stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium to Get Emergency Financing
</P>
<P>
   A group of investors led by Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone
pioneer, has agreed to provide $74.6 million in emergency financing
to Iridium, the global satellite telephone company that filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August. The financing, which
would allow Iridium to continue operating through the middle of the
year, is believed to be McCaw's first step toward taking control of
the troubled satellite system, which cost more than $5 billion to
develop.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nasdaq and Dow Fall Sharply
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell sharply as technology issues, which have been strong
recently, declined in heavy trading. The Nasdaq composite index
ended with a loss of 64.26 points, or 1.45 percent, to 4,363.24.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 258.44 points, or 2.36
percent, to 10,699.16, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
was down 30.02 points, or 2.08 percent, to 1,411.70.
</P>
<P>
   ENI-Repsol Merger Remains Elusive
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that ENI, Italy's largest oil and gas group, was in
talks to merge with Repsol-YPF, the largest Spanish oil and gas
company, continued. The reports sent shares of both companies
higher, but ENI would not comment and Repsol denied that talks were
taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Scudder to Overhaul Fund Lineup
</P>
<P>
   Scudder Kemper Investments said it was merging 23 mutual funds
and shutting 6, as it sought to strengthen its partnership with
AARP, formerly the American Association of Retired Persons, and
reverse withdrawals of $3 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tradescape.com to Buy MarketXT
</P>
<P>
   Tradescape.com, the day trading firm, has agreed to pay $100
million in stock to acquire MarketXT, an electronic trading system
that specializes in trading stocks in the evening. Michael
Sanderson, a former Instinet executive who is chief executive of
MarketXT, said the combination would encourage Wall Street to focus
more closely on day-trading firms.

   PepsiCo Reports Strong Quarter
</P>
<P>
   PepsiCo said it had better-than-expected results in the fourth
quarter, driven by strong gains in all brands, and added that it
would split its Frito-Lay International division into two regional
units.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate said its fourth-quarter profit declined 44 percent,
brought down by the cost of a restructuring, acquisitions, price
pressure and higher auto insurance claims.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp., the media company controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said
its profit fell by 26 percent in its second quarter on lower movie
sales and losses at its 40 percent-owned British Sky Broadcasting.

 _ SF CHRON   Hungary's Junket Invite Not Likely to Test Journalists' Ethics 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
If you see a technology story coming out of Hungary in the next few
weeks, you might want to look for a disclaimer telling you who paid
for the trip.
<P>
   Hungary in February isn't my idea of a dream junket, but the
central European country, in an effort to attract more high-tech
companies, is offering journalists airfare, hotels and interviews
if they'll come take a look at how tech savvy it is.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no news organization has firmly committed to sending a
reporter; San Francisco cable channel ZDTV had agreed to accept a
report from a Seattle free-lancer, but he changed his mind and
decided not to go, the station said.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those unusual ethical questions that crops up from
time to time. Can a journalist take a free trip and still write an
unbiased story?
</P>
<P>
   A continuing series of seminars at the National Press Foundation
in Washington, D.C., raises a similar question, as many of those
sessions are sponsored by large corporations. One last month on
science writing was sponsored by pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly; the
next one, for telecommunications writers, is paid for by MCI
WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   The NPF insists that the corporate sponsors have no control over
the content of its programs and that they fund them to build an
educated press corps. ``People in the business world are dying to
get journalists more knowledgeable about the technical aspects of
their business,'' said Bob Meyers, president of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, the San Francisco public relations firm
organizing the trip to Hungary said that the former Eastern bloc
nation wants to get the word out about its technology-friendly
policies and its educated, low-wage workforce but that few news
organizations want to pay their own way to see it for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Hungary would pay to bring a journalist across the
ocean doesn't mean the hosts would restrict what that reporter
could write, or even whom the reporter could interview. ``Take the
ticket and write what you want,'' said Martin Schwirn of the Larose
Group, the PR firm organizing the trip. ``How would we be able to
force people to write in a favorable light?''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Graham, editor of TechWeek, turned down the Hungary junket.
Graham, who serves as president of the regional chapter of the
Society of Professional Journalists, said he also refused an
invitation from a Utah group that was promoting that state as an
alternative to Silicon Valley. ``I guess they didn't learn their
lesson from the Olympics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also invited to Hungary was Cnet's News.com, an Internet
technology news service. ``Nobody here is going,'' said editor Jai
Singh. ``We pay for our own fare, even if we were going to go to a
ballgame. ... It's a basic fundamental ethical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Press Foundation seminars are not as clear-cut, as
the foundation _ a 25-year-old independent nonprofit _ tells the
sponsors to imagine a session led by their worst enemy, ``and you
can't do a thing about it,'' said Meyers, the NPF president.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few media outlets forbid their reporters from
attending the seminars, and interest is rising, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like soft money contributions for journalists,''
TechWeek's Graham said. ``If it's worth it for a well-heeled news
organization to send a reporter, then they should pay the
freight.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 people applied for 15 slots in the science and
e-commerce seminars. Attendees have included reporters from
Business Week, the New York Times, Newsday, the Miami Herald and
the Contra Costa Times, Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the program's success, he said, is the NPF's firm
stand that everything said at the conference is on the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the record helps keep the speakers honest,'' Meyers said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CALLING THE GEEKS:
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Gates comes to San Francisco next week to unveil the
Windows 2000 operating system, tech publishing heavyweight
International Data Group will use the opportunity to unveil a Web
network aimed at the geekiest readers of all: systems
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Called ITworld.com (IT standing for information technology), the
site will knit together content from many of IDG's trade
publications, such as InfoWorld, ComputerWorld and CIO magazines.
It will also feature original content from a staff of 80 who are
split between offices on Second Street in San Francisco and in
Southboro, Mass., outside Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that IDG could have done something like this
several years ago, but the company is run in a decentralized
fashion that lets its individual magazines develop their own Web
presences. Now, with more than 250 Web sites under its umbrella,
IDG views the new venture as ``one more iteration and evolution of
this network,'' said Kelly Conlin, the CEO. ``We've been in the
technology business for 35 years. We look at this from a long-term
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade magazines like IDG's have lost some of their glamour in
recent years as spiffy new titles covering the so-called New
Economy are drawing all the dot-com ads. But IDG is sticking with
and beefing up its offerings to the people running the computers
for big companies, for one simple reason: That's where the money
is.
</P>
<P>
   Mass-market sites like Cnet and ZDNet aim for the small
businesses and individual consumers _ roughly 50 million people _
who spent $132 billion on computers last year, according to Bill
Reinstein, who will head the ITworld venture. ITworld.com is
setting its sites on a smaller group with a bigger wallet: the 4.3
million IT pros who spend $253 billion on computers and related
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous market,'' Reinstein said, ``and we see a
gaping hole.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DREAM OF GINA: &QL; 
No one could quite believe it when Gina Smith left ABC News in the
fall to host a cable show for Cnet television. The disbelief meter
rose again last week when Smith left Cnet only six months into the
gig, this time to _ brace yourself _ be CEO of a network computer
startup founded by Oracle's Larry Ellison.
</P>
<P>
   Smith couldn't be reached for comment, and an Oracle spokeswoman
would not confirm the deal, noting that the new company _ said to
be called New Internet Computer Co. _ ``is only a rumor at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Upside magazine alerted us, however, that if we were to write
about the move, we should credit them with the scoop. It's a funny
scoop, though, since the news came only a week after Smith hosted
the Upside Showcase conference in Palm Springs. Upside cited
anonymous sources, so I can't say how they got the story; but
should they really be bragging that they got a scoop about one of
their own employees?
</P>
<P>
   I'll say this: They did have the story before Cnet, which is now
searching for a replacement for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ZDTV OVER THE AIR &QL; 
The cable channel ZDTV _ which features programming around the
clock about computers _ is based in San Francisco, but still isn't
on the local AT&AMP;T cable system. But its news is finding its way to
many other venues around the world, including here.
</P>
<P>
   This week, ZDTV agreed to provide KCBS radio in San Francisco
with five radio features a week. The company has already been doing
radio-style reports on the Web at www.zdradio.com, and its features
are carried on 70 domestic stations and the Armed Forces network,
reaching 140 countries and 400 ships at sea. (Thank you, Walter
Winchell.)
</P>
<P>
   The radio deal comes on the heels of last month's announcement
that ZDTV will provide tech news to the Associated Press Television
Network, which is mostly available in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FLOUNDERING ABOUT &QL; 
Last week, I mentioned that eCompany magazine hired Owen Thomas,
who came from the Red Herring. Actually, Thomas came from Time
magazine; before that, he had worked at the Herring. We tried
correcting it, but the correction called him ``Owen Herring.'' In
addition to his reporting, by the way, Thomas maintains an
entertaining Web site at www.ditherati.com, in which he pokes fun
at the statements of hype-talking tech execs.

 Microsoft Gives Pay-Per-View on Net a Boost  &HT;     By Kelly Zito 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Seeking to bolster Web broadcasting with an all-important component
for e-commerce, Microsoft unveiled the preliminary version of a new
software program yesterday that lets Internet firms sell online
pay-per-view events.
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  The Seattle softwaremaker's Digital Broadcast Manager
coordinates pay-per-view purchases, distributes streaming audio and
video and allows companies to track who is buying the concert or
sports event and tailor advertisements to them.
</P>
<P>
   Although already in use at a handful of Webcasters, including
House of Blues Digital (www.hob.com) and Showtime's Boxing Web site
(www.sho.com/scboxing), the final product isn't scheduled for
release commercially until summer. The price of the software hasn't
been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, companies are able to convert video and audio files
to digital formats for viewing on the Web. One problem holding up
the growth of the pay-per-view format has been a tool that handles
the back-office tasks such as sales and customer tracking.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Digital Broadcast steps in. Unlike companies such
as RealNetworks and others that have come up with partial
solutions, Microsoft's new program claims to handle everything from
the initial customer order to reports on how well the event sold.
</P>
<P>
   With the Digital Broadcast Manager, Microsoft hopes to one-up
RealNetworks, whose RealPlayer is the most popular software for
playing media files online.
</P>
<P>
   In the bigger picture, Microsoft believes the product will help
lay the groundwork for an increasing amount number  &LR; of pay-per-view
or subscription-based content on the Web, which now makes up only a
fraction of the total content available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, you'll be able to get full-length films across the
Internet,'' said Michael Aldridge, product manager for the digital
media division.
</P>
<P>
   Much like cable TV pay-per-view, customers go to a Web site,
select an event and pay using a credit card (they must have a media
player like RealPlayer or Microsoft's Windows Media player to view
the video). Unlike cable, Internet pay-per-view quality is affected
by the connection speed and is often displayed in a very small
window on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Felisan, vice president of House of Blues Digital, said
the product will help the Los Angeles company increase the
frequency of pay-per-view concerts from two 2  &LR; per week now to
daily events within several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business which we have long contemplated, but up
until recently, we weren't able to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like MP3, the digital format that lets consumers download
near-CD-quality music via the Internet, Felisan believes Digital
Broadcast Manager will let lesser-known artists reach their
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons why you don't see a lot of live broadcasts
on TV is that you need to be a talent that draws a lot of people,
because TV time is so expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Felisan and analysts admit that Web pay-per-view is far
from a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Schwartz, an analyst at Forrester Research in
Massachusetts, said the market will remain relatively small as a
result of limited access to high-speed Internet connections, the
big improvement in cable services and TV images, and the fact that
consumers have grown accustomed to free Internet content.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see more pay-per-view, but I don't think it will ever be
a majority (of the content),'' Schwartz said. ``Most content will
continue to be advertising driven.''

<P>
   As anonymous assaults on major Web sites continued Wednesday,
computer vandals crippled a large online brokerage operation and a
media site. The Justice Department pledged to find those
responsible, but computer experts questioned whether any defenses
could easily be deployed against the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of what increasingly appeared to be a well
planned and tightly coordinated siege by a single individual or
group, the impact of the attacks grew. In addition to damaging
commerce at the sites that have become targets, the attacks slowed
traffic in some portions of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, while pledging a vigorous pursuit
of the persons responsible, also acknowledged that they remained
unknown to authorities, having well covered their electronic
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned e-commerce companies across the Net _ many of whose
publicly traded shares dropped in value Wednesday as investors
tried to understand the implications _ began taking extraordinary
measures to protect their Web sites from becoming targets.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, computer security experts said the complex, anonymous
nature of the attacks made them difficult to trace or stop.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said the attacks appear to have been weeks or
months in the planning, since they require clandestinely loading
software onto dozens, if not hundreds, of computers around the
Internet. When those programs were activated this week, the host
computers were transformed into platforms for launching the
attacks. In almost all cases, experts said, the owners of the
computers never knew _ and still may not know _ that their machines
had become cogs in the attack machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to believe there are thousands of these tools out
there waiting for the launch button to be pushed,'' said David &UR; 16 &LR; 
M. Remnitz &UR; 17 &LR; , chief executive of IFsec &UR; 18C &LR;  LLC &UR; 19 &LR; , a New
York-based information security company. Suggesting that the
attackers already had the infrastructure in place for the attacks
to continue indefinitely, he added, ``I don't see any reason why
they would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the FBI &UR; 20 &LR;  had opened a criminal investigation, but
she and bureau officials acknowledged that they had no strong leads
and that they had heard no credible claims of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we are not aware of the motives behind these
attacks'' the attorney general said, ``but they appear to be
intended to interfere with and to disrupt legitimate electronic
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Ans &UR; 21 &LR;  they have disrupted the Internet as a whole in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote Systems, a company that measures the reliability and
performance of Web sites, reported Wednesday that during the
attacks, it took 8 seconds to call up a typical Web site's home
page, nearly twice the time required during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While government and computer industry sources continued to
acknowledge Wednesday that they could not be certain that the same
group or individual was behind the attacks, they said the nature of
the assaults seemed too similar to be coincidental. In each case,
the targeted Web site was so flooded with meaningless data that the
company's computers became paralyzed and unable to serve customers.
</P>
<P>
   What began with an attack on the popular Yahoo portal site
Monday, spread Wednesday to Zdnet &UR; 22 &LR; .com, a media site, and
Etrade &UR; 23 &LR; , one of the largest online brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one other major site appears to have been targeted.
Although the Internet media company CNet &UR; 24C &LR;  declined to comment
Wednesday, its network service provider reported detecting an
attack on the company's sites Tuesday afternoon but managed to
provide enough of a defense to avert crippling damages.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Di Chiro &UR; 25 &LR; , spokesman for Etrade &UR; 23 &LR; , based in
Menlo &UR; 26 &LR;  Park, Calif., said the company planned to deal ``one on
one'' with customers who asserted they lost money by not being able
to access the site to place trades.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro &UR; 25 &LR;  said following the assaults Monday on Yahoo and
Tuesday on Buy.com &UR; 27 &LR; , a retail site, and Ebay &UR; 28 &LR; .com, an auction
site, Etrade &UR; 23 &LR;  began discussing what measures might be taken to
defend the site against a similar attack. Although he said unnamed
measures were taken, the company was unable to prevent the attack.
But the company did have several contingency plans in place,
including directing visitors to an alternate Web site, which
Etrade &UR; 23 &LR;  advertised over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the attacks have been difficult to counter is
that finding the perpetrators and cutting them off requires a
cooperative, concerted effort between the targeted Web site and its
network service provider, the company that connects the site's own
computers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vixie &UR; 29 &LR; , senior vice president of Internet services for
AboveNet &UR; 30C &LR; , a network service provider whose clients include
eBay &UR; 28C &LR;  and CNet &UR; 24C &LR; , said the attackers appeared to be have
installed widely available software that, when secretly planted on
other people's computers, flood the target site with useless
streams of information and instructions to do meaningless tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie &UR; 29 &LR;  said AboveNet &UR; 30C &LR;  was hit with as much as 800
megabits of ``spurious traffic,'' a level that could cost the
company $400,000 a month to transport if it continued at consistent
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would cost us $400,000 a month just because some
teen-ager &UR; 31 &LR;  with a $300 Linux &UR; 32 &LR;  box doesn't like one of our
customers,'' said. ``It makes us a little testy.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier incarnation of this type of attack emerged two years
ago, but new illicit software has circulated that makes them easier
to launch and more difficult to defend against. The attacks
themselves have intensified in the last nine months, striking not
just the well publicized major sites, but also smaller sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT &UR; 33 &LR; , a federally
financed computer security organization based at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, along with private computer security
firms have released numerous warnings in recent months describing
the attacks and suggesting ways to combat them.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Dick, chief of the FBI's &UR; 20 &LR;  Computer Investigations and
Operations Section, acknowledged that tools for this type of
attack, known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack, are so
readily available on the Web that the attacks could have been
launched by a 15-year-old. ``It doesn't take a great deal of
sophistication,'' Dick said. ``In a relatively short of period time
an unsophisticated intruder or unsophisticated computer user can
take advantage of not only the U.S. government, but also
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, purposely disrupting computer networks is a
felony punishable for first-time offenders with a jail term of up
to five years and a $250,000 fine, plus assessment of damages. But
Dick repeatedly said the FBI &UR; 20 &LR;  had no hope of solving the crime
without ``help from the entire community'' _ meaning primarily the
various Internet service providers, or ISPs &UR; 35C &LR; , whose servers
were used to pass the data from the attacker to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with FBI &UR; 20 &LR;  to track the source of the
attacks,'' Vixie &UR; 29 &LR;  said, echoing similar statements from
officials at Yahoo and Ebay &UR; 28 &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Vixie &UR; 29 &LR;  said there were several measures sites could take to
protect themselves, including increasing their capacity to handle
traffic, using operating systems that can sift out malicious
traffic and installing the latest security patches that prevent the
sites from being commandeered to launch attacks on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   But he also added: ``This level of alertness is not sustainable.
We are hoping that there will be a technological or legal solution
so we can go back to building our network rather than defending
against attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   AboveNet &UR; 30C &LR;  and other Internet service providers have begun
filtering out suspicious traffic, but that, they said, is an
approach that must be continuously adjusted as attackers change
their means of assault.

INVESTORS TO FINANCE REVAMPING OF IRIDIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A group of investors led by Craig McCaw, the cellular
telephone pioneer, has agreed to provide $74.6 million in emergency
financing to Iridium LLC, the global satellite telephone company
that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August.
</P>
<P>
   The financing, which would allow Iridium to continue operating
through midyear, is believed to be McCaw's first step toward taking
control of the troubled satellite system, which cost more than $5
billion to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, based in Washington, asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York City on Wednesday to approve the debtor-in-possession
financing from McCaw. The company said the move would give it more
time to develop a reorganization plan and work with McCaw, who
intends to purchase the assets of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to McCaw, who also agreed to raise $1.2 billion
to help rescue ICO Global Communications Ltd. from Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection, say that his investment is part of an effort
to restore confidence in the satellite telephone industry as well
as create a consortium of satellite communications services that
includes Teledesic LLC, the so-called Internet in the Sky, which is
expected to begin operation in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Inc., which founded Iridium, said Wednesday that it was
also participating in the financing. But the company, which is
based in Schaumburg, Ill., said it would have a minority stake in a
new company controlled by McCaw and that the participation would
not have an adverse effect on its earnings this year.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Motorola provided $20 million in emergency
assistance to Iridium to help the company operate through Feb. 15.
At the time, company officials said they would cancel the satellite
service contract with Iridium unless a restructuring plan was ready
by that date.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, Motorola said it was following through on
its earlier edict not to contribute more money unless other huge
investments were committed.

 BUSH AND McCAIN EXCHANGE SHARP WORDS ON FUND-RAISING 
 (rk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ The two leading Republican presidential
rivals tangled over campaign fund raising Wednesday, with Sen. John
McCain calling Gov. George W. Bush the ``unwitting pawn'' of
special interests. The Texas governor, seeking to tarnish McCain's
reform credentials, questioned the senator's acceptance of
donations from political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp exchange took place over McCain's signature issue of
money in politics as the two Republicans campaigned across South
Carolina, the site of the next Republican primary, on Feb. 19. The
day saw both men fighting for the mantle of reform, which McCain
had used to sprint to an unexpectedly large victory in New
Hampshire last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has raised far more money than McCain, asserted at a
news conference that the Arizona senator had pledged earlier this
year not to take money from political action committees, which are
the political arms of unions and corporations and ideological
groups. He said the senator had broken his promise.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cited a January article in The Boston Globe, which McCain
later said misquoted him. Bush's aides said The Union Leader in
Manchester, N.H., had carried a similar report.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has always accepted money from political action
committees, which are limited to donations of $5,000 a candidate in
the presidential primary. Bush also takes such contributions.
McCain has been crusading not against such limited amounts but
against the unlimited, unregulated donations to political parties
known as soft money. He has denounced the ``iron triangle'' of
money, lobbyists and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus Wednesday, McCain pointed to news reports
suggesting that Bush's top campaign fund-raisers and Republican
leaders were preparing drives to raise soft money in preparation
for the general election in the fall. He said the governor was
risking the same kind of abuses that tarnished President Clinton's
fund raising in 1996. The Democratic National Committee returned
several million dollars because of questions about the origins of
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him as the unwitting pawn,'' he said of Bush. ``If he
won't support fundamental reform of the system then he becomes part
of the problem.'' Later in the day he seemed to soften his
criticism of Bush but not his assault on the soft money system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system that is being set up if he is the nominee is a very
bad thing,'' McCain said. ``Governor Bush, I hope, would understand
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush in recent days has tried to cut into McCain's appeal by
calling himself a ``reformer with results'' and pointing to his
record as governor of Texas. And Wednesday he emphasized his record
on tort reform and promised to reduce frivolous lawsuits in federal
courts. Before Monday, Bush had rarely described himself as a
reformer, instead focusing on his ``compassionate conservative''
theme and selling his tax cut plan. Wednesday, he managed to marry
the two in his appearance at Newberry, saying, ``A reformer with
results is a conservative who has had compassionate results in the
state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session at Newberry, Bush again faced
questions about flying the Confederate flag above the state's
Capitol. He won applause when he restated his position that any
decision on moving the flag should be made by South Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
   When one questioner called on Bush, if elected, to show
``leadership'' and force state officials to take down the flag,
Bush said doing so would go against his philosophy that individual
states should decide.

MARKET PLACE: NO REVENUES BUT SHARES SOAR. HOW DOES LOCH HARRIS DO
IT? 
</HEADLINE>
 (af) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loch Harris is a company that often seems to have grand plans.
In the last three years, it has announced that revenues were
expected imminently from businesses as diverse as solar water
pumps, oil production and cattle genetics. It said it had developed
a security system that was to be installed at the home of Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   None of those projects produced any revenues. But now the stock
is soaring again, this time on the announcement that a Loch Harris
subsidiary has developed a land mine detector that is to be tested
Friday in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it is proved in Croatia's live minefields, the whole
world will be clamoring for this lifesaver,'' said Rodney Boone,
Loch Harris' president, in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   In trading on the over-the-counter bulletin board, Loch Harris
shares, which sold for less than a dime as recently as last fall,
climbed as high as $5.95 this week on heavy volume, which has
totaled about 100 million shares in the last five trading days.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the price rose 15.6 cents to $4. With more than 393
million shares outstanding, that gives the company a market value
of $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Loch Harris' filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
show that it has not had any revenues since at least 1995. It did
issue a news release in 1998, reporting revenues of $4.2 million,
but the subsequent SEC filing did not show any revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Without revenues, it has managed to stay in business with an
unusual financing method. It has had its shareholders sell some of
their shares to the public and contribute the proceeds to the
company. In return, the company gives the investors three more
shares for each one sold.
</P>
<P>
   That financing scheme sounds crazy. It is a sure-fire way of
diluting the equity of current shareholders. But it provides cash
to the company by allowing the sale of shares without the need to
hand out prospectuses to investors, something that would be
required if the company were selling the shares directly. Those
prospectuses would need to be cleared by the SEC and would have to
note prominently the company's lack of revenues.
</P>
<P>
   R.B. Baker, the chairman of the board of Loch Harris, said in a
telephone interview Wednesday that the company had used the
technique of having shareholders sell shares, and donate the money
to the company in return for three times as many shares, because
``it was an innovative way of raising money'' and the company
needed the cash. But he said that the company was no longer doing
that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the costs of developing the mine detector had
been underwritten by an outside company in return for a stake in
the Loch Harris subsidiary that owns the rights to the product. He
said that the amount invested, and the size of the stake that the
investor is to receive, is not public information.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it is not clear how much benefit Loch Harris might get from
the mine detector even if the detector does become Loch Harris'
first successful product.
</P>
<P>
   What is public information is that Baker and other Loch Harris
officials have sometimes been enthusiastic about developments that
did not pan out. In 1997, Baker announced that a Loch Harris
subsidiary had agreed to supply solar water pumps to Mexico, adding
that the contract would bring in $15 million to $17 million in
sales the following year.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, he announced that a security system made by Loch
Harris was to be installed in the ``Gaza Strip palace'' of Arafat,
the Palestinian leader. Boone forecast that the company would soon
be making millions from a program in cattle genetics.
</P>
<P>
   Such announcements moved the stock from 7 cents a share up to a
high of 90 cents in 1997. But the company ended up reporting no
revenue from the pumps, the security system or the cattle genetics.
In 1998, Boone reported that the company's oil holdings were on the
verge of beginning production and would bring in millions of
dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the company even put out a news release saying it had
revenues of $4.2 million in the final three months of 1997, and had
made 2.6 cents a share during the period. It did not say just which
businesses had produced the revenues, but the announcement sent the
share price as high as 33 cents.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the company got around to filing financial
statements with the SEC, however, the revenues and profits had
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, the chairman, did not return a later phone call Wednesday
to inquire about the previous announcements. In the earlier call,
he said that Boone could not be reached because he was in Croatia
overseeing the mine detector tests. He also said that he thought
the company would soon begin reporting ``a little trickle'' of
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   During the eight days since the company announced plans for the
Croatia test, owners of privately issued stock have notified the
SEC of plans to sell more than 1 million shares. They evidently
decided not to wait for the test results.

TIGHTER SAFETY RULES PROMPT BETTER INSTRUCTIONS ON CAR SEAT USE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the midst of major changes in the design of
children's car seats, automakers are stepping up efforts to show
parents how to use the seats properly.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that 80 percent of child seats are installed
improperly and that 60 percent of children in fatal crashes are not
belted in at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chicago Auto Show Wednesday, DaimlerChrysler announced
that 400 of its dealers would offer free inspections of child
safety seats to drivers of any vehicle _ whether a Chrysler product
or not. By the end of the year, the free inspections will be
available at 1,000 dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has been working for years with the National
SafeKids Campaign, a nonprofit organization in Washington that
seeks to prevent childhood injuries. Last month, GM announced it
would donate 51 Chevrolet Venture minivans worth $3 million to the
group, which plans to turn them into mobile car-seat checkpoints so
it can offer safety checks in shopping malls, day care centers,
state fairs and other areas frequented by parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has offered 20 child seat clinics a year at dealerships
across the country for the last two years. Toyota has offered child
seat clinics and Nissan has distributed informational pamphlets to
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The moves have come as government highway safety agencies have
pressured the automakers to do more to ensure that child seats are
used properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for children in
America, and they are taking a terrible toll on families,'' Jim
Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said
here Wednesday. On average, five children under 10 die each day in
car crashes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that installing a child seat is not as easy as
strapping on a seat belt. Parents must first be sure that a certain
car seat model fits their car, and must then wrestle it into the
back seat and follow directions on how to attach the seat belts to
it tightly _ directions that vary depending on whether the car has
only lap belts or shoulder belts.
</P>
<P>
   Infants must ride in rear-facing seats until they are a year old
and weigh more than 20 pounds. And parents must not place front or
rear-facing car seats in front of air bags, requiring pickup truck
owners to have the passenger-side air bag switched off.
</P>
<P>
   Because of improper use of child seats, regulators have required
changes in the seats and the vehicles. Since last September,
forward-facing child seats have been required to meet stiffer
performance standards in crash tests, which most manufacturers have
met by adding straps that tether the top of the child seat to the
vehicle. By this fall, all cars and trucks must come equipped with
metal attachments for those tethers.
</P>
<P>
   Even as those rules are hitting the market, new safety
requirements are being phased in to make the installation of child
seats more foolproof. In addition to using the tethers, child seats
will be required to latch onto cars using a new system: straps or
metal brackets attached to the child seats will be snapped onto
rigid metal bars embedded in vehicle seats. Twenty percent of autos
must have the metal seat attachments by this fall, half of the
vehicles by the 2002 model year, and the rest must have the new
system by 2003.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the safety board lobbied automakers here Wednesday to
follow DaimlerChrysler's lead, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration held a hearing in Washington on child seat safety.
The agency is considering rating child seats in much the way that
it rates the crashworthiness of cars and trucks, said Rae Tyson, a
spokesman. ``We're still in the fact-gathering stage at this
point,'' he said. The agency heard testimony Wednesday from
consumer groups, automakers and the Juvenile Products Manufacturers
Association, which represents the makers of child seats.
</P>
<P>
   While consumer groups including Consumer's Union favor such a
plan, automakers and some safety groups say parents could get a
false sense of security by buying top-rated child seats. That is
because the performance of the seats varies depending on whether
they are installed properly and because seats perform differently
with different vehicle models.

KANSAS SENATOR, STUDENTS HAVE VIDEO CONFERENCE ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts logged on to the Internet on
Wednesday and up popped two groups of students from high schools
back home.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Republican became the third senator to have a video
conversation over the Internet with constituents in home states. He
took questions from government classes in the central Kansas towns
of Hillsboro and Marion for about 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts sat in front of a camera in a Senate building studio,
and the students gathered in front of cameras in their respective
schools. Images from all three locations appeared simultaneously on
screens, although the picture was about a half-second behind the
sound transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he saw great promise in the Internet as a means
for Washington lawmakers to conduct electronic ``listening tours''
from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just barely scratched the surface,'' Roberts said.
``You basically have the technology to do this in so many places.
It's a little impersonal, but you can at least see and hear people
and have that interchange.''
</P>
<P>
   The high school students asked Roberts questions about
agriculture exports, trade sanctions on Cuba and China,
bio-terrorism threats, new leadership in Russia and the solvency of
Social Security.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As anonymous assaults on major Web sites continued Wednesday,
computer vandals crippled a large online brokerage operation and a
media site. The Justice Department pledged to find those
responsible, but computer experts questioned whether any defenses
could easily be deployed against the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of what increasingly appeared to be a well
planned and tightly coordinated siege by a single individual or
group, the impact of the attacks grew. In addition to damaging
commerce at the sites that have become targets, the attacks slowed
traffic in some portions of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, while pledging a vigorous pursuit
of the persons responsible, also acknowledged that they remained
unknown to authorities, having well covered their electronic
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned e-commerce companies across the Net _ many of whose
publicly traded shares dropped in value Wednesday as investors
tried to understand the implications _ began taking extraordinary
measures to protect their Web sites from becoming targets.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, computer security experts said the complex, anonymous
nature of the attacks made them difficult to trace or stop.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said the attacks appear to have been weeks or
months in the planning, since they require clandestinely loading
software onto dozens, if not hundreds, of computers around the
Internet. When those programs were activated this week, the host
computers were transformed into platforms for launching the
attacks. In almost all cases, experts said, the owners of the
computers never knew _ and still may not know _ that their machines
had become cogs in the attack machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to believe there are thousands of these tools out
there waiting for the launch button to be pushed,'' said David M.
Remnitz, chief executive of IFsec LLC, a New York-based information
security company. Suggesting that the attackers already had the
infrastructure in place for the attacks to continue indefinitely,
he added, ``I don't see any reason why they would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the FBI had opened a criminal investigation, but she
and bureau officials acknowledged that they had no strong leads and
that they had heard no credible claims of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we are not aware of the motives behind these
attacks'' the attorney general said, ``but they appear to be
intended to interfere with and to disrupt legitimate electronic
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Ans they have disrupted the Internet as a whole in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote Systems, a company that measures the reliability and
performance of Web sites, reported Wednesday that during the
attacks, it took 8 seconds to call up a typical Web site's home
page, nearly twice the time required during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While government and computer industry sources continued to
acknowledge Wednesday that they could not be certain that the same
group or individual was behind the attacks, they said the nature of
the assaults seemed too similar to be coincidental. In each case,
the targeted Web site was so flooded with meaningless data that the
company's computers became paralyzed and unable to serve customers.
</P>
<P>
   What began with an attack on the popular Yahoo portal site
Monday, spread Wednesday to Zdnet.com, a media site, and Etrade,
one of the largest online brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one other major site appears to have been targeted.
Although the Internet media company CNet declined to comment
Wednesday, its network service provider reported detecting an
attack on the company's sites Tuesday afternoon but managed to
provide enough of a defense to avert crippling damages.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Di Chiro, spokesman for Etrade, based in Menlo Park,
Calif., said the company planned to deal ``one on one'' with
customers who asserted they lost money by not being able to access
the site to place trades.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro said following the assaults Monday on Yahoo and Tuesday
on Buy.com, a retail site, and Ebay.com, an auction site, Etrade
began discussing what measures might be taken to defend the site
against a similar attack. Although he said unnamed measures were
taken, the company was unable to prevent the attack. But the
company did have several contingency plans in place, including
directing visitors to an alternate Web site, which Etrade
advertised over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the attacks have been difficult to counter is
that finding the perpetrators and cutting them off requires a
cooperative, concerted effort between the targeted Web site and its
network service provider, the company that connects the site's own
computers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vixie, senior vice president of Internet services for
AboveNet, a network service provider whose clients include eBay and
CNet, said the attackers appeared to be have installed widely
available software that, when secretly planted on other people's
computers, flood the target site with useless streams of
information and instructions to do meaningless tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said AboveNet was hit with as much as 800 megabits of
``spurious traffic,'' a level that could cost the company $400,000
a month to transport if it continued at consistent levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would cost us $400,000 a month just because some teen-ager
with a $300 Linux box doesn't like one of our customers,'' said.
``It makes us a little testy.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier incarnation of this type of attack emerged two years
ago, but new illicit software has circulated that makes them easier
to launch and more difficult to defend against. The attacks
themselves have intensified in the last nine months, striking not
just the well publicized major sites, but also smaller sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, a federally
financed computer security organization based at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, along with private computer security
firms have released numerous warnings in recent months describing
the attacks and suggesting ways to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dick, chief of the FBI's Computer Investigations and
Operations Section, acknowledged that tools for this type of
attack, known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack, are so
readily available on the Web that the attacks could have been
launched by a 15-year-old. ``It doesn't take a great deal of
sophistication,'' Dick said. ``In a relatively short of period time
an unsophisticated intruder or unsophisticated computer user can
take advantage of not only the U.S. government, but also
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, purposely disrupting computer networks is a
felony punishable for first-time offenders with a jail term of up
to five years and a $250,000 fine, plus assessment of damages. But
Dick repeatedly said the FBI had no hope of solving the crime
without ``help from the entire community'' _ meaning primarily the
various Internet service providers, or ISPs, whose servers were
used to pass the data from the attacker to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with FBI to track the source of the attacks,''
Vixie said, echoing similar statements from officials at Yahoo and
Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said there were several measures sites could take to
protect themselves, including increasing their capacity to handle
traffic, using operating systems that can sift out malicious
traffic and installing the latest security patches that prevent the
sites from being commandeered to launch attacks on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   But he also added: ``This level of alertness is not sustainable.
We are hoping that there will be a technological or legal solution
so we can go back to building our network rather than defending
against attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   AboveNet and other Internet service providers have begun
filtering out suspicious traffic, but that, they said, is an
approach that must be continuously adjusted as attackers change
their means of assault.

BLUE CROSS OF KC TO AMEND CONTRACTS CONCERNING MEDICAL NECESSITY
CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City
said Wednesday that it would amend its physician contracts to
guarantee its use of independent physicians to decide disputes
involving medical necessity.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who should decide what is medically necessary to
treat patients is one of the issues during ongoing contract
negotiations between Blue Cross and area physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The contract change regarding medical necessity rulings will
codify a practice that Blue Cross already follows, said John P.
Mascotte, president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this action, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City is
making a legally binding commitment to have peer review of disputed
matters, operating outside the company's control, not by company
employees,'' Mascotte said. ``We'll be bound by their decision, and
we're willing to make that a matter of contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank DiTirro, a physician and Blue Cross' chief medical
officer, said Blue Cross already contracted with a California-based
physician peer-review group that rules on appeals involving Blue
Cross medical necessity disputes. This procedure will continue
under the contract amendment, DiTirro said.
</P>
<P>
   The medical necessity provision will be included in a contract
amendment that Blue Cross will send to its 3,200 contracted
physicians later this month. Other provisions include limiting Blue
Cross access to physician financial records.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross also announced the formation of a medical advisory
committee that will address areas such as physician communication,
medical policy issues, Blue Cross initiatives, and responses to
state and federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will replace a medical necessity advisory
committee that Blue Cross recently assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``While, in general, I'm pleased with the tone, there are
serious differences that still remain on the issue of medical
necessity,'' said Richard Hellman, a physician and president of the
Metropolitan Medical Society of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman, who has not signed the latest Blue Cross contract, said
he remained concerned that if Blue Cross chooses and pays the group
that decides medical necessity disputes, ``it could potentially
affect the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellman said he would rather have the outside review group
chosen by a medical society or state insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual show of protest, at least 1,000 area physicians
late last year declined to sign or delayed signing contracts with
Blue Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross responded in December by sending contract amendments
to all physicians in its health plan networks.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Blue Cross sent termination notices to doctors who
had not signed new contracts. The insurer has not disclosed how
many doctors received notices, but sources have estimated the
number to be in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The notices gave the physicians 90 to 120 days to reconsider and
sign the contracts. They will remain in the Blue Cross network
until the end of that period.
</P>
<P>
   A private meeting to talk about the situation involving Blue
Cross and its physicians has been scheduled for Friday in Kansas
City. Participants will include Kathleen Sebelius, Kansas insurance
commissioner, and Keith Wenzel, director of the Missouri Department
of Insurance.

POPULARITY OF FLAVORED CIGARETTES AMONG YOUNG WORRIES HEALTH
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Some middle-school students like to unwind
with a cigarette after the bell rings.
</P>
<P>
   Some light up a chocolate cigarette. Others have a strawberry
one. And for the really hip seventh-graders, it's a mango smoke.
</P>
<P>
   They are called bidis , flavored cigarettes from India that are
fast catching on with America's middle-school children, according
to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials warn that parents should not be fooled by the
youthful perception that a bidi is not a real cigarette and thus
not harmful. Bidis contain higher levels of tar, nicotine and
carbon monoxide than regular cigarettes do, according to the
national centers.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, health officials say, is that bidis
(pronounced bee-dees) are less expensive _ about $2 a pack _ and
easier for young people to obtain than regular cigarettes. They
come packaged in bright colors, and to top off the allure, bidis
are hand-rolled, tapered and have no filter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like joints,'' Michael Eriksen, director of the
CDC's Office on Smoking and Health, said, referring to marijuana
cigarettes. ``Kids think they convey a very cool and trendy
image.''
</P>
<P>
   A large bidi manufacturer in India, Sundarlal Moolchand Jain
Tobacconist, denies the adverse health findings. Company officials
could not be reached by telephone. Its Web site says bidis have
less tobacco and are ``healthier than cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also says bidis have herbal properties and a unique
lingering taste.
</P>
<P>
   Like most trends in American pop culture, the craze began in
coastal cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has now reached Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   An eighth-grader at a Kansas City, Kan., middle school said his
peers sometimes used bidis. And a 16-year-old south Kansas City
girl said they were popular with ``the alternative kids, you know _
the pot-smoking, nose-piercing crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bidis aren't taking the place of regular cigarettes,'' she
said. ``It's a different thing. They're like...exotic. Nobody buys
bidis and smokes them all. But if you take them to a party, they're
all gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the alternative appeal is that bidis are not sold in
places that traditionally handle cigarettes. In California, bidis
are big at surf shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Makes it more of an underground thing,'' the Kansas City girl
said.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Hornberger, a pediatrician specializing in adolescent
medicine at Children's Mercy Hospital, does not know how prevalent
bidis are in Kansas City, but she is aware of their popularity
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And she has no doubt about the target market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they start flavoring cigarettes like candy and selling
them in bright-colored packages, they are preying on young
people,'' Hornberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen declined to speculate on whether Indian companies were
aiming at American teens, saying: ``We don't know their motive, but
we know the result.''
</P>
<P>
   No American cigarette manufacturer makes bidis, Eriksen said.
And only bidis exported to the United States are flavored.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional cigarettes remain the most popular tobacco product
among young teens, but bidis have quickly claimed a share of the
teen-age market.
</P>
<P>
   A CDC survey of 642 Massachusetts youths showed that 40 percent
had smoked bidis. In San Francisco, the Booker T. Washington
Community Service Center polled students in four schools and
determined that 58 percent had smoked bidis.
</P>
<P>
   Both studies were done in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Earp, who runs the Tobacco Road Smoke Shop at 8155 State
Ave. in Kansas City, Kan., said he was doing a brisk bidi business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell to a lot of young people,'' Earp said, referring to
customers in their early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   His shop never sells tobacco products to minors, he said, but he
sees why bidis would appeal to youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're flavored and they look like a joint,'' Earp said.
``Kids probably think they're pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem health officials see with bidis is that by being
sold in ethnic food stores, surf shops and skater shops, they
sometimes escape the scrutiny of regulations that prohibit sales to
minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they don't even come with the surgeon general's
warning,'' said Dee Ann Allen of the Los Angeles County Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   That is a terrible oversight, Eriksen said, because bidis
actually pose greater health risks than regular cigarettes, partly
because bidis are not tightly packed, meaning they are difficult to
keep lighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``So kids puff harder,'' Eriksen said. ``They inhale more smoke,
more toxins, more tar, more nicotine and ultimately more
carcinogens into the lungs.''

SENATORS UNVEIL PLAN TO SOLVE SOCIAL ILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Coming soon to a city near you: a possible solution
to its problems, compliments of a new organization unveiled
Wednesday by U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas and others.
</P>
<P>
   The Healthy Culture Initiative is a nonprofit entity that will
develop ideas for addressing social ills in America. It will hold
summits in 10 cities this year, perhaps including Topeka and
Wichita, Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the subjects the organization wants to take on include
teen pregnancies, drug use by the young, community safety,
voluntarism, marriage, parental time with children, and the
prevalence of violence and sex in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problems are real,'' Brownback said at a press conference
with Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat also backing the
project. ``We ignore them at our peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Brownback said peace and prosperity can mask those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of good times, there is this nagging feeling that
society has grown harsher, coarser and more violent,'' Brownback
said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization will look at how solutions in some places can
be repeated elsewhere. Each city that agrees to hold a summit will
be asked to identify three problems it wants addressed. The Healthy
Culture Initiative will then conduct research and provide speakers
who represent success stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me it's so thoroughly well-intentioned and
classically American,'' said Lieberman. ``The aim of this
initiative is to get us talking to one another. People do want to
get involved, but sometimes the task seems overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has raised about $150,000 and projects it will
need a budget of about $500,000 its first year. It wants
communities it visits to help organize events and pay some of the
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Among contributors to the group are the Motion Picture
Association of America, Coors Brewing Co., the Gallup Organization,
Parents' Television Council and the International Fellowship of
Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This not a political organization,'' Lieberman said. ``This is
truly a ground-up approach to initiating a dialogue.''

<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.
</P>
<P>
   The actual accumulation, however, would be $942,692 _ nearly
twice as much. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using Jarrett's software and checking all 44 of the 30-year
periods, I found that actual experience beat average historical
performance 64 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Three things. First, most of the planning tools we use are
virtually useless.
</P>
<P>
   Second, we'll probably do better accumulating money than we
expect.
</P>
<P>
   And, third, we'll probably do worse in retirement, so spending
needs to be managed with great care. &QL;

Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.

   The actual accumulation, however, would be $942,692 _ nearly
twice as much. &QL;

periods, I found that actual experience beat average historical

   Three things. First, most of the planning tools we use are

<TEXT>
<P>
   Allow me to introduce the Installment Effect. That's my name for
what happens to investments when they're made or changed in
installments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us live on the installment plan. We get paid in
installments, we spend in installments, we borrow and repay in
installments. We also invest in installments.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not how most calculations on investment return are
presented.
</P>
<P>
   All mutual-fund representations, for instance, assume that
investors make a single investment and never add a dime after that.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar fund illustration _ the so-called mountain
chart _ routinely shows an initial molehill of an investment
growing to the size of Mount Kilimanjaro in a few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who had the foresight to invest $10,000 in Fidelity
Magellan in 1975 and let that money grow would have had $2,757,950
by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain charts make an especially poor fit with 401(k) plans.
Even though 401(k) plans are based on regular periodic investments,
every piece of literature says that the return on a fund has been
X, Y, or Z over the last three-, five-, or ten-year period _ as
though the plan were funded by a single, onetime investment instead
of a multitude of monthly contributions.
</P>
<P>
   This is no statistical quibble. The return on a single
investment and the return on a series of additions to or
withdrawals from the same investment _ the Installment Effect _ are
quite different.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the effect can mean the difference between a
well-financed old age and one that has you filling out a job
application at Wal-Mart at 84.
</P>
<P>
   A striking example of the Installment Effect can be found in an
unpublished paper with an innocent title, ``Retirement Withdrawal
Using a Calculator.'' It demonstrates just how far astray the
conventions of fixed-return calculation can lead us.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Jaye C. Jarrett, a San Antonio financial adviser with
a degree in mechanical engineering and a passion for crunching
numbers, the paper asks what would happen to a $1 million portfolio
composed of 65 percent large-company stocks and 35 percent fixed
income.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the portfolio withdraws $60,000 from it in the
first year. After that, the annual withdrawal is adjusted upward
for inflation. (To do the calculations quickly, Jarrett and a
computer programmer created a program to help grind out the
numbers. Called WATS, the program employs asset-return data from
Ibbotson Associates and allows the user to input any asset
allocation and see what would happen to it over any number of time
periods. Jarrett chose the 65/35 allocation because it was close to
that of many retirement plans.)
</P>
<P>
   Assuming an average portfolio return of 9.4 percent and an
average inflation rate of 3.75 percent, a conventional retirement
calculator _ like those found on many investment Web sites _ will
compound the investment by 9.4 percent each year, adjust the
withdrawal upward each year to account for average inflation, and
subtract the adjusted withdrawal from the return. Then it does the
same calculation for the next year and keeps on going until it
reaches the end of the time period.
</P>
<P>
   By that way of figuring, a retiree will take out $3,227,954 over
30 years _ $174,504 in the last year _ and will still have
$1,109,990 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the result bears no relationship to what may
actually happen.
</P>
<P>
   Using his software to compute with actual rates of return and
actual rates of inflation, and doing it for every 30-year period
from 1926 to 1998, Jarrett got very different results.
</P>
<P>
   In 21 of the 44 periods, the retiree ran out of money.
</P>
<P>
   How the portfolio performed depended entirely on the year the
retiree left the work force, an event that isn't a choice for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1949, for instance, would have more than
$4.4 million after 30 years. But anyone who retired in any year
after 1959 would have run out of money long before the period was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what most of us would expect, the worst periods to
retire weren't those that included the Great Depression. They were
the sizzling 1960s. The success rate for the 1960s was zero: In
each of the ten starting years, Jarrett's hypothetical retirees ran
out of money well before 30 years, crushed by erratic investment
returns and accelerating inflation. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Peter Lynch suggested that a retiree could
safely withdraw 7 percent a year from an all-stock portfolio. It
seemed like a reasonable idea. After all, if the long-term return
on large-company stocks is more than 10 percent and the retiree
withdraws less, what can go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   When you do the actual calculations over all the historical time
periods from 1926 to 1998, you learn that a constant withdrawal of
$70,000 from an initial portfolio of $1 million will exhaust the
portfolio in 9 of the 44 periods.
</P>
<P>
   This happens for the same reason that a man can drown in a river
with an average depth of one foot _ if he falls in one of the
places where the river is eight feet deep. Some years are good.
Some years are bad. Few are ``average.''
</P>
<P>
   Do the calculations year by year with actual returns and the
results are quite different from the average return for the
period. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone who retired in 1969 with $1 million and withdrew $70,000
a year to the end of 1998 would wind up with $13.9 million,
according to a conventional retirement calculator.
</P>
<P>
   The result seems logical enough, since the actual annualized
return on large-company stocks was 12.6 percent for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Actual experience, however, tells another story. Hit with both
the $70,000 withdrawal and an 8.5 percent loss in the first year,
the portfolio slips below $1 million and never recovers.
</P>
<P>
   With a value of $926,116 at the start of the 1973-74 crash, the
portfolio is down to $484,773 at the end of 1974 but is still
committed to providing $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a withdrawal rate of more than 14 percent. From then on,
it sinks year after year despite the market's incredible rise since
1982. At the end of 1998, the account is overdrawn by $30,000. &QL;

   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   To examine the difference, Jarrett had his software calculate a
new number, the ratio of the market-return result to the
average-return result. That was when he found some good news mixed
with the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett found that when regular withdrawals are made from a
portfolio, the portfolio's return tends to be lower than the
average annualized return for the same investment.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the portfolio will perform worse than the
average-return figure about 60 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as the Spender's Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   When new investments are added to a portfolio, however, the
Installment Effect reverses. Instead of getting a lower return than
the historical annualized figure, there's a good chance of getting
a higher return.
</P>
<P>
   Investing by installments over long periods boosts the rate of
return above what a single, onetime investment would earn over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the Accumulator's Bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose, for instance, that someone invested $2,000 a year from
1969 through 1998. If that money were invested in large stocks, the
Ibbotson figures show that it would earn an average annualized
return of 12.6 percent, accumulating to $544,521.

 &HT;    Jeb Bush tells Dad: Skip speech to Florida Legislature
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Gov. Jeb Bush on Wednesday asked his father
to cancel his March 9 address to the Florida Legislature, blaming
an Orlando senator who alleged that ``some sinister political
motive'' was behind the former president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Announced last week, former President George Bush's scheduled
talk drew immediate criticism in Democratic and some Republican
circles because of its timing, just five days before Jeb Bush's
older brother, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, will try to win Florida's
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Robert Milligan, Florida campaign chairman for
the Texas governor's main GOP rival, Arizona Sen. John McCain, said
the visit smacked of ``political elitism.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Senate Minority Leader Buddy Dyer, a Democrat, wrote the
former president to say he would not attend the March 9 joint
session address because he thought it was ``contrived.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bush relayed his anger over Dyer's refusal in a
phone call to Democratic Sen. Skip Campbell of Tamarac. Soon after,
Bush walked from his suite to Dyer's office, where they spoke in a
10-minute ``cordial'' meeting, the senator said. Finally, Bush
fired off an unusually personal and biting letter to Dyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your cynical assumptions about the timing of his visit could
not be more inaccurate,'' Bush wrote. ``Had I wanted him to
influence the outcome of the Florida primary, I would instead
recommend that he travel to a region of the state where a large
number of Republican votes were at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said plans for his father's visit were confirmed in July,
made at the invitation of House Speaker John Thrasher (R-Orange
Park). However, two e-mail messages, including one as early as July
12, indicate the trip was also being coordinated by Bush's chief of
staff, Sally Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, George W. Bush was the undisputed front-runner for
the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said that March 9 was a good time because
his father had two other Florida meetings that week, the governor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Buddy, this isn't about politics _ not for me _ it's about
family,'' Bush wrote Dyer. ``I love my 75-year-old Dad more than
life itself, and I will not subject him to petty partisan attacks
directed at me, through him, in the golden years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given recent events, and the fact that leadership in the House
and Senate cannot guarantee that my Dad will be treated with the
respect he so deserves ... I have asked him to cancel his
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another letter, Dyer reiterated to Bush that his point
was not to do anything to ``embarrass'' the governor or his father
by encouraging a walk out or a boycott. He planned to not attend,
he said, because ``I simply believe the timing of your father's
speech is inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer later said he thought the controversy was damaging George
W. Bush's campaign, but that the governor couldn't say that
outright. ``They found an out by blaming me.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida could become an important primary contest for the Texas
governor, who McCain badly defeated in New Hampshire, and now faces
another stiff race in South Carolina on Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to get out of this before it blew up in their
face,'' said Florida Democratic Party spokesman Tony Welch. ``I'm
happy our Legislature doesn't become a tool of the Bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thrasher and other Republicans were disappointed and angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts me that the petty and political actions of a few can
ruin something for everyone,'' Thrasher said. ``Manners, politeness
and respect are no longer common commodities in our public actions
and we are all diminished by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have also pointed out that they attended a joint
session four years ago by Democratic President Bill Clinton, then
running for reelection. In turn, Republicans then invited Clinton's
challenger, Bob Dole.

DENVER POLICE CHIEF PUSHED OUT AFTER A SERIES OF PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Mayor Wellington Webb began a search Wednesday for a
new police chief after a series of problems, including the
accidental shooting death of a man in a botched drug raid, led him
to seek the resignation of a 30-year veteran of the force who
served less than 18 months as its chief.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his request late Tuesday after meeting with the
chief, Tom Sanchez, the city's first Hispanic police chief and one
of the few Hispanics leading a big-city police force, Webb said,
``At certain times, due to a convergence of issues, a leadership
change is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who is 50, said Wednesday that he felt ``disappointed
and disenchanted'' over his forced resignation, asserting that the
criticism he had endured over the controversies obscured the work
of a 1,400-member force that was otherwise performing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any catastrophic events,'' the chief said in an
interview Wednesday. ``And I feel we prevented a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sanchez could not escape public condemnation of police
work in several prominent incidents, including the killing of
Ismael Mena, 45, a Mexican immigrant who was shot to death by
police officers last September during a raid on what turned out to
be the wrong house. Mena had been asleep in an upstairs bedroom
after working his shift at a local bottling plant.
</P>
<P>
   Officers involved in the raid, which had as its target the house
next door where drug activity was suspected, were cleared of
wrongdoing. But last Friday a special prosecutor filed perjury
charges against one officer, Joseph Bini, accusing him of providing
false information to a court in obtaining the search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said some of the false information played a role in the
officers' raiding the wrong house.
</P>
<P>
   The chief had also been criticized over several other incidents
that raised questions among citizens and elected officials about
his management style and sensitivity to the people he served.
</P>
<P>
   After the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl on Jan. 31, 1999,
retaining their National Football League championship, the police
used tear gas to disperse vandals when a downtown celebration grew
out of hand. Seven months later the police used tear gas again to
subdue unruly fans after a football game between the University of
Colorado and Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   The police were also accused of using excessive force last
August after officers subdued two people who led them on a chase
through rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Sanchez found his leadership skills under fire when
a police recruit, Ellis Johnson, admitted to a criminal history
that included theft and drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez recommended that Johnson not be hired, but the decision
was overruled by the chief's boss, Fidel Montoya, the city's safety
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said news accounts of various incidents fueled the
public perception that he was not doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   As one example, he cited critical news reports about New Year's
Eve activities in the city, where the downtown area was virtually
lifeless, partly because city officials had warned that parking
would be restricted and rowdy behavior would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``So all I heard was New Year's Eve was dull, too safe,''
Sanchez said. ``As a police officer, how am I supposed to respond
to that? My job was to make sure people who came downtown had a
good time and got home safe, which was the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The final episode occurred last Saturday, a day after Bini was
indicted in the Mena case. With permission from Montoya and Webb's
chief of staff, Sanchez left Denver for Honolulu to attend a
conference of police chiefs from the nation's 55 largest cities.
Television crews appeared at the Denver International Airport and
taped his departure for news broadcasts that Sanchez said made it
seem as if he were on a junket.
</P>
<P>
   He was summoned back to Denver by Webb on Monday, a day before
the conference was scheduled to begin, even though Webb told
reporters that the Hawaii trip played no role in his decision to
ask for the police chief's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Sanchez leaves only a small number of
Hispanics serving as chiefs of large police departments. They
include Joseph J. Santiago in Newark, David Bejarano in San Diego
and Sheriff Lee Baca in Los Angeles County. But Sanchez said he did
not feel sadder because of his Hispanic heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing,'' he said, ``has been difficult.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, still the Democratic Party's
marquee attraction and chief fund-raiser, is soliciting millions of
dollars in soft money donations to pay for an aggressive,
party-financed advertising campaign that will begin immediately
after the Democratic presidential nominee emerges from the primary
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements being planned are similar to the
controversial and much criticized ``issue ads'' in the 1996
election that were financed with $46 million in Democratic National
Committee soft money, the large unrestricted donations from
corporations, unions and individuals that political parties are
allowed to collect for so-called party-building efforts. The issue
ads were thinly veiled Clinton-Gore spots that critics said
violated a federal law prohibiting party-financed advertisements
that advocate election of a specific candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Commission considered a complaint
challenging the legality of the ads, but took no action. The early
use of issue ads were considered instrumental in establishing an
early lead for the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The president's central fund-raising role is part of a
Democratic plan formulated over the last year to try to counter
Republican financial advantages. Democrats are confident that their
agenda is more appealing than the Republicans' and want to make
sure they have the money to advertise it on the airwaves as soon as
the compressed primary season ends in March.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to appear at 35 to 40 Democratic National
Committee fund-raising events in the first three months of this
year that are expected to raise $20 million. Clinton, who is in
Texas for three fund-raising events Wednesday, has kept up a steady
schedule of big-money appearances to underwrite an early spring
advertising campaign and other party efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan is based on the assumption that the two
Democratic presidential candidates _ Vice President Al Gore and
former Sen. Bill Bradley _ will exhaust all of their resources in
the flurry of primaries in early March. Democratic officials expect
Gore to be their nominee and assume that Gov. George W. Bush will
survive to win the Republican nomination, despite the unexpectedly
strong challenge from Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic committee is concerned that Gore will be broke
while Bush will have millions of dollars left in the bank to get a
jump on general election campaigning this spring. By underwriting
party advertisements with soft money, the Democratic Party could
help keep Gore's campaign message on the air.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``What the president and I tell donors,'' said Edward G.
Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic Party, ``is that we
need the money to be competitive in the period from April 1 to Aug.
15.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that the party expected to match its
effort of 1996, when Clinton began an early series of television
advertisements that helped bury the Republican nominee, Bob Dole,
long before the fall campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential election cycle, the Democrats spent
$46.5 million on early issue ads that prominently featured
President Clinton and hope to nearly match that sum this year. The
Republican National Committee also ran issue ads on behalf of Dole,
though the Republicans spent only about $18 million and their ads
began much later.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Backus, the Democratic committee's press secretary,
said that the money that the party was raising this winter will be
used for a variety of activities. The party is building an
extensive computerized database of voters, establishing a presence
on the Internet and planning broad grass-roots efforts in the 15
states the party considers presidential toss-ups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to use all of the weapons in the arsenal,''
Backus said. ``This is not money exclusively going toward issue
ads. It is going toward Democrats winning in 2000 and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell said it would be impossible for the Democrats to ``match
the Republicans dollar for dollar; we can't.'' Rendell added, ``But
we cannot be off the air, we cannot be without a presence, we
cannot be without a response in those critical months.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials are delighted that Bush has found himself
in a scrap with McCain and believe he will come to regret his heavy
spending on early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush spent $37 million last year and came in second
in New Hampshire,'' Rendell said in a telephone interview from
McAllen, Texas, where Clinton held two fund-raisers Wednesday.
``It's clear proof that the people with the most money don't
necessarily win.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats each complained to the Federal
Election Commission in 1996 that the other party had violated the
law on using soft money to pay for candidate advocacy advertising.
But the commission ruled that the law was ambiguous and declined to
take action against either party. The Justice Department, after
months of study, said it found no grounds to appoint an independent
counsel to investigate the fund raising or spending practices of
the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some of the same consultants who designed the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign ads also created the party issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1996, Clinton will be the Democratic Party's strongest
money magnet. In 1998, he raised $19 million for the party; last
year he harvested $22 million, despite the impeachment trial and
the 10-week war in the Balkans, which forced the cancellation of a
number of fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been aided until recently in his fund-raising
efforts by the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Gore. But
with both of them fully engaged in raising money for their own
campaigns, Clinton has had to step up the pace of his party
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, one Democratic fund-raiser who insisted on
anonymity said, Clinton struggled to raise the kind of sums that
the party had come to expect from him. Indeed, the president was
asked to do several extra fund-raisers just to keep pace with the
party's goals, this fund-raiser said.
</P>
<P>
   But late in January, after Vice President Al Gore's victory in
the Iowa caucuses, the haul from Clinton's fund-raising appearances
returned to normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while there, it looked pretty desperate,'' the
fund-raiser said. ``As Gore has done better, we're getting some of
that old momentum back.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides say that Clinton does not consider fund raising a chore,
but rather his obligation as leader of the Democratic Party. And
the fact that he is not now running for office _ for the first time
in 24 years _ has clearly had a liberating effect on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a good time,'' he said Tuesday night at a big-donor
affair at the Hay Adams Hotel near the White House. ``I feel like
the cat that ate the canary some days.''

BRADLEY URGES $80 BILLION PLAN TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BRADLEY-EXCERPTS) 
(js) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSITY CITY, Mo. _ Declaring that the quality of education
in America unfairly depended on the wealth of the district, former
Sen. Bill Bradley unveiled an $80 billion education proposal
Wednesday that he said would improve the quality of teachers, hold
schools accountable for student performance and give parents the
safety valve of taking their children out of inferior public
schools for better ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today to say that we have separate and unequal when
it comes to the quality of education in America,'' Bradley said at
a school just 35 miles from where he grew up and attended public
schools. ``Education may be the great equalizer, but when schools
are unequal _ when poor children get an inferior education to
wealthy children, when minorities get a worse education than
non-minorities _ we are often preparing them for a life of
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator from New Jersey also criticized his opponent
for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vice President Al Gore,
for being part of an administration that Bradley said had increased
the number of teachers without insuring that they were highly
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before about 1,000 people at the University City High
School gymnasium in this St. Louis suburb, Bradley proposed
doubling the financing to $16 billion a year for Title I, the
federal aid program for schools in poor communities. He said he
would require teachers to pass a test in the subjects they teach or
to have majored in that area. And he said he would triple federal
money for charter schools, to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has not focused on education with the fervor he has
lavished on issues like health care, gun control and race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking Wednesday at an early childhood center in
Southfield, Mich., talked about his education proposals and faulted
Bradley for not speaking out sooner about education. ``There are
sharp differences between his approach to education and mine,''
said Gore, who has outlined plans for universal pre-care, testing
teachers, providing grants to train teachers and improving failing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen months have passed in this presidential campaign and
three states have had elections,'' the vice president said, ``and
only today has Senator Bradley made his first speech'' about
education.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley struck back at Gore in a news conference after his
speech Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, he's saying something that is not true,'' Bradley
said. ``It's defying reality to say that I haven't talked about
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bradley said, he had waited until now, as a crucial
series of primaries on March 7 and 14 approaches, to tie elements
of his education proposals together into one big package so that
his ideas would be fresh on voters' minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is when the country is actually paying attention to what
someone who's running for president would do,'' he said. ``And I
think it is an important part of reaching out to Democratic
constituents and America to defining what this candidacy is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley promised that he would probably present more policy
proposals in the weeks to come about major issues of concern to
Democratic voters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He emphasized the need to improve race relations in speeches at
a black church in Queens on Sunday, a town hall meeting in Tampa,
Fla., on Monday and a predominantly black college in Columbia,
S.C., on Tuesday. Along the way he criticized Gore; Gov. Jeb Bush
of Florida, a Republican, and the two leading Republican
presidential candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John
McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Bradley plans to talk to Los Angeles voters about
gun violence. And on Friday, he will talk in Seattle about women's
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as the backdrop for his speech on education, Bradley
chose a racially and economically diverse school district that
counts Tennessee Williams as its most famous son. The student body,
however, is more than 80 percent black.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said the keystone to education was the quality of the
nation's teachers, not class size or per-pupil spending _ offering
a different emphasis from that of the Clinton-Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   By requiring teachers to pass state-administered tests or to
major in the subjects they teach, Bradley said, he would complement
an earlier plan that would add 600,000 new teachers over the next
decade and offer to forgive student loans for college graduates who
decided to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'll give schools that money, but I'll tell you, there
are strings attached,'' he said. ``I will hold those schools that
receive federal money accountable for their results. And I expect
them to show results.''

<P>
   As anonymous assaults on major Web sites continued Wednesday,
computer vandals crippled a large online brokerage operation and a
media site. The Justice Department pledged to find those
responsible, but computer experts questioned whether any defenses
could easily be deployed against the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of what increasingly appeared to be a well
planned and tightly coordinated siege by a single individual or
group, the impact of the attacks grew. In addition to damaging
commerce at the sites that have become targets, the attacks slowed
traffic in some portions of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, while pledging a vigorous pursuit
of the persons responsible, also acknowledged that they remained
unknown to authorities, having well covered their electronic
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned e-commerce companies across the Net _ many of whose
publicly traded shares dropped in value Wednesday as investors
tried to understand the implications _ began taking extraordinary
measures to protect their Web sites from becoming targets.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, computer security experts said the complex, anonymous
nature of the attacks made them difficult to trace or stop.
</P>
<P>
   Security experts said the attacks appear to have been weeks or
months in the planning, since they require clandestinely loading
software onto dozens, if not hundreds, of computers around the
Internet. When those programs were activated this week, the host
computers were transformed into platforms for launching the
attacks. In almost all cases, experts said, the owners of the
computers never knew _ and still may not know _ that their machines
had become cogs in the attack machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to believe there are thousands of these tools out
there waiting for the launch button to be pushed,'' said David M.
Remnitz, chief executive of IFsec LLC, a New York-based information
security company. Suggesting that the attackers already had the
infrastructure in place for the attacks to continue indefinitely,
he added, ``I don't see any reason why they would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the FBI had opened a criminal investigation, but she
and bureau officials acknowledged that they had no strong leads and
that they had heard no credible claims of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, we are not aware of the motives behind these
attacks'' the attorney general said, ``but they appear to be
intended to interfere with and to disrupt legitimate electronic
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Ans they have disrupted the Internet as a whole in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Keynote Systems, a company that measures the reliability and
performance of Web sites, reported Wednesday that during the
attacks, it took 8 seconds to call up a typical Web site's home
page, nearly twice the time required during the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While government and computer industry sources continued to
acknowledge Wednesday that they could not be certain that the same
group or individual was behind the attacks, they said the nature of
the assaults seemed too similar to be coincidental. In each case,
the targeted Web site was so flooded with meaningless data that the
company's computers became paralyzed and unable to serve customers.
</P>
<P>
   What began with an attack on the popular Yahoo portal site
Monday, spread Wednesday to Zdnet.com, a media site, and Etrade,
one of the largest online brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one other major site appears to have been targeted.
Although the Internet media company CNet declined to comment
Wednesday, its network service provider reported detecting an
attack on the company's sites Tuesday afternoon but managed to
provide enough of a defense to avert crippling damages.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Di Chiro, spokesman for Etrade, based in Menlo Park,
Calif., said the company planned to deal ``one on one'' with
customers who asserted they lost money by not being able to access
the site to place trades.
</P>
<P>
   Di Chiro said following the assaults Monday on Yahoo and Tuesday
on Buy.com, a retail site, and Ebay.com, an auction site, Etrade
began discussing what measures might be taken to defend the site
against a similar attack. Although he said unnamed measures were
taken, the company was unable to prevent the attack. But the
company did have several contingency plans in place, including
directing visitors to an alternate Web site, which Etrade
advertised over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that the attacks have been difficult to counter is
that finding the perpetrators and cutting them off requires a
cooperative, concerted effort between the targeted Web site and its
network service provider, the company that connects the site's own
computers to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vixie, senior vice president of Internet services for
AboveNet, a network service provider whose clients include eBay and
CNet, said the attackers appeared to be have installed widely
available software that, when secretly planted on other people's
computers, flood the target site with useless streams of
information and instructions to do meaningless tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said AboveNet was hit with as much as 800 megabits of
``spurious traffic,'' a level that could cost the company $400,000
a month to transport if it continued at consistent levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would cost us $400,000 a month just because some teen-ager
with a $300 Linux box doesn't like one of our customers,'' said.
``It makes us a little testy.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier incarnation of this type of attack emerged two years
ago, but new illicit software has circulated that makes them easier
to launch and more difficult to defend against. The attacks
themselves have intensified in the last nine months, striking not
just the well publicized major sites, but also smaller sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Emergency Response Team, or CERT, a federally
financed computer security organization based at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, along with private computer security
firms have released numerous warnings in recent months describing
the attacks and suggesting ways to combat them.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dick, chief of the FBI's Computer Investigations and
Operations Section, acknowledged that tools for this type of
attack, known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack, are so
readily available on the Web that the attacks could have been
launched by a 15-year-old. ``It doesn't take a great deal of
sophistication,'' Dick said. ``In a relatively short of period time
an unsophisticated intruder or unsophisticated computer user can
take advantage of not only the U.S. government, but also
e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, purposely disrupting computer networks is a
felony punishable for first-time offenders with a jail term of up
to five years and a $250,000 fine, plus assessment of damages. But
Dick repeatedly said the FBI had no hope of solving the crime
without ``help from the entire community'' _ meaning primarily the
various Internet service providers, or ISPs, whose servers were
used to pass the data from the attacker to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with FBI to track the source of the attacks,''
Vixie said, echoing similar statements from officials at Yahoo and
Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said there were several measures sites could take to
protect themselves, including increasing their capacity to handle
traffic, using operating systems that can sift out malicious
traffic and installing the latest security patches that prevent the
sites from being commandeered to launch attacks on other sites.
</P>
<P>
   But he also added: ``This level of alertness is not sustainable.
We are hoping that there will be a technological or legal solution
so we can go back to building our network rather than defending
against attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   AboveNet and other Internet service providers have begun
filtering out suspicious traffic, but that, they said, is an
approach that must be continuously adjusted as attackers change
their means of assault.

U.S. HOPES TO EXPAND SANCTIONS AGAINST SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an effort to tighten pressure on the Yugoslav
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, the Clinton administration said
Wednesday that it supported a plan to expand some sanctions against
Belgrade while allowing resumption of some commercial airline
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The most effective sanction so far, according to many officials,
has been the little-publicized tool of refusing travel visas to
Milosevic's political and financial supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan of tougher sanctions announced by Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, the number of associates of Milosevic
officially barred from traveling to the United States and the
nations of the European Union would be increased from the current
600, perhaps as much as 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also backed a plan, to be presented to the
European Union's general affairs council in Brussels on Monday, to
strengthen enforcement of a ban on banking transfers from
Yugoslavia to European capitals, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state made the announcement at a joint
appearance here with the British foreign secretary, Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
   In response to requests from the struggling opposition parties
in Serbia, the ban on flights by airlines of European Union
countries would be suspended for six months. If free and fair
elections were not held in Yugoslavia within six months from the
lifting of the ban, the concession on the flights would be
``automatically'' withdrawn, State Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   How to undermine Milosevic, who has been indicted by the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, while unifying the
squabbling factions of the opposition has been a subject of
considerable debate within the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Albright has let it be known in recent weeks that one of her
most fervent hopes for the remainder of her term is to see the end
of Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   A recent round of political killings in Belgrade has encouraged
some administration officials to speculate that Milosevic's regime
may implode. The Yugoslav defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, was
shot and killed on Monday as he was eating dinner in a Belgrade
soccer club. Last month, the Serbian paramilitary leader and close
associate of Milosevic, Zeljko Raznatovic, was shot dead eating
dinner at the Intercontinental Hotel in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of these killings and whether they were masterminded
by Milosevic is still unclear. But what does seem clear is that the
dominant black-market economy in Serbia and fights over who
controls it are resulting in increased tensions within ruling
circles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In that respect, officials said, the visa ban on close
associates of Milosevic _ many of them accustomed to high living in
European capitals and on checking up on their foreign investments _
has been most effective. Some of these associates appear to be
complaining that Milosevic's rule is hurting rather than benefiting
them.
</P>
<P>
   By tightening the screws with the tougher travel ban, the
administration hopes that further cracks will emerge in the
Belgrade government.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, the administration had rejected proposals by
European countries to lift the ban on civilian airline flights to
Belgrade. Such an easing would open the door to lifting other
sanctions, administration officials argued.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said Wednesday that the airline flights would be
permitted because they had been requested by the opposition
parties. The secretary has met twice in recent months with leaders
of the Serbian opposition, and her aides are in daily contact with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are making very clear that the sanctions are going to
be targeted, expanded and tightened against those from the regime
that are not allowing the people of Serbia to express their will,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and the United States have comparable
regulations banning bank transfers from Belgrade, but enforcement
has been lax in Europe, the State Department said. The European
Union had pledged to increase its staffing to monitor and stop such
transactions, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But how effective these banking sanctions would be remained an
open question. ``It's like squeezing jello,'' one official said.

FBI'S FILE ON COLUMNIST IS RELEASED

<P>
   For four decades, Murray Kempton was known to New York City
newspaper readers as the bicycle-riding, jazz-loving, pipe-smoking
newspaper columnist whose bon mots and independent views filled the
pages of The New York World-Telegram, The New York Post and New
York Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   But to J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation from 1924 to 1972, Kempton was a ``rat,'' a ``snake''
and a ``stinker.''
</P>
<P>
   From the early 1950s to the late 1960s, the FBI monitored
Kempton's columns, producing a 194-page file. APBNews.com, a Web
site that focuses on crime news, made the file public on Monday
after the FBI complied with its Freedom of Information Act request.
</P>
<P>
   The file reveals that Kempton's generally liberal views first
aroused FBI scrutiny in the late 1950s and earned the particular
wrath of Hoover. One memo by an FBI official noted that Kempton
``has belittled Bureau and Director in his columns.'' Another noted
that he was on the agency's ``Do Not Contact'' list, which detailed
who was not friendly to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the agency was most intent on gathering material about
his membership in the Communist Party in the 1930s. The file has
material through 1969, when Kempton raised money for the Black
Panther Party. In a 1969 memo, the agency noted that Kempton was
``working for the Black Panthers raising funds through personal
contacts.'' (Four years later, Kempton wrote a book about his
relationship with the Black Panthers that confirmed his
fund-raising efforts, ``The Briar Patch: The People of the State of
New York vs. Lumumba Shakur, et al.'')
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's handwritten notations _ followed by his handwritten
initials, which indicated he had read the document _ appear
throughout the file. On one memo, Hoover wrote, ``When a newspaper
hires a snake like Kempton they can expect the worst.'' The same
memo referred to Kempton's new job with The New York World-Telegram
and The Sun: ``I am surprised that Scripps-Howard are taking on
this rat.''
</P>
<P>
   In another memo detailing the content and political thrust of
Kempton's newspaper columns, Hoover's neat handwriting appears
again: ``He is a real stinker.'' (``Real'' is underlined.)
</P>
<P>
   Kempton, who died in 1997, read his file in 1989 after learning
of its existence from Natalie Robins, the author of ``Alien Ink:
The F.B.I.'s War on Freedom of Expression'' (Rutgers University
Press).
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 Newsday column, Kempton wrote that as far as he could
tell nothing had ever come of his dossier. ``My career's
vicissitudes have all been of my own doing,'' he said, ``and my
malice toward Hoover, which was always small, and his malice toward
me, which seems to have been outsized, were alike inconsequential
for help or harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Rosenfeld, a former historian for the FBI, said that the
report's relative brevity indicated that the agency did not
consider him a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he got 194 pages in total, that meant the FBI wasn't that
interested in him,'' she said. ``If they are really interested, you
might get 194 sections.''

ARAB OFFICIALS CONCERNED BY FLARE-UP IN LEBANON

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Arab officials expressed alarm Tuesday that the
violence in Lebanon is spilling out of what had been accepted as
routine sparring between Israel and the militia backed by Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian foreign minister, Amr Moussa, just back from a
brief visit to Syria, said that Israel's late-night bombing of
three power plants and other targets east and north of Beirut was
illegal and ``very dangerous'' for peace prospects. Egypt has been
trying to shore up the talks between Israel and Palestinians and
between Israel and Syria; both sets of talks are in suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Israeli strikes Monday, most Arab diplomats had
treated with relative indulgence the two weeks of limited fighting
within Israel's self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Moussa was quoted as saying that the situation in the
region was ``uncomfortable.'' But after Israel's attack a few hours
later, he criticized Israel forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilians in Lebanon are no different from civilians in
Israel,'' he said in Cairo. ``Israel can't talk about protection
for its citizens and civilian facilities without understanding that
Lebanese civilians have similar rights to protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Lebanon has claimed the lives of five Israeli
soldiers in the past two weeks and a sixth soldier Tuesday. More
than a dozen Lebanese were wounded as a result of the Israeli
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the secretary-general of the Arab League in
Cairo, also reacted strongly, calling the Israeli attack ``a
criminal act that has exceeded all limits.''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting is deepening at a vulnerable moment in the peace
process, which appeared to be gaining steam over the past few
months, but then sputtered.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four years of inaction, Syria and Israel resumed
negotiations late last year on ending their half-century state of
war. But after three meetings, hopes for a swift agreement
evaporated. The talks have been suspended since mid-January. Talks
between Israel and Palestinian leaders also stalled this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon and Israel have not been talking, although Ehud Barak,
the Israeli prime minister, has said he wants to pull Israeli
troops out of the security zone in southern Lebanon by summer.
Until the air strikes, the fighting in south Lebanon, had not
raised alarms among Arab officials.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has some 35,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is considered to
control the Hezbollah militia, in part because Syrian forces
control its weapons and supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   After the latest Syrian-Israeli talks ended on a sour note, the
Hezbollah attacks on Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon and
Israel's retaliatory raids were assumed by many diplomats in the
Middle East to be related to the skirmishing at the bargaining
table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an escalation with the intent to reactivate the peace
process,'' said Tahseen Bashir, a military analyst in Cairo and a
former Egyptian diplomat. ''But it could get out of hand.''

TALKS STALL AT BOEING, AND ENGINEERS GO ON STRIKE

<P>
   More than 16,000 engineers and technical workers at the Boeing
Co. went on strike Wednesday after contract negotiations broke down
over wages and health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, only the second in the last 56 years for the
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace union,
was not expected to hurt Boeing's near-term ability to deliver
planes.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were clearly skittish. Shares of Boeing dropped
$1.8125 a share, to close at $39. The Dow Jones industrial average
plunged 258.44 points Wednesday, but analysts believed that
Boeing's setback was heightened by investor angst over its union
squabble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing was a down stock on Tuesday in a weak market,'' said
Sam Pearlstein, a research analyst with ING Barings. ``It's
somewhat of a surprise that investors are this nervous about the
strike, given that it shouldn't hurt Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also noted that the walkout could hardly be called a
surprise. Boeing, which has about 197,000 employees overall, has
been in tense negotiations with the union, which represents 22,000
engineers and technical workers at the company, since last October.
A strike had become increasingly possible during the last few
weeks, when the two groups could not agree on several key points,
including bonus pay and reductions in health care coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's engineers have wanted guaranteed wage increases and a
bonus plan similar to the one the company granted last year for its
machinists. As a group, the machinists should receive bonus pay of
about $4,400 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The machinists received a nice bonus,'' said Charles
Bofferding, the executive director of the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace. ``But we're supposed to be
happy with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Boeing believes that it has conceded to several of
the union's demands. The company has proposed to set up three funds
for merit raises. The engineers would receive increases averaging 8
percent during the first year of the contract, while technical
workers would receive about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not offered a bonus in either of our two proposals,''
said Peter Conte, a spokesman for Boeing. ``But we're offering to
improve their salaries through the salary adjustment funds. About
97 percent of the engineers received a salary adjustment last year
through the existing fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had not taken a strike by Boeing's engineers as a
serious threat to the company. Boeing's engineers are paid $63,000
annually while the technical workers are paid about $45,000. The
union's last strike against Boeing lasted for only a day, leaving
many analysts to believe that this walkout would also be short
lived.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be the case, the engineer's union has gained
strength among its members in recent months. Six months ago, only
30 percent of Boeing's engineers and technical workers were members
of the union, but the count has since climbed to 63 percent,
according to Bofferding.
</P>
<P>
   Union members were also vocal at Wednesday's walkout. Many of
them left the Boeing offices chanting, ``Take back Boeing. We are
Boeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bofferding predicted late Wednesday that 80 percent of the
union's membership would honor the strike, but it was unclear how
many engineers had actually left their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts remained confident that Boeing could maintain its
production of planes for several weeks or longer if its engineers
remained on strike. But it was unclear from Boeing and the
engineers union just how long the strike would continue.
Negotiations between the two groups have yet to be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The machinists negotiated with the company when they were at a
weak time,'' he said, and Boeing complied with their wishes.

WOODS AWED BY HIS STREAK, AND HIS OPPONENTS ARE AWED BY HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA JOLLA, Calif. _ At 6:42 a.m., Tiger Woods counted nine
television camera crews waiting for him as he teed off for
Wednesday's Buick Invitational Pro-Am. Later in the round, Woods
looked up and saw a news helicopter flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
   This was just the pro-am. How much attention will Woods draw
once the tournament starts?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Woods watch, which will continue Thursday, as the
Buick Invitational begins at Torrey Pines' North and South golf
courses. After winning his last six starts on the PGA Tour, Woods
is the hottest name in sports, and his arrival in the San Diego
area has even the skateboarders and surfers talking about golf.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' streak equals the second longest in history, matching Ben
Hogan, who won six consecutive starts in 1948. Byron Nelson had 11
consecutive victories in 1945, a record that has long been
considered untouchable, but one that Woods continues to chase.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods' incredible comeback Monday at Pebble Beach, when he
overcame a seven-stroke deficit with seven holes to play, even some
of his peers were in awe. Much of the talk at the driving range
Wednesday centered around Woods' bid to win seven in a row. His
fellow players were hoping to win one in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I really can't imagine winning six in a row,'' said Steve
Pate, one of Woods' teammates on last year's U.S. Ryder Cup team.
``It's not possible for most of us. He's just better than everyone
else. It's great for golf. People have been screaming for years,
asking when we're getting the next superstar. Well, here he is.
He's creating a lot of interest. A lot of people will be rooting
for him to keep winning. And then there will be the other side that
will want to see him get knocked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the microscope that Woods will be under at Torrey Pines,
there are reasons to like his chances. He is the defending
champion, and he won the Buick Invitational last year despite
trailing by nine strokes after the second round. Woods barely made
the cut here last year, and he appeared to be out of contention.
But Saturday, he set the course record at the South course with a
10-under-par 62, another example of Woods having something extra
when he needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Only 4 of the top 20 players in the world ranking are in this
week's field _ Woods, Davis Love III, Mark O'Meara and Phil
Mickelson. There is no David Duval, no Ernie Els, no Vijay Singh,
no Nick Price, no Jesper Parnevik and no Tom Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   Woods looked relaxed and confident Wednesday, playing on a
course where he has won both as a professional and as an amateur.
Woods has an 11:12 a.m. local tee time Thursday, playing with Fred
Couples and Billy Mayfair. Does Woods think he can win 11
consecutive tour starts? He did not rule it out. He never rules out
winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous task I have ahead of me if I'm going to be
the one,'' Woods said of the streak. ``I think I can do it if I
play well, keep making putts, and more importantly, have luck on my
side. There is a chance. But the chances are very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Any other player would love to be the streak-stopper, but Woods'
run has earned him even more respect in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has put any doubters or critics to shame,'' said Brad
Faxon, a six-time winner on tour. ``What we've seen him do is just
as impressive as when Jack did it, or when Tom Watson did it, or
when Johnny Miller did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us thought it was possible to win six in
a row, especially in this day in age. And he has done it on all
types of courses, against all kinds of fields. It's not like he
picks and chooses tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   If Woods is in contention Sunday afternoon, he will face the
pressure of the streak, while his opponents will face the pressure
of trying to beat him. The last official tour event that Woods
entered that he did not win was last August at the Sprint
International. Will the streak finally end this weekend? Everyone
in the field was eager to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any tournament now, it's almost like you want to know,
`Where's Tiger?''' Faxon said. ``Everyone would love to be the one
to take him down, but first, you have to get in contention. A lot
of exposure has been brought to the PGA Tour. So in the long run,
the streak is good for everybody. And it has definitely been good
for him.''

<P>
   Steve Forbes' withdrawal from the presidential race _ after
having spent $69 million of his own money on his two runs for the
White House _ was heartbreakingly clear in a photo on his campaign
Web site Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With snowflakes falling and his aides at his sides, Forbes is
shown gamely walking through the cold. The caption says that Forbes
``has canceled all of his previously scheduled'' events for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   So ends one of the most expensive personal odysseys for the
presidency. Forbes spent around $32 million of his own money in
this campaign _ on top of the $37.4 million he spent on his failed
1996 effort. His current spending, along with some $5 million he
received in donations in this campaign, gained him between two and
19 Republican delegates and no primary victories.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' spending puts him almost on par with the Texas
businessman Ross Perot, who spent a total of almost $71 million on
his 1992 and 1996 Reform Party bids. And, on a per delegate basis,
it brings him into competition with John C. Connally, the former
governor of Texas who raised $13.7 million in 1980 on his failed
Republican effort and won only a single convention delegate.
</P>
<P>
   As Forbes returned to his New Jersey home Wednesday, his aides
were scrambling to cancel the 14 live radio appearances and the
three television interviews his campaign had set up for the day.
After midnight Wednesday, just after he came in third in Tuesday's
Delaware primary, Forbes had met with his closest campaign adviser,
William Dal Col, and the two decided to end Forbes' second
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very straightforward,'' Dal Col said in an interview
Wednesday. ``We realized it was time to go. We talked last night
and we basically discussed how to get from here to there. And the
answer was that there wasn't really an opportunity in light of
Delaware. It was hard to see how we could put it together to get
the nomination and, if not, it was time to leave the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we did,'' said Dal Col.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Forbes halted a quest for the presidency that began
in 1996, when he first challenged Bob Dole for the nomination, and
ended in Delaware, where Forbes' 20 percent showing in a state
primary he had won in 1996 gained him no delegates to the
Republican convention and illustrated how his campaign had begun to
falter. His last days in Delaware were spent on a four-day bus tour
talking to high school students, too young to vote, and holding
such events as an impromptu visit to a bakery where fewer than two
dozen people greeted him.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' campaign began to unravel after having scored a strong
showing in the January Iowa caucuses, where he came in second to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. But, in Iowa, Sen. John McCain of
Arizona was not running in Iowa, making that an easy race. In the
tougher New Hampshire primary, Forbes was unable to capitalize on
his success in Iowa and he took only 13 percent of the vote, just a
single point above his 1996 showing there and far behind McCain,
who won the race, and Bush, who came in second.
</P>
<P>
   And polls were already beginning to show that Forbes was still
stuck in the single digit range in such important upcoming primary
states as Michigan and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In the analysis of why Forbes' effort failed, both those inside
the Forbes campaign and Republican observers say Forbes' anti-tax,
anti-abortion message may have been too abstract and too
issue-oriented at a time when polls say that voters are looking
more at candidates' personal characters than exact messages. In
response to the Clinton White House scandals, polls show that
voters are interested in tales of character-building and on the
perception that their candidate could beat the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in a robust economy, voters are less interested in
issues of drastic changes in the tax code than in the character of
the next person in the White House. Even Forbes, in an interview
Wednesday with NBC News, his only one of the day, acknowledged as
much: ``While I did have a strong message, I did not want to have
the fate of the messenger get in the way of the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col put it this way: ``While a lot of people may have liked
our message, it didn't translate into votes. You have a healthy
economy and not the anger you had in 1992 and 1996. With the
Clinton White House, issues of morality and character were
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``This became a race more about biography and character and
Steve's strength is as an issue candidate. Voters were not looking
at Steve as the type of person they wanted as president at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dal Col said it was hard for Forbes, the son of a millionaire
publisher, to compete with the war record of McCain and the legacy
of the Bush family. ``If it was a biography fight,'' Dal Col said,
``we couldn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, a Republican strategist and Washington lobbyist,
said, ``Fairly or unfairly, Steve does not come across as
presidential. It's hard for the public to envision him in the Oval
Office. He's smart and has lots of ideas, but doesn't fit the
role.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Forbes has never held office. In his career he has
had only one boss, his late father Malcolm, from whom he inherited
a publishing empire that forms the basis of his $440 million net
worth. Also his conservative message evolved very little, while his
rivals adopted many of Forbes' anti-tax themes, drawing votes away.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Galen, a Republican strategist, said that Forbes' anti-tax
message was ``so old it was growing whiskers.'' Many of the
conservative voters that Forbes targeted, Galen said, felt that
Bush reflected their views and had a better chance of winning the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Forbes has ruled out running for the U.S. Senate in
New Jersey. ``He flat out has no interested in the Senate
whatsoever,'' said Dal Col.

<P>
   BOLOGNA, Italy _ In the 1971 film ``La Mortadella,'' Sophia
Loren played a feisty would-be immigrant who is arrested by U.S.
Customs officials in New York for refusing to surrender a 20-pound
mortadella, the traditional pork sausage of Bologna. A cult classic
in Italy, the satire was aimed at what the director, Mario
Monicelli, called the ``authoritarian rigidity'' of American
society.
</P>
<P>
   After an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy in 1967,
Italian pork products were banned in the United States for decades.
Mortadella, however, has finally been freed. The U.S. Department of
Agriculture announced in the Federal Register last month that as of
Wednesday it would lift certain restrictions on pork and pork
products coming into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the mortadella ban had been greeted with incredulous
outrage and its lifting three decades later is a keenly felt
triumph _ even more than when the Prada yacht ``Luna Rossa'' beat
``AmericaOne''last weekend to become the first Italian sailboat to
qualify for the America's Cup finals since 1992. To
mortadella-makers in Bologna, in particular, the about-face by the
United States represents moral vindication after years of
injustice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than unfair, the American ban seemed crazy,
absurd,'' said Gianni Ballotti, 45, a floor manager at the Alcisa
pork factory in Bologna, where a picture of John Paul II blessing
an 80-pound mortadella at the Vatican in 1995 hangs near the
entrance. ``We send mortadella to countries all over the world, but
not to the United States?''
</P>
<P>
   The loosening of American regulations is partly a testimony to
Italian persuasion (and that of their American lobbyists). But it
is also the result of a striking role reversal in world trade.
Thirty years ago, the United States stood as a citadel of rigorous
veterinary and health regulations that kept many foreign imports
humbly at bay. Now, the United States, under attack all over the
world for exporting genetically-modified food and hormone-treated
beef, is pleading for understanding _ and open markets _ from a
haughty and intransigent European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to allow imports of mortadella, a delicacy that
costs more than twice as much as the American processed meat sold
as bologna, will not greatly effect U.S. pork producers. (In 1999,
Americans consumed 332 million pounds of domestic bologna.) But
U.S. officials, who recently signed a Veterinary Equivalency
Agreement with their European counterparts that recognizes foreign
sanitation procedures, hope that their magnanimity on mortadella
will help advance negotiations in more contentious areas, including
hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see decisions made in Europe on the import of
meat and meat products that are based solely on science, rather
than politics or protectionism,'' explained Elizabeth Berry,
agricultural counselor at the U.S. embassy in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   To some Italians, however, the American eagerness to rely on
science and, more precisely, a mutual recognition of domestic
research and testing, is based as much on expediency as reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has always hidden consumer protectionism behind the
mask of sanitary demands,'' Rino Brini, 80, president of the Alcisa
pork factory, which he co-founded in 1946, explained with a cynical
shrug. ``This is about trade wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Brini keeps on his wall a framed photograph of an Alcisa
mortadella posed against the backdrop of Arizona's Monument Valley;
he had smuggled the banned sausage into the United States in 1987.
Those small acts of defiance are common enough that the Armed
Forces Network regularly runs warnings to Americans overseas not to
bring home Cuban cigars or Italian mortadella, which like most meat
products will continue to be seized from individual travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Mortadella-makers look upon American-made bologna the way French
champagne-producers view Ripple wine _ with disgusted pity. ``I
couldn't even try it,'' Brini said. ``It looks so sad.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Pliny wrote that the Emperor Augustus liked mortadella. Written
recipes for mortadella, which is made from ground shoulder of pork
dotted with bits of lard, date back to the 16th century in Bologna.
Mortadella can trace its roots in America at least as far back as
the early 1700s, when a French Dominican missionary, Jean Baptiste
Labat, wrote to friends that he had sampled bologna sausages in the
New World, noting that, ``nevertheless, they tasted better in their
country of origin.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Mariani, author of The Dictionary of American Food and
Drink states that the first time the word ``bologna'' was used in
print in the United States was in 1850. Pamela Goyan Kittler, a
California-based cultural nutritionist who specializes in ethnic
foods, said the first samples must have been introduced by Italian
immigrants, but added, ``It was probably the German immigrant
sausage makers, especially Oscar Mayer in the early 1900s, who
developed the technology to produce sliced packaged meats, who
really popularized bologna nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of the current mortadella ban was made possible by
the Veterinary Equivalency Agreement, which the United States began
negotiating soon after the European Union imposed its first ban on
hormone-treated beef in 1989. It was also helped by a 1997 decision
by the U.S. government that permits individual regions of a country
to export their local products if that region has been found to be
free of animal diseases. Until now, all Italian pork products were
banned because Sardinia still showed traces of African swine fever.
Bologna, and the rest of mainland Italy, however, has been free of
it for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as no products from Sardinia are used, then mortadella
can be imported,'' said Masoud Malik, a senior veterinarian for the
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. He personally witnessed
Bologna manufacturers testing to ensure that their mortadella was
dry-heated to the required 69 degrees Celsius required by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   As a Muslim, however, he does not eat pork, and could not sample
the mortadella, which struck Italian producers as tragic.
</P>
<P>
   But the path to mortadella's legalization was also paved in part
by the effort to free Parma hams, which were finally allowed into
the United States in 1989 after an intense lobbying campaign. David
Biltchik, a Washington-based consultant, worked with Italian
producers, scientists, diplomats and U.S. officials to devise tests
that would persuade the Agriculture Department that Parma hams,
which are cured for 400 days, posed no threat to American lives.
But pressure was also put on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Fielding, a former Reagan White House official turned
consultant, was called in 1987 to help coax his friends at the
Agriculture Department. ``It was a very passionate issue for the
Italians,'' Fielding recalled. ``They provided quite a contrast
with American bureaucrats, who just didn't feel the same emotions
about ham.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bologna, however, such feelings still ride high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy,'' said Franca Gandolfi, shopping at Bologna's
main outdoor market. ``This means when we got to New York City, we
will finally be able to eat something good.''

CRASH-TEST DUMMIES ARE AT THE WHEEL

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago this month, Sharan Sayer's 24-year-old son,
Clint, was thrown from the bed of a pickup truck and run over. He
died. Since then, Sharan has been on a personal crusade to have a
law passed in Arizona banning passengers, particularly children,
from riding in the back of trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a law requiring seat belts,'' she says. ``We have a
law requiring that any cargo in a truck be secured. It strikes me
we should express at least the same concern for children, and that
any reasonable person would understand this.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Sharan went to the state Capitol, where she presented her
arguments for a pickup truck bill in a logical, fact-based,
intellectually sound manner to members of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you a minute.
</P>
<P>
   You can stop laughing now.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the time since that first trip, I have seen and heard some
of the most amazing things,'' Sharan says. ``The reasoning people
give you for not doing this is just . . . well, you can't even call
it reasoning. I don't know what you call it.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``par for the course'' comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Rep. Jake Flake of Snowflake, one of the many John
Rocker Republicans in the Legislature, said this about the practice
of hauling kiddies in the back of speeding pickups:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can legislate morality or responsibility. . .
. This is a way of life for a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Rocker Republican, Rep. Karen Johnson of Mesa, ridiculed
the pickup truck bill by saying, ``Members, welcome to the nanny
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worry about children becoming speed bumps, Arizona
legislators are more interested in closing down nudie bars and
maintaining laws against adultery and ``the infamous crime against
nature.'' (By which they mean, I believe, ``rational thought.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a law prohibiting kids from riding in truck beds was
passed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There were minimal fines attached and, at the time, Sharan Sayer
said, ``I am just so happy, I just can't wait for the governor to
sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Gov. Jane Hull _ the self-proclaimed children's
governor _ vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   So, Sharan Sayer is back at the Legislature this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill as it's written right now is so watered down I can't
imagine anyone would be against it,'' she says, pausing to consider
the absurdity of her statement.
</P>
<P>
   In its current form, the proposal manages to outlaw carting kids
in a pickup without actually outlawing it. It reads: ``A violation
of this section is not a civil traffic violation but a police
officer may stop the person driving the pickup truck or motortruck
and issue a written or verbal warning to the person.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the law contains no escalating punishment for ignoring
that warning, perhaps officers who confront offenders will be
issued dust pans and mops to help aid in any eventual cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least, maybe, a warning will wake some people up,'' Sharan
says. ``No one likes to be stopped by the police. If that's the
best we can do, I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   To get it, the proposal must first be approved by the House
Rules Committee, then by the full House and Senate, then be signed
by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can tell, the only way for the bill's sponsors to make
it appealing to legislators and guarantee its passage would be to
edit out the language Arizona politicians find most offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily by reducing the phrase ``truck beds'' to ``beds.'' &QL;

<P>
   F. Scott Fitzgerald said ``there are no second acts in American
lives.'' But he never heard of the new Volkswagen Beetle or the
Apple iMac _ to say nothing of the comebacks of entertainers like
Cher and Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Today, second acts are as popular in the world of consumer
marketing as they are in the entertainment business. Just in the
last year or so, Maxwell House coffee, American Greetings cards,
Volvo cars, the New York Stock Exchange and even the U.S. Navy have
produced new advertising that tries to recast their brand names as
hip and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is by creating a new image, a new package, a new
product benefit _ or a mix of all of the above _ long-established
brand names are finding it necessary to update their acts in a bid
to keep up with the rapid changes in American society and the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single brand, especially classic brands like Chevrolet
and John Deere that are always given credit for trust and high
quality, are fighting to become more contemporary and energetic,''
said David A. Aaker, vice chairman of Prophet Brand Strategy, a San
Francisco-based consulting firm. ``I'd say 70 percent of brands
want to be perceived as younger than they are now perceived.''
</P>
<P>
   The buzzword in marketing is relevance. Brands have to be on top
of the trends, or face the specter of declining sales. And the
trends are changing at Internet speed. Brands now compete in a
revved-up global market and face product trends that come from
around the world. The competition is even fiercer at the
supermarket, where instant sales information dictates how much
shelf space brands get. Multiculturalism and changes in family life
have also contributed to the need for change.
</P>
<P>
   In such a market, a youthful image is more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Take the New York Stock Exchange, the market leader whose
previous advertising promoted its strength, stability and
venerability. These are all great product attributes, but could be
viewed as a tad stuffy. Besides, the Big Board wanted to show its
current success in important global industries _ a message that was
being overshadowed by rising competition from the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of the Nasdaq market,
which has become synonymous with cool technology and Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is more technology companies are here than there,
and that's lost on people,'' said Robert Zito, senior vice
president of communications of the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Big Board brought in Omnicom Group's BBDO New
York, which introduced an untraditional television campaign,
modeled on consumer product marketing and using sports celebrities,
but aimed at corporate decision makers and other opinion leaders,
Zito said.
</P>
<P>
   In one spot, a little boy is propelled into a fast-paced almost
breathless journey after he asks his computer, ``Where is the
center of the tech world?'' He ultimately lands on the floor of the
exchange where, a voice-over explains, the ``most highly successful
technology companies'' are listed, like America Online and Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   The other commercial features Terry Bradshaw, the former
quarterback turned broadcaster, on an engaging quest for the center
of the sports world as he interrupts, among others, Mia Hamm on the
soccer field and Sammy Sosa at bat. The point? Big-name
sports-related companies like Reebok International and Nike are
traded on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Trout, a marketing consultant, in his book, ``Differentiate
or Die'' (John Wylie &AMP; Sons) which is due for publication next
month, notes the vast proliferation of product choices. In the
1970s there were 17 over-the-counter pain relievers; today the
total has soared to more than 140, he says. Five hosiery brands
existed then; today consumers can pick from 90. If you wanted
contact lenses then, Bausch &AMP; Lomb was your only choice; 36 contact
lens companies now vie for your eyes, offering everything from
tinted lenses to disposables, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of it is the global economy, brands are coming
from everywhere and the international guys are getting a lot better
at it,'' Trout said in an interview. ``It's an explosion of
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also become more expensive and difficult to create and
market new brands, explained Carol Davies, managing partner of
Kane, Bortree &AMP; Associates, a New York marketing firm. That
encourages companies to reposition existing brands rather than take
the extra risk and cost of developing a new one. With scanners and
other research, supermarkets are very sophisticated about what
sells and are reluctant to give shelf space to new brand names
without sales histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade has become much more sophisticated,'' Davies said.
Supermarkets are saying, ``We can't afford to carry all your
brands,'' and they have forced companies to reassess, she added.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the emerging generation of consumers is much
more comfortable with diversity than its parents are. ``It's fusion
_ what kids are doing with music, with food, with words,'' said
Cathy Clift, a senior vice president at McCann-Erickson, West, a
unit of the Interpublic Group. ``We are looking at a
cross-culturalism, and many more ethnic influences today.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Navy discovered that it had to reposition itself for
a new generation after its 1998 recruitment efforts fell short.
Research showed the Navy that young people aged 17 to 24 reject
glossy messages with paid actors and instead want information and
an honest approach, said Steve Lowry, public affairs spokesman for
the Navy Recruiting Command. ``They can spot a phony a mile away,
and that will turn them off faster than anything,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the commercial has to  &UR; move. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Navy switched its campaign from a high-toned, earnest
approach set to classical music. The new commercials, created by
BBDO New York, have a documentary style and use real sailors who
talk about the service. One spot shows young recruits on a ship
alternating between work and jamming in their own hip-hop band.
Another shows a young newscaster who landed her job after a Navy
stint. In 1999, the Navy did meet its recruitment goal, but factors
including changes in eligibility and better pay and pensions also
played a role in the gain.
</P>
<P>
   Brands are fighting to be forever young, not just for image
sake, but to replenish sales. Kraft Foods' Maxwell House has lots
of consumers, but its marketers want to attract younger consumers,
aged 25 to 35, to keep the brand thriving in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Starbucks, Maxwell House has been fighting back for
several years by introducing high-end varieties and running new and
different advertising. Still, its research showed that despite an
enviable status as an American icon, it needed to ``prove to
younger consumers that Maxwell House is not only timeless, it's
timely,'' said Rick Roth, worldwide client service director for
Maxwell House's agency, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, New York, a unit
of WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, last year the company replaced a line of ads that
relied mostly on nostalgia with new advertising set to original
music and showing people of all ages getting the most out of
ordinary moments. The tagline reflects the theme: ``Make every day
good to the last drop.'' Ogilvy also reworked the media schedule,
dropping out of daytime television and running more ads during
prime time, as well as focusing on youth-oriented magazines. Ogilvy
even covered city buses and subways with striking images.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising, said Ann Fudge, executive vice president of
Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Companies, and president of
Maxwell House and the Post divisions, is aimed at making Maxwell
House more relevant to young consumers by identifying with their
state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research showed while young people remembered us, they had
not fully connected with us in a stronger way,'' Fudge said. ``We
need to be really plugged into what's going on and what's important
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Maxwell House, Volvo, the Swedish carmaker now owned by
Ford Motor _ which long produced dependable and safe cars _ is
trying to reinvent itself. But while it wants to attract younger
buyers, it also realized that it had to change its overall image to
appeal to a broader audience, younger and older. With all cars now
safer than before, safety alone is no longer an exclusive selling
point for Volvo, said Bob Austin, Volvo Cars of North America's
director of marketing communications. Other features like style and
comfort were necessary to broaden the market.
</P>
<P>
   One commercial for its lower-priced model aimed at young people
is a comical spot showing a couple dropping off a 2-year-old after
a horrendous baby-sitting experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reach that prefamily group to get them in the
Volvo family,'' Austin said.
</P>
<P>
   American Greetings is also reaching out to younger people, even
though most greeting cards are bought by women over 35. The idea is
not just to appear youthful, but to introduce consumers to the card
line before they reach peak buying years, explained David DeMuth,
general manager of the Cleveland office of Doner, the advertising
agency that created the irreverent print advertising to reinvent
the brand. One image: a biker type in a tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, recasting a long-established brand is not easy. One
risk is losing the core customer. Moreover, perceptions are
difficult to change. Trout, the marketing consultant, said that
Timex tried to go more upscale a few years ago, but had more
success returning to its traditional position as a reliable,
relatively low-cost, watchmaker. The General Motors Cadillac
division, which is promoting sporty vehicles, has to fight its
image as a maker of big, roomy cars, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely difficult to reposition an established brand,''
Trout said. ``You can try to change things, but sometimes your old
identity just haunts you.''

POLICE TURN OVER MEXICO UNIVERSITY TO PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The federal police withdrew from the national
university Wednesday after a three-day occupation, returning
control to administration officials who had been exiled since April
by a student strike.
</P>
<P>
   At the medical school, students in white coats marched,
cheering, through the front doors, making a ``V'' for victory with
their fingers. Law students returned to their school accompanied by
mariachi trumpets. Across the campus, students and professors
joined maintenance workers to scrub the grime left by more than
nine months of disuse.
</P>
<P>
   The university president, Juan Ramon de la Fuente, who took
office during the strike, entered his office for the first time. He
pledged that striking students would be allowed to make up all
their classes. Acknowledging soberly that the strike had brought
``bitter experiences for everyone,'' he said he would try to
``close all the wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican leaders and intellectuals, sharply divided over
President Ernesto Zedillo's decision to send the police to break up
the strike, squared off for a protracted political fight over the
strikers who are in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Two judges here upheld felony charges that included theft and
criminal riot against 174 strikers arrested since Feb. 1.
Responding to an outcry from human rights groups, justice officials
withdrew charges that they had filed for terrorism and sabotage,
which would have left some strikers facing 25-year sentences if
they were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   De la Fuente dropped all the minor charges that the university
had lodged against the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   Several departments said they would be ready to resume classes
next week. In others, administrators found havoc.
</P>
<P>
   In suburban Naucalpan, at a high school that is part of the
university system, the director, Rafael Familiar Gonzalez, gave his

smashed or gutted, he said, estimating that replacing them would
cost $500,000. The electrical generator and the water pumps for the
plumbing for the 11,000 students had been pillaged. Familiar said
it could take up to three weeks for repairs. ``What the society
gave to educate these kids,'' he said, ``they just threw away like
trash.''

   Interior Minister Diodoro Carrasco told reporters that the
police had found no firearms and 12 or so firebombs. Some political
leaders called months ago for the police to crush the strike,
warning that armed guerrilla groups were hiding weapons at the
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arms were fewer than some people expected,'' Carrasco
conceded. ``What was extraordinary was the looting and
destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the strikers shut two campuses of the city
university of Mexico City in 24-hour protests. Zapatista rebels
based in Chiapas state called for ``a continuous campaign of
peaceful protests'' against the police action.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of students who tried to close a campus of the
National Polytechnical Institute in support of the strikers at the
national university was furiously rebuffed by other students and
their parents. They charged through the front gates and drove the
protesters into the street.

   Commissioner Bud Selig, who suspended John Rocker for all of
spring training and the first four weeks of the season, was the
first and chief witness at the hearing on the pitcher's appeal of
the suspension Wednesday, but what went on outside the hearing room
said at least as much about the controversy Rocker has stirred as
the testimony inside.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's presence at the commissioner's office on Park Avenue in
New York prompted curious and critical onlookers and a series of
signs protesting Rocker's remarks that denigrated foreigners, gays
and some minorities. That the Atlanta Braves closer was back in the
city where his problems began last fall during the Braves' games
with the Mets only added to the unusual atmosphere surrounding the
day's events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to Atlanta, you rat,'' one sign read.
</P>
<P>
   Said another: ``New York immigrants against Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who testified for nearly six hours on the first day of
the grievance hearing before the arbitrator, Shyam Das, disclosed
afterward that he had met privately with Rocker on Wednesday. He
declined, however, to discuss their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that was said will remain private,'' said Selig, who
headed back to Milwaukee immediately after completing his
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Following Selig on the witness stand Wednesday were Derrick
Boazman, an Atlanta city councilman, and Stan Kasten, the Braves'
president. Kevin Hallinan, baseball's chief security executive,
will be Major League Baseball's final witness. When the players
association presents its case, Rocker will be one of the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the union appealed the suspension, management presented
its case first because, under the collective bargaining agreement,
the burden of proof falls on the person imposing disciplinary
action.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is expected to be completed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Selig issued his penalty, which also included a $20,000 fine, on
Jan. 31, after hearing the outcry over Rocker's remarks in a
magazine article in December. The players association appealed the
suspension on Rocker's behalf the next day, contending that the
suspension was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have the right to appeal,'' Selig said after his
testimony, speaking with reporters outside the building that houses
the baseball offices. ``That's his right under our process. He has
strong feelings on the matter and so do I. Other commissioners have
had to go through this process. I did what I thought I had to do.
I'm very comfortable with what I did. The matter is now in the
hands of the arbitrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker said little. ``Just be patient,'' he told reporters.
``You'll find out later.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When he arrived for the hearing, Rocker was greeted by a round
of boos from a group of Bear Stearns employees who were outside
taking a mid-morning smoking break.
</P>
<P>
   A group of eight Bear Stearns mailroom workers appeared with
hastily made signs on brown packing paper that read, ``Go back
home, Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Rocker is a rat; this symbolizes Rocker,'' said Matt
Reischl, a labor organizer from Local 78, which represents
asbestos, lead and hazardous waste laborers. He was manning a
12-foot tall inflated rat he had set up along the sidewalk in front
of the building. ``We don't appreciate the statements he made about
immigrants. Our union consists mostly of immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   Reischl, 24, of Salzburg, Austria, said the local membership was
primarily divided between Spanish-speaking and Polish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from nearby buildings ignored the cold weather to linger
outside 245 Park Avenue in anticipation of getting a glimpse of
Rocker, who took an instant dislike to Mets fans when the Braves
played at Shea Stadium. His comments and feelings about the fans
fueled his larger verbal attack that he extended to many other
segments of society in an interview in Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   In suspending Rocker, Selig said, ``Mr. Rocker should understand
that his remarks offended practically every element of society and
brought dishonor to himself, the Braves and Major League
Baseball.''

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. - Theme parks and the hit game show ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire'' appear to be reversing the fortunes of the
Walt Disney Co. after a lackluster 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank-based company has reported a 5 percent revenue gain
and an 8 percent jump in operating income for the first quarter of
fiscal 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the impact of a 72 percent retained interest in
Go.com, a tracking stock for Disney's Internet holdings, the
entertainment giant earned $515 million, or 25 cents a share, for
the quarter ended Dec 31. In the prior year's quarter, Disney
earned $482 million, or 23 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues were $6.8 billion, up 5 percent from the like period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first-quarter results, announced Wednesday, were in line
with figures the company gave last month when it announced a
management reorganization and reviewed its earnings report.
</P>
<P>
   However, Disney's Internet operations - like many other
businesses related to the Internet - continue to lose money, and
are expected to continue doing so in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Television and theme parks were the strongest performers for the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's media networks posted a 19 percent gain in revenue,
from $2.3 billion to $2.7 billion for the previous first quarter,
and a whopping 73 percent increase in operating income.
</P>
<P>
   Theme parks and resorts reported record operating results,
including a 9 percent increase in revenue - from $1.4 billion to
$1.6 billion - and operating income increase of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had released preliminary highlights of the quarter's
results Jan. 24, when it also promoted ABC network chief Robert
Iger to second in command after Disney chairman Michael Eisner. ABC
contributed strongly to the quarter's results: Revenue from
broadcasting was up 13 percent over the same period the previous
year. ``Millionaire'' has been a ratings juggernaut, and ad sales
for the network reached a record $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's cable networks, including ESPN and the Disney Channel,
fared even better, with a 29 percent increase in revenue for first
quarter 2000 vs. first quarter 1999. And income from Disney's
equity investments in the Arts &AMP; Entertainment, Lifetime and E!
Entertainment Television channels soared 47 percent for the
quarter, year to year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer products continued to be weak, with revenue down 6
percent to $903 million for the quarter. Also, the blockbuster
success of ``Toy Story 2'' couldn't offset the disappointing
performance of such movies as ``The Insider'' and ``Bicentennial
Man,'' leading Disney to report a 10 percent decline in filmed
entertainment.

EXCERPTS FROM BRADLEY'S SPEECH ON EDUCATION  
</HEADLINE>
  (With BRADLEY-EDUC) 
(js) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remarks by former Sen. Bill Bradley Wednesday in a speech on
education that he delivered in University City, Mo.:
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty years, the Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal
was unconstitutional when it came to race and education in America.
I'm here today to say that we have separate and unequal when it
comes to the quality of education in America.
</P>
<P>
   A good education in America today is an American birthright.
While millions of children are getting such an education, there are
far too many children who are trapped in failing schools. Education
may be the great equalizer, but when schools are unequal _ when
poor children get an inferior education to wealthy children, when
minorities get a worse education than non-minorities _ we are often
preparing them for a life of failure. To me, that is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   I believe there is nothing more important to education than a
qualified teacher. Research shows that one of the strongest
predictors of how students perform on national tests is not class
size or per pupil spending, but the presence of a qualified
teacher, a teacher who is fully certified and majored in the
subject he or she taught. That is why I will require that schools
that receive federal money will have to ensure that their teachers
are fully qualified. `Warm bodies' are just not good enough for our
children, millions of who sit down every day in classrooms before
teachers who do not meet the minimum requirements for teaching in a
public school. ''

HILLARY CLINTON OFFERS PLAN TO ATTRACT NEW TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton turned her attention Wednesday to the
teacher shortage threatening schools nationwide, outlining a plan
to lure more college students into teaching with federally financed
scholarships worth up to $10,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech at Syracuse University, she said she envisioned a
National Teaching Corps that would provide 60,000 students a year
with scholarships of $5,000 to $10,000 each. The scholarship
recipients would have to spend at least four years teaching in
urban or rural schools with pronounced teacher shortages, her aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who formally announced her campaign for the Senate on
Sunday, said the program would also provide training and signing
bonuses, which her aides said would be worth $10,000, for people
who switch to teaching from other professions. Up to 15,000 people
a year could receive the training.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program would promote alternative pathways to
certification so that people from fields like engineering or
computer technology or foreign language or a host of other areas
would feel that they could enter the teaching profession,'' Clinton
told an audience of about 900 students and faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   She did not say how much the recruiting and training program
would cost, or where the money would come from. Her aides said
those details were yet to be worked out. But the proposals were the
most detailed that she has offered to date on the subject of
education. Clinton has said she wants to make education a central
issue of her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, her remarks on education policy have focused mostly
on the topic of school vouchers, a concept that her opponent, New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, strongly supports. Clinton has
repeatedly said she opposed vouchers, and she repeated that
position Wednesday, calling them a ``gimmick'' that drains money
from public schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton, who has the backing of the state and city teachers'
unions, also said Wednesday that she supported bonuses for
outstanding teachers. Although she did not elaborate, her aides
later said she supported the concept of extra pay for teachers who
sought additional training and those who shared their expertise
with younger or less experienced colleagues. The aides said Clinton
believed such bonuses should be based on evaluations not only by a
teacher's supervisor but also by the teacher's colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan contrasts sharply with a merit pay plan that
Giuliani has vowed to push through in negotiations with the city
teachers' union this year. Under his plan, instead of receiving
across-the-board raises each year, teachers would be eligible for
different levels of raises _ or no raises at all _ based on their
performance.
</P>
<P>
   While not referring to Giuliani by name, Clinton referred
cuttingly to his proposal to sell the New York City Board of
Education's headquarters in Brooklyn and his frequent criticism of
the teachers' union. ``Will you spend your time firing people or
fixing our schools?'' she said. ``Will you work to sell off the
school board building or invest in our children? Will you resort to
teacher-bashing or engage in problem-solving?''

 FDA BARS MARKETING OF SUPPLEMENTS tO PREGNANT WOMEN  
 (bl)  
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Under pressure from experts in birth defects, the
Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday withdrew, at least for
now, a new rule that allowed dietary supplements to be sold for
common pregnancy-related conditions like morning sickness and leg
swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike drugs, supplements do not require rigorous testing for
safety and efficacy, and the new FDA rule, which took effect
Monday, drew fire from birth defects experts, who said it would put
unborn babies at risk.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the agency Wednesday told supplement manufacturers
that their products could not ``make any claims related to
pregnancy'' until officials had time to examine the issue. Dr.
Janet Woodcock, director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation
and Research, said that the FDA would convene a public hearing and
that the outcome might be a revision of the rule.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Consumer Healthcare Products Association,
which represents supplement manufacturers, said the organization
would not oppose the FDA's move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that the FDA is acting responsibly in addressing this
question,'' said the spokeswoman, Donna Edenhart.
</P>
<P>
   The provision at issue is part of a larger rule that permits
supplement manufacturers to market products for conditions
associated with natural stages of life, like memory loss due to
aging, and acne in adolescence. This broader rule, which stems from
the agency's interpretation of a 1994 law that severely restricted
its authority to regulate herbal products and vitamins, remains in
effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of pregnancy and dietary supplements has been a
thorny one for the agency, whose reversal Wednesday was its second
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   When the FDA first proposed its rule, in April 1998, it said
that while pregnancy was not a disease, some conditions associated
with it _ like morning sickness and leg swelling _ were, and that
dietary products to relieve those symptoms would be treated like
drugs, requiring successful testing and agency approval.
</P>
<P>
   The final rule, issued in January, rewrote that provision so
that such products would be classified as supplements, not
requiring FDA review. Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Public
Citizen's Health Research Group, an advocacy organization in
Washington, called that reversal ``a complete cave-in'' and
organized public health experts to protest.
</P>
<P>
   Those experts cited the case of thalidomide, a drug that caused
deformities in 10,000 babies in Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan
after it was prescribed for morning sickness in the 1960s. Babies
in the United States were largely spared, because the FDA refused
to approve the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``To open the floodgates to unfettered marketing of dietary
supplements to pregnant women, without the need for any information
on safety, never mind efficacy, just seems to be inviting
thalidomide all over again,'' said Dr. Allen A. Mitchell, a birth
defects expert at the Boston University School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell said there was some evidence that pseudoephedrine,
found in herbal cold preparations, might cause gastroschisis, a
rare birth defect that involves a malformation of the
gastrointestinal tract. And experts are concerned about high doses
of vitamin A, he said, because a close cousin of it, the drug
Accutane, causes birth defects.

   ``Jesus as a Figure in History'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Allan Powell &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Westminster John Knox, $22 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's an old saying among journalists: If your mother says she
loves you, check it out. A number of academicians actually seem to
use that approach _ or something even more skeptical _ when it
comes to a certain Nazarene carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Allan Powell's ``Jesus as a Figure in History'' surveys the
efforts of several modern scholars to examine Jesus from a
historical perspective: Using the standard methods of that
discipline (rather than faith-based theology), what kind of Jesus
can be seen? The answers range from a rather ordinary Jewish sage
to something pretty close to the Christ of the traditional church.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's volume gives useful insights into the methodologies and
mind-sets of those attempting such work. Perhaps the most striking
factor is the enormous suspicion with which some of them approach
the Gospels; indeed, Powell says the Jesus Seminar ``tends to
regard Gospel tradition as guilty of fabrication unless proven
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the New Testament's status as the primary source for
information on Jesus, one wonders why such authors bother to deal
with the subject at all. &QL;

<P>
   It should come as no surprise that this CD vaulted over everyone
else (Kirk, CeCe, Hezekiah and many more) to hit No. 1 on the
national gospel charts in its second week of release.
</P>
<P>
   Trin-i-tee 5:7 (Angel, Adrian and Chanelle) made a strong
impression last year with their eponymous debut and opening for
labelmate Kirk Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   This second CD, however, takes the positives of that recording
and improves upon them on almost every track. All three singers can
take the lead, and the lush harmonies are, well, lusher than last
time. And there is more diversity than before.
</P>
<P>
   The opener, ``Put Your Hands,'' is, yes, a takeoff on the gospel
standard, but it's brilliantly reworked as a boundlessly energetic
piece of Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire-style '70s funk, complete with zippy
horns and a prominent funk guitar. And there is a well-mined
old-school gospel feel to Walter Hawkins' ``Highway'' (which
features guest vocals from Tramaine Hawkins) and ``There He Is,'' a
song by urban superstar R. Kelly. Both savvily reach back to gospel
days of old while sounding thoroughly modern.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a welcome directness on Travon Potts' ``My Body,'' a
song that warns an overexcited beau that ``My body is God's body/No
it ain't your property/Jesus died on Calvary/Just to save someone
like me.'' It's a powerful song that should connect with young
women around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to R&AMP;B/hip-hop female trios are inevitable
(especially TLC) but 5:7 are smartly modern in their songs and
production without ever letting anyone wonder whether their message
is religious or secular. Big as they are right now, Trin-i-tee 5:7
will go even further. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The women huddled over an oval-shaped dining room
table on a recent Saturday night. Some were stalwarts of the
women's liberation movement of the 1960s and '70s. Others were
simply swept up in the spirit, if not the actions, of the
movement's high tide.
</P>
<P>
   But now, instead of plotting demonstrations, preparing
conference papers or nibbling on breadsticks at Mother Courage, a
favorite feminist haunt in the West Village that has long since
disappeared, they often gather at the Jane Street apartment of
Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, for dinner and a game of
killer poker.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of consciousness raising sessions and speak-outs, it is
five-card baseball, anaconda, guts and Chinese poker, the current
hit that uses two decks of cards. Peppered through the night is
spirited conversation about the issues of the week, personal and
political.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the other Saturday, as nickels, dimes and quarters
went showering onto the center of the table in Brownmiller's
book-lined dining room with apricot-colored walls. Ringlets of
cigarette smoke curled above the table. A churning dishwasher
provided the background noise.
</P>
<P>
   The women started the poker game a decade ago to find out why
men were so obsessed with it. If it was like a secret men's
society, they wanted to know what was going on. Yet for these
veterans of the feminist wars, poker night has come to serve a
distinct purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is community,'' said Brownmiller, 64, one of the chain
smokers and author of the influential 1975 treatise ``Against Our
Will: Men, Women and Rape,'' in addition to a new book, ``In Our
Time: Memoir of a Revolution'' (Dial Press, 1999), which chronicles
landmark events of the feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the view of Brownmiller, the women's movement has
lost its steam, so poker night gives ``an old feminist'' like
herself something to do during non-activist times. In poker, her
new sobriquet is Queen of the Lows for her prowess at high-low
games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet around the poker table on Saturday nights, the opinions
about the vitality of the women's movement are as divided as in the
world beyond Brownmiller's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over; you could have another Anita Hill and it could
come back,'' insisted Noreen Connell, a former president of the
state and New York City chapters of the National Organization for
Women, blowing smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A blessing of poker, it might be said, is that players must
concentrate on the cards. They say the group has not folded
precisely because they do not air their differences all night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disagreements, there is a strong feeling of
camaraderie, said Evan Morley, an editor with Berkeley Books. She
used to be treasurer for a group called the New York Radical
Feminists and edited its monthly newsletter from 1970 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, this poker group is a small remnant of a
community of political women,'' said Morley, a short, gray-haired
woman with a weathered, impish face who would describe her age only
as ``old enough to collect Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a particularly good moment to wax nostalgic. It
was Morley's deal, five-card baseball. The bet was a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to pay to play, baby,'' she called out, leaning over
with a cigarette dangling, appendage-like, from her lip.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of players revolves, with a core group of a half-dozen
women ranging mostly from their mid-50s to early 80s. Often, twice
that many women show up.
</P>
<P>
   There are regulars like Florence Rush, a spry 82-year-old author
who wrote a book about the sexual abuse of children; Frances
Whyatt, a flamboyant novelist and poet who has written under the
pseudonym Shylah Boyd; and Robin Reisig, a former Village Voice
reporter who now teaches at the Columbia University Graduate School
of Journalism. Among the other players are Sally Guttmacher, a New
York University professor, and Rose Arce, a CNN producer.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for poker came to Brownmiller in 1989 after she covered
the trial of Joel Steinberg, who was charged in the beating death
of his illegally adopted daughter, Lisa. While she waited for a
verdict with mostly male reporters, the defendant's male lawyer
strode into the pressroom with a deck of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Brownmiller was not a poker player, but she played anyway,
losing every hand. She left thinking about why should poker be a
man's game. Separately, an anthropologist friend named Ruby
Rohrlich, who died recently, was thinking along the same lines.
</P>
<P>
   But in a typical feminist split, Brownmiller said, the poker
group was barely founded before it erupted into two terrible
fights, the penny battle followed by the great cigarette battle.
</P>
<P>
   First, the contentious Rohrlich had a big jar of pennies she
wanted to bring to the game. ``We knew men would never play with
pennies,'' Brownmiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Rohrlich quit her cigarette habit and could no longer
tolerate the plumes of smoke from other players. The women held
fast against the pennies, and a year or two later, the smoke was
the last straw for Rohrlich, who stormed out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The others have kept up their Saturday poker nights ever since.
They hear about games like Texas Hold'em from tournaments played at
Binion's Horseshoe, a famous casino in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Brownmiller has a good table, so poker nights are often spent at
her apartment. She also thinks she is the best player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan is kind of the center of it,'' Rush said. ``She gets new
people in. She gets upset if you stop coming. She feels it's
important for all of us because we need each other and it's a way
of coming together.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   During the game, the women find poker soothingly mindless; the
calling, the betting, the winning, the losing. There are the poker
faces, the hard stares. But in a game where anyone can stay in for
a quarter, it is difficult to experience the kind of bluff that
curdles the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   They begin the night with a home-cooked meal, and talk about
movies, books, clothes, favorite food shops, politics. They
understand each other well. They can annoy each other easily.
Hillary Clinton is a touchy subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a liar,'' Brownmiller said. ``She lied about Whitewater.
She has lied about Vince Foster. She lied to protect her husband
until she couldn't lie anymore about Monica Lewinsky and her
husband's promiscuity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't she lie about that?'' interjected Guttmacher,
the NYU professor. ``It's nobody's business. Why should she be
compelled to tell the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Brownmiller broke in: ``Also, she is a carpetbagger. She is not
a New Yorker. I don't think she stands for anything. She has no
track record. Being a wife is not a track record.''
</P>
<P>
   The others around the table bristled quietly at Brownmiller's
position.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment or two, the subject moved to Bella Abzug at an
antipornography march in Times Square in 1979. Some players look
back wistfully to that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hot,'' said Whyatt, 54, whose racy novel ``American
Made,'' about a free-spirited young woman, came out when Erica
Jong's sexually frank novel ``Fear of Flying'' was breaking taboos
in the mid-1970s. ``We could sell anything, and it was a lot of
fun. Now we can't sell our underwear. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   But more often, the women keep up with the news of the week.
Recently, they raked over the presidential candidates. Connell and
Whyatt pretty much decided that John McCain was the devil for his
position against abortion. The Arizona senator, it seemed to them,
had scared George W. Bush into towing a more conservative line on
that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, the oldest player, interrupted to share a thought about
the Democratic candidate Bill Bradley: ``You know what bothers me
about Bradley, and I know it's not nice: his double chin.''
</P>
<P>
   The other women cracked up.
</P>
<P>
   And that night, before a game that would last until midnight,
they celebrated Rush's 82nd birthday. Rush had told them not to
bother. But they always celebrate birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   They also look out for one another. When anyone in the group
gets sick, the others run errands. When Rush has eye surgery soon,
Brownmiller will take her to the hospital and bring her home.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a former social worker from Westchester County, became
active in the women's movement in 1971. Her activism broadened when
her youngest son contracted AIDS. He died at age 39 in 1990. She
said she discovered activists in her AIDS advocacy work who ``were
more feminists than the feminists.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the dinner plates were cleared for poker that night, the
players raised Champagne flutes to toast Rush. ``Long may she live,
an example for us all and a hard act to follow,'' Brownmiller said.
</P>
<P>
   Rush thanked them. ``I'm happy.'' Then they all beamed.

NEWBERY AWARD CARRIES AUTHOR FAR FROM FACTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you should meet Christopher Paul Curtis, winner of the 2000
Newbery Award for ``Bud, Not Buddy'' (Delacorte, $15.95), and
wonder whether to speak to him or ask for an autograph, don't
hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired of talking to readers or signing books,''
Curtis said during a lengthy phone interview. ``If I wasn't doing
that, I'd be working in a warehouse unloading trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Many writers say the same sort of thing, but Curtis isn't
kidding. Despite being selected for the prestigious award from the
American Library Association for the best children's book published
in the past year, the 46-year-old Curtis is just a few years
removed from working on the line at a Flint, Mich., car factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job for 13 years in that Fisher Body 1 plant made me a
writer,'' Curtis said. ``I hated that job. I stood on my feet 10
hours a day putting doors on cars. You worked with a partner and,
between the two of you, the rate was 60 cars an hour, one a
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Bored, Curtis and his partner developed a plan. Each would pull
door duty on 30 cars in a row, giving his partner 30 minutes off
each hour. Curtis used that time to write, mostly journals noting
how much he despised his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was one of those people who liked to spend; I had a
family and getting credit was much too easy,'' Curtis recalled.
``So I was stuck there.''
</P>
<P>
   In his heart, Curtis had always wanted to write. But during his
20s and 30s, he knew the fiction he produced wasn't good enough to
sell to a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept working at it, though,'' Curtis said. ``Writing is like
anything else. The more you do it, the better you get, like
learning to dribble a basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Curtis couldn't stand the factory any more. He quit and
embarked on a series of ``minimum wage, horrible jobs: maintenance
man, warehouse worker. I ended up at a warehouse, unloading trucks.
Now, my wife had read a lot of what I had written. She told me one
day she knew I was unhappy. She said we should save money and I
could take a year off to try to write. And that's what I did in
1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Free to plan his own writing schedule, Curtis went each day to
the Flint public library, where he sat at a table and tried to
think of a novel to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of writing a children's book, but that's
just the story that came to me,'' he said. ``The book that came out
was `The Watsons Go to Birmingham _ 1963.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, an African-American, tried to tell the story of a black
family in the still-segregated South as movingly as possible. When
he completed the book, he wasn't certain what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read in some magazines about writing contests being
sponsored by two publishers, Little, Brown and Delacorte,'' Curtis
recalled. ``I entered both. I got a personalized rejection letter
back from Little, Brown. I don't take rejection well. If I didn't
win the Delacorte contest, my year off was almost up and I was
going back to the warehouse.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't win. But Wendy Lamb, a Delacorte editor, called Curtis
and said her company would like to publish ``The Watsons'' anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a $4,000 advance and couldn't believe it,'' Curtis said.
``But beyond that, book sales didn't bring in much. I think my
first royalty check was only in double digits. So I went back to
the warehouse for a year and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Watsons Go to Birmingham _ 1963'' won the Coretta
Scott King Author Award for excellence by an African-American
children's writer, and was a Newbery runner-up. Curtis was asked to
make speeches nationwide to groups willing to pay for the
privilege. He quit his factory job and, between speeches and family
relocation to Windsor, Ontario, began working on his second
children's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to get in the same place in my mind I had gone to
find `The Watsons,' Curtis said. ``I still wrote in a library. This
time, I thought about my grandfathers, who were great storytellers.
One was a baseball player, one was a musician. I never wanted to
listen to them, and then when they passed away it was too late. But
I got this character _ Bud, not Buddy, in my mind, and based other
characters on my grandfathers and the people in their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bud, Not Buddy,'' the title character is a 10-year-old boy
who flees foster parents in 1936 during the depths of the
Depression. Bud believes his father is a musician whose name he has
learned from fliers saved by his mother. After numerous
misadventures, he sets out from Flint to Grand Rapids to find the
man.
</P>
<P>
   The story's power comes less from plot twists _ Bud finds his
family, though not in the form he expected _ than from Curtis'
deadeye ability to capture the emotions of children. Bud's thoughts
on kissing, fighting older boys, getting to sleep at night and,
above all, dealing with life by way of a list of unwritten rules,
are wonderfully expressed in simple, colorful terms.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of writing and 18 months of editing and rewriting,
``Bud, Not Buddy'' hit bookstore shelves in 1999. Librarians and
educators fell in love with the book; on Jan. 18, when the Newbery
Award was announced at the ALA annual meeting in San Antonio, the
librarians present leaped to their feet in a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all just unreal, and sometimes I got real emotional,''
Curtis said. ``I'd heard for a while my book was going to win, and
lots of times that can be a jinx. But it did win _ ``The Watsons Go
to Birmingham _ 1963'' was a Newbery runner-up and I also won the
Coretta Scott King Award for ``Bud, Not Buddy'' So it was a great
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis plans to go home to Canada and continue work on his third
book, which is three-quarters completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is for slightly older readers, the ones they call
young adults,'' Curtis said. ``My first two books have been for
10-, 11-year-olds, the `middle readers.' Anyway, the new one is
called ``Bucking the Sarge.'' It's about a 15-year-old boy, one who
lives in Flint, again, and his mother is a scam artist who owns
lots of rent properties. She wants him to follow in her footsteps,
but he doesn't like that. I'll finish it soon. I'm on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Factory work is forever in Curtis' past, but he never wants
those years expunged from his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the time I learned to be a writer,'' he concluded.
``If it had been easier for me, it wouldn't mean as much as it does
now when it has all worked out.''

BAFFERT COMES TO VALENZUELA'S DEFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Pat Valenzuela's defense gained a familiar voice
Wednesday when Bob Baffert asked the Santa Anita stewards not to
revoke the Kentucky Derby-winning jockey's license following his
latest drug relapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never put any riders or horses in danger. We aren't talking
about race-fixing,'' Baffert, the nation's leading thoroughbred
trainer, said at a hearing held four days after Valenzuela tested
positive for amphetamines. ``This is about a guy's personal
problem. I would... give him another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert praised Valenzuela as ``a good person'' who is ``good
for the sport'' and casually volunteered to ``be in charge of him
or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewards Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and Ingrid Fermin said a ruling
on Valenzuela's future could come as soon as today.
</P>
<P>
   The stewards heard Don Murray, director of the Winners
Foundation, a race track support group for substance abusers,
testify during the 30-minute hearing that Valenzuela has waged an
``outstanding'' fight against the drug and alcohol addictions that
have led to repeated suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   And they heard Van Nuys-based attorney Donald Calabria describe
Valenzuela as ``a different person now'' who ``didn't run and
hide'' but promptly admitted suffering a relapse by ingesting speed
last Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 37, walked into the California Horse Racing Board
office at Santa Anita Saturday morning and admitted violating the
conditional, ``last-chance'' license agreement that allowed him to
return in September from a nearly two-year suspension for a
drug-related absence.
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, Valenzuela said he hadn't been ordered to submit
a urine sample in the fourth months since his return.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela had been ordered off his scheduled mounts after
missing the races Friday, when agent Nick Cosato phoned the
stewards to report the jockey had ``personal problems.'' Cosato has
since quit working for Valenzuela, who began the week eighth in the
Santa Anita standings.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that Valenzuela would claim he used drugs
to help fight a weight problem or pain from a recent neck injury.
Instead he confessed that ``I let everybody down'' and threw
himself on the mercy of the stewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my job and hope I can continue to ride and be a clean
and sober member of society,'' said Valenzuela, who rode 1989
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things (relapses) do occur,'' Calabria said, ``with
people who are fighting this battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Boding ill for Valenzuela is the fact Pedersen and Fermin were
members of the Oak Tree board of stewards that suspended him
indefinitely in 1997 and recommended he not be relicensed. Pedersen
told Valenzuela on Wednesday, ``Our decision will have to come from
the head and not the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably share some of the feelings of the people who
support him,'' Pedersen said. But he added that the stewards'
priority is creating ``a safe environment'' for other riders.

OBSTETRICIAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN CARVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Manhattan obstetrician pleaded not guilty to felony
assault charges Wednesday for carving his initials into a woman's
stomach after performing a Caesarean section last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The arraignment of the doctor, Allan Zarkin, was his first
public appearance since the incident at Beth Israel Medical Center
was reported. He was animated in the courtroom, chatting with his
lawyers and a former patient, but he declined to speak with
reporters after his appearance in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In an added twist to an already bizarre case, a lawyer for the
patient angrily criticized prosecutors Wednesday for bringing
criminal charges against Zarkin. The patient, Dr. Liana Gedz, a
dentist who is suing Zarkin, his former Murray Hill practice and
Beth Israel for $5.5 million, has called the criminal prosecution a
waste of taxpayer's money, and her lawyer, Robert Sullivan,
dismissed it Wednesday as a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real public issue is the failure of the medical profession
to monitor itself,'' said Sullivan. ``That would take a lot of
work, and this is an easy headline-grabbing conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, defended the
criminal charges Wednesday and said his office would continue
investigating Zarkin's treatment of other patients as well as
``other criminal activities.'' He declined to specify what those
other activities were and dismissed Gedz's call to drop the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a private lawsuit,'' said Morgenthau. ``This is a
public prosecution. When someone commits a serious crime, it's up
to the state to prosecute it. Would you like somebody's initials
carved into your belly without your permission?''
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin, 61, whose medical license was revoked Feb. 3, admits
carving his initials into Gedz's stomach but has blamed an
Alzheimer's-like disease for his actions. The case, one of the most
peculiar medical misconduct matters in the city in decades, has
reverberated beyond the doctor himself.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the harshest rebukes of a hospital in years, the State
Department of Health fined Beth Israel $14,000 last Thursday and
ordered it to improve its oversight of doctors. Health Department
officials also temporarily closed all operating rooms at a Queens
clinic, Choices Women's Medical Center, where Zarkin worked as
medical director after the incident, stating the clinic had
``serious violations'' that posed a risk to patients, including
inadequate employee screening and supervision in the case of
Zarkin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Zarkin displayed the flamboyance that his
colleagues said was his trademark at Beth Israel and at the
practice where he was a partner, New York Gyn/Ob Associates in
Murray Hill. The doctor, who was led into court in handcuffs, had
his thick white hair combed straight back and wore a long flowing
brown overcoat, a gray turtleneck and a thick gold necklace with a
large medallion.
</P>
<P>
   Zarkin, who had surrendered to prosecutors earlier in the day,
spoke to his lawyers in an animated voice and turned his face away
from courtroom artists as they tried to draw him. He stood before
the judge, Brenda Soloff, and said only, ``Not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arraignment, he warmly greeted a former patient who
was in the courtroom to show her support. He clasped her hand,
kissed it and embraced her, saying ``Yes! Yes! I remember you!''
and ``Thank you very much!''
</P>
<P>
   During an elevator ride he continued chatting with the former
patient, telling his lawyers at one point, ``You see, somebody
likes me.''
</P>
<P>
   As his lawyer, Barry Fallick, told reporters that the incident
was caused by Pick's disease, which causes an Alzheimer's-like
degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain, Zarkin stood quietly
behind him. ``There are a lot of cameras here,'' the doctor
muttered to one of his lawyers at one point. Several seconds later,
he quietly asked, ``Can't I leave now?'' And then, a few seconds
later, he was led to a waiting sedan and whisked away.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Mills, a forensic psychiatrist who has been treating
Zarkin, said brain scans showed he was suffering from Pick's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But when Morgenthau was asked whether he believed that Zarkin
was genuinely sick, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is something that will be decided by a
jury.''

BOEING ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL WORKERS GO ON STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ About 17,000 Boeing Co. engineers and technical
workers went on strike Wednesday, threatening to disrupt a range of
work at the aerospace giant from flight testing operations to
airplane services.
</P>
<P>
   Employees walked out over demands for more money and the
protection of their benefits. After filing out at 9 a.m. they
rallied at Renton Memorial Stadium, promising to stay on picket
lines for weeks or months. There are no plans to resume
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives and analysts were unsure how the strike would
effect the company. That's because much of Boeing's technical
community is involved in research and long-range projects, not the
day-to-day construction of the aircraft, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer also has never faced a prolonged strike by its
technical community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could develop to be a big problem if the issues surrounding
this walkout are not resolved in the near future,'' said Peter
Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie Group Inc., a Seattle-based
investment firm. ``I would be surprised if the engineers had the
resolve to stay out of work for a long duration.''
</P>
<P>
   The engineering strike also spread beyond Boeing's walls,
drawing in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the
United Transportation Union. Those unions promised that their
members wouldn't cross the engineers' picket lines. Though their
resolve could disrupt the delivery of parts and documents, Boeing
is likely to create alternative delivery sites to cope with the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the second strike in its history, The
Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
presented a unified front.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 8,000 workers packed the Renton, Wash., stadium. They
threatened to shut the company down, hoisting signs that read ``No
Brains, No Planes'' and yelling ``One More Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to bust this union and we are going to show them how
strong this union is,'' said Doug Smith, a union negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how long Boeing engineers and technicians can
remain unified, however. Only 63 percent of the 22,600 workers
covered by the contract actually belong to the union.
</P>
<P>
   The union also can't offer its members a deep strike fund to
help with bills and other expenses during the work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's second-largest union called a strike after talks with
the company collapsed late Tuesday night. The two sides couldn't
resolve the union's demand for higher compensation and lump-sum
bonuses. The union also wanted Boeing to guarantee a greater
portion of future wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, negotiators disagreed over Boeing's proposed
changes to existing health care and life insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps couldn't even agree on how many covered employees
walked off the job Wednesday. The company said that 15 to 20
percent of its technical workforce arrived for work Wednesday,
while 20 to 25 percent of its engineers reported for duty. That
means about 17,000 workers went on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The engineering union estimated that 95 percent of the 22,600
workers struck Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The strike caps a fruitless year-long effort to craft a
three-year contract for the company's technical community. During
that time, union members rejected two contract offers from the
company. Feb. 2, 51 percent of the voting engineers rejected
Boeing's final offer, while 62 percent of the technical workers
rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared only moderately concerned about Boeing's
first strike in four years. Boeing's stock fell 2 points to close
at 39. However, the stock fell on a day when the broader Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunged 258.44 points to close at 10699.16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing will try to act tough. They will cave a little bit,''
said a financial analyst, who requested anonymity. ``We won't know
the difference here on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Engineers pledged to change Wall Street's impression. Jeff
Medina, who works in the company's weights and balances division,
said the company won't be able to deliver any airplanes without
engineers on site to calibrate weights and perform other tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Planes aren't going anywhere,'' Joseph Asaif said as he left
Boeing's Flight Test Center and helped set up a 12-man picket team
in the rain.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials said they were still assessing the damage of
the strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is too soon to tell. We will be assessing it in the days to
come,'' said Peter Conte, a Boeing spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The labor dispute hasn't spread to Boeing engineers and
technicians in Wichita, Kan., according to Conte. Those workers
have separate SPEEA contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As strike teams set up in front of Boeing plants throughout the
Puget Sound region, negotiators said they had no plans to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Federal mediator Richard Barnes, who tried to settle the fight
earlier this week, promised to return, according to Craig Buckham,
executive board president of the engineering union. Barnes is head
of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
</P>
<P>
   However, Boeing stuck to the hard-line bargaining stance it has
adopted in recent days. The company didn't bring any new proposals
to the last two bargaining session on Monday and Tuesday and
declined to take up the union's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple of days are very emotional. (After) that
point, both parties need to come back in and talk,'' said Ragen
MacKenzie's Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   That emotion was evident at Wednesday's union rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they could bully us. They were wrong,'' Charles
Bofferding, the union's executive director, told a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30 minutes later, thousands of engineers piled out of
the stadium stands and marched calmly down to the Boeing plant.
</P>
<P>
   A diverse group of old and young, men and women, aerospace
veterans and newcomers, all pledged their support for the union's
efforts. Some have second incomes to get by on as long as the
strike lasts, others are trying to piece together loans and savings
to survive the indefinite period of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that the company won't respond,'' confided John
McTernan, an 18-year veteran in avionics systems. From Boeing's
side ``there's no give and take.''
</P>
<P>
   Police closed down three lanes of traffic and marchers stayed
within in the traffic cones marking their route. The strikers
eventually doubled back and returned to the stadium, where they
took up posts at the entrances to the sprawling Renton plant.
</P>
<P>
   Union members were particularly upset that Boeing Chairman Phil
Condit left the country in the last 24 hours. Last fall, Condit
personally intervened in negotiations with the company's largest
union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers. That union credited Condit with salvaging the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some engineers hoped Condit, who once worked as a Boeing
engineer, would play the same role in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout stands as one of the largest white-collar strikes in
recent U.S. history, rivaled only by massive New York teachers'
strikes and nursing walkouts, according to academic experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is right up there,'' said Kate Bronfenbrenner, a
professor of labor studies at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   But the union perhaps took the simplest step in its labor action
Wednesday. In the coming days it will face greater challenges, such
maintaining unity among a workforce splintered by the fact that
some strikers pay union dues and some don't.

 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Frederic Lord, a mathematician whose doctoral work at
Princeton a half-century ago laid the foundation for scoring the
fill-in-the-bubble examinations that have tormented generations of
No. 2-pencil-wielding applicants to colleges and graduate schools,
died Feb. 5 at a nursing home in Naples, Fla. He was 87, and had
lived in Naples since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Lord joined the fledgling Educational Testing Service, the
developer of the College Board exams, in March 1949 as director of
statistical analysis. He stayed for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lord did not write test questions. What he did, first as a
graduate student at Princeton and later at the testing service, was
devise a trailblazing mathematical model that enabled test writers
to categorize particular questions, based on their difficulty.
Among the ripples from his research were formulas that have allowed
the testing service to compare student performance on a range of
questions on multiple versions of the SAT in one year.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to explain the magnitude of Lord's ideas, which came
to be known as Item Response Theory, Martha Stocking, a principal
research scientist at the testing service since 1967, used a staple
of the College Board exams: an analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine in the 1900s or earlier building cars,'' Stocking
said. ``One approach would be to take a horse-drawn cart and put an
engine on it. Another approach would be, in the privacy of your own
workshop, to build a scale model of a car and then when you get the
perfect car in the scale model, then scale it up to a real-car
size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building statistical models is just like this. You take a real
situation with real data, messy as that is, and build a model that
works to explain the behavior of real data.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the College Board exams, Lord's models would
influence the Graduate Record exam, the Test of English as a
Foreign Language, the Graduate Management Admissions Test and the
Law School Admissions Test.
</P>
<P>
   That his life's work would have such an impact on higher
education was almost written in his genes.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Mather Lord was born on Nov. 12, 1912, in Hanover, N.H.
His father, Frederick Pomeroy Lord, was a professor of anatomy at
the Dartmouth Medical School. His great-great grandfather, Nathan
Lord, was Dartmouth College's sixth president, serving from 1828 to
1863. His mother, Jeanette, was a suffragette.
</P>
<P>
   Lord started on his career in science as a boy. He set off an
explosion in his family's basement when a chemistry experiment went
awry, sparing him but, as he recalled, damaging the house, said his
second wife, the former Muriel Kendall, whom he married in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Lord graduated from Dartmouth in 1936, with a bachelor's degree
in sociology. What followed was a period of some aimlessness, in
which he moved to the Midwest to explore a career as a novelist.
But he ultimately landed at the University of Minnesota, where he
earned a master's degree in educational psychology and where his
interest in test theory was ignited.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, he joined the graduate record office of the Carnegie
Foundation, a precursor to the testing service, first as a research
assistant and later as its assistant director. In 1951, having
moved to the testing service, he earned a doctorate in psychology
from Princeton. His dissertation would come to be regarded as a
major work by psychometricians, or students of testing theory.
</P>
<P>
   Lord was the author or a contributor to more than 100 books or
papers. In 1958, he expanded his dissertation into the book
``Statistical Theories of Mental Test Scores,'' written with Melvin
R. Novick, which was regarded as another milestone in test theory.
</P>
<P>
   Lord's first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1973, produced
three sons, Steven, who died in 1961; John, of Palmetto, Fla., and
Eric, of Langhorne, Pa. He is also survived by three step-children,
Conrad M. Bessemer and Robert H. Bessemer of Pittsburgh, and Diane
Carnegie Osborne of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lord officially retired from the testing service in 1982,
his work there continued until 1985, when an automobile in which he
was riding in South Africa was struck by a bus. After his prospects
for recovery were all but ruled out, Lord emerged from a coma after
21 days, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of his later years tending his beloved orchids and
playing bridge. He was a bridge life master.
</P>
<P>
   Lord's wife said that his mind remained keen into his final
days, despite his being tethered to an oxygen tank, a result of
emphysema and congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played bridge,'' Lord recalled of one of their last visits.
``He was almost annoyed with me. I made a bid. He didn't think I
was using the rules properly.''

ARTHUR SEELEN, 76, CO-OWNER OF NEW YORK'S DRAMA BOOK SHOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ohio)   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur Seelen, a former actor who with his wife,
Rozanne, owned the Drama Book Shop in Manhattan, the oldest
performing-arts bookstore in the United States, died Feb. 7 at his
home in Manhattan. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 Seelen bought the store from Marjorie Seligman, who
founded it in 1923. Seelen and his wife, who survives him, were
married in 1980 and ran the business together.
</P>
<P>
   The store, which has 40,000 titles, including plays, biographies
and theatrical histories, ranging from the popular to the academic
and esoteric, is a meeting ground for actors, playwrights,
directors and others. On a bulletin board at the entrance aspiring
performers can find out about work opportunities in and out of the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Born Arthur Seelenfreund in Brooklyn, Seelen graduated from City
College of New York. While working as a chemical engineer in
Columbus, Ohio, he acted in plays and then continued his theater
career in New York. He appeared in children's theater and on
Broadway, as an understudy, in ``The Wall,'' Millard Lampell's 1960
adaptation of the John Hersey novel.
</P>
<P>
   Seelen, who took pride in the variety of the books in his store,
said that his motto was, ``If we don't have something here, we want
to know why.'' &QL;

LIFE-SIZE PLUSH TOY IS A REAL DOLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SUZIE ST. JOHN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Susan Stofsky has the perfect man in her life. He
doesn't hog the bed or snore and is great for cuddling. Best of
all, he doesn't have a mind of his own.
</P>
<P>
   He's a plush doll called the Huggable Hunk and stands 5 feet 8
inches tall, weighs a trim 13 pounds that looks more like a buff
170 and sports ripped abs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $159, he's not for everybody,'' Stofsky said. ``He's a
frivolous luxury item that's a lot cheaper than going to a
therapist.''
</P>
<P>
   The Van Nuys entrepreneur owns This Little Piggy Inc., a company
that markets the hand-sewn, plush doll she created.
</P>
<P>
   Hunk has big blue eyes, dark, shaggy hair and wears a pair of
black silk boxers. He arrives with a long-stemmed red silk rose and
a personalized letter. On his behalf, Valentine's Day and birthday
cards are sent to his owner during their first year of
togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   Stofsky hit on the idea last summer as she was saying goodbye to
a boyfriend who was returning home to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about him that was so sweet was that he was cuddly.
I had never had that in relationship and realized I was really
going to miss that part of it,'' Stofsky explained.
</P>
<P>
   She thought about getting a giant stuffed animal to snuggle with
and then figured there must be a big doll that could fill the
boyfriend void.
</P>
<P>
   Her surprise at the lack of life-size dolls or body pillows led
to Hunk's inception.
</P>
<P>
   She pitched her idea to a toy company she worked for in New York
called Prime Designs, Ltd. They showed some interest, so Stofsky
started sketching out her ideas and faxing them to the company,
which is now based in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would send them something that looked like Brad Pitt and I
would get back Howdy Doody,'' she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in September, the doll was ready for review and she made
the trip to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   After the design was approved, 200-plus Hunks were shipped to a
fulfillment house in Nevada, where the dolls hang out until they
find companionship.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, the former associate producer for Warner
Bros. said sales are brisk through Stofsky's Web site,
www.huggablehunk.com or by calling (888) 930-9109.
</P>
<P>
   Stofsky said deals are in the works to have the doll sold at
local outlets of national retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how fast everything has happened,'' said Stofsky,
whose future plans include designing more dolls in varying skin,
hair and eye colors, as well as a line of dress and play clothes
for the dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to make more fun things, nothing serious. I like
to see people happy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the response has been pretty favorable, especially
after Hunk made a guest appearance on local news programs and on
ABC's ``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   One customer is Esrin Gozukzil of suburban Brentwood, who found
herself complaining about being alone when her husband was out of
town on business. So she decided to try out a Huggable Hunk.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a month after buying one, she can't stop raving about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so comforting to have him in bed while my husband is
gone,'' said Gozukzil, who works as a producer's assistant. ``I
love cuddling with him, too, but the best part is dressing him. I
can't even do that to my husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Gozukzil said her husband thinks it's great, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sit and have a beer together and I like hanging out with
a room full of men,'' she said. ``He's almost as good as the real
thing.''

A TACTIC THAT CAN BACKFIRE: A RELUCTANT DEFENSE WITNESS
</HEADLINE>
  (With DIALLO-TRIAL) 
(nk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The lawyers representing the four officers in the
Amadou Diallo case faced a problem Wednesday that defense attorneys
usually try to avoid at all costs: calling a witness to the stand
without first knowing what the answers will be.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, defense lawyers would choose not to put such a
witness on the stand, even if the witness was known to have
information favorable to their clients. The risk lies in whether
the witness might also have information, unknown to the defense,
that is unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   The events in court here Wednesday illustrated that danger. The
lawyers for the officers called a witness, Schrrie Elliott, to the
stand, based primarily on her statement in an interview last year
on WNBC-TV, that someone yelled ``gun'' before Diallo was shot. Her
testimony, the lawyers calculated, would show that the officers
thought their lives were in danger before they opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   But while Elliott did say that she had heard someone yell
``gun,'' she said it was not impossible that Diallo, rather than
one of the four officers who shot him, had said it. But perhaps
more damaging was the cross-examination. Prosecutors led Elliott,
based on her grand jury testimony, which had not been disclosed to
the defense, through a devastating description of Diallo's last
moments. She described four officers emerging from their car, guns
drawn, to form a semi-circle, and then a fireworks-like series of
shots, many of them after Diallo had fallen to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers representing the officers said they thought the
issue of whether someone had yelled ``gun'' was too important to
keep Elliott off the stand. ``We weighed our risks and we think
there's enough upside here,'' said John D. Patten, who represents
Officer Sean Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawyers said the defense could have reduced its risk
in several ways. Only one of the defense lawyers could have called
Elliott as a witness, which would have allowed the other three
lawyers to cross-examine her and try to discredit any damaging
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, it's a good thing to call her,'' said Kyle B.
Watters, a lawyer in private practice who represented the Diallos
in their civil case against the officers. But calling her as a
joint witness ``was a tactical error,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers also could have limited the scope of questioning
to what Elliott had heard, not what she had seen, other lawyers
said. Or they could have made a motion to make her a hostile
witness before her testimony, which would have allowed them to try
to discredit her testimony if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the hostile witness motion was made only after the
prosecution's cross-examination, and it was granted only after
Elliott had given a graphic and emotional description of what she
had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Professor James A. Cohen of Fordham University Law School said
that defense lawyers should have recognized that Elliott could have
been more damaging than helpful because two judges had declined to
classify her previous statements as helpful to the defense. State
law requires prosecutors to give the defense only the previous
statements of witnesses whom they plan to call, or of witnesses who
could be helpful to the defense. But two judges , in separate
rulings, declined to give Elliott's prior testimony to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the trial, defense lawyers made
fruitless attempts to get Elliott to meet with them. They decided
they needed her anyway. When they put her on the stand Wednesday,
Stephen C. Worth, a lawyer for Officer Edward McMellon, made clear
that Elliott had not cooperated with the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes in a criminal case, you have to call people who
don't want to be called as witnesses,'' he said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because the judge ruled that Elliott is an adverse witness,
the defense lawyers will have the chance to cross-examine her, and
they will have 50 pages of her previous statements _ including an
interview with the FBI and her grand jury appearance _ with which
to try to discredit her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The danger, Cohen and others said, is that if they go too far in
undermining her credibility, they also risk diminishing or even
eliminating the value of what brought her to the stand for the
defense in the first place.

WHERE AND HOW TO HOUSE THE AGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y _ In a span of 35 years, Ruth Dewey has
led the Girl Scouts here and presided over both the Board of
Education and the Friends of the Library. Now, at 77, she looks
forward to living out her final years here and believes she has the
perfect place to do it: a proposed continuing-care retirement
community, the sort of place that lets you decline gently into old
age with a range of supports.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a snag. A group of residents is trying to stop the
project and its six new buildings. They warn about dangerous zoning
precedents and increased traffic and argue that the project's scale
is too big for this tiny riverfront village.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel you've put in your two cents of work for the
community,'' Dewey said. ``There's an assumption that the elderly
are somehow different from the community, that we're not part of
it. But I'm not somebody whose interests should now be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The skirmish here is part of a broader battle unfolding in
suburban communities, particularly in Westchester County, where the
65-and-over population is expected to grow by 26 percent in the
next 20 years. Those projections, coupled with the county's
affluence and a recent loosening of state regulations, have put
Westchester on the radar screen of developers eager to build the
type of upscale housing that lends older people a hand with daily
activities.
</P>
<P>
   And so the county's older residents find themselves asking
neighbors and elected officials to make room for them at a time
when many feel that congestion and development have reached a
critical mass. The resulting clash is providing a revealing glimpse
of generational and real estate politics in the New York suburbs,
often playing out as a conflict between the housing values of young
professionals and the housing needs of their parents' generation.
</P>
<P>
   Developers and advocates for the elderly say the kind of
supportive housing designed to keep the elderly out of nursing
homes has swept the South and West with little opposition. The New
York region has posed a tougher challenge, and Westchester County
has perhaps put up the most formidable resistance of all.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, dozens of projects representing about
7,600 units of housing for the elderly have been proposed. Many
have been approved and are being built. But many others have become
ensnared in high-powered local resistance _ opposition Web sites
are whipped up and lawyers retained before a formal application can
even be presented to a planning board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're heavily into New Jersey and Massachusetts and
Connecticut, and New York is our only big void,'' said Michael J.
Giacopelli Jr., senior vice president of development for Marriott
Senior Living Services in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The company, with 143 housing developments for the elderly in 29
states, has had five separate proposals for elderly housing fail in
Westchester and Long Island over the last two years. ``There are a
lot of barriers to entry,'' he said. ``Zoning codes don't even
recognize the use in many cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Private groups and public agencies working with the elderly find
the issue a source of rising frustration. ``What communities are
saying is that when you become too frail to live independently,
there's no place for you,'' said Mae Carpenter, director of the
Westchester County Office for the Aging.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, the vehemence of the opposition has to do with
the special nature of the housing. Developers, whether for-profit
companies or nonprofit organizations, want to put the housing for
the elderly in or near residential neighborhoods so that occupants
feel part of a community.
</P>
<P>
   The projects, however, are not purely residential, and that is
the problem. Like hotels, they rise higher than two stories and
have dining rooms, laundry facilities and 24-hour staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents are quick to point out that they are not
``anti-senior.'' Indeed, some of the most active foes of such
proposals, like 72-year-old Malvin Gersfeld of Ardsley, are
themselves retired and have the time to digest environmental impact
statements the size of phone books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of senior housing is great for those who can afford
it,'' Gersfeld said. ``But we don't want it because it will destroy
what little green space we have left.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gersfeld is leading the opposition to a proposed senior housing
complex on 12 acres in Ardsley, in Westchester. The developer,
Hassett Belfer Senior Housing of Great Neck, on Long Island, needs
a zoning change for the project, which would offer three levels of
care and charge a monthly rent. But the community's protests, plus
a preliminary thumbs-down from the planning board, have sent the
company back to the drafting table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with a lot of opposition, and we are resubmitting a new
plan with fewer units and addressing the concerns,'' said Andrew B.
Belfer, a partner in the development company.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the plan outnumber opponents, Mayor Sam Abate of
Ardsley said, but he fears they are growing anxious. ``When I
campaigned around the community, one of the comments I got from
seniors was, `Will it be built before I die?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns about the effect on neighborhoods, some
opponents worry about repercussions for school districts, because
elderly voters are commonly assumed to oppose school budgets.
Another fear is whether the current rash of proposals could
saturate the market for housing for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Hastings-on-Hudson, where there is a proposal to create
a continuing-care retirement community called Andrus on Hudson on
the grounds of an existing retirement home, the zoning implications
of the plan have taken a complicated turn.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid being accused of seeking a preferential zoning change
specifically for its property, Beth Abraham Health Services, a
nonprofit health-care network in the Bronx and a sponsor of the
project, has asked the village to create a ``floating zone'' for
senior housing that could, in theory, apply to three other parcels
in the village.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic has created a small furor, as village residents
envision a glut of complexes. ``People think we don't want any
senior housing, and that is absolutely not the case,'' said Leslie
Chervokas, 41, a chairwoman of the Hastings Community Coalition, an
opposition group. ``What we don't want are four of these very large
facilities, because the residential character of the community
can't sustain them.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other senior housing plans, Andrus on Hudson is geared
toward elderly residents with deep pockets. The entrance fees would
run from $209,000 to $665,000; monthly rents are expected to range
from $1,995 to $4,550.
</P>
<P>
   Those projects are affordable only to elderly people with
household incomes of at least $50,000 a year. That includes fewer
than 25 percent of the county's residents who are 65 and older.
</P>
<P>
   But soaring real estate prices have allowed many older residents
who never considered themselves wealthy to sell their homes at
prices that make even the high-dollar projects like Andrus on
Hudson affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth and Donald Dewey paid $30,000 for a house in 1965 that they
recently sold for $400,000. ``When we came here we never thought we
could afford something like this,'' Dewey said, referring to Andrus
on Hudson, where she and her husband have already secured a future
home with a $1,000 deposit.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, a retired Columbia University economics
professor, are excited about plans for an outdoor pool surrounded
by gardens and the smart apartments with magnificent river views.
But the main reason they want to live in a place like Andrus on
Hudson, they say, is to avoid feeling like a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cared for my mother and my mother-in-law, and I thought how
nice it would be to decline without all these crises, without
having to involve one's own children in crises,'' Dewey said. ``If
I fall and break my hip, my daughter doesn't have to come from
California and say, `What on earth am I going to do with my
mother?'''

 THE AD CAMPAIGN: BUSH ATTACKS McCAIN ON FINANCE PLAN  
 (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second radio advertisement by George W. Bush's
presidential campaign is running in South Carolina, which has its
primary Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: South Carolina's attorney general, Charlie Condon,
says: ``The Charleston union riot reminds us why South Carolina is
a right-to-work state. Unfortunately, big labor comes out a big
winner in John McCain's campaign finance plan. Senator Strom
Thurmond says it would be disastrous for conservatives. Almost
every conservative senator opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCain plan curtails free speech rights of individuals and
citizens groups, limiting what they can do in elections. But it
does not prohibit union bosses from taking mandatory dues from
working people and spending them to elect liberal Democrats. That's
not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain proudly stood with Bill Bradley to tout his plan. It
tells us something that Bradley, Clinton, Gore, Kennedy and the
liberal media all support the McCain plan. The McCain plan would
give union bosses and the liberal media more control over elections
by restricting First Amendment rights of individuals and citizens'
groups. Those are not South Carolina values.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The commercial paints with a broad brush. It correctly
notes that Sen. John McCain's proposed legislation for changing
campaign financing does not include a ``paycheck protection''
provision that would prohibit labor unions from taking the
mandatory union dues of workers to spend millions on political
activities and organizing that benefit Democrats primarily. But
McCain's plan would regulate the so-called soft money contributions
to political parties from labor unions, just as it would regulate
such donations from corporations and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: In the course of a legitimate critique of McCain's
plan, the commercial deftly, and cynically, evokes as many
conservative buzzwords and liberal bogeymen as will fit into half a
minute. The clear goal, a glimpse into part of Bush's strategy for
winning South Carolina, is to rally the loyal Republicans on the
right, a significant slice of the state's primary pie. Bush is
clearly counting on them.

YET AGAIN, RANGERS CAN'T BEAT THE DEVILS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The calendar reads February, but the
Rangers and the Devils displayed playoff intensity Wednesday night
as they met for the last time in the regular season, playing before
the first sellout of the season at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the rivals meet in the playoffs or not, the Rangers have
to wait until next season to try to end an embarrassing run of
futility against the Devils, who extended their regular-season
unbeaten streak against the Rangers to 19 games (13-0-6) with a 4-1
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had back Brian Leetch, their captain and best
player, but they were missing four other players. The Devils lost
two important players to ejections in the early stages Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Power-play goals on three consecutive manpower advantages for
the Devils made the difference in a game of such high intensity
that even Scott Gomez, the usually passive rookie of the Devils,
got into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who had one power-play goal on 17 attempts in the
previous five games, feasted on the Rangers' penalty killers, who
had allowed just one goal on 18 attempts in the previous five
games.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, Brian Rafalski and Scott Niedermayer scored the
power-play goals and Patrik Elias sealed the victory with an
empty-net goal for the Devils (34-15-6-4), who improved their home
record to 22-4-2, best in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur faced 27 shots for the Devils, and his only
mistake was on a power-play goal by Valery Kamensky in the first
period for the Rangers (23-24-8-3). Kirk McLean, replacing the
injured Mike Richter, had 35 saves for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers got Leetch back a game or two before they had
expected, but three players were sidelined because of injuries. Two
occurred in the 2-2 tie the rivals played a night earlier at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Fleury and Kim Johnsson each missed a game for the first
time this season. Fleury sustained a bruised right shoulder in the
third period on Tuesday, and Johnsson had been hit over the left
eye with Gomez's stick late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Richter and Adam Graves were also out again, Richter because of
a knee injury from the skills competition at the All-Star Game, and
Graves because of the death Monday of one of his infant twin sons.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils lost Claude Lemieux and Lyle Odelein for the night
with 7 minutes 1 second left in the opening period in a melee that
started with a fight between Gomez and the Rangers' Tim Taylor
before several others from both teams got involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A minute later, the Rangers were awarded their first of four
manpower advantages in the opening period. They capitalized on the
second power play, when Kamensky, standing in the middle of the
left circle with 7:33 left in the period, one-timed Radek Dvorak's
pass from the other side for his seventh goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A tripping penalty against Knuble proved costly as Holik tied
the score on a shot from the slot with 2:52 left after a pass from
Patrik Elias. It was Holik's 19th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took command from the early stages of the second
period and took a two-goal lead on power-play goals by Rafalski and
Niedermayer. Rafalski's came at 5:50, when he found plenty of space
on the left side and and one-timed Holik's pass for his second goal
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Niedermayer's goal, his fifth of the season and first since New
Year's Day in Boston, came less than two minutes later from close
range on the left after Brendan Morrison fanned in the slot.  &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Alfred Boehm, a publishing entrepreneur who
brought the Guinness Book of World Records to the United States and
gave the book its name, died Feb. 6 at his home in Manhattan. He
was 86.
</P>
<P>
   The short, cherubic man with the immaculate goatee published
thousands of titles at the company he founded, Sterling Publishing
Co., but his road to fame began with his discovery in 1956 of a
pile of books languishing unsold on the shelves of a Boston
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm raced to London and snapped up the licensing rights to
what was then called the Guinness Book of Superlatives, paying no
money down, only a percentage of whatever books he could sell. His
son Lincoln, now president of Sterling, said that one of his own
first jobs was ripping off the book jackets of 10,000 books in
order to change the name to the Guinness Book of World Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``He figured ``superlative' was a word nobody would
understand,'' Lincoln Boehm explained.
</P>
<P>
   The older Boehm also Americanized the book by adding baseball
records, a not insignificant addition in a tome founded by the
Guinness Brewery in 1951 to settle barroom arguments. In no time at
all, he was selling hundreds of thousands of books and licensing
the name to everything from museums to paper cups. Soon Sterling
and Guinness were divvying up $1.7 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   His success was so dramatic that more people knew the name
Guinness as a book than as a creamy stout. The result was a series
of legal fights in the 1980s, culminating in Guinness' buying back
the license for $8 million in 1989. A federal judge described
Guinness' attempt to discredit Boehm's license as ``blatantly
unreasonable cupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boehm had a ball with the book while he had it. He was
regularly featured on the Guinness Book of World Records television
show with David Frost as a judge of arcane world records. He
disqualified the man who caught a grape in his mouth from 270 feet
away on the grounds that it was not a widely practiced event. For
various reasons, he also nixed the fellow who somehow fit 150
clothespins on his nose. The man who ate a bicycle fared no better.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the disputes involved deeper research, like the time
he discovered the world's oldest man wasn't. It happened in 1979
when he found the marriage certificate for Charlie Smith, who had
claimed to be 136. He was a mere 104.
</P>
<P>
   ``He blew it when he got married when he was 35,'' Boehm said.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's offices on Park Avenue South were regularly crowded
with extremely fat, tall, short and peculiarly talented folks. They
included Morris Katz, who held the record for painting more
paintings than anybody else. Boehm seized the opportunity to kill
two birds with one stone by publishing his book, ``Paint Fast and
Loose.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1980 article in The New York Times, N.R. Kleinfield
suggested that Boehm himself had a decidedly impish look about him,
suggesting he might be about to set a record for ``balancing the
most corn cobs on his head or devouring the most crayons during a
solar eclipse.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan on Feb. 6, the same date he died. He
graduated in 1934 from Columbia, where he majored in sociology and
edited The Columbia Spectator. He then worked for a string of
publishing companies, mastering the skills of editing, production
and sales.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 he founded Sterling. The business was created in a phone
booth in the Hotel Pennsylvania in Manhattan where Boehm would go
at 5 p.m. to take calls out of earshot of his employer. He told the
story at the company's 50th anniversary last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling's first book was Stampography, the first of thousands
of how-to books it would publish. Boehm wrote dozens of books,
including a popular series of 64-page geography texts from which
students were encouraged to cut out pictures for school reports. He
would personally visit all the countries. ``It also made for a tax
deduction, of course,'' his son said. Sterling expanded overseas,
with sales between $50 million and $100 million, the younger Boehm
said. It currently has more than 3,000 titles in print.
</P>
<P>
   Boehm, who lived for years in a Madison Avenue penthouse,
married either five or six times, his son said. In addition to his
son Lincoln he is survived by his wife, Nijole; three daughters,
Suzanne Farwell of Seattle, Diana Kerman of Portland, Ore., and
Emily Partin of Mayapur, India; another son, David L.; seven
grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   As record-keeper for the planet, Boehm was often well poised to
pick up on emerging trends. For one thing, he noticed goldfish
getting progressively smaller, making eating a record number of
them less of an accomplishment. ``The goldfish got down to the size
of caviar,'' he said in explaining why the Guinness Book of World
Records dropped competitive goldfish consumption.

PATAKI CALLS FOR END TO TIME LIMIT IN RAPE CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki Wednesday called for an end to
the legal time limit for prosecuting accused rapists and other
violent criminals, because rapidly expanding DNA databases could
now be used to identify them long after the crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few crimes as heinous and violent as rape, which too
often leaves the victim with severe and long-lasting physical and
emotional scars,'' Pataki said. ``Currently, the law imposes a
five-year statute of limitation on the prosecution of rape, while
the trauma for the victims can last a lifetime. That is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's comments Wednesday came in response to an article in
The New York Times that said that law enforcement officials were
racing to use DNA evidence in a backlog of rape cases, including
hundreds in New York City alone, before the cases expired.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also expressed his support
Wednesday for repealing the time limit in rapes and other violent
sexual assaults. ``We will almost certainly have cases in which DNA
analysis conclusively identifies the rapist, but we will not be
able to prosecute the case because it is more than five years
old,'' Giuliani wrote in a letter to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   But several defense lawyers said that abolishing time limits
would make it more difficult for suspects to find witnesses and to
mount an effective defense. ``You're taking away the ways they can
defend themselves and basing the entire case on DNA results _ and
those are not perfect,'' said Vincent E. Doyle III, a defense
lawyer in Buffalo who is chairman of the criminal justice section
of the New York State Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican who has lobbied for an expansion of the
state's DNA database, did not specify which violent crimes other
than rape should be exempted from a statute of limitations. Under
current state law, only the most serious crimes like murder and
first-degree kidnapping may be prosecuted at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, the governor's press secretary, said Pataki had
directed Katherine N. Lapp, the state's criminal justice
coordinator, to make recommendations for a bill that the governor
would submit during the current legislative session, which is
scheduled to run through June.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Dale M. Volker, a Republican from the Buffalo area
and a former policeman, said he supported Pataki's plan. ``It's not
just about solving old crimes,'' said Volker. ``You may get someone
off the streets who is still committing rapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a Democrat who heads the Assembly
committee overseeing criminal laws, said he would have to study the
issue further. ``It doesn't sound like a bad idea on the face of
it, but I'd like to hear what the other side has to say on it,'' he
said.

SID ABEL, 81, HOCKEY STAR ON A FAMED RED WINGS LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sid Abel, the Hockey Hall of Famer who starred with the Detroit
Red Wings and was later a coach, general manager and broadcaster in
the National Hockey League, died Feb. 8 at a hospital in Farmington
Hills, Mich. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Abel won the Hart Trophy as the league's most valuable player in
1949 and for several seasons he centered Detroit's Production Line,
with Gordie Howe on right wing and Ted Lindsay on left wing.
</P>
<P>
   Inducted as a player into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1969, Abel
knew the hockey business from many perspectives. As a player, he
married the secretary to the Red Wings' general manager and later
he was considered a ``players' coach'' who was sensitive to their
moods and needs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Abel's career lasted long into the modern era of
expansion, his roots were in the old six-team league, when players
traveled by train, salaries were low and grudges were well nursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hockey for money, but we would play the Toronto
Maple Leafs for nothing,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings won the Stanley Cup three times when Abel played
for them, with their most memorable championship coming in 1950,
when they beat the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   In the first series of the two-round tournament, Detroit lost
Howe when a collision with a Toronto player left Howe in the
hospital with a life-threatening brain injury. In the final game of
the finals, Abel, the captain, scored a goal in a game at Olympia
Stadium that went into overtime tied at 3-3. The Red Wings won on a
goal by Pete Babando.
</P>
<P>
   Many hockey books include pictures of a weary, sweat-soaked Abel
kissing the silver trophy that night.
</P>
<P>
   Abel's Production Line got its name because it produced goals
and because his team played in the Motor City, where the economy
was based on cars produced on assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Howe was known as Hockey, Lindsay was Terrible Ted and Abel was
called Boot Nose because of an altercation with Montreal's Maurice
(the Rocket) Richard. After Howe flattened Richard in a fight, Abel
skated by and asked him ``How do you like that?'' and added a
reference to Richard's French-Canadian ethnicity. Richard responded
by re-arranging Abel's nose with a punch.
</P>
<P>
   Howe, reflecting on the fight, said: ``Today, if you called
someone what Sid called Rocket, you'd get called up before a
judge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any question about his leadership,'' Howe
said. ``Sid was very much respected.''
</P>
<P>
   In a playing career that spanned 12 seasons with the Red Wings
and 2 with the Blackhawks, Abel scored 189 goals and had 283
assists during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Gerald Abel was born on Feb. 22, 1918, in Melville,
Saskatchewan, played as a junior for the Saskatoon Wesleys and the
Flin Flon Bombers before turning professional with Detroit in the
1938-39 season. His career was interrupted for almost three seasons
during World War II, when he served in the Royal Canadian Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   He left Detroit in 1952 to play and coach for the Chicago
Blackhawks. He returned to the Red Wings in 1957 as a coach, added
general manager's duties in 1962, but left the organization in 1971
and worked with teams in St. Louis and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Abel returned to Detroit as a broadcaster in 1976 and became
popular for his insights and speech patterns. Speaking in a Western
Canadian accent and verb forms, Abel would tell his Motor City
listeners ``Montreal are a skating club'' or ``Detroit are pressing
on the power play.''
</P>
<P>
   Abel was blunt on the air and sometimes angered management with
his tart observations. But fans admired his honesty even while
mimicking his voice. For several seasons, when the Red Wings
struggled in the early 1980s, Abel the broadcaster was more popular
than any player.
</P>
<P>
   His No. 12 was retired in 1995, hung between Howe's 9 and
Lindsay's 7.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday night's Red Wings game at Joe Louis Arena, hours
after his death, the fans stood for a moment of silence in memory
of Abel, and the banner that bears his number was briefly lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Abel is survived by his wife, Gloria; a son, Gerald; a daughter,
Linda Johnson; a brother, Don; five grandchildren and five
great-grandchildren.

MARBURY'S STROLL IS COSTLY AS NETS LOSE TO SIXERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Just when it seemed as if the New Jersey Nets had
lost a game in every way imaginable, they came up with a new
blunder in Wednesday's debacle at the First Union Center. After
wasting a 21-point second-quarter lead, the Nets blew a chance to
win on the final shot when their star point guard, Stephon Marbury,
committed the strangest of turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With 22.7 seconds left, the Philadelphia 76ers' Allen Iverson
(41 points) hit a 3-pointer to tie the game at 90-90. The Nets'
Keith Van Horn, who had hit a 3-pointer moments earlier, inbounded
the ball to Kerry Kittles, who then gave the ball to Marbury. With
Eric Snow guarding him, Marbury began casually walking the ball
upcourt in preparation for the final shot. But he took too long,
and the officials whistled him for a 10-second violation, thus
giving the ball to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, the 76ers gave the ball to Iverson, who drove
for a four-footer on the baseline against Kittles. His shot rimmed
out before being tipped by Theo Ratliff. As Ratliff's shot was
heading out of the cylinder, Larry Hughes leaped high over everyone
to tip in the ball at the buzzer. That gave Philadelphia a dramatic
92-90 victory and sent the Nets to the locker room in shame.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first in three games for the Nets and it
dropped them to a 19-30 mark heading into the All-Star Game break.
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering their once-commanding lead, the Nets led,
75-70, at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Johnny Newman
started things off right by opening the period with a 3-pointer to
increase the lead to eight. Philadelphia cut the margin to five
before Marbury seemed to push it back to seven when Ratliff blocked
his driving layup with five minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Mike Mathis, whistled Ratliff for goaltending and
two points points appeared on the scoreboard for the Nets. But Tim
Donaghy, another official, overruled Mathis and called for a jump
ball, which the 76ers controlled. Soon, the Nets led by only 79-77.
</P>
<P>
   With 3 minutes 37 seconds remaining, Iverson drove to launch a
five-foot bank shot that tied it at 81-81. After a 3-point play by
Marbury and subsequent basket by Iverson, Van Horn put the Nets
ahead 87-83 with a 3-pointer at the 2:42 mark. It was a huge shot
not only for the Nets but also for Van Horn, who had played poorly
throughout and had not scored since the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, baskets by Ratliff and Iverson knotted things again
at 87-87 with 1:27 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were exceptional for 21 of the first 24 minutes of
play. They executed strongly, moved the ball with crispness and
shot with accuracy. They took a 26-18 lead after one quarter,
behind 50 percent shooting and scoring contributions from seven
players.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn led the balanced attack with seven points, three
rebounds and two steals, while Gill followed with six points. It
was basically seven on one as Philadelphia tried fruitlessly to
counter with Iverson. He did his part, scoring 12 points against a
befuddled Kerry Kittles on 5-of-7 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets looked ready to run away with their third straight
blowout victory early in the second. On the strength of a powerful
17-5 run, they turned a 9-point game into a 50-29 lead five minutes
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Burrell led the spurt with some tremendous outside
shooting, hitting three 3-pointers to finish the half 4 of 4 from
behind the arc. His last triple made it 48-29 and ignited an
outburst of boos from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' demise began when coach Don Casey substituted for the
hot man. With 2:43 left in the half, and the Nets leading by 54-35,
Casey put Van Horn in for Burrell. It may have seemed like a good
move but it quickly turned disastrous as a rash of Nets turnovers
and 76ers baskets ensued.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn started the parade of errors with a bad pass less than
30 seconds after entering the game. The Nets committed three more
turnovers in the next minute, and Philadelphia converted on the
bulk of them to chop the deficit to 54-45 with 49.6 seconds left.
Marbury picked up his third foul amid the ruckus and went to the
bench with 1:15 left.
</P>
<P>
   Intermission did nothing to quell the 76ers' surge or heat up
the frigid, butter-fingered Nets. Instead of coming out to protect
their lead, the Nets missed their first six shots and turned the
ball over four times in the first five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That enabled the 76ers to move within two points, and if not for
their own miscues, they would have had the lead. Marbury ended the
drought with a breakaway dunk to put the Nets ahead, 58-56, but a
3-point play by Snow moments later gave the 76ers its first lead
since 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Now in a battle, the Nets began playing again. The teams traded
the lead several times before the 76ers moved ahead, 66-62, on a
3-pointer by Aaron McKie. Flying to the rescue like a caped
superhero was Burrell, who answered McKie's basket with his fifth
3-pointer to begin what would become a 13-4 run at the end of the
quarter.

DEAL BLENDS DAY TRADING AND AN ELECTRONIC NETWORK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tradescape.com Inc., one of the nation's largest day trading
firms, has agreed to pay $100 million in stock to acquire MarketXT
Inc., an electronic trading system that offers evening stock
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Tradescape.com, a privately held company in New York, acquired
MarketXT by offering stock to a group of investors that includes
some of the biggest names on Wall Street, such as Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter and Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, scheduled to be announced Thursday, creates a new kind
of hybrid on Wall Street, a company that is part day trading firm,
part online broker and part electronic communications network.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes just a week after Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the
nation's largest online broker, said it would pay about $487
million in stock to acquire Cybercorp Inc., a day trading company
that specializes in software.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Tradescape.com said they would direct their huge
corps of day traders _ many of whom will get access to the market
through the Internet _ to MarketXT, an electronic trading network
that aims to give investors and traders faster and cheaper access
to the stock market by using Tradescape.com software.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the next generation of technology; smart software that
routes orders to the best execution,'' said Michael O. Sanderson, a
former executive of Reuters' Instinet electronic trading network
who is chief executive of MarketXT. ``You won't have to have five
screens on your desk.''
</P>
<P>
   MarketXT, which began offering trades after the closing bell on
Wall Street last October, has been struggling with a service that
trades only about 100,000 shares a night. Tradescape.com, which
generates volume of about 40 million shares a day from its 3,500
day traders, should buoy the company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will also benefit from a $100 million
investment from a group of investors led by the Softbank Corp.,
executives said. By spring, MarketXT plans to operate as an
electronic communications network, from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily,
offering regular, after-hours and pre-market trading to online
investors and day traders, executives say.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to license software and to open its
system to other online brokers and institutional investors, who may
now have the opportunity to bypass some major Wall Street brokers
and gain access to the market on their own, Tradescape.com
executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Omar S. Amanat, the 27-year-old founder and chief executive at
Tradescape.com, said the company plans to close all of its
bricks-and-mortar day trading offices in favor of remote access
through a high-speed Internet link. He said that the day trading
software the company developed offers a feature that finds the best
price, called smart routing, and has direct access to the stock
market, something online brokers are now scrambling to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street has been blindsided by the evolution of innovative
technology in this industry and now they're trying to catch up,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ETrade has been in talks for several months to acquire
Tradescape.com, according to people close to the negotiations.
Officials at ETrade and Tradescape declined comment on the talks
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, however, said that Wall Street is beginning to take a
second look at day trading firms, which have come under fire from
regulators and federal officials for violating trading rules and
engaging in speculative trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day trading volumes at one time were a curiosity that people
sneered at or disparaged,'' he said. ``But Tradescape's volume is
huge, and their software is great; that's why they've become
attractive. That's Wall Street for you _ things have changed.''

MAGNIFICENT SEVEN BAIL OUT THE KNICKS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE, Wisc. _ Operating in his own time zone, Latrell
Sprewell spent Tuesday night in his own bed, most of Wednesday with
his family, and finally got around to his team less than half an
hour before tipoff Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At least he was in the locker room at halftime. At least he did
not miss the impassioned speech delivered by the spindly
gray-haired sage of the team, the unassuming David Wingate. For
months, Wingate had been clapping his hands and urging his team on
in a suit. Wednesday night, it was different.
</P>
<P>
   After being activated before the game, Wingate was in uniform,
and had every right to stand up, raise his voice, and inspire a
Knick team that had been down by 19 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Hey, we have too much talent in here to lose,'''
Wingate said. ``We have a lot of pride, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell took note, then took off. After giving up unlimited
points to the larger Glenn Robinson, after turning the ball over in
an unfocused flurry, Sprewell finally arrived mentally to prod his
team into an amazing turnaround. From the sideline, Jeff Van Gundy,
who used just seven players on his depleted roster, played six of
them 25 minutes or more and squeezed 40-plus minutes out of
Sprewell, Allan Houston and Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   All three of them, plus Charlie Ward, scored 20 or more points.
It was the first time since 1992 that that had happened. Not only
did the core Knicks hold up, they tapped the spirits in their weary
bodies and unearthed a furious defensive effort to overtake the
Milwaukee Bucks in the fourth quarter, coming away with an
improbable 109-103 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Gate said,'' Van Gundy said, referring to Wingate, ```Woo!'
That says it all. That was a helluva win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It came, in part, after Sprewell's revival. After showing up at
Wednesday morning's shoot-around late and sleepy-eyed, his late
arrival to the game seemed to effect his first-half focus. While
Robinson exploited the inattentive Sprewell for 16 points, Sprewell
scored just 4. In the third quarter, things began to change. By the
end of the game, Sprewell had scored 27, handed out 7 assists and
held Robinson to just 4 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he does come in late, you now he's going to be focused to
make up for it,'' said Allan Houston (22 points), who upped his
defense on a bad ankle and held Ray Allen to 9 second-half points.
``I don't recommend it, but I'm glad he played like that. At the
end of the day, he played his butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Ewing. He scored 20 points and had a key rebound off a
missed free throw by Sprewell that he turned into a field goal,
giving the Knicks a 99-95 lead with 2:35 left in the game. This
after he'd just given the Knicks their first lead of the game with
a fade-away jumper at the 3:07 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks comeback began in the third quarter. They used a
29-13 run to draw within 1 point of the Bucks. By the end of the
third, they had out-rebounded the Bucks, 13-7, out-shot them 60
percent to 30 percent and out-hustled them to every loose ball. A
dormant Sprewell came alive to score 12 third-quarter points and
helped give his team a chance to pull off a win.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks tied the game, 79-79, on a 3-pointer by Charlie Ward
with 11 minutes left in the game. But the Knicks could not take the
lead, repeatedly giving up a basket, and then tying the game. They
had a chance to take the lead with 3:33 left in the game. Down
95-94, Houston missed a jumper, Thomas came up with the rebound and
Ewing faded away for a go-ahead jumper with 3:07 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then their defense really kicked in. In the next 45 seconds, the
Knicks forced Allen and Sam Cassell into turnovers.

ANALYST'S REVIEW BOOSTS MALL KIOSK STOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES - A brief mention on Bloomberg Television had a huge
impact on GenesisIntermedia.com Inc. on Wednesday. Investors took
notice of the company following a favorable mention by an analyst
that sent the company's stock price soaring to a close 77 percent
above its previous day's price.
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed at 11.75, up 5.125 from Tuesday's $6.625.
</P>
<P>
   GenesisIntermedia operates Centerlinq Internet kiosks,
free-standing machines linked to the World Wide Web. They feature
touch-screen Net surfing to patrons of a dozen malls across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   What it offers the malls is information.
</P>
<P>
   Much like a grocery store shopper's club, Centerlinq generates a
card shoppers can use to receive discounts from mall merchants. In
order to obtain a card, the customer fills out a form at the kiosk,
contributing to a database of shopper information used to target
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The increasing popularity of the devices is readily evident at
the company's headquarters in Van Nuys, in L.A.'s San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Computers in boxes are packed into an area that takes up a
quarter of the fourth floor, multicolored wires hang from the
ceiling waiting to be plugged into the growing network and
employees in other departments have a standing order to stay out of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   GenesisIntermedia began as a direct marketing company, but has
entered into the technology realm with Centerlinq.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when some malls are forbidding their tenants to
promote the Internet as a sales medium, others are embracing it as
a marketing tool. That's where Centerlinq comes in.
</P>
<P>
   It is GenesisIntermedia's direct-marketing savvy, gained through
years of pitching investment strategies to individual investors,
that gives the company its strength in its new market niche, said
stock analyst Courtney Smith, a principal of Courtney Smith &AMP; Co.,
whose comments spurred the price run-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives them expertise most dot-coms don't have in terms of
marketing,'' he said. ``The Internet is the same as direct mail.
It's one on one marketing, it's not brand marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at GenesisIntermedia think it's about time the
company got noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have been there a long time ago,'' said Ramy
El-Batrawi, GenesisIntermedia.com's chairman and chief executive
officer. ``People are finally recognizing what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Batrawi said companies comparable to Genesis have market
capitalizations in the hundreds of millions or billions.
</P>
<P>
   GenesisIntermedia's market capitalization - the aggregate value
of all of its outstanding stock - is around $62 million after
Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks are in 18 malls nationwide. Southern California
kiosks can be found at the Antelope Valley Mall and Beverly Center.
</P>
<P>
   El-Batrawi said the company has plans to install kiosks in an
additional 80 to 100 malls this year. He hopes to reach 100 million
users by the end of the year, 1 percent of whom will sign up for
the membership cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every mall has about a million people that traffic their mall.
We know their shopping habits, where they shop,'' El-Batrawi said.
``We're in high-traffic areas, so we don't have to spend too much
money attracting people to us.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point the kiosks will be in enough malls and have enough
users to make the product a viable option for major advertisers,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one year, the game will be over. By then they will either
be one of the largest success stories or they will have stubbed
their toe and gone back to being a marketing company,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith believes the concept will work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centerlinq has the potential to be a home run,'' he said.
``Millions of people are looking at the screens every week. That's
the same as a TV network.''

   GENEVA _ Pascal Lamy is known as ``the Exocet'' for a
personality as direct and aggressive as the missile built in his
French homeland. But now that he is Europe's top trade official,
Lamy's subtle diplomacy may be a more useful weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old career civil servant, appointed as the European
Union's trade commissioner last fall, has found himself at the
center of some of the world's most contentious trade disputes.
French farmers want him to preserve the subsidies that keep their
prices artificially high but are regarded as obstacles to free
trade. European consumers want him to keep genetically modified
food from abroad off store shelves. Then there are the seemingly
never-ending trade fights between the European Union and the United
States over bananas, steel, aircraft noise and hormone-treated
beef.
</P>
<P>
   There had been some surprise at Lamy's appointment, partly
because of a widespread impression that he was simply too blunt and
might alienate Europe's trading partners with his no-nonsense
approach. But Lamy has shown himself to be adept at compromise.
</P>
<P>
   He took the initiative to help restart the World Trade
Organization talks that collapsed in Seattle two months ago,
becoming the first top-level trade official to publicly propose a
plan to break the impasse. This week, the Geneva-based trade forum
announced that it would reconvene the talks, although with a
narrower agenda than Lamy had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to repair and reignite the process,'' he said in an
interview last week in his office in Brussels, headquarters city of
the European Commission, the European Union's administrative arm.
</P>
<P>
   Lamy was named to the trade post after top officials of the
previous European Commission were dismissed last year over
accusations of mismanagement and cronyism. His selection was a
surprise partly because he had a not-altogether-flattering record
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   He had served for nine years as assistant to the former European
Commission president, Jacques Delors. It was in that post, where he
handled top-level meetings of the Group of Seven industrial
nations, that he acquired the sobriquets of Delors' hatchet man or,
alternately, Delors' Exocet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Lamy left Brussels and returned to Paris to help in
trying to salvage Credit Lyonnais, a troubled big bank that had
accumulated enormous debts and required repeated taxpayer bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of an exclusive French management school, Lamy is
identified with the country's political elite, a circle he mixes in
easily as a member of a well-to-do Normandy family. Skeptics have
wondered how a man ensconced in the French establishment would deal
with the European practice _ espoused most forcefully by France _
of subsidies for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture is a tricky one for him,'' said Paul Brenton of
the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ``He may want
to move ahead, but he will face the strength of the agricultural
lobby and ministries in Europe. He can only move ahead carefully
and subtly in this atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamy, trim from his passion for marathon running, maintained
that he can make progress on agriculture. ``I have room for
maneuver,'' he said in the interview. ``We believe agriculture has
environmental, social, local and landscape impact which deserve the
taxpayer paying for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Deep-seated differences between Europe and the United States
over the American view _ one backed by other exporting countries,
that farm goods should be treated like any other item of trade _
contributed to the failure in Seattle. European countries and Japan
strongly argue that farmers must be protected in order to preserve
rural life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been less French than expected in agriculture,'' said
Nicholas Clegg, a British member of the European Parliament, who
was dubious about Lamy's selection. ``He has said the future of
agriculture reform is not taboo. This has been a highly pleasant
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamy departs from some European colleagues on the even more
fractious topic of genetically modified food. He believes such
disputes should be decided at the World Trade Organization. ``The
WTO will have to articulate the rules about this,'' Lamy said,
acknowledging that his view would be unpopular in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He strongly defended the trade organization, which a broad range
of critics have called a secretive organization that has little
public accountability. The WTO ``has been painted as the black box
where multinationals do their dirty tricks in getting rid of
barriers that protect nice people,'' Lamy said. To counter that,
``my prescription is going out loudly on the idea that we need more
trade liberalization with rules that benefit everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He has proposed that the trade forum release more internal
documents, sponsor a yearly public debate and open its
deliberations to nongovernmental organizations. ``This is all part
of the democratic scene setting at the international level,'' he
said.

TO OUTLAW GAY GROUP, SCHOOL DISTRICT MAY BAN CLUBS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ORANGE, Calif. _ Under the protection of a court but in defiance
of a school board's wishes, a group of gay teenagers and their
supporters held a long-awaited meeting Wednesday at El Modena High
School here. But whether the group will ever do so again remains
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   In a fight that has roiled this conservative suburban community
and drawn attention across the country, the Orange Unified School
District is seeking to ban the group, contending that it is
inappropriate because it deals with issues of sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Now, faced with a lawsuit and a judge's preliminary injunction,
the district is considering a new approach: whether to vote
Thursday to ban all 38 noncurricular clubs, including the Black
Student Union and the Gentlemen's Club, as a way of halting the gay
group's meetings. Only one other school district, Salt Lake City,
has taken such an approach and a lawsuit against that district is
still moving through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached a point in this process where the board faces
a range of options,'' said Judith Frutig, a spokeswoman for the
board. ``On one hand, they could stop the lawsuit or on the other
they could press forward with the knowledge that this case will
likely go as far as the Supreme Court. So they have a lot to
consider.''
</P>
<P>
   As a demonstration of the passions that the dispute has
inflamed, protesters who had come from as far away as Salt Lake
City, exchanged verbal insults with students in a melee outside the
school Thursday afternoon. The police were called in to break up
the disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   For supporters of club, the board's decision in December to deny
the its application to meet is a violation of free speech. But to
opponents of the group, the primary subject matter is inappropriate
for a school organization. At least one board member contends that
homosexuality is a sin and that permitting a group to meet on
campus condones it. ``The Bible says we're all sinners, but this,
in my opinion, is asking us to legitimize sin,'' the board member,
Bill Lewis, said at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, in response to a lawsuit by the group's student
organizers, a federal district judge, David O. Carter, ordered the
board to allow the group to meet until the case could get a full
hearing and he criticized the school district for failing to
protect gay students from harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over the club's existence arises as gay rights
issues play out across the country on several other fronts: in
Vermont, legislators are considering whether to grant domestic
partnership rights to gay couples, while a California ballot
initiative will ask voters to reaffirm that the state should only
acknowledge heterosexual marriage. Illinois is considering a law
that would offer special legal status to gay victims of violence.
</P>
<P>
   But while those legislative and legal fights have attracted more
attention, schools across the country are increasingly wrestling
with similar kinds of sweeping issues. As studies show that gay
youths are revealing their sexual orientation at younger and
younger ages, a growing number of teen-agers are forming gay rights
support groups.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics compiled by the Gay, Lesbian and
Straight Education Network, more than 600 gay alliance clubs now
exist in middle schools and high schools across the country. In a
handful of cases, school boards have considered moves to stop the
groups from meeting, but have backed down as court actions were
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average age at which students self-identify as lesbian and
gay has dropped dramatically over the last 20 years,'' said Jon W.
Davidson, a supervising lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, the country's largest and oldest lesbian and gay
legal rights organization. ``High schools are having to deal with
this issue whereas they didn't in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dispute here, the school board cited the state education
code in denying the group's application. The board said the code
had strict requirements on how, when and by whom sex education and
related courses are taught on school grounds. It said it would be
inappropriate for students to lead discussions on such sensitive
topics as sexuality and sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The school board announced its decision after the group filed a
lawsuit in November charging that the board was illegally delaying
action on the application. The suit cited the Equal Access Act of
1984, the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteeing equal protection and
other civil rights laws. The 1984 act provides that schools
allowing groups to meet in extracurricular clubs cannot deny
certain groups to meet because of the content of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was passed by Congress at the urging of
conservative groups pushing for religious meetings in schools, but
it has since become an effective tool for gay rights groups seeking
similar privileges.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when Carter issued his preliminary injunction
ordering the district to allow the students to meet as the case
moves through the court, he carefully examined the student's rights
under the law, ultimately finding that the board must ``give
plaintiffs all the same rights and privileges that it gives to
other student groups.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his ruling, the judge also found that there was a
strong indication that the students were being harmed as a result
of being denied their First Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiffs have been injured not only by the board's excessive
delay, but also by the inability to effectively address the
hardships they encounter at school every day,'' the judge wrote.
``Some students at El Modena do not even feel safe using the
school's restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since Carter's ruling, the atmosphere for gay
students at El Modena has been tense, student organizers said. When
they arrived at school on Monday, gay students said the campus was
littered with prank gay-recruitment fliers. ``Come on Elmo, don't
be shy! You're either gay ... or you're bi,'' read the fliers,
which showed two men naked from the waist up.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Colin, a 15-year-old who helped found the gay club, said
the idea for the club arose from the savage beating death in 1998
of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old freshman at the University of
Wyoming who was targeted because of his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Student organizers say their goal is to promote tolerance among
and for gay and straight students at the school. A survey by the
Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network found that 91 percent
of students polled by their organization regularly heard homophobic
comments at school. More than two-thirds of gay respondents said
they had been verbally, physically or sexually harassed on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The El Modena group said that it hoped to raise public awareness
and promote tolerance by providing a safe forum for discussion of
issues related to sexual orientation and homophobia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to stress the need for people to put aside their
personal prejudice and agree to treat everyone with respect when
the situation calls for it,'' the group wrote, noting that no one
needed to disclose their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But school officials and some parents say they fear the students
are being used to promote the agenda of national gay advocacy
groups and express concern about the group's mission.

ARTISTRY COLLIDES WITH ATHLETICISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ She has been the anointed female skater of her
generation, the establishment favorite, a two-time world champion
and three-time national champion. And yet Michelle Kwan feels a
twinge of unfulfillment in her career, forged as much in gracious
defeat as in spectacular victory.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, she has come to realize there is nothing hard and fast in
figure skating except the ice. Victory and superiority are etched,
then erased, with the passing of a Zamboni machine. While her
career path once seemed straight and unimpeded, she has now arrived
at a crossroads as her opponents have cleverly circumvented her
artistic superiority by ratcheting up the jumping difficulty in
their routines.
</P>
<P>
   How Kwan responds, beginning Friday at the national
championships, will have implications as far-reaching as her
ability to win the gold medal that eluded her at the 1998 Winter
Olympics in Nagano, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   She has lost four of her last five major international
competitions since 1997, and while second place can hardly be
dismissed, and no one else possesses her consistency, victory has
been elusive for Kwan, one of the greatest female skaters of all
time. The 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City are two years away,
but Kwan has some important skating decisions to make while she
adjusts her personal life to the pleasures and distractions of
college at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   At her best, Kwan possesses an elegance and ethereal presence
that no other woman can equal. But, since peaking with her Salome
long program in 1996, her dramatic, contemplative style has
achieved a kind of sameness, predictability and caution. Sometimes
she appears to be skating more out of a sense of obligation than
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the technical aspect of her skating has remained
static while her opponents have upped the ante with dazzling triple
jumps performed in combination. Tara Lipinski defeated a tentative
Kwan in Nagano because Lipinski skated a more difficult long
program that included a triple loop-triple loop combination. Three
weeks ago at a competition in Lyon, France, Kwan finished behind
Russia's Irina Slutskaya, who landed triple lutz-triple loop and
triple salchow-triple loop combination jumps within the space of 15
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   At the national championships, 14-year-old Sarah Hughes of Great
Neck, N.Y., will challenge Kwan with triple salchow-triple loop and
triple toe-triple loop combinations in the long program. Kwan plans
to attempt the triple toe-triple toe combination. Her coach, Frank
Carroll, believes Kwan will need two triple-triple combination
jumps to win a gold medal in Salt Lake City. He also wants her to
insert a more difficult triple flip in her short program in place
of the triple toe on which Kwan has a security-blanket reliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to develop more technically,'' Kwan said at a news
conference Wednesday. ``I've got a new motivation: `I've got to do
this. I can't back down.' It's like bidding for something at an
auction. You want this piece of artwork. Someone bids higher, you
don't care. You pay more to them to get the painting. That's how I
feel now. I'm willing to pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   The costs are still being figured. Last fall, Kwan took a full
course load at UCLA, and her skating went into a mode of
maintenance, not improvement. She is taking only one class this
winter to concentrate on skating. She will most likely not attend
school at all in the months before the 2002 Olympics. Carroll also
suggested that Kwan needed to reduce her involvement in lucrative
pro-am competitions in order to spend the necessary time refining
more difficult jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gauntlet has definitely been thrown down,'' he said. ``If
she wants to pick it up, she has to schedule her time better.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Kwan said, she planned to compete at the Salt
Lake City Olympics. ``I love to put myself through the competition
and stress and pressure,'' she said. ```Can she do it? Can she land
her jumps?''' Though she does not talk about it, Kwan also feels
her career is incomplete after winning a silver medal in Nagano,
Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Even a chance at redemption, however, is not always sufficient
to sustain a skater's motivation in the four years between
Olympics. Lipinski, her chief American rival, has turned
professional. There has been no one in the United States to push
Kwan. Her primary competition here will come from no one older than
14. And even without an Olympic gold medal, she earns an estimated
$2 million a year. When she was young, the newness, the chase,
nourished her enthusiasm. Now, when the rink is cold and her body
is tired, Kwan said, she has to muster her own eagerness. ``It
doesn't float down in your hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really has to want to do it,'' Carroll said. ``I've never
viewed competition as a negative for top athletes. It's a
challenge. If it doesn't spur her on, she shouldn't do it. This is
Michelle's life. The motivation has to come from within. She's got
to want to raise the bar herself. I think she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this challenge from the jumpers is what Kwan needs. Her
artistry may be superb, but it no longer guarantees victory. Any
timidity in her skating and she is vulnerable. Even if she makes no
mistakes, she could lose again next month at the world
championships in Nice, France. Even if she wins, she faces two
years of necessary improvement or risks unfulfillment again in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way of the game, the way of sport,'' Carroll said.
``There has to be progress or you get left in the dust.'' &QL;

   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Feb. 10: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don Imus, the radio personality who likes to torment
politicians, says that Steve Forbes spent $100 million to make
himself a laughingstock. That is, as they say in politics, a harsh
formulation. Other tabulations put his personal spending in two
campaigns at something like $70 million. As for the campaign, it
would be kinder to call it a quixotic venture that taught some
worthy civic lessons.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson is that even in the era of dollar-driven politics, it
is impossible to purchase a political base for a candidate who
lacks reasonable policies and some modicum of personal appeal.
Forbes should not be ridiculed for his lack of charm and his poor
speaking ability, but neither should the electorate be expected to
use its imagination in supplying the threshold qualities required
of a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On the policy side, it was heartening that even in a
conservative party, no one was fooled by Forbes' pandering veer to
the right on abortion between his 1996 and 2000 campaigns. In both
campaigns, moreover, GOP voters definitively rejected his flat tax
for what it was _ a bald attempt to give the most affluent
Americans a free ride.
</P>
<P>
   But the main lesson of the Forbes campaign is that the Supreme
Court really needs to erase that part of its 1976 Buckley vs. Valeo
ruling that allows the unlimited expenditure of personal funds by a
candidate. That gives wealthy candidates a built-in advantage over
other citizens who must solicit donations effectively. It also
allows those candidates to play a recklessly disruptive role in
elections without themselves having earned credibility at the
ballot box or through other forms of civic accomplishment. To be
sure, novice candidates have a right to run, but Buckley vs. Valeo
creates a narrow, privileged class of novices.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his inability to get votes, Forbes will be best
remembered for his attacks on more successful Republicans like Bob
Dole, the party's 1996 nominee, and Gov. George W. Bush, this
year's former front-runner. Oddly, Forbes' advisers have been
saying that their boss is leaving the campaign trail with hard
feelings toward Bush. Perhaps in his farewell press conference
Thursday, Forbes can explain exactly what offense Bush committed,
other than defeating Forbes in Iowa and Delaware. &QL;

COSTLY STUBBORNNESS BY THE IRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Feb. 10: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would be tragic if the Irish Republican Army undermined the
nearly two-year-old peace settlement in Northern Ireland by
refusing to turn in even a small component of its arsenal. Yet that
is just what the IRA seems determined to do, despite pleas from the
Irish government, Northern Ireland's largest Catholic party and the
Catholic bishop of Londonderry to begin disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gerry Adams, the leader of the IRA's political wing, Sinn
Fein, sounds despairing at the prospect of a new crisis that could
return the province to direct British rule. British and Irish
leaders, along with President Clinton, continue their last-minute
efforts to avoid such a setback. But they cannot succeed unless the
IRA faces up to its responsibilities and begins to turn in its
arms.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not, Britain plans to suspend the power-sharing
executive set up under the Good Friday 1998 peace agreement and
reimpose direct rule. By doing so, London believes it can extricate
Ulster's leading Protestant politician, David Trimble, from his
promise to withdraw from the executive and resign his party
leadership if the IRA did not give up some of its grenades, guns
and explosives by early February.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble is the most moderate leader Ulster's Protestant majority
has produced. His willingness to compromise was critical to the
Good Friday agreement and to the peace that has followed. Britain's
hope is that if the executive is suspended, Trimble will be able to
stay on and remain open to any honorable resolution of the
disarmament impasse.
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger, however, that suspending the executive could
push the IRA into even greater intransigence, indefinitely
prolonging British rule and putting the Good Friday agreement at
risk. Power-sharing has brought equal political representation and
opened the way to political office for Sinn Fein. It has been
accompanied by overdue civil rights guarantees for Northern
Ireland's Catholic minority. It is hard to understand why the IRA
would throw these gains away for the sake of maintaining its status
as a heavily armed force.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA argues that it has never been defeated and that
unvanquished armies do not disarm. It also insists that it will
never disarm under pressure. Yet even for an undefeated army there
would be no shame in voluntarily agreeing to turn over weapons for
the sake of a just peace. The same logic applies to the major
Protestant paramilitary groups, which have also failed to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA persuades no one by arguing that the Good Friday
agreement binds only Sinn Fein and not itself, or that the
disarmament provisions specify only when the process is to be
completed, not begun. The reasonable assumptions were that Sinn
Fein could deliver its military counterpart, the IRA, and that
steps toward disarmament would be taken well before the May 2000
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The positive results already achieved by the Good Friday deal
are plain enough. It has given Northern Ireland's people two years
of peace and a sharp reduction in British military patrols. It has
also brought greater social and political justice for Catholics and
a constructive plan for police reform. The IRA should put these
achievements ahead of gamesmanship and start turning over its
weapons.

NEW MAVERICK ROMAN BRINGS NBA FEVER BACK TO DALLAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dennis Rodman arrived at Reunion Arena last night at
6:09 _ six minutes early.
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting him as he entered the building was a media herd, which
crowded Rodman and his entourage all the way to the Mavericks'
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is ridiculous,'' said Rodman, who has permission to show
up 75 minutes before games, 15 minutes after other Mavericks
players. ``I expect this for somebody else in the league, but not
for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I hold that kind of power in this league?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's arrival and debut with the Mavericks has generated more
electricity and excitement at Reunion Arena than any NBA event
since the Mavericks made the playoffs in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders sat courtside. Seven or eight seats to his right
sat Emmitt Smith and former Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr.
Mavericks founder Don ``Big Hat'' Carter was also in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Rodman, last night's game between the Mavericks and
Seattle SuperSonics became the hottest ticket in town.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks came away with a 117-106 loss, but Rodman provided
the rebounding they were looking for. He finished with 13 rebounds,
five fouls and one assist in 32 minutes. And although he missed his
only field-goal attempt, his presence seemed to be on the mark with
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who may have played his last game for the Cowboys and
whose wife delivered a baby boy yesterday morning, attended his
first Mavericks game of the season. Rodman's appearance took
Sanders away from his wife and newborn child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's wonderful for the game, for the team and the
city,'' said Sanders, who knows a thing or two about creating
excitement. ``This city's like one big cup of tea. They need some
sugar in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big Dennis Rodman fan and a Mark Cuban fan. I'm on
board.''
</P>
<P>
   So, it seemed, were a lot of fans, as the Mavericks enjoyed
their second sellout of the season. Everybody wanted what turned
out to be the hottest ticket in town since last year's Stanley Cup
Finals between the Stars and Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be no surprise, because there's a lot of fans in
Dallas,'' forward Cedric Ceballos said. ``We've just got to give
them a reason to come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of our play, Dennis and the new owner. Even when
we were losing we had an exciting game and people came out.''
</P>
<P>
   But not like they did last night. This was special. This was
Rodman, a surprise starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to start eventually anyway, so we might as well
throw him right in there,'' Mavericks coach Don Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Television crews were as much a part of the backdrop as the
fans. TV reporters did live shots at 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., uncharted
territory for a Mavericks game in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The national media _ including ``Sports Illustrated,'' CNN,
``The Sporting News'' and NBA Photos _ attended the game. All
because of Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through things like this before with Michael
\RJordan\S in Chicago and Shaquille \RO'Neal\S in Orlando,'' Sonics
forward Horace Grant said. ``I think it's great for this
organization and city to have a player like Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can help them, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks provided extra security for Rodman, who seemingly
has reached rock-star status.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Rodman arrived to the arena six minutes earlier than
he was supposed to, Ceballos said: ``He must be nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman did not admit to having any jitters, but when he reached
his locker and saw his No. 70 jersey for the first time he was not
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want 69 so bad ... 69 is my number. That's \R70\S not my
number,'' Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to buck the system _ again _ Rodman said for the
rest of this season he plans to wear all four of his NBA numbers _
10 (Detroit, San Antonio), 70 (Dallas), 73 (LA Lakers) and 91
(Chicago). And he dares the NBA to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I would do something really different when I came
back,'' Rodman said before the game. ``I said, `Let's do 70 first,
then 73, 91 and 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wear all four \Rjerseys\S all year long. Let's do it.
These are the numbers I've had since I've been in the league, so
every game let's have a different number.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman tried to downplay the significance of his appearance in a
Mavericks uniform, and couldn't understand how a man from humble
beginnings in South Oak Cliff could create such a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about winning,'' Rodman said. ``It's all about
filling the seats and everyone having a good time. ''
</P>
<P>
   As one sign in the stands read: ``Thanks Mark Cuban. The NBA Is
Back In Town.''

EDITORIAL: THE HIGH PRICE OF OIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, Feb. 10: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Home heating prices in the Northeast, the region that relies
primarily on oil to heat homes, have doubled over the past year.
Indeed the residents of the Northeast have suffered a double blow.
First OPEC, the consortium of oil-exporting countries, conspired
last spring to cut production by millions of barrels a day. As a
result, crude oil prices nearly tripled by December and gasoline
prices rose by over 30 percent during the past year. Then a cold
wave struck last month, drawing down inventories of home heating
oil and sending its price soaring. Residents are demanding relief
from Congress, but it is already too late to push down heating
bills before spring.
</P>
<P>
   Last September Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, anticipating
the impact of the OPEC cutbacks, called on the administration to
release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, almost 600
million barrels of oil stored in salt domes in Texas and Louisiana.
The administration has balked at using the reserve because it is
designed to soften the blow of another oil embargo or similar
energy crisis, not to control market prices. Using it to offset
temporary price increases can discourage conservation and run down
reserves that will be needed in any future crisis. Legislation
sponsored by Schumer to tap the reserve has gone nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the reserve cannot provide immediate relief because
it takes at least several weeks to get oil out of the salt domes
and into people's homes. If the reserve were tapped starting now,
the oil would not arrive in the Northeast until the crocuses start
to bloom, heating needs fall and home heating prices fall on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is still good reason to open up the reserve today,
though not in the way Schumer originally proposed. OPEC cutbacks
have driven worldwide inventories down to dangerously low levels.
That could send gasoline prices rising this summer. Worse, by next
winter a combination of low inventories and cold weather could send
crude oil prices to $40 a barrel, about twice the normal price of
crude over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   The way to handle this problem is to open the reserve for
``swaps'' rather than sales for cash. The administration is
reviewing the idea and is expected to make a decision soon. Under a
system of swaps, a company would take oil out of the reserve and
sell it at current prices. The extra oil on the market would help
drive prices down. Later the company would return a somewhat larger
amount of oil to the reserve. The incentive for the companies is
that they would earn a profit from selling the reserve oil at
today's high prices and replacing it later with cheaper oil bought
when prices almost certainly will have fallen. Swaps could not only
knock the edge off oil prices but, unlike outright sales, fill the
reserve above its current level. Philip Verleger, an energy
economist, estimates that swaps could reduce crude oil prices by $3
or $4 a barrel, a fall of more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A virtue of swaps is that they could be made a permanent feature
of the reserve. The administration would let companies withdraw oil
at any time as long as they return it and additional oil at a
predetermined date in the future. That would eliminate the need for
jockeying that comes every time politicians are asked to open up
the reserve for this or that episode of high oil prices. Had swaps
been permanently in place when Schumer, who supports their use,
first called on the administration to act, Northeastern homeowners
would already be reaping the benefit. If a system of swaps is put
in place today, they will be there in time for this summer's
possible run on gasoline stocks or a run on heating oil over the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Oil has already entered campaign debates. Bill Bradley has
embraced the idea of swaps, and George W. Bush has called for the
administration to pressure Saudi Arabia to ramp up OPEC production
levels. Both ideas make sense. Pressuring Saudi Arabia is a way to
get OPEC's production rates higher. Though the tactic has often
failed in the past, the Saudis may be more receptive this time. By
driving oil inventories to near zero, Saudi Arabia has
inadvertently put Iraq, which could produce much more oil than it
now does, into a powerful position. Next winter Iraq could well
demand that the United Nations lift sanctions on its oil exports in
return for added production. The Saudis might want to reconsider
decisions they have made that have put their archenemy in control.

NORTHRIDGE ACCEPTS BIG WEST INVITATION
</HEADLINE>
 TO BIG WEST PACKAGE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twice, Cal State Northridge tried to get into the
Big West Conference. On Wednesday, it finally succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   The Big West announced that CSUN and UC Riverside were extended
invitations to become the conference's newest members, starting in
June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge's invitation was enthusiastically accepted by Louanne
Kennedy, CSUN's interim president, who presided over the
eight-month process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball went up from the Big West, and the question was: `Are
we going to catch it?' '' Kennedy said at the news conference
announcing the move. ``Or are we going to wait and risk the fact
that they might not throw the ball again?''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a unanimous, enthusiastic vote to offer the invitation
to these two fine universities to join the Big West Conference,''
said Long Beach State president Robert Maxson, the chairman of the
board of presidents. ``Northridge has excelled academically and
it's made a firm commitment to a sports program and demonstrated
excellence for many years in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought Northridge was the perfect fit. Time will show
this was a good move,'' he said. ``For several years, I thought
Northridge was a natural for the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN tried to get into the Big West once before, in 1994, but
was turned down. The athletics program then joined the Big Sky in a
partnership often tested by CSUN's inability to upgrade its
athletic facilities and the scandals that rocked the school in the
recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a wonderful experience playing in the Big Sky,''
Kennedy said of the membership that ends next spring. ``We leave
them with regret, but at the same time we're really pleased to be
able to now come into the Big West and be part of this largely
California conference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big West, based in Irvine, will have 10 members when CSUN
begins play. Six schools are in Southern California: UC Irvine, Cal
State Fullerton, UC Santa Barbara, Riverside and CSUN. The others
are Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Pacific, Utah State and Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to play natural rivals... we really believe we can
increase our attendance at sports events,'' Kennedy said, alluding
to the fact that Northridge has ranked last in the Big Sky in
attendance in almost every sport, ``and to develop and continue the
kind of rivalries that exist in high schools carrying on to
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxson, Long Beach State's president for six years, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us in Southern California,'' he said, ``what a wonderful,
natural, wholesome rivalry this will be between our campuses. There
will be conference games that it's just (as) easy for our fans to
go to the other school as it is to our own place.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen of Northridge's 20 sports are affected by the move, with
one notable exception: football. That program will become an
independent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play I-AA football, we'll play nonconference until we
can find a conference that we'll be able to join,'' Kennedy said.
``What we're really trying to do is provide revenues to all the
athletic (teams) in a relatively fair manner. We have no intention
of de-emphasizing football.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge could continue to play in the Big Sky as an
associated member, though, or latch on to a potential I-AA
conference that could include Cal Poly and UC Davis. The Big Sky's
scholarship mandate of 60 is too much for CSUN, especially with the
department's gender-equity issues.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Dick Dull, the driving force behind
Northridge's campaign to be invited to the Big West, said the
Matadors are out of the Big Sky in football for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's in the best interest on this institution
to carve out an independent schedule,'' he said. ``Yes, there could
be opportunities for a California-based football conference in the
future. We never seriously considered playing football... as an
associate member in the Big Sky. I'm not sure that's a practical
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Big West expanded in the '90s, its hopes were to
strengthen its status in Division I-A football. That position has
changed, even if Big West Commissioner Dennis Farrell said football
is still a ``priority'' sport.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 2001, only three Big West schools will be playing
football: Utah State, Idaho and CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Football-playing members Arkansas State and Nevada are both out
of the Big West by the end of this spring. Boise State, North Texas
and New Mexico State are all leaving the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum in the Big West has shifted to men's and women's
basketball, which happily coincides with Northridge's new
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball has always been a sport of emphasis in the Big West
Conference,'' Farrell said. ``We will continue to strengthen our
position regionally and nationally in men's and women's
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean a basketball arena is in the works at CSUN? The
men and women play in tiny Matador Gym, which seats just 1,600, and
despite their success, the basketball teams haven't played to a
sellout this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would personally love to have a basketball arena,'' Kennedy
said. ``There are issues about where it would be built and how it
would be done. We've had discussions with private developers...
none of those have panned out.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't room for an on-campus arena in the university's
master plan, so an expansion of Matador Gym is more likely, Kennedy
said.
