<HEADLINE> Bus Fares Double In India Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Commuters in the Indian
capital have to pay double bus fares effective from Saturday
following the decision of the Delhi government to revise the bus
charges.
</P>
<P>
The increase, which also included fare on inter-state, tourists
and holiday excursion bus services, followed over 35 percent rise
in diesel prices by the central government on October 6.
</P>
<P>
The sharp bus fare increase left tens of thousands of
passengers across the city which has a population of over 12
million fretting and fuming, and many were so shocked that they
were unable to react.
</P>
<P>
Commuters now should pay two rupees (one U.S. dollar is
currently 43 rupees) for the first four kms as against one rupee
earlier, four rupees between four and eight kms, six between eight
and 12 kms, eight between 12 and 16 kms, and a flat fare of 10
rupees beyond 16 kms, according to a press release by Delhi
Transport Corporation (DTC).
</P>
<P>
However, charging rates on certain passes including students,
resettlement colony, press and old age have remained the same as
before.
</P>
<P>
That the bus fares were going up had become a hot debating
point among commuters both inside buses and along the streets.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Federation of Trade Unions is among the various
organizations that have come down heavily on the central
governments for increasing the diesel prices which caused the bus
fare increase.
</P>
<P>
The federation accused the government of adding to the burden
of a population already struggling to make two ends meet in the
wake of increasing unemployment, lockouts and closures.

<HEADLINE> EU Reaffirms Stance On U.S. Senate's CTBT Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPERE, Finland, October 16 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
leaders strongly voiced their regrets Saturday for the U.S.
Senate's decision not to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"This sends the wrong signal to would-be nuclear proliferators.
All those states which have yet to adhere to the treaty should do
so as soon as possible," they said in a declaration at the end of
the two-day EU summit here in the Finnish city of Tampere.
</P>
<P>
"The EU welcomes President Clinton's public commitment to
continue to work for ratification of the treaty by the United
States and also to continue to observe a moratorium on nuclear
test," the EU leaders said.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the 15 EU member states
said they are firmly convinced that the treaty is strongly in the
interests of all states as an essential barrier to the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The member states reiterated their commitment to intensify
their efforts to bring the treaty into force at the earliest
opportunity," the EU leaders added.

<HEADLINE> Editor-in-Chief of Iranian Banned Daily Nabbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran's conservative-dominated
court on Saturday issued an arrest warrant for Mashallah
Shamsolvaezin, editor-in-chief of the banned moderate daily
Neshat.
</P>
<P>
An informed source said that the branch 1410 of Tehran Public
Court issued the warrant after Shamsolvaezin rejected preliminary
investigations, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shamsolvaezin is accused of desecration of the Islamic
sanctities and the Quranic teachings and his arrest warrant was
issued in accordance with the article 26 of the press law, the
unnamed source said.
</P>
<P>
In a court hearing last week, Shamsolvaezin had asked for time
to provide the court with evidence to support his defense against
the charges leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
But he introduced three lawyers to the court Saturday and said
that he does not believe in preliminary investigations and would
appear before the court in presence of the press jury.
</P>
<P>
The daily Neshat, which supported the reformist policies of
President Mohammad Khatami, was closed down on September 5 on
"charges of disrespect for Islamic Sanctities and the status of
supreme leader."
</P>
<P>
The ban came after the daily published an open letter of a
co-founder of the opposition Iran Liberation Movement to supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The letter urged the paramount
leader to distance himself from the conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Neshat was the successor to Tous and Jameah, which had been
closed down on press charges. Since Khatami came to power in
August 1997, six liberal dailies have been shut down by the
Iranian conservative judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Preliminary Report on S.California Earthquake Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A magnitude-7.0 earthquake
centered in a remote, sparsely-populated part of Southern
California occurred at 2:46, and strong shock of this major event
and aftershocks were felt in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary report released early in the morning
by the local office of the U.S. Geological Survey, on average, an
earthquake of this size is expected to generate approximately four
aftershocks of magnitude 5 or larger within the next week. Two
early aftershocks above magnitude 5 already took place between the
mainshock and 6:00.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey and the California
Institute of Technology are continuing to analyze the data and
geologists are now in the epicentral area to look for surface
rupture.
</P>
<P>
During the past week between October 7 and 14, 197 earthquakes
occurred in Southern California, according to the Geological
Survey office.
</P>
<P>
Southern California Edison, the local utilities company, said
that it is assessing damages and preparing to dispatch repair
crews to areas most seriously impacted by the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are probabilities of damaging earthquakes in
Northern California. According to a report released Thursday by
the U.S. Geological Survey, there is a 70 percent probability that
one or more damaging earthquakes of magnitude 6.7 or larger will
strike the San Francisco Bay area during the next 30 years. There
is also an 80 percent chance of one or more magnitude 6 to 6.7
earthquakes before 2030. Such smaller quakes, centered in
urbanized areas, could also cause serious damages throughout the
Bay region, the report said.

<HEADLINE> At Least Five Killed in Hurricane in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
killed as Hurricane Irene hit Florida State of the United States
Friday, said reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The hurricane brought blustery winds, heavy downpours,
widespread power outages, and threats of serious flash-flooding to
hundreds of thousands of residents from Daytona Beach to Miami to
Tampa and Orlando, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
After drenching Cuba's tobacco fields and collapsing buildings
in Havana, Irene rolled ashore Friday afternoon near Cape Sable,
120 kilometers southwest of Miami in Florida, and headed north
through the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
Florida Power and Light said it had restored power to 700,000
people, but more than 1.5 million remained without service in
seven counties from Miami to Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
Most airlines suspended service to south Florida and the Miami
International Airport was shut down for three hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
After striking Florida Friday, the hurricane churned in the
Atlantic Saturday on a path that could bring it to the coast of
North Carolina State, which is still recovering from the drenching
passage of Hurricane Floyd last month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton declared a state of emergency for
Florida, authorizing the Federal Emergency Management
Administration to coordinate disaster relief efforts with state
officials.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Botswana President Festus
Mogae was among the first voters in Gaborone on Saturday when the
polls opened for the country's general election, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mogae, who is leader of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party
(BDP), said he was confident of victory.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the electorate to vote and expressed concern
over voter apathy.
</P>
<P>
Only 467,000 of the 800,000 eligible voters have registered.
</P>
<P>
Mogae said a new BDP government would concentrate on the
diversification of Botswana's economy away from its reliance on
diamonds.
</P>
<P>
"My thrust will be to create jobs and industry."
</P>
<P>
He added the government would spend up to 60 million Pula (13.3
million U.S. dollars) to combat AIDS/HIV.
</P>
<P>
"We have not done enough yet. The epidemic is very serious it
is hurting our economy," Mogae said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Declares 7-Day Mourning for Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has
declared a seven-day period of national mourning for the passing
away of former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
The mourning period began at zero hour Saturday and will last
until midnight next Friday. Through this period the Mozambican
flag will be flown at half mast.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere died of leukemia at the age of 77 at a London hospital
on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The founding father of Tanzania is remembered in Mozambique for
his unflinching support for the southern African country's
struggle for independence from Portuguese colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
It was under Nyerere's aegis in Dar es Salaam that the
Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) was founded on June 25,
1962, and it was from camps in southern Tanzania that the first
FRELIMO guerrillas slipped over the border in 1964 to start the
armed liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere was a close personal friend of several Mozambican
leaders, including the founder and first president of the FRELIMO,
Eduardo Mondlane, and his successor, the first president of an
independent Mozambique, Samora Machel.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Tanzania itself, other countries which have declared
national mourning for Nyerere include South Africa, Kenya and
Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Recovers More Stolen Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government says it
has recovered an additional 800 million U.S. dollars of the
country's illegally acquired wealth by officials of the previous
administration.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Adamu Ciroma told reporters in Lagos Friday
that 20 million of the latest amount was retrieved within the
country from the family and officials of late military ruler Gen.
Sani Abacha's regime, reported the Punch, a major Nigerian
newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the recovery happened outside the country where the
bulk of the stolen wealth had been stashed away in foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo's chief economic adviser, Philip
Asiodu, has put Nigeria's stolen money at 5.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Ciroma said the "co-operation of the recovery of the looted
money is more from the people who looted and not from foreign
governments."
</P>
<P>
As was the case in the millions of dollars earlier recovered
from officials of the old regime, he added that the new
recoveries had been lodged in a special account in the Central
Bank of Nigeria to be disbursed after the approval of the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the Swiss city of Bern said the bank
accounts of Abacha, his family members and those of his aides had
been frozen.
</P>
<P>
This has further raised hopes in Nigeria that the country could
retrieve more of its stolen wealth.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Makes One More Peace Bid For Angola BAC132CAB075I16TAQL01:4501:461069 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday voted unanimously to reopen a mission in Angola
after the world body shut down its peacekeeping operations in the
southwest African country while warring parties resumed the
country's 25-year-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
The move was contained in a resolution adopted after months of
negotiation between the United Nations and the Angolan government,
during which Luanda informally approved reestablishing a mission
of 30 international staff, which the 15-member Security Council
said should include political, human rights and military personnel
to help revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council in its resolution authorized the U.N.
Office in Angola (UNOA) to explore "effective measures for
restoring peace" as well as assisting in humanitarian aid and
promoting human rights. The UNOA's six-month mandate expires on
April 15, 2000, subject to renewal.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council took the step to show that the United
Nations does not want to abandon Angola, which has been plunged
into the longest civil war on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
When recommending the end of the U.N. mission in Angola earlier
this year, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has attached
great importance to promoting peace and development in Africa
since he became the first black African to head the world body,
announced that the United Nations would never abandon Angola.
</P>
<P>
Observers here compared the situation for the United Nations in
Angola to that of Somalia, a reminiscence of a Security Council
decision several years ago to put an end to the peacekeeping
mission in Somalia as of March 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, the 188-member United Nations is still being
haunted by what Annan has described as "the Somalia syndrome."
</P>
<P>
Discussions on reopening a U.N. office continued earlier this
month with Angolan Foreign Minister Joao de Miranda at the U.N.
headquarters in New York on the sideline of the General Assembly.
He was reported to have agreed to the mission.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the ongoing civil war and worsening humanitarian
situation in the African nation, the Security Council wants the
UNOA to be "greatly helpful in restoring peace and promoting
national reconciliation" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 Lusaka peace agreement fell apart in December 1998
after the Angolan government and the rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) resumed the war. Since then
neither side has been able to declare victory. The UNITA holds
most of the countryside, and the government runs the cities where
the majority of the nation's population live.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing months, more than 2 million Angolans have been
forced from their homes and hundreds are dying of hunger each day.
The current war is creating disease, death and poverty in the
country, which is rich in oil and diamond.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the peace bid, the Security Council is seeking
more concrete measures to cut off the UNITA's war funds, collected
from its illegal sales of diamond.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, under the leadership of Jonas Savimbi, had earned
between 3 and 4 billion U.S. dollars over the past eight years
from diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still some difficulties in the
re-establishment of the U.N. office.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials are very cautions, saying that a written
agreement had not been signed. Angola was in no hurry to do so and
might not issue visas, they said.
</P>
<P>
Humanitarian workers had been allowed to remain in Angola after
the withdrawal of peacekeepers. But the Angolan government has
since February turned down political or military personnel,
presumably because they might observe the war more closely and
communicate with the rebel UNITA. U.N. aid workers have been
forbidden by the Luanda government to enter most of the UNITA-held
territories.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Security Council resolution called on the
Angolan government to conclude an agreement with the United
Nations on the status of the mission as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Security Council is also concerned with the
safety and security of the U.N. personnel and other aid workers in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
They have all the reason to worry about the safety and security
after two U.N.-chartered cargo planes were shot down within eight
days after Christmas last year, killing 23 people, including U.N.
peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> EU Says Aid To Pakistan Depends On Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPERE, Finland, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union
(EU) said here Saturday that it will consider next month further
measures as appropriate including the future of development
assistance to Pakistan according to change of situation there.
</P>
<P>
When closing their two-day summit in the Finnish city of
Tampere, the EU leaders said in a declaration on Pakistan that the
EU believes strongly that Pakistan needs a stable and democratic
government and also requires such a government to sustain its
economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of the conditions for such a program, lending of
international financial institutions should be withheld, the EU
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
"The immediate restoration of democracy and the rule of law is
essential. This will be in the best interest of the Pakistani
people and will be crucial in preserving the stability of Pakistan
and the wider region," they said.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the 15 EU members also
underlined the need for continuing dialogue between Pakistan and
India in order to resolve the tensions in the South Asian
sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
"Recent events underline the importance of both Pakistan and
India adhering to the global non-proliferation regime," they
added.
</P>
<P>
The EU also reiterated its grave concern over developments in
Pakistan and condemned recent actions of the military.
</P>
<P>
"The EU is particularly dismayed by the Proclamation of
Emergency, the suspension of the constitution and democratic
structures, and the reports of the arrest of the cabinet
ministers," the leaders said.
</P>
<P>
The EU called on the military to respect the safety and legal
rights of those under arrest and to release them without delay.

<HEADLINE> Tens of Thousands Demonstrate in Paris For Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people,
called by the French Communist Party (PCF), demonstrated Saturday
in Paris to demand protection of jobs and in protest against the
plan by the Michelin tire group to lay off 7,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
Police said that 32,000 people joined the demonstration, while
the PCF said the number of participants stood at 70,000.
</P>
<P>
One of the banners held by the demonstrators said, "Create jobs
or enrich the stock holders, you must choose."
</P>
<P>
Another banner held by workers of Michelin said, "It is not at
the stock markets that one makes tire."
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators finger-pointed the employers and not the
Socialist government as was previously expected, as the government
and the PCF have just struck a deal on a 35-hour work week law.
</P>
<P>
PCF National Secretary Robert Hue said that he was "very angry"
about the failure of the government to do more to protect labor
rights and seek social equality.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the Socialist government of Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin was not one of the rightwing and it had done quite a
S02233NAB071I16TEQL01:4801:564542
lot since it came to power in July 1997.
BAC134CAB077I16TAQL01:5501:562223
S04194NAB071I16TEQL01:4801:564542
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was also a counter-attack against a rally
made on October 4 by French employers in Paris in protest against
the 35-hour work week and blaming the government for holding
prejudices against them.
</P>
<P>
Some other leftwing parties, including the Citizen's Movement
led by Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the Greens and
the extreme-left Lutte Ouvriere and Revolutionary Communist
League, also joined Saturday's demonstration.
</P>
<P>

BAGHDAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was killed
and two other injured on Saturday in U.S. and British warplanes'
attacks on civilian targets in southern Iraq, an Iraqi military
BAP326NAB073I16TEQL01:5701:571939
spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 13:40 hours (1040 GMT), three
formations of enemy warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Thi-Qar, Misan,
Muthana, Wasit, Qadisiya, Najaf and Kerbala provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed civilian facilities in the region,
leading to the above-mentioned casualties, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He added that Iraqi air defenses fired back and forced the
enemy planes to flee to their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
At 10:30 hours (0730 GMT), seven formations of U.S. and British
warplanes coming from Turkey violated northern Iraqi airspace over
the provinces of Neiniva and Erbil, said the spokesman, adding
that Iraqi anti-aircraft units repulsed the enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched airstrikes against Iraq
last December, their warplanes have made 13,865 sorties over the
so-called northern and southern no-fly zones, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western alliance imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Mozambique's Hydro-power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- It is "feasible" to build a
hydroelectric dam on the Zambezi River, according to a study on
the socio-economic impact of the construction of this
hydroelectric dam.
</P>
<P>
The M'panda Ncua project is a part of Mozambique's intention to
become the main supplier of electricity to the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region, the Mozambique News Agency
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two of the main factors that work in favor of the proposed new
dam are the availability of water in the river, and the need of
the electricity market in the country and in the region,
</P>
<P>
Juliao Pondeca, an official of the Technical Unit for the
implementation of projects, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This dam, construction of which has no dates as yet, will have
the capacity to generate between 1,600 and 2,000 megawatts, and
the project is tentatively budgeted at about three billion U.S.
dollars (two billion for dam-building and one billion for the
high-voltage transmission lines southwards).
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that there are already some international
partners who have expressed their interest in investing in the
M'panda Ncua project.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government will seek opportunities to sign
agreements with them, once the remaining studies on the economic
and environmental impact of the dam are concluded, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Mozambique is selling electricity to South Africa
and Zimbabwe from the Cahora Bassa dam, which is also on the
Zambezi River and some 70 kilometers upstream from M'panda Ncua.
</P>
<P>
Cahora Bassa is the largest Portuguese investment project in
Mozambique. The Portuguese hold about 82 percent of the shares in
the dam operating company, HCB.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, Ootober 16 (Xinhua) -- Health condition has
deteriorated in south and central Iraq in the last decade, said
visiting UNICEF chief here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), told reporters that child mortality
rates in Iraq remain unchanged since UNICEF released a survey in
this regard last August.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that she followed up the child mortality
survey that UNICEF released several months ago which indicated
that Iraq's child mortality rates have more than doubled since
the imposition of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
She said that after returning to U.N. headquarters, she
will speak to Executive director of U.N. Iraq Program Benon
Sevan on the health and education conditions in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
She called on the international community to take into
considerations the influence of sanctions on children when
imposing them.
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions are tools that are used... we strongly urge that
in imposing them, one should take into account the implications
on children," she said.
</P>
<P>
As for the sanctions imposed on Iraq, she said "I don't
think that anybody thinks this should be the long-term solution
to the difficulties in this country."
</P>
<P>
She also stressed the need for speeding up delivery of
contracted medicine and medical appliances under the oil-for-food
program to Iraq.

<HEADLINE> 20 Members of Muslim Brotherhood Arrested in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- In a major blow to Egypt's
biggest Islamic group, security forces have arrested 20 senior
members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the country's Middle
East News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The arrests took place on Thursday when 16 of the Brotherhood
members were meeting at an office of the Engineers' Union in
Cairo's southern suburb of Maadi while four others were arrested
at their homes, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent detainee was Mukhtar Nouh, a leading lawyer
who defends Muslim fundamentalists. Nouh is the treasurer of the
Lawyers' Union and a former member of the Egyptian parliament, the
People's Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The detainees also included Mohammed Abdel-Badie, secretary
general of the Veterinarians' Union, Mohamed Ali Bishr, board
member of the Engineers' Union, Khaled Badawi, a lawyer and
Zaghloul, secretary general of Cairo's Doctors' Union.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian state security prosecutors have ordered that the 20
detainees be imprisoned for 15 days for interrogation, which began
on Friday, the new agency said.
</P>
<P>
The detainees were accused of joining an illegal group, holding
illegal meetings in an attempt to revive the Brotherhood,
infiltrating unions to carry out anti-government activities and
circulate anti-government materials, it added. The Thursday's
action was believed to curb Islamic extremism among the ranks of
Egypt's unions.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1928, the Muslim Brotherhood was banned in 1954. The
government of President Hosni Mubarak tolerated the group until
1995, when the authorities arrested at least 200 members of the
group. Since then, the government has cracked down on the group,
accusing its members of supporting the Islamic insurgency that
broke out in 1992. Hundreds of Brotherhood members have been
arrested and scores imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
The Mulism Brotherhood maintains that it does not resort to
violence in its campaign to revive Islamism.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Mourns Tanzanian Late Leader Nyerere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela said Saturday that he shared a deep sense
of loss and sorrow with Tanzanians at the passing away of their
late leader Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
"As we mourn the loss of a friend, a leader and
comrade-in-arms, we will take comfort in the knowledge that
through his efforts and example, we are more able to strive for
the goals we shared with him and his people," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
In a condolence message to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa,
Mandela said Nyerere was "one of Africa's greatest patriots."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he will arrive in Tanzania any time to pay last
respects to Nyerere, the founding father of the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's wife Graca Machel arrived in Tanzania Saturday and
will join the late Tanzanian leader's widow Maria Nyerere in the
mourning of Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Mandela said the freedom of South Africa, the
liberation of other oppressed people and the unity and
decolonization of the African continent were part of a single
struggle for a better world.
</P>
<P>
"His vision, his burning desire for justice and his commitment
to Africa interests were an inspiration to a whole generation of
Africa's leaders," Mandela added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela went on to say that "one thinks with humanity of the
contribution that he made to the liberation of our continent and
to freedom of South Africa. I count myself as deeply privileged to
have been amongst the first South African freedom fighter to be
received by him, when we sought his country's help as we embarked
on armed struggle."
</P>
<P>
He said even after Nyerere had stepped down from public office
people throughout the world "benefited from his leadership and
wise counsel, in pursuit of development, peace and justice."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who retired as Tanzanian president in 1985, died of
leukemia on Thursday morning in a London hospital.

<HEADLINE> WFP Food Convoy Attacked by Somali Gunmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen attacked
a large food convoy from the World Food Program (WFP) near the
Mahadday district, about 113 kilometers north of Somali capital
Mogadishu late Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses said on the VHF radio in the nearby Jowhar town
Saturday that six people, five men and a woman, were killed from
the side of the attackers during the heavy exchange of the gunfire
Friday night. Eleven of the wounded have been hospitalized in
Jowhar town
</P>
<P>
The exact casualties are not known yet, nor if there are any
fatalities from the side of the WFP convoy escort.
</P>
<P>
However, it is confirmed that the attempt of the gunmen
attacking the food convoy has been foiled and the convoy went
ahead to its destination.
</P>
<P>
The WFP convoy carried more than 252 tons of maize on 25 heavy
duty trucks from Mogadishu to the towns of El-Bur and Galhareri
and their surrounding villages in Galgudud region where the
starvation has been high since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
As the roads are troublesome between Mogadishu and other towns
in either central or southern Somalia, it sometimes takes more
than 15 days for the WFP convoys to reach a target area.
</P>
<P>
Insecurity created by outlawed gunmen adds difficulties to the
roads ruined by lack of repairing.
</P>
<P>
The WFP gives a contract to local companies through competition
and the winner delivers the food aid to its destination. The
local company that wins the contract of delivering the food
deposits an amount of money in U.S. dollars equivalent to the
value of the food to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
So, if the food is looted, it is the business company that
loses its money while the WFP would only have to loose its
principle of getting the food to the most needy people.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The President of the
World Bank, James Wolfensohn, said Tanzanian late leader Julius
Nyerere remains a source of inspiration to comfort people all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said in his condolence message that Nyerere was one
of the few world leaders with high ideals, moral integrity and
personal modesty.
</P>
<P>
"While world economists were debating the importance of capital
output ratios, Mwalimu was saying nothing was more important for
people than for being able to read and write and have access to
clean water," Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian founding father Nyerere, addressed as Mwalimu or
"teacher" in the swahili language, died of leukemia Thursday
morning in a London hospital.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said Nyerere gave his compatriots a sense of hope
and achievement early in their life as a country with few
parallels on Africa, bound by a common language Swahili and a
history almost entirely free of internal division and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank chief said Nyerere also looked after hundreds of
 thousands of refugees forced to live in western Tanzania by
political turmoil in central Africa and good enough he left office
at an age when he could certainly have continued.
</P>
<P>
"He was known as Mwalimu which was his first profession. Many
of us today still regard ourselves as his student, and we feel
very honored to have known and worked with him in his life,"
Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn concluded by saying "to the people of Tanzania and
to his wider family across Africa and around the world, I want to
say how much we share your sadness in his passing away."

HAVANA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Cuba and the International
Atomic Energy Organization (IAEO) have signed an Additional
Protocol to the Safeguard Agreements of Cuba, related to the
peaceful use of nuclear energy, local sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed Friday by Cuban Science, Technology and
Environment Minister Rosa Elena Simeon, and Mohammed Elbaradei,
IAEO general director, who arrived here Thursday for a four-day
visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban official said that the protocol shows the peaceful
purpose of the Cuban nuclear program, and is one more step in the
transparency of the projects carried out in the island, including
the Juragua Nuclear Central, in Cienfuegos, paralyzed for lack of
funds.
</P>
<P>
The visitor thanked Cuba for the signing of the protocol,
saying that his organization maintains many joint activities with
Cuba, especially in the full and peaceful use of nuclear energy in
the fields of health and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Rosa Elena Simeon said, "Cuba has always given its cooperation
to the IAEO, mentioning its assistance in the training of
specialists to use in a peaceful way all the possibilities of this
energy for the good of the Cuban people living standards."
</P>
<P>
Cuba has not signed the Nuclear Weapons Non Proliferation
Treaty because it considers this instrument discriminatory in
relation to the use of atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
Simeon said that Cuba's position has been clear about the
proliferation of nuclear weapons. "The disarming must be for
everybody, especially in a moment in which the United States
Congress rejected again the treaty," Simeon said.

process" in the third largest African country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has indicated that it would send at least 7,000 troops
to monitor the implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement
for the DRC, Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He called on the world body to speed up the deployment of
troops to the DRC which had been lobbying the U.N., together with
several southern African leaders, to send troops immediately.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of troops could allegedly only start after the
deployment of U.N. peace-keepers.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Lusaka peace process, Mudenge said that it
was very strong because it had remained in force several months
after it was signed, though no peacekeepers had been in place.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Arrest Anniversary Celebrated in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 persons marked with
a march in Santiago Saturday the first year of detention of former
military dictator Augusto Pinochet in London.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of Detained and Disappeared Persons Association
President Viviana Diez said she felt "an immense happiness"
because Pinochet has spent one year in detention.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's opponents started their march around the Alameda,
the main avenue of the capital, passed Plaza Italia and Plaza of
the Heroes. The march ended without incidents, said police.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pinochet's followers commemorated the
detention with a mass in a cathedral attended by Army Commander in
Chief General Ricardo Izurieta, and former collaborators of the
military regime.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's sympathizers shouted outside the church praises to
the military regime and insults against President Eduardo Frei.
</P>
<P>
The government of President Frei has repeatedly asked the
British government to free Pinochet, 83, for humanitarian reasons.
</P>
<P>
A British judge authorized Pinochet's extradition to Spain,
where a judge pretends to try him for crimes against the humanity
committed during the 1973-1990 military regime.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16, 1998, while recuperating
from back surgery, has spent the past year under house arrest in a
rented mansion outside London while battling attempts to extradite
him to Spain.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Chile formally requested that Britain release
Pinochet, saying that he was in no condition to endure a long
extradition trial due to deteriorating health.
</P>
<P>
The events marking the first anniversary started the day when
hundreds of retired military men and their families rallied at a
Santiago theater to demonstrate for his release.
</P>
<P>
No violence was reported during Saturday's events. The Interior
Ministry had announced that police would be on alert to prevent
clashes and sporadic outbursts of violence that have occurred
throughout Pinochet's confinement.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Vows to Stay in the Union After Nyerere's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAE ES SALAAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President Salmin
Amour Saturday called the people in the isles to remain calm at
this hard time when all Tanzanians are mourning late leader Julius
Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the ruling Revolutionary Party of Tanzania,
or Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) elders in Zanzibar to officially
brief them on the death of Nyerere, Amour said the Tanzanian
nation is mourning for one of the founders of the union of
Tanzania who left an indelible mark on the social and historical
development of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Amour, who is also the vice-chairman of the ruling party, said
he wanted the elders to be firm and not swayed. He expressed the
hopes that Nyerere' s "well trained and qualified political boys
were all out to uphold what he did and advocated - solidarity,
peace and the spirit of stability," according to reports from
Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State in Zanzibar President's Office, Mohammed
Ramia, said Friday that the union between Tanganyika and Zanzibar
will be maintained at any cost.
</P>
<P>
He added that the death of Nyerere will not under any
circumstances be an excuse to weaken or break the union the
founding father helped to establish.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the government's condolences after an emergency
cabinet meeting, Ramia said the Isles and Union governments would
jealously defend the Union, a shining example in African unity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a marine transport service company based on the
island, Azam Marine, announced that it would offer free return
boat tickets for all of Zanzibaris who wish to travel to Dar es
Salaam to pay their last respect to Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued to the press by the company Saturday said
that it had decided to volunteer the services in a move to
appreciate an immeasurable contribution by Nyerere to local and
international politics.
</P>
<P>
The body of Nyerere is expected to arrive in Tanzanian capital
Dar es Salaam next Monday by a special plane chartered by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union with Zanzibar isles in 1964 to
form Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Upbeat About Palestinian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expressed optimism about
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks Saturday, citing the release
of the second batch of Palestinian prisoners on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are advancing in a positive way as
Israel freed 151 Palestinian prisoners in the second stage despite
a week behind schedule. The delay came after the two sides ran
into dispute on who were to be freed.
</P>
<P>
There are also positive moves towards the opening of a safe
passage between the Palestinian self-rule Gaza Strip and West
Bank, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the transit route was delayed for a second time
Saturday in two weeks over disagreements on how to operate it. The
safe passage was to have opened Sunday, allowing the Palestinians
for the first time to move relatively freely between the two
separate Palestinian areas that lie on either side of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Internal Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said more
talks will be held next week to try and resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also lauded a recent Israeli decision to dismantle a
number of Jewish settlements, the country's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, has been a key mediator of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa acceded that a significant, though variant, pro-peace
trend towards reconciling with the Arabs, and particularly with
the Palestinians, was reflected in the public opinion in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the positive, progressive movement
of the peace process would reflect on the general atmosphere of
the relations between Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian-Israeli ties became tense after former Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in 1996 due to his
intransigence. Following the election of Ehud Barak in May, the
ties have been much improved as Barak is taking steps to push the
peace talks forward.

<HEADLINE> Kidnappers Get Deadline From Nicaraguan Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government gave
the kidnappers of a Canadian engineer and a Nicaraguan soldier a
deadline until Sunday night to release their hostages.
</P>
<P>
"The authority cannot continue being a hostage of the
kidnappers, and that is why we give them until this weekend to
release their prisoners, as a show of tolerance from the
government, Interior Minister Rene Herrera said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian engineer Manley Guarducci and Nicaraguan soldier
Orlando Rocha were kidnapped last September 30 by an armed group
of the Andres Castro United Front (FUAC), made up of former
Sandinista Popular Army members, which surrendered its weapons
last year.
</P>
<P>
The kidnapping occurred in a sector of the Atlantic zone of
Nicargua, where the Canadian-funded Hemconic mining company
operates and where Guarducci works.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers demand that the government honor the agreements
signed in December of 1997, which foresee the supply of land,
economic and technological assiatance and an amnesty for the
former military in exchange for their demobilization.
</P>
<P>
Army Commander Gen. Joaquin Cuadra said that the armed forces
have deployed some special troops to rescue the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"The military way would be the last choice, but you can be sure
that it would be successful," said Cuadra.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, has sent a message of
condolence to the people of Tanzania following the death of the
founding father of the nation Julius Nyerere.
</P>

the highest esteem as a great statesman, untiring advocate for
social and human justice and champion of the course of the world's
underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I will retain very fond memories of Mwalimu
(teacher in Kiswahili) as a strong supporter of refugees and other
displaced victims of armed conflicts," she noted.  Nyerere was
widely addressed as "Mwalimu," or teacher in Kiswahili, for his
intellect and integrity throughout Africa.
</P>
<P>
"As we presently witness continued deterioration in the Great
Lakes region, I trust and hope that the passing away of Mwalimu
will be overcome by our combined efforts," Ogata added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, condolences have poured in from Hungary, Botswana,
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the Pan-African
Movement, among other countries and international organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Sunday that it
expected the Commonwealth to back suspension of Pakistan after
last week's military coup.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the Commonwealth group of
countries is due to meet in London on Monday and to discuss
Pakistan's future.
</P>
<P>
"I'm meeting with some colleagues from the Commonwealth
tomorrow and the ministerial action group in London," he told BBC
television.
</P>
<P>
"The rules of the Commonwealth are quite clear. They are set
out in principles that members of the Commonwealth must abide by
democratic principles and human rights," said the foreign
secretary.
</P>
<P>
"As the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth (Chief Emeka
Anyaoku) said last week, a country which has a military coup
suspends itself from membership of the Commonwealth and the
council of the Commonwealth and therefore I would expect that
decision to be endorsed on Monday," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed at the same time that Britain remained "a
friend of Pakistan" and would continue pressure for a return to
democracy in that country.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Britain made it clear that it had frozen all direct
development assistance to the government of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after Pakistan's army, led by General Pervaiz
Musharraf, deposed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government in an
apparently bloodless coup on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Indonesian President's Reply-Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Commenting on Indonesian
President B.J. Habibie's reply-speech on Sunday noon, only the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) flatly rejected
the speech, and other factions remained vague in their final
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
In his nearly two-hour reply-speech to the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), Habibie replied to the general view
of the 11 factions in MPR on his accountability speech that he
made on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Habibie denied that his administration has seen the people of
East Timor as a burden to the nation, saying the East Timor issue
had been used by the international community to corner Indonesia
for years.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of corruption, collusion and nepotism, Habibie
said a letter on the termination of investigation into former
president Soeharto's alleged power abuse regarding foundations he
chaired was issued because there were no evidences.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the MPR Amien Rais did not give any judgment
whether the reply-speech is good or bad.
</P>
<P>
Asked on whether the president's reply speech has covered all
the factions' questions, he said: "There are many still left
behind."
</P>
<P>
Chairwoman of the PDI-P Megawati Soekarnoputri said her party
would maintain its rejection of Habibie's reply-speech.
</P>
<P>
Head of the PDI-P's faction Sutjipto said since the beginning
his party has refused the president's accountability speech, and
he won't give any further comment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sutradara Gintings, chairman of the Indonesian
National Unity faction -- one of four factions which openly aired
rejection to Habibie's accountability speech on Thursday -- said
his faction cannot accept Habibie's policy on letting the people
of East Timor have the second option -- separation from Indonesia
if most of the East Timorese rejected Jakarta's offer of autonomy
package.
</P>
<P>
Muhaimin Iskandar, spokesman of the National Awakening Party
(PKB) faction in MPR, said his faction would still learn Habibie's
reply-speech despite the fact that it remained too verbalistic.
</P>
<P>
The head of state has yet to provide concrete answers based on
the real condition during his 512-day administration, he added.
</P>
<P>
PKB also openly aired rejection to Habibie's accountability
speech.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, A.M. Saefuddin of the United Development Party
faction said Habibie had elaborated many things in his
reply-speech to the factions' view on his accountability.
</P>
<P>
The National Defense Force/Police faction, which has tried to
maintain its neutrality since the first day of MPR general
session, remains committed to its previous stand.
</P>
<P>
"We are giving the final stand on the president's
accountability to the MPR commission which is in charge of
handling the matter," said Hari Sabarno, chairman of the faction.
</P>
<P>
General Chairman of the Golkar Party Akbar Tandjung sees that
the replies given by the head of state are still incomplete.
</P>
<P>
"The Golkar Party sees there are some questions not yet
answered completely by the president, maybe because of limited
time or pages," he said.
</P>
<P>
And if in the factions' final view, the accountability speech
could not be settled through deliberations, Akbar said he is ready
to vote.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Bans Import of Vetch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
banned the import of vetch from Sunday, following a news item
carried out in different newspapers that vetch which looks like
pulse contains toxic chemicals, an official handout here said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The handout said the government never imported vetch but the
private traders have been importing the product from Australia
since the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The government has already made an inquiry from Australia's
Agriculture Ministry whether vetch is food for people or feed for
animals and whether it contains toxic elements, the handout said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government has decided to send samples of vetch to
different research institutions such as the Nutritional Science
Institute and Bangladesh Agriculture Research Institute which will
submit a report soon to ascertain if vetch is meant for human
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The government will decide about the import of vetch after
receiving the report.
</P>
<P>
Toxicity in "vetch" imported from Australia and marketed in the
country as lentil for human consumption could impair eyesight and
affect human tissues, The Daily Star newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is toxic even for animals," officials of the Institute for
Development Policy Analysis and Advocacy were quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Niger Presidential Poll begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Voting started on Sunday in the
first round of Niger's presidential election designed to restore
civilian rule in the west African country, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Major Dauda Mallam Wanke, who seized power in a military coup
last April, formally opened polls by casting his vote in the
capital Niamey and calling for a massive turnout.
</P>
<P>
If none of the seven candidates wins an outright majority in
the first round, a runoff between the top two is tentatively
scheduled for November 24 at the same time as a parliamentary
election.
</P>
<P>
The seven candidates include Mahamane Ousmane, who won the
1993 presidential poll that ushered in multi-party democracy but
was toppled in a military coup three years later.
</P>
<P>
Polling in the vast, landlocked and arid country began at 8
a.m. (0700 gmt) and will end officially at 7 p.m. (1800 gmt).
First results are likely to be released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Just over four million registered voters of the population of
10 million were due to cast their ballots in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Niger, which has a per capita gross national product of just
$200, has been pushed to the verge of bankruptcy by a collapse in
the world price of uranium, its main export. It depended largely
on foreign donors, including former colonial ruler France, to
organize the election.
</P>
<P>
The army junta ordered Niger's borders closed as part of
security measures for the election.The borders are to reopen at
midnight on Sunday.

YANTAI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Longda Group, a township
enterprise in east China's Shandong Province, was cited as a
brilliant example in industrializing agriculture at a recent
international symposium on fruit and vegetable processing.
</P>
<P>
The group has established contacts with more than 50,000 farm
households and crop growing bases with a total cultivated land of
6,600 hectares. It processed 55,000 tons of farm produce last year,
yielding an output value of 560 million yuan. Each of the over 50,
000 farm households earned an annual income of 5,000 yuan on
average by providing the group with fresh vegetables, fruit and
other farm produce.
</P>
<P>
To date, 30 similar agro-industrial enterprises have been
created in Yantai, a port city in Shandong, and they gained a
combined output value of 3.2 billion and a pre-tax profit of 290
million yuan last year. One-third of the per capita income of
local farmers comes from cooperation with these enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the International Symposium and Exhibition on
Fruit and Vegetable Processing Technology and Industrialization (
ISEFVTI), which closed in Yantai on Saturday, described the
practice of Yantai as a welcome new trend in China's rural
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and president
of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said at a press conference
hosted by the ISEFVTI that industrialization of agriculture should
be the focus of economic growth in rural China in the next century.
</P>
<P>
China's rural economy witnessed two substantial leaps in the
past two decades. One was led by the nationwide implementation of
the household contract responsibility system with remuneration
linked to output, and the other derived from the enormous growth
of township enterprises.

WASHINGTON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration has offered to help Russia
complete a key radar site and to share more American radar data if
Russia agrees to renegotiate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty so
that the United States could build a national missile defense
system, Senior U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
-- The new military-led government in Pakistan is likely to
pursue foreign policies that are acceptable and even pleasantly
surprising to the Clinton administration, according to observers.

<TEXT>
<P>
At present, China's rural economy is on the verge of a third
leap. However, some Chinese economists say that this process is
being retarded by several elements.
</P>
<P>
For example, as one of the largest farm produce growers in the
world, China turns out hundreds of million tons of vegetables and
about 10 million tons of fruit annually. But much of this harvest
is ruined every year due to poor freshness-retaining facilities
and technology, outmoded ways of management, and slow processing.
</P>
<P>
According to specialists attending the symposium, the
percentage of fruit that is processed in developed countries
averages 23 percent, while that in China is only four percent.
Moreover, the country lacks production variety for special needs.
</P>
<P>
Dr. T.C. Tso, an American agronomist, advised his Chinese
colleagues to heighten the value of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
As China readjusts its industrial structure, it is impossible
at the present stage to speed up the farm produce processing
sector by expanding the scale. A workable method is to turn more
township enterprises into vegetable and fruit processors by
improving product mix and readjusting township enterprises so as
to make better use of their existing assets, as has been done in
Yantai.
</P>
<P>
Song Jian said the symposium on fruit and vegetables provides
Chinese enterprises an opportunity to keep abreast of the advanced
technique of other countries, promote technical transfer, and
industrialize Chinese agriculture.

<HEADLINE> President Writes Foreword for Book on China's Major Economic Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin has
inscribed the title and written a foreword for "Major Events in
China's 50 Years of Economic Development," a book that came off
the press here today.
</P>
<P>
In the foreword, entitled "Sum Up the Past, Explore the Future,
" Jiang says that under the correct leadership of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), the country has made remarkable economic
achievements since the People's Republic was founded 50 years ago,
especially in the 20 years of reforms and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, also CPC General Secretary, says China has strengthened
the agricultural sector and built up an independent and
comparatively integrated industrial system out of an extreme
poverty.
</P>
<P>
The country's modernization drive has now achieved continuous
progress, resulting in prosperity in all undertakings, and China
has notably strengthened integrated national power with dramatic
and lasting changes in both rural and urban life resulting in
improved living standards of the people, he writes.
</P>
<P>
The magnificent economic achievements in China during the past
50 years is the most splendid chapter in the history of the
Chinese nation, Jiang says, adding that it is of great importance
for China to sum up the enormous achievements and abundant
experiences in the past 50 years in order to push the country's
great cause of socialist modernization forward into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The book was compiled by the Office of the Leading Group on

<HEADLINE> Britain's Cook Warns France Over Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook warned on Sunday that France will have to back down over its
refusal to lift the ban on British beef or face legal action.
</P>
<P>
"The French are ultimately going to have to give way on this,"
he told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
"They're in the wrong. They cannot sustain this position
ultimately and if they maintain this position they will lose. ...
This is the point we made this weekend. The sooner they recognise
this, the sooner they accept the binding agreement the better," he
said.
</P>
<P>
However, both French President Jacques Chirac and Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin keep on defending their decision to
continue the ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
They said they have new scientific evidence suggesting that it
is too soon to give British beef a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said in Finnland that a French panel had decided that
British beef remained unsafe. He insisted that he "had no option".
</P>
<P>
"It was absolutely impossible for the government to ignore this
unanimous scientific decision," Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
During the European summit held in Finnland this week, British
Prime Minister Tony Blair also warned France that its continued
ban on British beef had broken the European Union (EU) law and was
"entirely unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
The European Commission lifted its three-and-a-half year ban on
British beef on August 1, after Britain implemented a wide-ranging
cattle cull and tough new safety rules in the wake of so-called "
Mad Cow Disease".
</P>
<P>
Only France and Germany have yet to pass legislation bringing
them into line with the EU decision.

<HEADLINE> Harvard Professor Lectures at China's Oldest University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- When Cambridge University was
founded in Britain in 1167, Yuelu Academy in central China's Hunan
Province had already had 191 years of history. Today, a lecture by
Professor Tu Weiming from America's Harvard University was offered
at this oldest of China's institutes of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
The lecture entitled Dialogue between Confucianism and Cultures
was delivered to an audience of about 1,000 who were seated in the
school's antique courtyard, a scene very familiar in China a
century ago. Since then, the old schools and schooling system have
been replaced by Western-style teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
The lecture was transmitted via satellite TV all over the
country and was also available to Internet users worldwide at a
the website: www.nhnh/hnstv.com.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tu's talk lasted 40 minutes, during which he said
that based on Confucian ideology, nations can live harmoniously
together without surrendering their own characteristics. This
thesis is in conflict with his colleague at Harvard, S.P.
Huntington.
</P>
<P>
"Talks can alleviate conflicts among nations in the new
millennium, and people influenced by Confucian concepts are more
likely to accept this idea," said the renowned neo-Confucian.
</P>
<P>
His lively talk on the quadrangle ground inspired enthusiasm
for a discussion of the humanities and social sciences. Questions
on exchanges between people of various cultures and with different
beliefs followed in free discussions for the next hour.
</P>
<P>
Replying to questions, Tu said that those people who have taken
hold of most of the world's capital and materials should shoulder
more responsibilities in making use of these resources to
stimulate cultural development, and this is what the broader sense
of Confucianism is talking about.
</P>
<P>
Tu's speech rejuvenated a traditional discourse teaching
atmosphere at the centuries old academy, whose democratic teaching
has influenced many generations of open-minded talent, including
late Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
The old-style university education thrived in China during the
Song Dynasty in the 10th century when it was aimed at selecting
high-ranking officials to serve the imperial families. They also
taught the Confucian classics and often invited renowned scholars
from all over the country to lecture and talk with students to
encourage their openness to new ideas.
</P>
<P>
Yuelu Academy President Zhu Hanmin said his school wants to
revive the "democratic way of teaching" tradition, and will invite
more scholars from home and abroad to lecture every month. Chinese-
American scientist Cheng Ning Yang, and Jin Yong, a famous writer
from Hong Kong, are expected to give lectures at the school before
long.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese scholars here said that the revival of the "
academic rostrum" will place Yuelu Academy, under Hunan University,
in the forefront of China's academic exchanges in social sciences.

<P>
OTTAWA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Car theft has risen 88 percent
in Canada over the past decade, a Canadian press report said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Organized-crime rings are mostly targeting Ontario and Quebec
for expensive cars and, for the first time, Montreal and Toronto
have reported carjackings this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the victims are over 50 with many saying they
were robbed of their high-end cars at gun or knife-point.
</P>
<P>
A 69-year-old Montreal doctor was one of the 11 recent victims
to report to police. The doctor was forced to surrender car keys
to his Mercedes sedan after a gang of three knocked him to the
ground in the parking lot outside his clinic.
</P>
<P>
Crime rings are shipping the cars elsewhere to the stolen-car
market, police say, adding "the carjacking trend is well-developed
in the United States. It looks like time has caught up to us."

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Calls for Reducing Burden on Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- In a keynote address delivered
to a recent national teleconference, Vice Premier Wen Jiabao urged
local governments at all levels to attach greater importance to
reducing the burden on farmers.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier called for a high-degree political
responsibility and the adopting of measures to firmly end all
activities that could increase their burden.
</P>
<P>
From now until early next year, greater administration and
supervision must be in this area in order to safeguard social
stability in rural areas, said Wen, who is also a member of the
Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wen pointed out that it is the CPC's basic policy to reduce the
economic burden on farmers and that many of these burdens have
been curbed because the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council have paid consistent and great attention to the issue,
while local governments at all levels have also made their efforts.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the problem has never been resolved at its
root, and is quite serious in some localities.
</P>
<P>
Unless the economic burden is really reduced, farmers will not
be able to acquire the capability and enthusiasm to increase their
investment, readjust crop structure, develop production, and
increase their incomes, the vice premier noted.
</P>
<P>
Now, as the autumn harvest and government procurement of farm
products begin, the very time when all sorts of levies are
collected in the countryside is also the time to confront this
issue, according to the vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Wen attributed the inability to resolve this long-standing
problem to the failure of some localities to carry out the policy
of reducing these burdens. The policy must be implemented
unswervingly, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He ordered the abolishment of all local rules that are contrary
to the central government policy in this regard and an end to any
overcharges levied by local governments and to all illegal levies.
The leadership at all levels must ensure that no major cases
related to economic burdens on farmers occur in their localities,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier pledged that the central government will
propel local governments to reduce the burden, check any
irregularities, enforce severe punishment in major cases,
especially those resulting in death or injury, reduce taxis and
levies for disaster-strichken farmers, and strengthen the
education for and control of grassroots officials.

<P>
TIANJIN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Around ten thousand alumni
gathered at Nankai University in northern China city of Tianjin
today to celebrate the 80th anniversary of the university's
founding.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC), sent a congratulatory letter for
the event in which he said he hopes that all faculty members will
work hard to build the university into one of the best in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jieping, vice-chairman of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee,
together with presidents, scholars, and specialists from over 100
universities both at home and abroad, attended the ceremonial
activities.
</P>
<P>
Nankai University was established by educators Yan Fansun and
Zhang Boling, and the school is now considered a model among
modern colleges.
</P>
<P>
In the past 80 years it has nurtured some 100,000 graduates in
many fields, among whom are Zhou Enlai, late Chinese premier, Chen
Xingshen, a renowned Chinese mathematician, Wu Ta-you, a famous
physicist, and Cao Yu, an eminent playwright.

<HEADLINE> Danish Royal Tableware Exhibition Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of porcelain,
silver and crystal tableware used by Danish royalty opened at
Beijing's Palace Hotel today.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibits are Flora Danica and Blue Fluted pieces made
by Denmark's Royal Copenhagen Co., both luxury porcelain dinner
services with universal appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Fluted design originated in China, and is thought to
be an abstract version of chrysanthemums. Since 1775 when the
Royal Copenhagen Porcelain Manufactory was opened, Blue Fluted
table service has been its most popular design.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Fluted pattern appears deceivingly simple to produce,
yet nearly 1,000 artists' brushstrokes are required for each piece.
</P>
<P>
Svend Auken, visiting Danish minister of Environment and Energy,
said at today's opening ceremony that Danish people are
particularly proud of the porcelain products from Royal Copenhagen,
and regard them as typical Danish products.
</P>
<P>
"However, we should not forget that at the very beginning, we
Danes learned the technology for producing porcelain from China's
ceramic traditions and workmanship," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fact that high quality and expensive Danish
porcelain is now entering the Chinese market is a strong evidence
of China's rapid economic development and the considerable growth
of income in the country over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the opening ceremony were Christopher Bo
Bramsen, the Danish ambassador to China, and Chinese foreign trade
officials.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Lashes out at U.S., Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday lashed out at the United States
and Israel, calling them "two vivid examples of the hegemonic
powers" in the world.
</P>
<P>
The two "use any possible means to remove any obstacle on their
own way," the leader told visiting former South African President
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
There are powers in the contemporary era that consider
themselves the main rulers of the globe and interfere in any part
of the world when their interests demand so, and do not hesitate
to commit human massacre or inflict heavy destruction on nations,
he further accused.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the recent threat against Iran by the U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin, Khamenei said that the threat
was a sign of the selfish and oppressive policies of the
U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said earlier this month that the U.S. had information,
but no proof, on Iran's role in the bomb attack on the U.S.
military base in Khobar, Saudi Arabia in 1996, in which 23
Americans were killed and more than 300 others injured.
</P>
<P>
He urged Iran to help U.S. in the probe of the Khobar case, but
warning that a conclusion of Iran's involvement in the bombing
case would leave Iran open to a U.S. response, including possible
U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
Rubin's remarks angered the Iranian authority, which soon
rejected a visa application of his wife Christina Amanpour, a
famous reporter of the Cable News Network.
</P>
<P>
Iran has repeatedly denied any role in the Khobar case and
refused to cooperate with the U.S. in the investigation, saying
that the case was an internal affair of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Mandela, Khamenei also rejected the
Israeli identity, saying that the Zionists (Israelis) expelled
Palestinians from their homeland and have so far committed all
possible forms of crimes against them in an attempt to usurp
their territories.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and other hegemonic powers have assisted the
Zionists in such an attempt, he said, however the Israeli regime
today feels that it has been choked by the Palestinian issue,
because a 10-million strong Palestinian nation with faithful,
strong and determined personalities are bent on continuing their
struggle for the restoration of their rights.
</P>
<P>
He condemned and rejected as unacceptable expulsion of
Palestinian people from their homeland and transfer of a group of
Jews from the U.S., Europe, Russia and other parts of the world to
the occupied Palestine (Israel).
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the Palestinians would move
forward towards their goals in the light of their continued
struggles, adding that certainly the Palestinian nation would
emerge victorious and would regain not only the West Bank but the
entire Palestinian territory.
</P>
<P>
Palestine belongs to Palestinians, and the Palestinian Muslims,
Jews and Christians will live together, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed satisfaction with Mandela's success in the
short period of his responsibility serving in the capacity of
South African president.
</P>
<P>
Mandela in the meeting appreciated Iran's move to cut off
relations with the former South African apartheid regime
immediately after victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979 and
set up closer ties with the popular movement in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that the independent nations should exercise
solidarity to stand against the big powers. With solidarity the
independent states can make good on the injustice done against
them by the big powers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela arrived here on Saturday for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Horticulture Expo Welcomes More Elderly Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- '99 World Horticulture
Exposition in southwest China's Yunnan Province today featured
free tours for elderly people.
</P>
<P>
A number of activities and special services were offered here
in celebration of the International Year of the Elderly today,
which coincided with a traditional Chinese festival of the elderly
who usually go for outdoor tours and mountain climbing on the day.
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 visitors above the age of 65 have visited the
gardens at the exposition for the past five months, according to
statistics, and the total number of visitors has now passed 8.7
million.
</P>
<P>
Today, the ninth day of the ninth month on the Chinese lunar
calendar, was designated as Elderly Persons Day in Yunnan in 1988,
which suggests an increasing awareness of caring for older people,
as Chinese society is becoming an increasingly more aged one.
Fully one-tenth of China's population is now aged 60 and above,
around 126 million people.
</P>
<P>
Each exhibition hall at the exposition has a special corridor
for the elderly to protect them from being knocked over by the
flowing crowds, and this friendly environment has attracted many
old visitors. One 82-year-old man said that he has visited the
exposition four times.
</P>
<P>
Today, the white-haired folks toured the blossoming gardens,
where they could also avail themselves of free medical and legal
advice.

<HEADLINE> National Craft Show '99 Starts in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A three-day National Craft Show
'99 started in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Sunday with the
aim to promote export of the country's handicraft products.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the show, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said the
rapid and massive expansion of cottage and handicraft industries
could help to alleviate poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
The handicraft sector could help the creation of
self-employment among the unemployed youths, specially the
womenfolk, and the rural economy can be strengthened through this
sector, she said.
</P>
<P>
Terming the people of Bangladesh as ardent lovers of art,
Hasina said their artistic mind can be reflected through the
growth of the handicraft.
</P>
<P>
She advised the producers of handicraft to manufacture products
keeping in mind the demand and fashion of the time, and assured
her government's readiness to extend necessary help and
cooperation in developing the handicraft industry.
</P>
<P>
Underscoring the need for setting up a design center for the
handicraft industries, the prime minister said the government
would provide land or a house for the center which should also
cater for research and training facilities.
</P>
<P>
She announced that awards at national level would be introduced
for best designs of handicraft.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 stalls of different handicraft products made of cane,
bamboo, leather, brass, fabrics, wax and other materials have been
put up in the exhibition, jointly organized by the Export
Promotion Bureau and the Bangladesh Handicraft Manufacturers and
Exporters Association.

<HEADLINE> HK to Introduce More Mainland Professionals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
considering a plan to introduce some 2,000 outstanding mainland
professionals annually as a move to enhance its status as a high-
tech center, according to local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
No quota or minimum wage will be set for the scheme that is
expected to be launched around the end of this year, but
applicants must possess excellent qualifications and expertise
unavailable in Hong Kong, the "Sunday Morning Post" quoted
Secretary for Security Regina Ip Lau Suk-yee as saying.
</P>
<P>
A selection committee composed of officials, businessmen,
academics and legislators will be set up to handle applications,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Qualified applicants should have a doctorate degree from a
prestigious university, sound publication and research record, or
working experience in renowned firms, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The professionals will initially be issued with a one-year
working visa and are not allowed to change jobs during this period.
After that, they can switch jobs or become self-employed when
immigration officials will reassess their cases.

<HEADLINE> Macao-Zhuhai Bridge to Be Completed in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Macao, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The construction of a bridge
linking Macao with the neighboring Zhuhai City is well under way
and will be completed by the end of November, the Macao Daily News
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The bridge, which is named Lotus Flower Bridge, and related
border checking facilities will be put into use before December 20
when China resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Lotus Flower Bridge will act as a second land passage
between Macao and the inland areas of China besides the Gongbei
Customs, which now serves as the only passageway between Macao and
the inland areas and is often crowded with mounting personnel and
cargo exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that vehicles run along the left side of
the road in Macao while those in Zhuhai run along the right side,
a bridge approach will be able to help vehicles change driving
lanes when they pass through the main bridge.
</P>
<P>
The bridge will have a total length of 1,716 meters with six
lanes. Construction of the bridge started in June of 1998 with
joint funding by the governments of Macao and Zhuhai.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Establish National AIDS Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
started moves to establish a central body to coordinate the
currently fragmented efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The state has gazetted a Bill which, if passed by Parliament,
will necessitate the transformation of the ad hoc National AIDS
Co-ordination Program into an all encompassing National AIDS
Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ), the Zimbabwe News Agency reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Bill seeks to control the effects of the epidemic and to
promote and co-ordinate the application of the necessary policies
and strategies and evaluating their effectiveness in combating the
incurable disease that has afflicted a fifth of Zimbabwe's 12.5
million population and kills almost 1, 000 people every week.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the NACZ, which would mobilize and manage
resources in support of a national response to the epidemic, had
long been called for by concerned groups who felt that the
government was not doing enough to educate the nation on the
disease and mitigate the scourge.
</P>
<P>
There had been calls for AIDS to be declared a national
disaster so the government could mobilize finance and other
resources to launch a blitz against its spreading which has been
described as very fast.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economic woes are now partly blamed on the pandemic
which is prevalent among the economically viable age groups of
between 15 and 49 years, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Council would be responsible for enhancing the capacity of
various sectors of the community to respond to the epidemic and
co-ordinate their responses while it would also encourage the
provision of facilities to treat and care for infected people.
</P>
<P>
It would also promote and co-ordinate research into the
epidemic and ensure the effective dissemination and application of
the results and to encourage and disseminate any information
relating to HIV/AIDS.

LAGOS, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former Chief of Army
Staff Lt. Gen. Ishaya Bamaiyi has been put under house arrest to

which took place under the late military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha, a

hardly around Army Headquarters as he was often said to be on
"special assignments" .

Abiola, acclaimed winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential election.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Commander of the Zimbabwe
Defence Forces General Vitalis Zvinavashe said there is need for
new blood in the national army to replace ageing soldiers, most of
whom have been serving since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
According to the army magazine released here on Sunday,
Zvinavashe said some 40,000 soldiers in the army and 5,000 in the
air force were due for retirement by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said the conditions of the forces needed to be improved
since they had been constrained by limited resources which could
be rejected by young recruits who had no political knowledge of
the liberation struggle which was characterized by hardships.
</P>
<P>
The army has recently embarked on a recruitment drive which has
been seen by many as a move to fill in gaps created by deaths in
the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
According to the army magazine, the army was not spared by the
AIDS scourge which afflicts mostly the 15-49 age group.

NICOSIA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' chief migration
officer Christodoulos Nicolaides was arrested on Saturday for
bribes-taking and abuse of power in issuing visas to foreigners,
local media reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaides was suspended from service in the Immigration
Department on Thursday. His arrest came one day after the arrest
of Charalambos Anastasiades, twin brother of ruling Democratic
Rally party leader Nicos Anastasiades.
</P>
<P>
The arrests of the two men, with suspected accomplices
including three policemen, followed Cyprus' Justice Ministry and
police pledges to crack down on the cabaret business, which was
accused of involvement in prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police last week launched an emergency probe into
allegations that police officers are involved in flesh-trading
and are being paid to supply fake residence permits for foreign
women in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has a bad reputation for importing female cabaret
dancers who are then allegedly forced to work as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Police has information that Nicolaides was involved in at
least 35 cases of issuing irregular residence permits to
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Anastasiades worked as a labour agent specializing in
importing foreign workers, including cabaret "artists", to
Cyprus.

JOHANNESBURG, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading South African newspapers Sunday:
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The South African government is to crack down on schools
which are performing badly. The state may even close down poorly
run schools.
</P>
<P>
Sunday World:
</P>
<P>
-- The South African government has pledged 40 million rand
(6.7 million U.S. dollars) to support the fight against the
malaria-carrying anopheles mosquito, one of mankind's smallest but
deadliest enemies.
</P>
<P>
City Press:
</P>
<P>
-- A major investigation has been launched by the police and
various government departments, into a nationwide loan scam
running into millions of rand. The investigation is linked to
allegations that corrupt home affairs officials are issuing false
identity documents to a crime syndicate so it can obtain
fraudulent loans from micro-lenders.

<HEADLINE> Environment Law to Be Enacted in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A bill to regulate and
coordinate environment management in Kenya will be submitted to
Parliament for discussion in an effort to combat environmental
deterioration in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Nation newspaper quoted Minister for Mineral
Exploitation Jackson Kalweo as saying that lack of strong
legislation had made it difficult for the government to prosecute
people destroying the environment.
</P>
<P>
If the Environmental Management and Coordination Bill was
approved in parliament, a National Environment Management
Authority would be set up to monitor and coordinate various
environmental activities, Kalweo said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a National Environment Council which "shall
be responsible for policy formulation, setting national goals and
promote cooperation among public departments, local authorities,
private sector, and non-governmental organizations", according to
Kalweo.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill has been criticized as too inclusive and
likely to create a large and ineffective bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Civil Service Richard Leaky, former Kenya Wildlife
Service boss, said early this year that the draft legislation was
"extremely ambitious and too large in scope".

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Scotland's Dario Franchitti
led for the majority of the race Sunday to win the Gold Coast Indy,
overtaking non-finisher Juan Montoya of Colombia in the CART FedEx
championship points race.
</P>
<P>
Franchitti, the pole winner who trailed Montoya by 12 points
going into Sunday's second-last race of the season, won the 65-lap
race under threatening skies and over the 4.5-kilometer Surfers
Paradise temporary street course in one hour 58 minutes and 40.726
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Franchitti only relinquished the lead during pit stops in his
Kool Reynard Honda. Italian Max Papis, who pitted only twice,
snuck into second, 2.6 seconds behind Franchitti.
</P>
<P>
Adrian Fernandez of Mexico was third, Bryan Herta of the United
States fourth and Michael Andretti of the United States fifth.
</P>
<P>
With the win Franchitti moves to 209 points on the season and
Montoya stalls on the 200 points he carried into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Colombian appeared to lock his wheels on the
49th lap when he was running third behind Franchitti and Fernandez.
His car slid heavily into the tire barrier, putting him out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
Franchitti, who has six career wins, will carry his nine-point
lead into the final race of the season, the Marlboro 500, at
Fontana, Calif., on October 31.

<HEADLINE> Rejection of Fund Request May Render S'pore Shares Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Local shares are expected to
be weaker after Singapore gave red light to a U.S. fund's excess
stake of the Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) and required it
to reduce its share-holdings in DBS, according to reports Sunday
by local media.
</P>
<P>
LianHe Zaobao, the leading local newspaper in Chinese, said
that shares will be weakened by the case in which the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) rejected an application from U.S.
fund Brandes Investment Partner (BIP) to become a substantial
share-holder of the DBS Group Holdings (DBSH) and required the
fund to dispose its holding of DBSH shares in excess of five
percent within three months.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times, the Sunday edition of local leading English
newspaper the Straits Times, quoted an asset management director
as saying that for the first time MAS has rejected an application
to be a substantial holder and DBS stocks might be weak when
trading resumes Monday due to the impending sale of BIP's holding
and other reasons such as Wall Street's plunge.
</P>
<P>
The paper also quoted a foreign broking house head as saying
that the move taken by MAS "will be a double whammy."
</P>
<P>
The BIP, a fund registered in the U.S., made an application to
be a substantial share-holder of DBSH last month after
accumulating more than five percent limit allowed in Singapore's
Banking Act.
</P>
<P>
MAS rejected BIP's application on the account that BIP did not
obtain MAS approval for its going over the five percent
share-holding limit when it acquired 6.9 percent stake of DBSH in
late August, which was believed to be a breach of the Banking Act.
</P>
<P>
Under the Section 17 of the Banking Act, no party can acquire a
five percent interest in the voting shares of a
Singapore-incorporated bank without first obtaining approval from
the MAS.
</P>
<P>
According to latest report, BIP is now holding 7.1 percent
stake of DBS and needs to sell off 22.6 million shares to meet the
requirement by the MAS. The excess shares are worth 418.1 million
Singapore dollars (about 248 million U.S. dollars) based on last
Friday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, the Ministry of Information and the
Arts (MITA) said Saturday that the Singapore government would
redefine the three percent share-holding limit in newspaper
companies and apply it to fund managers so as to ensure that no
single person or company can exercise undue control over a
newspaper company.
</P>
<P>
MITA took the move after the U.S. Capital Group had become a
substantial share-holder of the Singapore Publishing Holdings
(SPH) by acquiring an accumulated 5.05 percent stake of the SPH in
early September.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Newspaper and Printing Presses Act (NPPA)
stipulates that no person shall, without the approval from the
ministry, hold either directly or indirectly through nominees more
than three percent or the ordinary shares issued by a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
AS the Capital Group is a nominee in holding the shares and not
a beneficial owner, it was not seen as an offender that breached
this provision as currently worded.
</P>
<P>
However, after the NPPA is amended, the Capital Group has to
divert its excess shares within a fixed period.
</P>
<P>
The Capital Group's holding of SPH shares had grown to 20.04
million shares or 5.49 percent according to latest report.
</P>
<P>
That works out to 9.1 million shares in excess of the three
percent limit and the excess shares are worth 270.9 million
Singapore dollars (about 161 million U.S. dollars) at Friday's
closing price.

</P>
<P>
The troupe's leader Su Guo-qing told Xinhua that the visit was
very successful in introducing Chinese culture and art to the
Maldives and promoting understanding between the peoples of the
two countries.

determined to put in place "bold budgetary measures designed to
provide more macro-economic stability to enhance economic growth
and promote genuine social development".
</P>
<P>
He cited the repeal of the enterprises promotions decree 1989
and the abolition of the dual exchange rate system as part of
incentives in the policy measures put in place to allow for an

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian trade deficit has
 increased by 60.5 percent in its 1998/99 fiscal year ending on
July 7, the Capital newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Trade and Industry Ministry was quoted as saying
that the total import expenditure has risen to 8.97 billion birr
(1.1 billion U.S. dollars), while at the same time export revenue
has declined to 3.5 billion birr (430 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Latest figures indicate that in the last fiscal year, Ethiopian
 foreign exchange earnings from export only covered 39.5 percent
of import expenditure.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, import expenditure on petroleum has
increased by 46.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that export revenue has declined by 14.6 percent.
Much of the decline was caused by the decrease in foreign exchange
earnings from coffee export.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian National Authority Saturday strongly
condemned Prime Minister Ehud Barak's compromise with settler
leaders last week on the dismantling of settlement encampments,
saying it "legitimizes theft by forces."
</P>
<P>
The compromise leaves 32 of the 42 settlement encampments
built since the signing of the Wye agreement last year in place,
while making a settler council responsible for evacuating the
others.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is trying to take advantage of the improvement in its
diplomatic status since the change of government in July in order
to be accepted into the group of "western and other" states at the
United Nations and in other international bodies.
</P>
<P>
Israel is currently the only member-state of the United Nations
that does not belong to a regional group. As a result, it is
barred from serving as one of the rotating members of the Security
Council and from holding positions in the management of
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Nine foreign workers who were being held in prison prior to
their deportation escaped on Friday night from a prison in Ramle,
near Tel Aviv. Public Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami set up a
commission of inquiry Saturday to examine the circumstances of the
jail-break and to look into the system of incarcerating foreign
workers in general.
</P>
<P>
Since the deportation policy was introduced in 1996, hundreds
of foreign workers who entered Israel illegally have been held
in custody and many have been deported even though their employers
owed them money.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The opening of the "safe passage" route linking the West
Bank city of Hebron and the Gaza Strip scheduled for Sunday was
postponed due to what Palestinian spokesmen called "technical
problems."
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in two weeks the opening of the route
had been delayed. Under the Sharm el Sheikh agreement, the route
should have opened on October 3.

<HEADLINE> Russia: New Doctrine Allows First Use of Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Russia may use nuclear weapons
against states, nuclear or otherwise, that threaten its vital
national interests, a top defense official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the
General Staff and one of the authors of Russia's new military
doctrine, said new dangers are threatening Russia although the
threat of a global nuclear war has been effectively reduced to the
minimum.
</P>
<P>
Russia "may use nuclear weapons if its existence as a state,
and its independence and territorial integrity come under threat,"
Manilov told the weekly Interfax Vremya.
</P>
<P>
He described NATO's eastward expansion as one of the potential
threats to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"After the Warsaw Pact broke up, it seemed that NATO is losing
its meaning. It was a wrong impression. On the contrary, a new and
very serious threat -- NATO's eastward enlargement -- arose," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The expansion of the NATO military structure and the drawing
of new countries into it actually means the emergence of new
demarcation lines in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"This is a potential threat to Russia, as these lines are
advancing towards Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft of the new military doctrine was published earlier
this month in the Red Star newspaper and the Russian Security
Council, a top advisory body, is scheduled to discuss the draft in
November.

Habibie Sunday noon delivered a speech before the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), replying to the general view of the
11 factions in MPR on his accountability speech that he made on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
In his nearly two-hour reply-speech, Habibie denied that his
administration has seen the people of East Timor as a burden to
the nation, saying the East Timor issue had been used by the
international community to corner Indonesia for years.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Head of State also denied allegation that his
administration did nothing to save the lives of
pro-integrationists, but claimed that his government entrusted
their fate to the United Nations Mission in East Timor (Unamet).
</P>
<P>
"It is not true that we do nothing to deal with the problems of
the East Timorese people. What we have done is to let the Unamet
determine their destiny. But the Unamet (staffers) played an
unfair role," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the MPR's meetings on Friday and Saturday, all factions
in MPR were critical over Habibie's handling of the East Timor
issue, lamenting its likely separation from Indonesia as a result.
They criticized Habibie for not bringing the option of a ballot to
the MPR before executing the plan.
</P>
<P>
But Habibie in his reply-speech denied the accusation that he
had not consulted with the MPR on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign Minister Ali Alatas has always provided explanations
on East Timor each time he has a working meeting with the House's
Commission I, and the commission has agreed to the two options
(autonomy or independence)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the bitter feeling that this nation would have
following the defeat of pro-autonomy faction in the U.N.-organized
ballot, Habibie reiterated that the ballot returns need to be
accepted.
</P>
<P>
Touching on his government's efforts to cope with a number of
problems of human rights violations, Habibie reminded all layers
of the nation, especially the military apparatus, to build deep
consciousness towards respect for human rights so that all forms
of human rights abuses can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The president maintained that the government has undertaken
proper steps handling the recent series of riots and their
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
According to Habibie, the handling of the cases should be
directed to achieving the long-term objective of promoting legal
awareness among the people, as well as solutions to tackle the
roots of the problems.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of corruption, collusion and nepotism, Habibie
said a letter on the termination of investigation (SP3) into
former president Soeharto's alleged power abuse regarding
foundations he chaired was issued because there were no evidences.
</P>
<P>
He said that the SP3 is not absolutely effective. If there are
new evidences, the case could be continued. Asides from that, he
added, the SP3 issuance is not related to other cases involving
Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Of the 700 MPR members, 613 attended the MPR's plenary session
chaired by MPR Chairman Amien Rais, compared to the 638 MPR
Members who attended the president's accountability speech.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11 MPR factions, the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle, the National Awakening Party, the Indonesian National
Unity Faction and the Love the Nation Democratic Party have flatly
rejected his accountability speech.
</P>
<P>
The United Ummat Sovereignty faction accepted the speech, and
other factions failed to come down on one side or the other,
referring the speech to the MPR commission which will be formed to
deliberate it.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Agrees to Host Palestinian Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 17 Xinhua) -- Jordan has agreed to host
reconciliation talks between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
the powerful Palestinian opposition Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine (DFLP), the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced Saturday by visiting DFLP leader
Nayef Hawatmeh after his talks with Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh said he asked Rawabdeh to host a meeting between
Arafat and his Damascus-based faction, and the Jordanian premier
has given the green light to such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
The date for the meeting has not been fixed, but possibly in
the end of October or early November, Hawatmeh said.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP has opened dialogue with Arafat's Fatah, the
mainstream faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), and Arafat met with Hawatmeh in Cairo last August for the
first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
The DFLP had been opposed to the peace talks between Israel and
the PLO.
</P>
<P>
Hawatmeh said earlier this month he would consider taking part
in the final status talks between Israel and the Palestinians,
marking a possible change in his policies towards the peace talks
with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Washington removed the DFLP in early October from an official
list of terrorist groups, apparently in support for the
reconciliation process among the Palestinians. The DFLP earlier
said that it would like to normalize its ties with the U.S. once
it is no longer on the list.
</P>
<P>
Currently the DFLP and the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine (PFLP) constitute the backbone of a Palestinian
opposition alliance in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The PFLP has also started a reconciliation talk with Arafat,
but it still refused to take part in the upcoming final status
talks between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Antelope Poaching Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China has basically contained
the rampant killing of Tibetan antelopes by sustained crackdowns
on wildlife poaching in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese forest rangers have arrested 3,000 Tibetan antelope
poachers and confiscated 20,000 furs, 1,100 kg of cashmere, 400
rifles and 190,000 rounds of ammunition, and 171 motor vehicles
since 1990, said Cao Zhen, an official with the State Forestry
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The central government staged a two-week-long raid on the
poaching of Tibetan antelope and other rare animals in Qinghai
Province and the Xinjiang Uygur and Tibet Autonomous regions in
western China last April.
</P>
<P>
Along with these efforts, eleven forest protection centers have
been created in the Altun Mountains and the wild Hoh Xil Nature
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
State forest and public security departments will continue to
cooperate with provinces in western China and neighboring
countries to tighten the protection of wild animals and block
antelope-product smuggling channels, Cao said.

<HEADLINE> Huge Ancient Conch Found in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- A huge fossilized conch with an
estimated age of 200 million years has been found by a fisherman
in the Yongjiang River in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The iron-red conch fossil is 88 centimeters long and 56
centimeters wide, its thickest part is 20 centimeters, and it
weighs about 60 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of the substance inside the conch and its extreme
hardness shows that this is a 200-million-year-old sea conch, said
Huang Qishan, director of the region's museum of natural history.
</P>
<P>
The current region of Guangxi was a stretch of sea some 300
million years ago. When the sea turned into land, the conch
apparently remained, and later was washed into the Yongjiang River,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
This find is unprecedented and will be of great value for
researching the evolution of marine life, the expert noted.

<HEADLINE> Basis of Myanmar Economy: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has taken agriculture as
the basis of its economy to meet the basic food and nutritional
needs of the people, said Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General Khin
Nyunt.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a ceremony here Saturday marking the 1999 World Food
Day, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, noted that the country's agriculture, in
which 63 percent of the working people are involved, provides for
36 percent of the national gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
He stated that for the first time in Myanmar's history,
large-scale commercial agriculture is being practiced with the
involvement of the private sector which has reclaimed and is
reclaiming hundreds of thousands of areas as agricultural and
plantation land.
</P>
<P>
With the rebound in agricultural production, he hopes Myanmar,
once one of the foremost food exporting countries in the world, to
become a major food exporter of the region in the near future by
implementing necessary policies to ensure that there should not be
any problem with regard to food sufficiency in the future even
though it has none at present.
</P>
<P>
On his government's agricultural undertakings, he said that it
has built 101 large, medium, and small-scale irrigation facilities
since 1988 at a cost of more than 22.8 billion Kyats (76 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the irrigated area of the country has
been increased by an unprecedented 603,450 hectares in a short
period of 11 years, adding that 23 more dams and embankments are
still under construction.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom to Provide Long-distance Alternative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China unicom is expected to
begin offering its long-awaited long-distance phone service both
domestically and internationally later this year, Business Weekly
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of this year, we will provide long-distance phone
services in the country's more than 20 cities, both domestically
and internationally," Tan Xinghui, general manager of planning and
marketing with China Unicom, said.
</P>
<P>
The business expansion, if implemented as envisioned, will
eventually make China Unicom a major force in the telecom services
sector.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is expected to benefit from the split up of the
China Telecom monopoly into three independent operations including
mobile phones, fixed phones and satellite services later this year.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom currently operates paging, mobile phone, Internet
access, IP (Internet Protocol) phone and limited local fixed-phone
services.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customers will have to remember two sets of regional
codes with the new service. They have become used to dialing only
one phone code during past decades.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is authorized to conduct local fixed-phone
business in Tianjin, Chongqing and Sichuan only.
</P>
<P>
"We will mainly rely on China Telecom's fixed-phone network to
provide long-distance services," said Tan.
</P>
<P>
Since China Telecom, which controls the fundamental fixed-phone
network, is reluctant to co-operate with China Unicom, the company
has faced great difficulties in developing inter-connections
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Tan said China Unicom plans to lease part of mobile capacity
from China Mobile Communication Corp, the most profitable arm
separating from China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
"We are in negotiation and it will benefit the two sides since
some of China Mobile's network capacity is idle," said Tan.
</P>
<P>
The company's Internet business will also begin later this year.
</P>
<P>
Tan said a key plan involves co-operating with Internet service
and content providers.

BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China's machinery industry is
expected to have a 10-percent annual growth in the upcoming three
years, "Business Weekly" reports today.
</P>
<P>
During the initial stage of the 10th Five-Year Plan period (
2001-2005), China will need about 80 billion yuan on machinery for
large-scale construction of communications and water conservancy
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The industry will experience a growth of 30 percent by the end
of this year. In the first half of this year, sales in the
industry increased by 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
But insiders predict the momentum will taper off as from 2003
when the Chinese government curtails its massive investment in
infrastructure construction.
</P>
<P>
Han Xuesong, vice-chairman of the China National Construction
Machinery Association, said the industry will channel 350 million
yuan into technical upgrading in an effort to solve the problem of
poor product performance.

<HEADLINE> Car Makers Prepare for WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"We have visited some large auto manufacturing giants around
the world and will select new partners from among them," he said.
</P>
<P>
If FAW wants to survive fierce international competition, it
will have to participate in a globalized automobile industry, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
FAW, one of the "Big Three" carmakers in China, has set a goal
of creating affordable cars to expand its market share and to
increase its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiaowu, vice-director of the State Machine-Building
Industry Bureau said, "We have no say in determining when China
will enter the WTO, but we must give up the illusion of protecting
the automotive industry from being dented by foreign competition.
We must try our best to catch up with the advanced international
levels in terms of development capabilities within the grace
period granted by the WTO to the infant sector.
</P>
<P>
"We must have brands of our own based on scales of economy and
innovative research and development."
</P>
<P>
Establishment of large corporate groups through mergers and
acquisitions is the "most important and imperative" step for China
to take to enhance its competitiveness in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
If China could win a 60 percent share in the economy car market
with engine sizes ranging from 1 liter to 1.3 liters prior to its
formal accession to the WTO, China's automotive industry would be
able to sustain its future development, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
On another front, the auto component sector is also facing
formidable challenges. In 1998, sales reported by 709 auto parts
manufacturers surveyed were 34.04 billion yuan. Their combined
profits were reported to be 3.155 billion yuan, according to the
China Automotive Industry Association (CAIA). Their spending on
research and development was 522 million yuan, accounting for only
0.8 percent of their total sales.
</P>
<P>
"Scales of economy are also needed in the auto component
industry to facilitate standardization and reduce costs," said an
official with the CAIA.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Rebels Use Guided Missiles: Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Tests conducted by British
ballistic experts have confirmed that Sri Lanka's separatist Tamil
rebels have used guided missiles to attack government forces last
month, the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The experts have identified the Anti Tank Guided Missile (ATGM)
fired at army defenses in northern Sri Lanka by Tamil rebels as an
AT4 Fagot, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It has been established from parts of the suspected missile
sent by the army for tests in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The suspected missile destroyed an army track armored personnel
carrier in the northern town of Paranthan on September 24.
</P>
<P>
The British authorities have sent a preliminary report to Army
headquarters confirming the exact identity of the ATGM, the paper
said, adding that a further report is expected shortly to give
more details including the country of manufacture and other
specifications.
</P>
<P>
The confirmation showed that the rebels of Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had gone for more expensive and sophisticated
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Officials said the Navy had stepped up patrols in northeastern
waters over reports that LTTE rebels may have arranged fresh
supplies of weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been known to receive military hardware from
larger ships and to offload the cargo at sea to smaller craft and
ferry them back to its major base in Mullaitivu, 280 kilometers
northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a drawn out war for independence in
the island's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Iran Renews Call for Practical U.S. Action on Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday renewed its
call for "meaningful" behavior and "practical" action from the
U.S. following its recent goodwill gesture on relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
If Washington really meant to improve on past behavior with
Tehran, it had to show its goodwill by "meaningful" behavior and
"practical" action, spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry
Hamid Reza Asefi said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi's words came after U.S Assistant Secretary of State for
the Near East Martin Indyk Thursday called for unconditional
dialog between the two bitter enemies to improve their ties
severed soon after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. behavior in Iran over the past few decades, and even
up to the present day, has been such that it has only consistently
built up on the wall of distrust between the two countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the U.S. can compensate for its past
and present behavior only by taking practical, perceptible and
meaningful steps, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said at the Asia Society Thursday that it is the time for
Iran and the U.S. to engage each other as two great nations on the
basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
However, he made clear that Washington can improve its ties
with Tehran only after Iran fully ended its support for
terrorism, its opposition to the Middle East peace process and
gave up its programs on weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman criticized the U.S. for failing to make a
political and national decision to change their behavior with
Iran "due to internal problems, and the strong lobby of pressure
groups within the structure of the government in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
"If they really are, they would do well to review the records
of unhealthy relations between the two countries and do something
by way of correcting it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that Iran's logical expectation is not a
precondition (for dialog), "but it is simply a factual statement
that asserts the fact of the impossibility of cherishing hopes for
a bright future on equal terms without taking fundamental steps
for improving relations.
</P>
<P>
"On the one hand Mr. Indyk refers to equality and mutual
respect in his address, and on the other hand in the same address
Mr. Indyk levels unfounded charges against Iran's peaceful
activities in the area of chemicals and nuclear weapons and in
connection with (the U.S.) outlooks on Iran's role in the Middle
East affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.S. charges against Iran are "vain and
surprising" since Iran is signatory to many international
conventions on disarmament, and has been cooperating with the
relevant international institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Those unfounded charges against Iran are leveled with the
idea of bigger arms sales to the countries of the region, and also
for the purpose of diverting public attention away from the
weapons of mass destruction in the possession of the Zionist
(Israeli) regime," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Iran's policy of defusing tension, Asefi said that
certain quarters in the U.S. are unhappy with the Iranian policy,
and they intend to torpedo Iran's progress in that area by
uttering vain statements.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the U.S. have taken some hard steps by exchanging
goodwill gestures for dialog since the moderate Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami came to power in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
Washington and Tehran broke off their diplomatic relations in
1980 after Iranian revolutionary students took over the
U.S. embassy in Tehran and held its staff members as hostages.

<HEADLINE> Relatives of Malvinas Casualties Go to Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A plane with 20 relatives
of Argentine soldiers killed during the 1982 Malvinas war flew for
the first time from Argentina to the islands Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Lan Chile airliner, which took off from Santiago, made a
stop in Rio Gallegos, capital of Santa Cruz province, in the south
of Argentina, from where it took off to Puerto Argentino, the
Malvinas capital.
</P>
<P>
There are mothers, children and brothers and sisters of
soldiers killed during the Malvinas war, as well as a priest.
</P>
<P>
Rio Gallegos mayor Anselmo Martinez called the travelers "honor
guests" and bid them farewell at the local airport.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 Argentine soldiers died in the war against Britain for
the possession of the islands in 1982. The British call the
islands Falkland instead of Malvinas.
</P>
<P>
The Lan Chile flight to the Malvinas is the first to make a
stop in Argentine territory, since a previous one with a first
group of Argentine passengers traveled on August 7 from Santiago,
Chile, to the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Martinez handed the travelers a plate to be placed at the
Darwin Cemetery, where 236 Argentine soldiers are buried.
</P>
<P>
The relatives of the fallen soldiers will remain one week in
the islands, where they will have contact with the local
residents.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain on July 14 signed an agreement for the
resumption of trips from Argentine territory to the Malvinas and
the reestablishment of communications between the South American
country and the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean airline resumed on August 7 the flights to the
Malvinas after the Chilean government suspended them on April 1 as
a protest against the detention of former military ruler Augusto
Pinochet in London.

<HEADLINE> French, German Nuclear Power Companies Negotiate Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- France's nuclear boiler maker
Framatome and the German Siemens company are negotiating a merger,
although a definite agreement is yet to be made, said Framatome
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Framatome said that the aim of such a merger is to strengthen
the European nuclear industries in the world market.
</P>
<P>
The French daily Liberation said that the two companies "should
present on October 21" to the central enterprise committee of
Framatome a project on setting up a joint venture of nuclear power
production.
</P>
<P>
Framatome said that it has informed its personnel of the
"hypothesis" of a merger with Siemens, and it will call a meeting
of the management next week to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
"There have been talks with Siemens since the end of July and
we hope that they will succeed. But we are not in a phase to sign
or consult our personnel on a document already achieved. We are in
a phase of information on the hypothesis," Agence France-Presse
quoted a spokesman of Framatome as saying.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed the signing of an agreement of merger
by French and German aerospace and defense groups,
Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Liberation, which has obtained a copy of the
merger project, Framatome will hold 66 percent of the shares of
the future merged group, while Siemens will hold 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Several other French companies, including Alcatel
telecommunications company which holds 44 percent of the shares of
Framatome and the COGRMA nuclear processing company which is
buying shares from Alcatel, besides the French government, will
also play crucial roles in the restructuring of nuclear industry.

<HEADLINE> France Stresses Industrial Battle Between Europe, Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy,
Finance and Industry Dominique Strauss-Kahn said Saturday that the
industrial battle should not go on among European countries, but
between Europe as a single bloc and others.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Sunday newspaper Journal du
Dimanche, Strauss-Kahn said that the merger between the French and
German aerospace and defense groups, Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA,
is made on the basis of equality between France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
"The French side and the German side both will hold the same
amount of capital of European Aeronautic, Defense and Space Co.,
which is 30 percent, and the same power," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the merger will accelerate the production of a
future super jumbo jet, A3XXX Airbus passenger plane with 500
seats.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when euro is launched, we should restructure our
forces and create great European champions capable of embracing
the biggest international challenges," he said.
</P>
<P>
The merger between Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA, both of which
hold 37.9 percent of the shares of the Airbus Industrie
consortium, will pave the way for the establishment of an
independent Airbus group, the world's second largest in the civil
aviation industry after the U.S. Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The British Aerospace also holds 20 percent of the shares of
Airbus Industrie, and the Spanish CASA 4.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese NPC Delegation Hold Talks With U.S. Legislators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The delegation of the
Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) recently held four rounds
of discussions here with U.S. congressmen on Sino-U.S. relations,
trade, regional security and other issues of common concern, a
delegation spokesman said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The NPC delegation, which concluded a five-day visit to
Washington and left for New York Saturday, held talks with Donald
Manzullo, chairman of the U.S.-China Inter-parliamentary Exchange
Group of the U.S. House, Doug Bereuter, vice chairman of the
group, and many other congressmen including Tom Lantos and Thomas
Ewing.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were held in a friendly, frank and serious
atmosphere," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides remain different on some issues, they
agreed to expand cooperation and eliminate differences to promote
the steady and sound development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side reiterated China's principled position on
Taiwan, while the U.S. side said it would remain committed to the
"One China" policy, the three communiques governing Sino-U.S.
relations and the promise of "Three Nos" on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed the hope to strengthen cooperation and
communications between the parliaments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The NPC delegation's visit to the United States has enhanced
mutual understanding, expanded common ground and increased
friendship between the legislative bodies of China and the U.S.,
thus establishing a good basis for future communications, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by Zeng Jianhui, member of the Standing
Committee and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
NPC, arrived here on October 11.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the U.S. Congress has invited a
Chinese NPC delegation to visit the country.

<HEADLINE> Leeds Equal Club Record to Stay Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Leeds United equalled a 68-year
club record and struggled to stay on top spot in the English
premier league on Saturday with a 2-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday
at Elland Road.
</P>
<P>
Two late goals from 18-year-old Alan Smith ensured Leeds
grabbed their ninth successive victory, equalling the all time
record set in 1931.
</P>
<P>
The win keeps them above Manchester United who remain second, a
point behind, after thumping Watford 4-1 at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal got the better of Everton at Highbury, winning 4-1
thanks to two goals from Croatian striker Davor Suker while
Liverpool beat high-flying Chelsea 1-0 with a David Thompson
second-half strike.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea finished a bad-tempered game with nine men after Marcel
Desailly and Dennis Wise were sent off.
</P>
<P>
Struggling Newcastle lost away from home for the sixth time
this season when they were beaten 4-1 by Coventry. Bobby Robson's
men stay second-from-bottom in the league.

<HEADLINE> New Battle on for Everton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- An American finance house have
had a bid accepted to buy out Peter Johnson's 68% controlling
interest in Everton football club, according to local reports on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
And on Monday accountants representing Manhattan-based EM
Warburg Pincus and Co can begin checking the books of the Goodison
Park club with a view to the deal being completed.
</P>
<P>
But it is believed that vice-chairman Bill Kenwright, who has
been struggling for almost a year to win control of the club
himself, will now have to join forces with another North West
consortium of businessmen to fight the American offer.
</P>
<P>
The Warburg Pincus bid, believed to have been brokered by
computer games entrepreneur and Everton fan Paul Finnegan, has
been presented to Johnson's Leeds-based brokers Arthur Anderson,
and accepted by the now Jersey-based major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
A source said: "This is obviously subject to contract and due
diligence."
</P>
<P>
In layman's terms, that means time for accountants to check the
club's books, and that starts officially next week.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday the club hold their annual general meeting, where
Kenwright could even be voted off the board by Johnson's majority
control, and the scene is set for a battle royal between the
American bidders and the theatre impressario.
</P>
<P>
An offer of around 30 million pounds has actually be rejected
by Johnson from a group of high-powered North West businessmen -
not connected to Kenwright - who has still to formally put his own
offer on the table.
</P>
<P>
Now shareholders expect Kenwright to hit back by agreeing to
join forces with the businessmen's group to outbid Warburg Pincus.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Nolan, spokesman for the club's shareholders association,
confirmed that his organisation know about the American bid and
accept that it is genuine, but he said: "I will believe it has
happened only when the cheque has cleared the bank."

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne Gave Warning to England Young Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Paul Gascoigne has warned
England's emerging stars not to sabotage their careers by
following in his footsteps off the field.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough star Gascoigne had a brief spell in hospital last
year to deal with drink, depression and stress related problems.
</P>
<P>
And he urged the new batch of international talent to "stay out
of trouble or get hammered".
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, currently banned after being sent off against
Chelsea last month, said: "I'll hold my hands up and say I have
made mistakes. I'll be the first to admit it. I've always told (
England's young players) them, don't do the things I've done
because you will get hammered and it does affect your game.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully if they do look at the mistakes I've made - and
there have been a lot - they'll keep out of the trouble I've put
myself into," Gascoigne told BBC's 'Football Focus.'
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne believes England boss Kevin Keegan has a talented
pool of players at his disposal and singled out David Beckham for
his methods of coping with the limelight.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne added: "Beckham got a lot of stick from when he got
sent off in the World Cup. He's a young lad and he's had a lot to
cope with. His performances at the end of last season were
fantastic and he'll do well for England as well."
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne, who still harbours hopes of an England recall after
his controversial axeing from Glenn Hoddle's 1998 World Cup squad,
insists he has now got over his personal problems.
</P>
<P>
he added:"I've had my bad moments but hopefully after this now
I can get back playing and everything will be OK. In myself I'm
quite happy."

<HEADLINE> Basler Suspended for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Bayern Munich midfielder Mario
Basler has been suspended for the rest of the German season, the
club said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Club president Franz Beckenbauer said, "It's because of
repeated violations of a player's obligations."
</P>
<P>
Basler was fined 20,000 marks (11,110 U.S. dollars) in August
for spending the night before a league match in a disco. He has
also been involved in a salary row with the team.
</P>
<P>
In February Basler, 30, got into a scuffle with a restaurant
guest, who he said tried to touch his wife, and a year ago he was
fined for spending too much time at the Oktoberfest beer festival.
</P>
<P>
Basler, has been out with a knee injury since September and his
contract runs out at the end of the season, making his future
unclear.

ordered Saturday the evacuation of the 12,000 residents from the
city of Banos because of the danger of an eruption of the
Tungurahua volcano.
</P>
<P>
National Polytechnic School Geophysics Institute (IGEPN)
technicians said that the Tungurahua permanent seismic activity
show that the volcano has entered an eruptive stage.
</P>
<P>
Ashes spewed from the volcano have blocked the road between
Banos, in the Tungurahua province, and Riobamba, the capital of
the neighboring province of Chimborazo.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should remain here, because in case of an eruption the
risk is really fatal," Mahuad told the press in Banos close to the
volcano slopes.
</P>
<P>
The president took part earlier Saturday in an air inspection
of the volcano crater, which is 5,000 meters above the sea level
and is 140 kilometers south of Quito.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said that a Tungurahua eruption would throw ashes and
rocks that would destroy roads and dam rivers, which could put the
local population in a dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
Civil Defense authorities and the Crisis Committee declared an
"orange alert" for Banos.
</P>
<P>
Mahuad said that many of the Banos residents and those of
nearby towns have abandoned the zone.
</P>
<P>
An Austrian tourist and an Ecuadorian guide were injured 10
days ago by a volcano explosion when they were climbing it,
according to local media reports. The Tungurahua is one of the
tourism attraction in the center of Ecuador.

<HEADLINE> Gansu to Establish Modern Enterprise System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 17 (Xinhua)-- An overall reform to establish a
modern enterprise system is about to take effect in Gansu Province
in northwest China, according to the local government.
</P>
<P>
It has stipulated that 75.6 percent of Gansu's medium-sized and
large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) will set up a standardized
modern enterprise system, while the rest will carry out various
reforms for the purpose by the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The reform will be mainly enforced in industries of commerce,
grain production, petroleum, tobacco, tourism and foreign trade,
and about ten backbone merged enterprises are expected to be
established before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
There are 131 medium-sized and large SOEs in Gansu now, among
them 39 have established a preliminary modern system.
</P>
<P>
For decades, China's SOEs have been huge in number but weak in
strength. They have become one of the major factors hampering the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
A major, pressing task for the Chinese government at present is
to actively push ahead with reform of state enterprises so that
they will extricate themselves out of difficulties at an early
date.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Expects Good Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Jilin Province, a major grain
producer in northeast China, expects a grain output of about 23
billion kilograms this year.
</P>
<P>
The rice output will hit a record high to reach more than four
billion kilograms, up from 3.85 billion kilograms last year, the
provincial agricultural department has said.
</P>
<P>
Due to a decline in market demand, the province's corn-growing
acreage dropped 138,600 hectares from last year's, and the corn
output will also drop by 2.25 billion kilograms to reach an
estimated 16.25 billion kilograms this year, according to the
source.
</P>
<P>
The grain harvest in Jilin has been achieved under adverse
weather conditions, including low temperatures and heavy spring
rains during planting season and drought in the summer.
</P>
<P>
Jilin has 2.1 million hectares of arable land. Corn is its
major crop.
</P>
<P>
The province's grain output reached 25 billion kilograms in
1998, an all-time high, statistics show.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Says Goodbye to Minibus Taxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's yellow minibus taxis,
guaranteed to give a low-cost, bumpy ride and blamed for defiling
the capital city's image, made their final exits this month after
11 years on the city streets.
</P>
<P>
The minibus taxi, or "miandi" in Chinese, appeared here in 1988
and instantly helped ease traffic congestion as commuters clumped
together for rides.
</P>
<P>
By 1993, there were 350,000 of the vehicles in Beijing, sources
from the local taxi administration said. Miandi accounted for 51
percent of the city's taxis, daily forming a choppy yellow sea as
they chugged down the roads.
</P>
<P>
Despite its advantages, the minibus was proved to be relatively
unsafe and emitted high levels of exhaust. Choosy travelers were
turned off by its lack of air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
Before China's 50th anniversary celebration on October 1,
Beijing authorities replaced all the minibus taxis with new cars
to lessen air pollution in the city.

<P>
HARBIN, October 17 (Xinhua) -- Twelve ostriches, which are
generally a tropical breed, have grown accustomed to the life in
Dahiggan Mountains of China's coldest province, Heilongjiang, and
several have given birth.
</P>
<P>
Bought three months ago by an ostrich breeding farm in
Heilongjiang, the ostriches have grown from half a meter to two
meters tall. Seven have laid a total of more than 50 eggs.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yaohui, an official with the breeding farm, said that
ostriches are usually raised outdoors, coming inside only in
winter. The temperature of their current living area, which has no
heating equipment, is minus 20 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that ostrich breeding has been rewarded in the market:
The price of a young ostrich has reached 10,000 yuan and an egg is
worth 200 to 300 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The largest bird in the world, the ostrich usually lives in
tropical zones. Its meat is edible and the feathers can be used as
decorative objects.

<HEADLINE> China's Defence Sector Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- China's defence sector and
nuclear facilities will be Y2K compliant at the turn of the
century, "Business Weekly" reports today.
</P>
<P>
"We can ensure all facilities in the country's defence sector
will be safe and reliable on January 1, 2000," the paper cited a
report of the State Commission of Science, Technology and Industry
for National Defence.
</P>
<P>
The national defence commission supervises 10 group
corporations focusing on key industries, weapons, nuclear power,
space, aviation and shipbuilding.
</P>
<P>
The commission set up a special office to deal with Y2K
problems in December last year. It has also sent 12 specialist
panels to carry out spot checks of sensitive equipment and
production lines since late August.
</P>
<P>
The report said the existing weapon systems are basically
immune from the affects of Y2K computer problems. "There will be
no nuclear leaks or explosions caused by Y2K problems in our two
operational nuclear power stations."
</P>
<P>
With less than three months left, the commission urged related
sectors to strengthen their efforts in risk evaluation and
contingency preparations.

<HEADLINE> Sino-ROK Trade Imbalance a Cause for Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 17 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea should
make an effort to reduce its growing trade surplus with China, "
China Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
"China has remained in a deficit in its trading with ROK since
the two established diplomatic relations in 1992 and the deficit
volume has expanded in recent years," the paper quoted Xu Changwen,
director of the Asian and African Affairs Department of the
Chinese Academy of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the General Administration of Customs indicate
China's trade deficit with ROK increased from 200 million U.S.
dollars in 1992 to 8.72 billion U.S. dollars in 1998. From 1992 to
May this year, the cumulative deficit volume has added up to 32.2
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xu attributed the growing trade gap to the depreciation of the
Korean currency, which has sharpened the competitive edge of
Korean exports and the dumping of some South Korean goods onto the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
"Although we are not pursuing a continual trade balance with
every trading partner, a lingering and growing trade deficit will
surely influence the further development of our bilateral trade,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu urged ROK to increase its imports from China to improve the
trade balance.

<HEADLINE> SFOR Intensifies Presence in Southern Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peacekeeping
forces in Bosnia intensified military presence in southern Bosnia
since Friday night, aimed at cracking down protests from local
Bosnian Croats against a recent move of the forces.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that from Friday night the Stabilization
Force (SFOR) increased troops in Mostar city, 70 kilometers south
of Sarajevo, and deployed armored cars at major intersections
there.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian news agency said SFOR soldiers on Thursday raided
four office buildings in the Croat-controlled part of Mostar,
forced personnel out to corridors or into garages at gun-point,
searched the offices and took away important documents, archives
and technical equipment.
</P>
<P>
During the raids women were taken to bathrooms and strip-
searched and two Bosnain Croat security men were injured, one
seriously, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
The move, which NATO claimed was aimed at seizing illegal
weapons and to "weed out those elements engaged in illegal or
noncompliant activity," triggered protests from the local Bosnian
Croats.
</P>
<P>
They threw stones and eggs at the Spanish and French
peacekeepers on Thursday and blocked several highways and
crossings in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
SFOR commander Montgomery Meigs has relieved Major General
Zlatan Jelic, head of the Croatian garrison forces, of the post.
</P>
<P>
He said that the intensified military presence in the region
was to stop "activities being conducted in direct violation of the
Dayton Peace Accords," which was signed in 1995 following the 1992-
1995 Bosnian war.
