Authority says okay to call English team ``pitiful Poms''

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ A New Zealand broadcaster has
been exonerated for calling England's rugby players ``pitiful
Poms'' after their disastrous southern hemisphere tour earlier this
year.
	   England's understrength squad lost 76-0 to Australia, before
crashing 64-22 and 40-10 against a New Zealand team which
subsequently slid to its worst losing sequence in history.
	   While the English put up little fight on the playing field,
television viewer A.F. Judge showed some when he complained to the
Broadcasting Standards Authority.
	   Judge complained that the ``pitiful Pom'' remark, in a One
Network News report on July 5, was racist and derogatory and likely
to encourage discrimination against British people. He said the
presenter should be dismissed.
	   TVNZ responded that the word ``pitiful'' was an accurate
description of the performance of an international rugby side that
had lost seven games in a row.
	   It said the word ``Pom'' was used in a good natured or
affectionate way.
	   The word ``Pom'' derived from convicts sent to Australia in the
19th century; its derivation is not clear, though one explanation
is that it was short for ``prisoner of his majesty.''
	   The broadcasting authority said the remark did not breach
television standards about discrimination and the words did not
represent British people as inherently inferior.
	   ``It was an ad lib colloquialism specifically directed at the
reportedly dismal efforts of the touring rugby team,'' the
authority said in a statement.
	   Judge moved to New Zealand in 1974 and reported to the authority
that his son had been victimized at school and was called a
``Pommie bastard'' by classmates. Judge said that when a New
Zealand rugby winger came to his son's school after a tour of
England he told the class that ``all Poms are dirty.''

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's 12 million voters will
choose between a conservative incumbent proposing radical tax
reform and a Labor opposition promising more spending on social
programs and thousands of new jobs when they go to the polls
Saturday.
	   Dubbed the Millennium Poll, the election will usher in the
government that will oversee the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and the
100th anniversary of Australia's federation in 2001.
	   If Labor wins, it will be the first time since the Great
Depression in the 1930s that Australians have voted out a
government after just one term.
	   More likely, however, is a narrow win for Prime Minister John
Howard's conservative Liberal-National party coalition, leaving him
with a vastly reduced majority in the lower house of Australia's
bicameral Parliament.
	   Throughout a five-week campaign dominated by dry discussions of
taxes and the economy, opinion polls have shown the two main
opponents are neck-and-neck amid high levels of voter apathy and
distrust.
	   Latest polling Thursday showed the conservatives pulling ahead
slightly.
	   But the wild card is the right-wing party One Nation, which
exploded onto the political scene 18 months ago with anti-Asian,
anti-Aboriginal and populist protectionist appeal.
	   While support for One Nation has halved in recent months and its
mercurial leader Pauline Hanson may lose her seat, the party may
end up with the swing vote in a divided Parliament.
	   Howard has called for sweeping changes to the tax system,
including a new goods and services tax that will be partially
offset by cuts in income taxes.
	   Labor has promised to create 500,000 jobs in its first
three-year term, and party leader Kim Beazley has also called for
smaller income tax cuts targeted at low-income earners.
	   But Beazley has been weighed down by the memory of 13 years of
Labor government, which voters threw out in a landslide just 2 1/2
years ago, and has sought to recast the party in the style of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's New Labor.
	   ``We have listened to these voices and we have learned,''
Beazley said at the official Labor campaign launch.
	   By making tax reform the centerpiece of his campaign, Howard has
sought to sideline issues unpopular for the government, such as
criticism that he failed to react quickly enough to stem the rise
of Hanson.
	   ``In this election campaign, if you really believe in calling it
for Australia ... you have to embrace the cause of taxation
reform,'' Howard said.
	   Coverage of Hanson, who claims Australia is in danger of being
``swamped'' by Asians, calls Australia's Aborigines over-privileged
and advocates economic protectionism, has hurt Australia's
reputation overseas.
	   Even if Howard retains control of the more powerful lower house,
polling indicates the balance of power in the upper house will
again lie with minor parties or independents, meaning the
government may have to negotiate to get its bills passed into law.

Asian markets shudder after tumble on Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asian stock markets shuddered in early trading
Thursday after Wall Street sank beneath the 8,000 level overnight,
triggering declines in regional bourses from Sydney to Seoul.
	   Investors sent share prices in Tokyo spiraling to new 12-year
lows over concern about the sell-off in New York _ and the
sputtering Japanese economy.
	   Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
fell 123.91 points, or 0.92 percent, to 13,282.48 as of midday. On
Wednesday, the index had plunged 415.04 points to 13,406.39, the
lowest close since February 1986.
	   Markets in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and most
Southeast Asian nations also dipped after the Dow Jones industrial
average tumbled 237.90 points, or 3 percent, on Wednesday to
7,842.62.
	   ``The Dow off 237 points certainly put a negative tone to the
start of the market,'' BT Alex Brown's Grant Taylor said of the
decline in New Zealand _ the earliest Pacific market to trade after
Wall Street's close.
	   U.S. stocks dropped across-the-board as investors registered
fears an incremental interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve
would not be sufficient stimulus to buoy fourth-quarter corporate
earnings.
	   On Tuesday, the central bank had lowered its federal funds rate
target, which member banks charge each other for overnight loans,
by 0.25 percentage point to 5.25 percent.
	   The sour reception to the Fed's action came amid a flurry of
profit warnings from companies such as Gillette Co., RJR Nabisco
Holdings and Unocal. All three firms informed investors Tuesday
that third-quarter earnings growth would likely come in lower than
expected.
	   A possible slow down in U.S. growth could trim badly-needed
sales by Asian companies in the crucial American market, something
which has made investors in regional markets increasingly wary of
keeping funds wrapped up in already bearish bourses, traders said.
	   Hong Kong markets were closed Thursday for the Chinese National
Day holiday, but Singapore's Straits Times Index was down 8.42
points to 931.23 as of mid-morning as a result of the slump in U.S.
and Japanese markets.
	   ``The index has been depressed in the last few days, and we
expect it to go even more down in response to Wall Street,'' said
Jacqueline Ong of IDEA.
	   In Australia, the Sydney's key All Ordinaries Index of share
prices was off 21.6 points to 2565.4 in early trading, down from
Wednesday's close at 2587.0. Neighboring New Zealand's NZSE-40
capital index lost 2 percent in morning trading, giving up 39.49
points to 1688.45.
	   Meanwhile, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index opened down
2.82 points to 307.50. In Taipei, the benchmark Weighted Price
Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange fell 59.09 points, or 0.9
percent, to 6774.86.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index sank 21.35 points,
or 1.7 percent, to 1238.29. In Indonesia, Jakarta's JSX Composite
Index declined 1.958 points, or 0.7 percent, to 274.192 points in
early trading. The Stock Exchange of Thailand index retreated 3.26
points to 250.56 in the first half hour of trading.

Floods claim three lives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Floods have killed three people and caused
2.5 billion dong (dlrs 174,000) in damage in one of Vietnam's
poorest provinces, the provincial Flood and Storm Control Committee
said Thursday.
	   Parts of Quang Tri province, in the nation's midsection, have
been swamped by nearly continuous downpours that have dumped 918
millimeters (three feet) of rain on the area over the past two
weeks.
	   Monday's rainfall alone was measured at 325 millimeters (12.8
inches).
	   The flooding has damaged irrigation projects, roads and some
houses, the committee said.
	   Until mid-August, the province had been suffering from its worst
drought in more than half a century, along with outbreaks of dengue
fever and malaria.

Banned magazine gets permit after changing name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ After being banned in May for using provocative
images, the Singapore version of a British men's magazine will be
returning to newsstands under a different name, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Singapore FHM, formerly known as For Him Magazine, received
approval from the Ministry of Information and the Arts as a new
publication after the publisher, Emap Singapore, gave assurances
that it will keep to Singapore's strict guidelines about the use of
sex in local publications, the Straits Times said.
	   Launched in January 1998 with an average circulation of 30,000
per issue, For Him Magazine targeted an audience of men aged 19 to
35 with stories on sports, career and fashion and photos of
scantily clad women.
	   But last May the government banned the magazine, saying that it
carried illustrations associated with risque lingerie or soft porn
publications and had failed to change its style after warnings from
the ministry. An appeal from the publisher was turned down.
	   The new monthly will hit the streets on Oct. 16.

Newspaper: Britain planned possible attack on Soviets after German
</HEADLINE>
surrender &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Within days of Germany's World War II defeat,
Winston Churchill ordered the drafting of contingency plans for an
Anglo-American invasion of the Soviet Union that would lead to the
``elimination of Russia,'' according to a report Thursday in the
Daily Telegraph.
	   Citing documents recently discovered in Britain's public
archives, the newspaper said the plan, codenamed ``Operation
Unthinkable,'' was eventually rejected by Churchill and replaced
with a defensive proposition to guard against invasion by Josef
Stalin's Red Army.
	   Historians had long believed that the tense period immediately
after the war led to plans of this sort, but had never been able to
prove it until the forgotten documents were found, the Telegraph
said.
	   ``Nobody has ever seen this kind of thing before,'' the
newspaper quoted war historian D. C. Watt as saying. ``But we have
had strong suspicions that they must have been written. I had
always assumed that the records of this had been lost.''
	   Churchill described the plan as ``a purely hypothetical
contingency,'' but regarded it as necessary enough to have his
planning staff working on it amid the euphoria of victory, the
Telegraph reported.
	   ``The fact that the plan was made is significant, but it was to
guard against an unlikely event,'' Watt was quoted as saying.
	   The battle plan, presented as a report to Churchill on May 22,
1945 _ 14 days after the end of the war _ included the use of up to
100,000 German troops to back up 500,000 British and American
soldiers attacking through northern Germany, the newspaper
reported.
	   It predicted that Stalin would invade Turkey, Greece, Norway and
the oil fields of Iraq and Iran in retaliation and launch extensive
sabotage operations in France, the Netherlands and Belgium.
	   The report assumed that the World War III would start on July 1,
1945, the Telegraph said, probably with a surprise attack by 47
British and American divisions.
	   The report ruled out total war against the Red Army, which
outnumbered the Allies by more than two to one, and added that
there was no reason why an Anglo-American invasion of the Soviet
Union would fare any better than Hitler's attempt in 1941.
	   John Ericson, an expert on the Soviet Union at Edinburgh
University, described the documents as ``very important and very
illuminating,'' the Telegraph said.
	   ``On June 29, 1945, the Red Army suddenly executed a complete
redeployment of its order of battle, for no apparent reason,'' the
newspaper quoted Ericson as saying. ``I have always wondered why
they did it. Perhaps we have just discovered the explanation.''

Kurosawa posthumously receives government award

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, Japan's legendary film director,
posthumously received a prestigious award from the Japanese
government Thursday to honor his achievement, officials said.
	   The People's Honor Award was presented by the Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi to Kurosawa's eldest son, Hisao, at Obuchi's official
residence, a government spokesman said.
	   The award is given to people in Japan who contribute to the
arts, entertainment or sports. Only 14 people have ever received
the award since it was established 21 years ago.
	   Kurosawa becomes the first film director to receive the award.
	   Kurosawa, who made ``Rashomon'' and the ``Seven Samurai,'' died
Sept. 6 at the age of 88.

India's government targets Western songs on drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's information ministry is
considering tuning out Western pop songs about drugs from state-run
stations, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Pioneer newspaper said the ministry took up the issue after
a Bombay group, Citizen's Organization for Public Opinion,
complained about the Eric Clapton song ``Cocaine'' being aired on
state-owned All India Radio.
	   The government ``will not remain a silent spectator any more and
will take a serious view of songs which have (the) potential to
misguide young, impressionable minds,'' The Pioneer quoted junior
information minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi as saying.
	   ``The government is not talking about censoring Western songs
here. But surely, airing such songs on the public broadcaster is a
matter of public concern,'' Naqvi was quoted as saying.
	   The ministry has not yet decided exactly what it plans to do,
but intends to take some action regarding the songs, Naqvi said.
	   Since her Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party took power as
head of a coalition in March, senior information minister Sushma
Swaraj has tried to persuade private broadcasters not to run
cigarette and liquor advertisements. State-run TV and radio does
not carry such advertisements, but the government cannot officially
ban private stations from running them.
	   Swaraj also ordered that condom advertisements be aired late at
night rather than during prime time, and cut connections to
foreign-based phone sex lines.
	   The ministry last month asked MTV to take the Indian flag off a
special logo the channel designed for the country's 50th year of
independence celebrations, saying the channel was misusing the flag
for commercial purposes.

Philippine Airlines workers vote to determine airline's future
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers voted
Thursday on whether to give up their right to strike for 10 years
as part of a management recovery plan that would allow Asia's
oldest carrier to reopen.
	   It was the second time in 11 days that the 6,700 members of
PAL's largest union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they
rejected the proposal, forcing Asia's oldest carrier to shut down
and leaving much of the country without air service.
	   Results of the referendum were expected to be known later
Thursday.
	   Many union members had thought the government would not allow
the 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes on Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Under the plan, workers would suspend their collective
bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent
share of the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights and expose them to management abuses.
	   Union president Alex Barrientos said Thursday he has not visited
the union office for several days after some militant workers
threatened to shoot him.
	   ``If they want an explanation of why we agreed to the plan, they
can always call me,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of workers marched to the presidential palace on
Tuesday to protest the plan and urge the government to take over
the airline instead.
	   President Joseph Estrada says the government cannot do that
because it does not have the money to underwrite daily losses of up
to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Estrada, who helped broker the agreement with union leaders,
also urged the workers to ratify the plan.
	   ``I have assured the labor union that as president I will always
protect them, I will not abandon them,'' he said.
	   PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan has been meeting in
Europe with foreign creditors to ask them not to repossess the
airline's planes ahead of its possible reopening.
	   PAL has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency crisis. It
says creditors have insisted on a suspension of the union's
bargaining agreement to ensure labor harmony before they accept a
restructuring of the company's finances.
	   Asia's currency crisis hit shortly after PAL launched a dlrs 4
billion modernization program, greatly inflating the amount of
money it must repay to overseas creditors. The airline has been
unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of debt.
	   Two foreign carriers, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific and Dragon
Airlines, have begun flying some domestic routes to help fill the
vacuum left by PAL's closure.

Thailand's UCOM sells stake in Romanian telecom company
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ United Communication Industry,
Thailand's second-largest mobile phone operator, said Thursday it
has sold most of its stake in Logic Telecom of Romania at a profit
of 846.9 million baht (dlrs 21.5 million).
	   UCOM said in a filing to the Stock Exchange of Thailand that it
sold 15.2 million shares, or a 79 percent stake, in Logic Telecom
for 1.79 billion baht (dlrs 45.5 million) to Telecommunication
Business Service Ltd. of Romania.
	   UCOM is now left with 3.5 million shares in Logic Telecom, about
19 percent of ownership.
	   Logic Telecom is a mobile-phone operator and provider of
satellite and Internet service in Romania. UCOM's investment in
Logic Telecom accounted for 15.7 percent of the Thai company's
total assets prior to the sale.
	   Nopadol Thongprasert, a senior vice president at the parent
company, said it decided to sell because it needs to boost working
capital at a time when local business is suffering from Thailand's
recession.
	   ``It would take a few years before we see a return from
investment from Logic Telecom,'' Nopadol said. ``Given the economic
situation in Thailand now I think we should try to bring in money
(from overseas sources).''

Seoul urges North Korea to open official dialogue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
expressed hope Thursday that last month's appointment of a new
leader in North Korea would spur an official dialogue between the
rival states.
	   ``With the inauguration of the new leadership, I hope that North
Korea can start a new age of reconciliation and cooperation with
us,'' Kim said in a speech marking South Korea's Armed Forces Day
on Thursday.
	   ``To do this, dialogue between the South and North authorities
has to be resumed soon,'' he said.
	   In a long-awaited power reorganization in early September, North
Korea adopted a new constitution endorsing Kim Jong Il as its
leader and appointed his loyalists to key government, party and
military posts.
	   That completed a power reorganization in North Korea following
the 1994 death of Kim Jong Il's father, longtime leader Kim Il
Sung. It also marked communism's first hereditary power succession.
	   The South Korean president said the two governments need to open
dialogue to discuss peace on the Korean peninsula, which still
remains technically in a state of war because no peace treaty was
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
	   While stressing the importance of an official dialogue, Kim
Dae-jung said his government will also actively support private
exchanges with North Korea to build confidence.
	   North Korea has been receptive to offers of economic and other
non-government exchanges by South Korean civic groups.
	   Reviewing parades by thousands of combat soldiers and modern
military hardware and an acrobatic fly-by of military aircraft, Kim
also said South Korea must continue to build up its arms to deter a
possible North Korean invasion.
	   ``As is shown in continuing infiltration incidents, North Korea
is still adhering to an unchanging strategy of communizing and
unifying the country by force,'' he said.

Landmark animal protection law gets green light
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ The legislature appears ready to approve a
landmark animal protection law that offers hope for ending Taiwan's
chronic stray dog problem and quieting an international outcry.
	   The law, which requires registration of all pets and mandates
fines of up to 50,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 1,450) for animal
abuse, was approved in committee, the legislature said Friday.
	   The law now goes to the general session of the legislature,
where officials said they expect speedy passage.
	   In a statement, a coalition of 21 animal rights groups praised
the law as providing the ``most basic guarantee for the dignity of
life of animals in Taiwan.''
	   Animal advocates hope the registration requirement, backed with
the threat of fines, will help reduce numbers of new strays, most
of which are former pets.
	   The law also requires ``appropriate'' living space, nutrition
and clean conditions for all pets. Only humane methods may be used
to kill sick animals or those that must be destroyed by law.
Animals will be destroyed after seven days if not claimed.
	   Deplorable conditions at Taiwanese dog pounds have attracted
international attention and sparked protests by animal activists
outside Taiwanese government offices overseas. Critics say dogs are
routinely drowned, beaten to death, electrocuted or simply left to
die of neglect at pounds around Taiwan.
	   U.S.-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has
enlisted film stars including actions heroes Jean_Claude Van Damme,
Steven Seagal and Jackie Chan in a letter writing campaign to urge
Taiwanese officials to pass the animal protection law.
	   Some aspects of the law may be difficult to enforce, such as its
requirement that live chickens and fish sold in traditional markets
be kept and slaughtered humanely.
	   But its passage underscores the about-face in official attitudes
towards animal protection since Taiwan was subjected to U.S. trade
sanctions for the illegal trade in tiger bone and rhinoceros horn
four years ago.
	   A conservation law was later passed, and private groups say
effective enforcement has pushed the trade in endangered species
parts deep underground.

US to release Israeli spy, says paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli newspaper reported Thursday that the
United States has agreed to release Jonathan Pollard, an American
jailed for spying for Israel 12 years ago.
	   But Pollard's wife Esther told Israel Radio that the report is
untrue. She called it a leak to cover up the Israeli government's
failure to act.
	   The Israeli newspaper Yediot Acharonot reported that in their
talks in Washington Monday, U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed on steps that would lead
to the release of Pollard, who is serving a life sentence. The
paper said the agreement was reached during the private part of
their meeting, with no aides present.
	   But Esther Pollard charged that the news report was a baseless
leak. Leading a strident a campaign for her husband's release that
has angered many in Israel and the United States, she charged that
every time an Israeli prime minister meets an American president,
there are leaks about the imminent release of Pollard.
	   She told Israel radio that high-level sources in Washington said
``the subject had not been brought up in serious fashion and
therefore no agreement was reached.''
	   Pollard was an intelligence officer for the U.S. Navy when he
was arrested outside the Israeli embassy in 1985. It emerged later
that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a shadowy Israeli
intelligence-gathering body in the United States. Until recently,
the Israeli government disavowed Pollard, and called his espionage
a ``rogue operation.'' The present Israeli government granted
Pollard Israeli citizenship, and many Israeli officials, including
cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison. File Stored As:

China bans blood sales to slow spread of AIDS, other diseases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A new Chinese law banning payment for blood
donations took effect Thursday, prompted by an alarming rise in
AIDS and other diseases in contaminated donations.
	   Until now, 40 percent of blood for transfusions and other
medical needs in China was purchased. But health officials worried
that many sellers were prostitutes, drug addicts, poor farmers and
others at risk of AIDS, hepatitis and other diseases.
	   A recent survey by the Ministry of Public Health showed 30
percent to 90 percent of the blood provided by these sellers tested
positive for hepatitis B.
	   It is unclear whether China can make up for the loss of
purchased blood through voluntary and compulsory donations required
of health workers, soldiers and civil servants. Compulsory
contributions already account for 40 percent of the nationwide
supply, while just 20 percent is given voluntarily.
	   The state-run newspaper China Health News, in a front-page
commentary, said patients will be encouraged to store blood for
future use and to seek donors among friends and relatives.
	   Doctors, nurses and other health workers were told to inform
recipients of blood products and their families of the risks
associated with transfusions.
	   Health workers were exhorted to ``give up old beliefs that
giving blood weakens the body'' and to set an example by donating
themselves.
	   The new law would put some ``career'' blood sellers out of work.
	   A photo essay in the newspaper Yangcheng Evening News showed
several frequent sellers displaying their bruised arm veins.
	   One 50-year-old man was quoted as saying that he had supported
his wife and raised a family by selling blood, as often as 10 times
a month, since he was 18 years old.
	   The report said less than 10 percent of the blood supply came
from voluntary donations in Guangdong, the southern province where
the newspaper is published.

Elway practices, plans to play Sunday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN MOSSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Week 3 of the John Elway Hamstring Watch produced
some positive news.
	   Elway practiced Wednesday, reported no ill effects and vowed he
will start in Sunday's home game against Philadelphia. The
quarterback was upgraded to probable on the Denver Broncos' injury
report.
	   ``It seems to be getting better and better,'' Elway said
Wednesday. ``The week off definitely helped me. It's a lot better
today.''
	   On Sept. 13, Elway strained his right hamstring in a game
against Dallas. He aggravated the injury against Oakland the
following week, then felt a twinge in the hamstring during pregame
warmups against Washington last week and spent the game on the
sideline.
	   Elway, 38, was a full participant in Wednesday's practice,
although he didn't do rollouts or bootlegs at full speed.
	   ``We didn't test him, we didn't sprint him for obvious
reasons,'' coach Mike Shanahan said. ``But this is the furthest
he's been along at this stage of the week since the Oakland game.
	   ``He practiced good and said he felt pretty good. He's doing a
little work on a treadmill right now, so hopefully it just keeps on
getting better. Unless there's a major setback in the next couple
of days, I'd be very surprised if he's not able to go.''
	   Asked after the morning walk-through if he intended to miss
another game, Elway said, ``No. I don't get paid to sit on the
bench. You want to play. I was playing well before I got hurt, so I
want to get back out and start playing again.
	   ``When you don't miss many games, as I haven't, and then you
miss one, it kind of puts everything back in perspective. So every
once in a while it's good for the psyche to miss a game, because
then you realize how much you enjoy playing it.''
	   Veteran Bubby Brister replaced Elway in the second quarter of
the Oakland game and engineered a 34-17 victory. Last week, Brister
made his first start since 1995 and led the Broncos (4-0) to a
38-16 win.
	   Shanahan and the Broncos medical staff have attributed Elway's
pregame sensation last Sunday _ which the quarterback described as
a ``pop'' _ to scar tissue breaking loose.
	   The Broncos were in good health for the game against winless
Philadelphia (0-4). Offensive lineman David Diaz-Infante is the
only player likely to miss the game. He's listed as questionable
with a knee injury.

Bangkok opens center to attract foreign investment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok's city government announced
Thursday it is opening a center to attract and assist foreign
investors interested in opening businesses in the Thai capital.
	   ``As a direct result of the unprecedented economic turmoil
throughout the Southeast Asian region, it is necessary to once gain
build confidence in Thailand,'' the city's statement said.
	   Thailand is mired in its worst economic crisis in modern times.
Investment has fallen off, although some companies, attracted by
lower prices for real estate, products and services because of the
bad economy, have chosen to invest or expand their operations in
Thailand.
	   The new center is similar to the national government's Board of
Investment, which assists foreign investors in the country, except
that is hopes to steer investment to the capital.
	   The national government, however, is trying to steer more
investment to the outer provinces to create a better distribution
of wealth.
	   Called Bangkok ONE, the new office is intended as a one-stop
service center to provide information, help coordinate with
government agencies and offer legal and financial advice, a press
release from the city administration said.
	   The center will also have computers, Internet access, faxes and
other communications and office services available for investors.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Just a few years ago, imports were so scarce that
an American visitor with an extra pair of Levi's blue jeans could
ignite a bidding war on the streets of Moscow.
	   Today, Russia is one of the most import-addicted nations in the
world _ a remarkable 48 percent of all consumer goods here are
foreign made, according to the State Statistics Committee.
	   The businessman hasn't made it until he's chauffeured to work in
the quiet comfort of a Mercedes sedan. A middle-class family eats
American chicken on Chinese plates while watching a Mexican soap
opera on their Japanese television. Even a poor Russian stopping at
the corner kiosk for sausages and cigarettes is likely to be buying
imports.
	   This dramatic transformation has created a huge problem: in the
current crisis, most Russians can't afford imports, and the
country's feeble economy can't produce many of the most basic
things people want to buy.
	   And it's not just the wealthy ``new Russians'' who've had their
lifestyles pared back. Imports have infiltrated almost every sector
of the economy, but now they're at least twice as expensive because
the ruble has fallen from 6 to 15 against the U.S. dollar.
	   Russia's economy has been shrinking for a decade, and the latest
crisis has once again driven it into full-fledged depression, with
this year's contraction expected to be around 5 percent. Prices
have soared 67 percent since August and could climb 300 to 500
percent by the end of the year, according to Central Bank
forecasts.
	   Consider chicken, a major Russian import. American drumsticks
began appearing in Russian stores during George Bush's presidency,
and to this day they are fondly known as ``Bush legs.''
	   Tyson Foods, a leading American exporter to Russia, slaughters
its birds in Arkansas, sends them to New Orleans, ships them across
the Atlantic Ocean and trucks them into the Russian heartland.
	   When they finally hit the freezer section at Russian
supermarkets, they are competitively priced _ at least until the
ruble crashed _ and are far superior to Russian chicken that comes
from just down the road.
	   Russian agriculture has so withered that the country imported 73
percent of its sugar, 37 percent of its fish and 35 percent of its
meat last year, said Nikolai Kharitonov, leader of the Agrarian
Party. This year's drought-stricken grain harvest is expected to be
the smallest since 1957.
	   ``During the seven years of pseudo-reforms, the country has been
plundered, industry has stopped functioning, and Russian
agriculture has the rights of a step-daughter,'' Kharitonov said.
	   Hundreds of foreign companies took part in the recent World Food
Moscow trade exhibition, all vying for a slice of what had been a
rapidly expanding import market. Instead, many of them may soon be
leaving Russia.
	   ``Last chance to look at imported food,'' Kommersant newspaper
joked in an article on the trade fair.
	   Russians who quickly grew accustomed to filling their shopping
carts with Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Skippy peanut butter and Baskin
Robbins ice cream are now facing sticker shock.
	   ``Before the crisis, I didn't even check the prices,'' said
Dmitri Teterin, a concert pianist lugging groceries out of Seven
Continents, an upscale supermarket stocked almost entirely with
imports. ``Now I'll have to start looking in the Russian shops.''
	   Some sample prices: Nescafe Gold coffee, dlrs 15 for a
half-pound. Blue cheese from France, dlrs 25 a pound. Heineken
beer, nearly dlrs 3 a bottle.
	   President Boris Yeltsin tried to launch a ``buy Russian''
campaign last year, but even he wasn't too persuasive.
	   ``Yes,'' Yeltsin conceded, ``our cars are not as good as
foreign-made ones and break down more often.''
	   The economic emergency has achieved what Yeltsin's exhortations
could not. Imports to Russia fell 19 percent in August compared to
a year earlier, and the trend seems certain to continue, the
government said.
	   Customers have already moved to stores selling cheaper Russian
goods, and the crisis could stimulate some Russian industries to
produce more. But many businesses and shops that depend on imports
could be ruined.
	   As Russian capitalism has evolved, the initial wave of kiosks
that sold imported candy bars, cigarettes and booze in the early
1990s has been followed by trendy boutiques and American-style
shopping malls in Moscow.
	   Even the remote corners of Russia are now served by an army of
``shuttle traders'' who fly to Europe, the Middle East and Asia,
stuffing their suitcases with inexpensive clothes and shoes that
they sell back home.
	   Russia had been exporting enough oil, gas and other natural
resources to pay for the imports. But energy prices are sagging,
imports are costlier and something has to give.
	   St. Petersburg, the country's busiest port, has seen a roughly
50 percent drop in imports since August, customs officials said.
	   ``The ships have virtually disappeared,'' said Viktor Yatsuk,
director of Barbaletta, a major freight-handling company.
	   His firm processed 51,000 tons of food in July, but only 17,000
tons in August. In the first half of September, it handled one ship
with 1,300 tons of bananas.
	   ``This is terrible,'' said Yatsuk, who has placed all but 20 of
his 300-member staff on unpaid leave. ``There are no imports at
all.''

Troubled LTCB sells headquarters building
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. said
Thursday it has sold its Tokyo headquarters building and the land
underneath it to a group company.
	   The real estate was sold Wednesday to Chobuil Corp. for 96.35
billion yen (dlrs 708 million), LTCB said. The bank said it will
post a 51.91 billion yen (dlrs 381 million) profit from the sale.
	   LTCB is at the center of political debate over whether to use
taxpayers' money to help clean up the Japanese banking industry's
mounting bad debt problem.
	   Earlier this week, two lending affiliates of the troubled LTCB
filed for bankruptcy.
	   But the bank said the sale was part of the bank's
previously-announced restructuring plan, which included the sale of
assets. As a result, there is no change to LTCB's earnings
forecast, the bank said.
	   After the sale, LTCB will rent the property from Chobuil, a real
estate company in which LTCB has a minority ownership stake.

millennium government
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS 8th graf to clarify the significance of One Nation in
vote counting

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's 12 million voters will
choose between a conservative incumbent proposing radical tax
reform and a Labor opposition promising more spending on social
programs and thousands of new jobs when they go to the polls
Saturday.
	   Dubbed the Millennium Poll, the election will usher in the
government that will oversee the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games and the
100th anniversary of Australia's federation in 2001.
	   If Labor wins, it will be the first time since the Great
Depression in the 1930s that Australians have voted out a
government after just one term.
	   More likely, however, is a narrow win for Prime Minister John
Howard's conservative Liberal-National party coalition, leaving him
with a vastly reduced majority in the lower house of Australia's
bicameral Parliament.
	   Throughout a five-week campaign dominated by dry discussions of
taxes and the economy, opinion polls have shown the two main
opponents are neck-and-neck amid high levels of voter apathy and
distrust.
	   Latest polling Thursday showed the conservatives pulling ahead
slightly.
	   But the wild card is the right-wing party One Nation, which
exploded onto the political scene 18 months ago with anti-Asian,
anti-Aboriginal and populist protectionist appeal.
	   While support for One Nation has halved in recent months and its
mercurial leader Pauline Hanson may lose her seat, the party may
still hold the key to the election by influencing which party wins
in closely contested districts.
	   Howard has called for sweeping changes to the tax system,
including a new goods and services tax that will be partially
offset by cuts in income taxes.
	   Labor has promised to create 500,000 jobs in its first
three-year term, and party leader Kim Beazley has also called for
smaller income tax cuts targeted at low-income earners.
	   But Beazley has been weighed down by the memory of 13 years of
Labor government, which voters threw out in a landslide just 2 1/2
years ago, and has sought to recast the party in the style of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair's New Labor.
	   ``We have listened to these voices and we have learned,''
Beazley said at the official Labor campaign launch.
	   By making tax reform the centerpiece of his campaign, Howard has
sought to sideline issues unpopular for the government, such as
criticism that he failed to react quickly enough to stem the rise
of Hanson.
	   ``In this election campaign, if you really believe in calling it
for Australia ... you have to embrace the cause of taxation
reform,'' Howard said.
	   Coverage of Hanson, who claims Australia is in danger of being
``swamped'' by Asians, calls Australia's Aborigines over-privileged
and advocates economic protectionism, has hurt Australia's
reputation overseas.
	   Even if Howard retains control of the more powerful lower house,
polling indicates the balance of power in the upper house will
again lie with minor parties or independents, meaning the
government may have to negotiate to get its bills passed into law.

Howard ``angered'' by charges of ``racism'' against his countrymen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime minister John Howard said
Thursday that he gets ``very angry'' when he hears Australians
described as ``racist or intolerant.''
	   But he admitted that he had made mistakes and said Australian
society and history is not without blemish.
	   ``And, in particular, our treatment of our indigenous people
(the Aborigines) is something that readily comes to mind when I
talk about blemishes,'' Howard said.
	   Howard was speaking to reporters two days before the country's
national elections on Saturday.
	   One reporter had asked what impact the far right, anti-Asian,
anti-Aboriginal politician Pauline Hanson has had on Australia.
	   Howard said opinion polls show that Hanson's One Nation party
has lost much of its support in the past few months; it is down to
about 7 percent in most areas.
	   ``I think Australians, over time, have demonstrated their
inherent tolerance,'' Howard said.
	   ``I get very, very angry when people describe Australians as
racist or intolerant,'' he added.
	   The One Nation party won more than 23 percent of the popular
vote and 11 of 89 seats in the Queensland state elections in June.
	   Howard said that that the quality of public debate in Australia
might have improved since then because people now realize that
simplistic solutions, like those One Nation offers, do not work.
	   He said his main criticism of One Nation is that it describes
Australians according to their race.
	   ``That is wrong. That is repugnant to Australian society,'' he
said.
	   Howard said anyone who had embraced this country had as much
right to call Australia home as he, himself, has.
	   ``All people, regardless of their background, are entitled to
decent treatment,'' he said.
	   Howard pledged again that he would make no deals with the One
Nation party after Saturday's election.
	   But he admitted that he had made mistakes and said Australian
society and history is not without blemish.
	   ``And, in particular, our treatment of our indigenous people is
something that readily comes to mind when I talk about blemishes,''
Howard said.

Estrada: Philippines to withdraw as World Expo 2002 host
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Thursday the Philippines has made a final decision to withdraw as
host of World Expo 2002 because of economic difficulties.
	   ``This expo will only expose us to debts,'' Estrada said in a
radio interview with station DZMM. ``My decision is final. It will
not push through.''
	   Estrada said the government would have to spend 6 billion pesos
(dlrs 135 million) to host the event, money that could be better
used on projects that would ease poverty.
	   He said he has studied cases of several other countries that
failed to recoup their expenses in hosting the exposition,
including this year's host, Portugal.
	   ``We cannot afford to lose money,'' he added.
	   Estrada had earlier said he will drop the hosting of the event
but reconsidered the decision a few days later when some businesses
proposed that private companies pay for the costs.
	   Several businessmen and former tourism secretary Mina Gabor were
against the withdrawal, saying it could damage the image of the
Philippines. Gabor lobbied for the Philippines to win in June over
Australia to host the exposition.
	   Gabor said at least 3.7 million tourists would be expected to
attend the exposition. About 60 countries were expected to
participate.
	   Former President Fidel Ramos also urged Estrada to reconsider
and offered to help raise funds, officials said.
	   Estrada said he preferred to use the money for agriculture to
build roads and irrigation dams and for mass housing projects.
	   He has said the event may result in useless and costly
structures similar to ones built at a special economic zone north
of Manila for a trade exposition in June.

Thai prime minister says new coalition lineup nearly ready
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said
on Thursday that a Cabinet lineup for a new seven-party coalition
government is nearly complete and will be submitted to the
country's king for approval by early next week.
	   ``Everything has fallen into place,'' Chuan told reporters
outside the executive office building. All high level appointments
must be approved by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the constitutional
monarch.
	   The new lineup includes the Chart Pattana (National Development)
Party, which with 51 seats in the House of Representatives will add
more political muscle to the coalition's now thin parliamentary
majority of 207-185.
	   The added strength will make it easier for the Chuan government
to overcome opposition the legislature to legal and financial
reforms intended to help Thailand work its way out of the its worst
economic crisis in modern times.
	   Chuan's political point man, Interior Minister Sanan
Kachornprasart, was the ruling Democrat Party's chief negotiator in
forging the new coalition.
	   In a week of frenzied and fractious bargaining, he managed to
bring Chart Pattana into the government without losing any of the
other five parties allied with the Democrats in the coalition.
	   Some bitter disputes had arisen over the apportionment of
Cabinet spots, with all parties forced to give up some valued posts
to make room for Chart Pattana under quota system used in Thai
politics.
	   Most unhappy was the Social Action Party, whose leader, Montree
Pongpanich, resigned this week over his failure to gain more
Cabinet posts for his lawmakers, and the ``Cobra Faction'' of the
Thai Citizens Party.
	   Some Cobras were unhappy that they lost one post. They called
Chuan ungrateful because they had rebelled against their own party
to join his coalition last November, enabling him to become prime
minister.
	   Some lawmakers had speculated that the SAP and the Cobras might
bolt from the coalition.
	   But Cobra leader Vatana Asavahame said Thursday that
``everything is fine. We have reached an understanding,'' with the
Democrats.
	   Sanan said the only Cabinet slot still not filled was that of
education minister, which belongs to the Chart Thai (Thai Nation)
party.
	   Education Minister Chumpol Silparcha resigned Wednesday citing
health reasons, and the coalition was waiting for the party to
nominate a new minister.

Millennium bug could prompt Asian companies to list in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Concerns about the millennium bug
computer problem crippling Asian stock exchanges could prompt many
companies in the region to list on the Australian Stock Exchange,
the exchange's chief said Thursday.
	   Australian Stock Exchange managing director and chief executive
Richard Humphry said the exchange was looking at ways to fast-track
the processing needed to allow a company to temporarily list on the
exchange in the event of a major technological problem elsewhere.
	   ``This is a voluntary thing'' for affected companies, Humphry
told reporters.
	   ``But it means those companies could continue to trade if their
own markets happen to go off-line for whatever period.''
	   Humphry said new arrivals to the Australian Stock Exchange could
stay listed in their home markets.
	   ``We've already had an approach from an Indonesian company to
list with the Australian Stock Exchange, a significant one. And
it's principally because of the current difficulties Indonesia is
experiencing,'' he said.

Japanese stocks close at 12-year low, dollar higher in Tokyo

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese share prices sank to new 12-year lows
Thursday on mounting worry about the deterioration of the economy
and concern over a drop on Wall Street overnight. The dollar rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell
209.27 points, or 1.56 percent, to close at 13,197.12 _ the second
straight day it finished trading at lows not seen since February
1986.
	   On Wednesday, the Nikkei had plunged 415.04 points, or 3
percent.
	   ``The outlook is still very tough,'' said Dhia Amir, a senior
institutional sales trader in the Tokyo office of Nomura Securities
Co.
	   The market lost ground after a brief rally in early trading as
dismay set in about the results of the latest quarterly Bank of
Japan survey of business sentiment, or ``Tankan'' report, traders
said.
	   The report, released just before the start of trading Thursday,
showed a key business condition diffusion index for big
manufacturers sank to a worse-than-expected minus 51, down from
minus 38 in the previous June survey.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section fell 27.85 points, or 2.61 percent, to 1,015.72. The
TOPIX lost 19.33 points, or 1.82 percent, the previous day.
	   Investors also sold off shares following Wall Street's dip,
traders said.
	   In overnight trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined
237.90 points, or 3 percent, to 7,842.62 on worry interest rates
have not been lowered enough to boost flagging corporate profit
growth.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar traded higher
against the yen in reaction to the disappointing results of the
Bank of Japan survey, traders said.
	   It rose to 136.66 yen in mid-afternoon trading, up 0.94 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo, but that was below its late New York level
of 136.75 yen overnight.
	   Selling of yen for dollars picked up pace after the Nikkei stock
average appeared as if it could crash through the psychologically
important level of 13,000 points in early afternoon trading, they
said.
	   The Nikkei, which sank as low as 13,018.75 in interday trading
Thursday before recovering slightly, has not traded below 13,000
since January of 1986.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.710 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.765
percent, driving its price up to 109.84 yen from 109.35 yen.

Cubs down one game, but not out, Sosa says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM SALADINO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The Chicago Cubs found out that regular-season
dominance means little once the playoffs start.
	   Atlanta's John Smoltz dominated the Cubs on Wednesday in a 7-1
victory, snapping the Braves' five-game losing streak against
Chicago.
	   ``What happened during the regular season is over,'' said Sammy
Sosa, whose Cubs took six of nine from Atlanta, including five in a
row before the loss Wednesday in their first playoff appearance
since 1989.
	   ``We only lost one game. We played poorly today and made a few
mistakes,'' said Sosa, who became a household name when he hit 66
home runs to finish four behind Mark McGwire's record 70 homers.
	   ``It's no different in the playoffs. Maybe we tried to do too
much in the first game,'' he said.
	   The Braves, taking part in a record seventh consecutive playoff,
played 72 games in the postseason since the Cubs last appeared.
	   ``They've been there so many times and this is our first time,''
Sosa conceded. ``But the war is not over yet.''
	   The Cubs will send Kevin Tapani (19-9) to the mound Thursday
night in Game 2 against Atlanta's Tom Glavine (20-6). Friday is an
off day before the series shifts to Chicago for Game 3 on Saturday.
	   Smoltz, 17-3 during the regular season, became the winningest
pitcher in postseason history (11-3) in beating the Cubs. The
right-hander gave up five hits, struck out six and didn't allow a
walk in 7 2-3 innings. Whitey Ford and Dave Stewart each had 10
postseason victories.
	   ``He (Smoltz) was the story of the game,'' Cubs manager Jim
Riggleman said.
	   Sosa had two of the hits off Smoltz after going 3-for-33 (.091)
previously off Smoltz. He said with the home run race over, he
concentrated more on just hitting the ball.
	   ``You've just got to make contact and get on base and not swing
so hard,'' he said.
	   Maybe some of his teammates should have used the same formula.
	   Chicago's only run came on a solo home run by Tyler Houston in
the eighth. By then, the Braves had a 7-0 lead.
	   Chicago starter Mark Clark went 6 1-3 innings. He gave up seven
hits and four runs _ two earned _ walked one and struck out four.
The right-hander was touched up for a two-run homer to Michael
Tucker in the second and a sacrifice fly to Andruw Jones in the
sixth before Ryan Klesko sealed the victory with a grand slam in
the seventh off Matt Karchner.

Chicago phenom likely to pitch Game 3 of division series
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Kerry Wood will apparently make his comeback in
the NL division series.
	   Wood, who hasn't pitched for the Chicago Cubs in a month because
of a sprained elbow ligament, was put on their postseason roster
Wednesday and is likely to pitch Game 3 against the Braves.
	   The Cubs hedged a bit by going with 11 pitchers on their 25-man
roster, but they expect Wood to be on the mound Saturday after an
encouraging performance in the Arizona Instructional League.
	   ``I'm excited to get back out there,'' Wood said. ``It's been
kind of frustrating of late to be watching the team go out there
and play in some big games and not being able to be a part of it.''
	   Wood, who has been out since Aug. 31, pitched 2 2-3 scoreless
innings in the instructional league Monday, allowing three hits and
striking out three. He threw 51 pitches, his fastball reaching 95
mph (152 kph).
	   Mark Clark (9-14) started Game 1 for the Cubs, and Kevin Tapani
(19-9) will work in Game 2 Thursday night. When the series shifts
to Wrigley Field, the Cubs expect to go with Wood (13-6, 3.40 ERA),
the only Chicago starter with an ERA below 4.00.
	   Wood tied a major league record in May by striking out 20
batters in a nine-inning game. The 21-year-old righty wound up
third in the league with 233 strikeouts despite missing the final
month.
	   ``We're pleased to be able to activate him,'' manager Jim
Riggleman said. ``We're not sure how he's going to be control-wise.
He hasn't pitched in a major league game in a while.''
	   The Cubs aren't planning a strict pitch count for Wood. Instead,
they will let him work as long as his mechanics are sound.
	   ``It's not so much how many pitches he throws,'' Riggleman said.
``It's the position of the arm when he's throwing. There's a
certain spot that he reaches which is a problem. When he's not
doing the mechanical flaw, he's fine.''
	   Given the weary state of Chicago's pitching staff after a
stretch drive that included a wild-card playoff victory over San
Francisco on Monday night, a healthy Wood would be a major boost.
	   He pitched three times against the Braves _ all Chicago
victories _ going 1-0 with a 2.18 ERA and 20 strikeouts in 20 2-3
innings. He has been especially tough at Wrigley Field, winning
nine of 10 decisions with a 2.97 ERA.
	   Riggleman said he wouldn't change his decision to use Wood based
on where the best-of-5 series stands after two games.
	   ``The only reason he wouldn't start is just if I feel Atlanta is
swinging the bats extremely well against our right-handed pitchers.
Then I'd go to (lefty Terry) Mulholland,'' the manager said.
	   ``The likelihood is that he will pitch. The decision will not be
made whether we're down 0-2, up 2-0 or 1-1.''

Japan bank survey indicates confidence in economy is worsening
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS two final grafs with analyst quote. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Underlining the seriousness of Japan's recession, a
central bank quarterly survey released Thursday found confidence at
small and medium-sized businesses plunging to its worst since the
survey was begun in 1967.
	   Business sentiment among major manufacturers was hardly better,
as confidence was the worst in 3 1/2 years, according to the Bank
of Japan's widely watched ``tankan'' survey.
	   The survey's main index measures the percentage of firms seeing
business conditions improve minus the percentage seeing conditions
worsen.
	   The measure for small and medium-sized manufacturers was minus
57, worse than the previous record low of minus 51 in May 1975. In
the previous survey released in June, the index was minus 49.
	   For big manufacturers, the index fell to minus 51, the worst
since February 1994 when it fell to minus 56. In the survey
released three months ago, it was minus 38.
	   Japan is stuck in its worst recession in half a century, its
economy dragged down by massive bad loans in its financial sector
and sales dampened by the Asian currency crisis and also pessimism
among consumers at home.
	   Bankruptcies among companies have risen. Smaller companies are
the worse hit because they are more dependent on bank loans to
finance their businesses.
	   Shosaku Murayama, director of the Bank of Japan's research
department, said the survey shows that the overall economy is in a
slump.
	   ``The survey indicates that companies expect their earnings and
financing to worsen further,'' he said.
	   Analysts predicted that hard times would continue. Although the
government has announced a stimulus package of public spending, its
effect has yet to be felt, they said.
	   ``Small and medium-sized companies aren't likely to see an
improvement,'' said Akio Yoshino, senior economist at Credit Suisse
Asset Management in Tokyo.

Lions' Carrier suspended one game
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Detroit safety Mark Carrier, whose
helmet-to-helmet blow gave Tampa Bay's Brice Hunter a concussion,
is the first NFL player in six years to get suspended for an
on-field hit.
	   The league suspended Carrier on Wednesday for one game, the
NFL's first suspension for an on-field hit since 1992, when Green
Bay's LeRoy Butler was sidelined one game for throwing a forearm to
the head of Detroit quarterback Andre Ware.
	   The suspension will cost Carrier about dlrs 25,000, one week of
his base salary of dlrs 475,000.
	   Gene Washington, the NFL's chief disciplinarian, said Carrier's
record was taken into account. This is the third time in two
seasons and the fifth in seven years he has been cited for hitting
with his helmet.
	   George Young, the league's senior vice president for football
operations, called the latest hit ``unnecessary, dangerous and
something we do not want in the game.''
	   ``It is a tackling technique that poses a significant injury
risk both to the player and his opponent,'' he said.
	   Said Lions coach Bobby Ross: ``I don't know how we can make
decisions on this when two guys are going up for a ball.'' Ross
also alluded to two former Lions, Reggie Brown and Mike Utley, who
received serious neck injuries.
	   ``It's ironic that we would be the one team picked out after
eight years of what's happened to us when there are people who have
titles of head hunters and everything else, and that not one thing
has been done to them,'' Ross said.
	   Carrier's hit, which didn't draw a penalty, came during the
second period of the Lions' 27-6 victory Monday night. The game was
delayed about 10 minutes while Hunter was treated on the field.
	   ``Football is a tough sport and sometimes people get injured. It
was a hard hit, but I am fine,'' Hunter said Wednesday.
	   Last season, Carrier was fined once and warned once for two
improper helmet hits in the same game.
	   He also was fined dlrs 7,500 for a hit against Green Bay in
1997. With the Chicago Bears, Carrier was fined a total of dlrs
17,500 for improper helmet hits in 1992 and 1993.
	   ``The league is very tough on helmet-to-helmet hits,'' Tampa Bay
coach Tony Dungy said. ``We've had some fines we haven't liked. You
kind of just have to live with them and go with the flow. I don't
think he has a reputation as a dirty ballplayer or anything. He's a
good player and he plays hard and tries to help his team win.''

Libya honors 11 African leaders for breaking U.N. air embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi presented 11
African leaders with medals of honor in appreciation for violating
a U.N. air embargo against Libya, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Thursday.
	   Four of the African leaders were present at Wednesday night's
ceremony in the northern coastal town of Sirte where Ghadafi
presented the medals, MENA said.
	   They were presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Idriss
Deby of Chad, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Isaias Afwerki of
Eritrea, MENA said.
	   Medals were also received on behalf of presidents Omar el-Bashir
of Sudan, Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, Yaya Jammeh of Gambia,
Laurent Kabila of Congo, Robert Mugabe of Zimambwe, Blaise Campaore
of Burkina Faso and Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central African
Republic.
	   All the 11 African leaders have in the past three months flown
to Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel.
	   The Organization of African Unity announced in June that it
would no longer abide by the air embargo against Libya.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim also received a medal
Wednesday ``for his role in serving the causes of justice and peace
in Africa,'' MENA said.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992 to try to
force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.

Police arrest six, probe link to Cape Town blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police have arrested six men and
seized two pipebombs, and are investigating them in connection with
the fatal explosion at a Planet Hollywood restaurant in August.
	   Officers surrounded a house in the Cape Flats slum, and
recovered two unexploded pipe bombs that were tossed from the
house, said police spokesman Senior Superintendent John
Sterrenberg.
	   They were acting on a tip, he said.
	   The Aug. 25 bomb killed two people. Investigators later said the
explosive resembled earlier bombs placed at police targets. Those
bombs had been linked to a Muslim vigilante group, People Against
Gangsterism and Drugs.
	   Sterrenberg declined to give details on the suspects, who were
arrested Wednesday night.

Philippine Airlines workers vote to determine airline's future

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers voted
Thursday on whether to give up their right to strike for 10 years
as part of a management recovery plan that would allow Asia's
oldest carrier to reopen.
	   It was the second time in 11 days that the 6,700 members of
PAL's largest union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they
rejected the proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving
much of the country without air service.
	   Members were given until Friday noon to vote, but counting could
begin Thursday night if voting is completed earlier, said Labor
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma.
	   Many union members believed the government would not allow the
57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Under the plan, workers would suspend their collective
bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent
share of the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights and expose them to management abuses.
	   ``This is our last card,'' union president Alex Barrientos told
workers Thursday. ``As your leader, I am not giving away your
rights.''
	   Barrientos said he has not visited the union office for several
days after some militant workers threatened to shoot him.
	   ``If they want an explanation of why we agreed to the plan, they
can always call me,'' he said.
	   ``We're being asked to choose between two coffins,'' said Renato
Ramos, a union board member opposed to the plan.
	   Aurora Magsombol, an airline comptroller who has worked for 19
years in PAL, said she would rather lose her job than her rights,
adding she doesn't believe a guarantee by PAL chairman and chief
stockholder Lucio Tan to continue recognizing the union if the
bargaining agreement were suspended.
	   Hundreds of workers marched to the presidential palace Tuesday
to protest the plan and urge the government to take over the
airline, which has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency
crisis.
	   President Joseph Estrada says the government cannot do that
because it does not have the money to underwrite daily losses of up
to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Estrada, who helped broker the agreement with union leaders,
also urged the workers to ratify the plan.
	   ``I have assured the labor union that as president I will always
protect them. I will not abandon them,'' he said.
	   He asked union members to consider not only their welfare but
also that of millions of Filipinos who would be affected by PAL's
shutdown.
	   Tan has been meeting in Europe with foreign creditors to ask
them not to repossess the airline's planes ahead of its possible
reopening.;1Hlease hold indonesia-demonstration. replacement

Car explodes in Riga's center, bomb possible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ An automobile exploded late Wednesday in the
old-town section of the Latvian capital, injuring a passerby, the
Baltic News Service reported.
	   It was not immediately clear if the explosion was caused by a
bomb.
	   Tensions have been strong in Riga recently in the build-up to
Saturday's referendum on controversial proposed changes in the
country's naturalization laws that would make it easier for ethnic
Russians to become citizens.
	   The car belonged to a Norwegian businessman, BNS said. The
passerby's condition was not given.
	   Police were considering the possibility that the car's fuel tank
exploded ``for as yet unknown reasons,'' BNS said.
	   About one-third of Latvia's people are ethnic Russians, most of
whom became stateless when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. The
parliament this year passed amendments that would remove some
obstacles to the Russians becoming citizens, but nationalists who
oppose the changes were able to force a referendum on the changes.
	   This spring, a bomb damaged Riga's only synagogue and a small
explosive device was set off outside the Russian Embassy several
days later.

Hong Kong celebrates Chinese National Day in somber mood

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong celebrated China's National Day
Thursday with parades, carnivals, banquets and a sobering reminder
that worse economic times may be ahead.
	   In a message to Hong Kong's 6.7 million people, Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa praised China's economic achievements but reminded
Hong Kong that it is ``facing the most serious challenges in recent
decades.''
	   Tung was joined by hundreds of Hong Kong and mainland
dignitaries and other citizens at an early morning flag-raising
ceremony outside the massive convention center where Britain handed
over the territory to China in July 1997.
	   Tung was to give an official cocktail reception later Thursday
and attend several other celebrations.
	   But some people said they had no mood, or money, to celebrate.
	   Restaurants that staged lavish banquets last year reported
business had fallen by up to 30 percent this year. People also were
forgoing exotic vacations to stay home for the public holidays
Thursday and Friday.
	   ``The economy's so bad. I'm not in the mood to celebrate,'' said
Carol Ng, 30, a secretary, buying groceries at a market.
	   Ng said she celebrated the holiday last year dining out with her
family in a fancy Chinese restaurant, just weeks before the stock
market crashed.
	   Hong Kong is mired in its first full-blown recession in 13 years
_ the economy is expected to shrink 4 percent this year, and
unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   A labor union planned a rally against layoffs and pay cuts later
Thursday.
	   But Tung remained upbeat, saying in his message that Hong Kong
can revive its economy ``with the staunch support of our
motherland'' and the Hong Kong people's ``tenacity, flexibility and
creativity.''
	   To boost confidence, Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged
support for the territory and promised not to devalue China's
currency. A yuan devaluation would harm investors' confidence in
Hong Kong and put heavy pressure on Hong Kong's currency link to
the U.S. dollar.
	   As fears that China would meddle in Hong Kong's affairs and curb
civil rights have largely failed to materialize, Hong Kong people
are becoming more open to the mainland.
	   In a clear sign of closer ties, thousands of Hong Kong citizens
enjoyed a rare chance to visit the barracks of Chinese People's
Liberation Army troops stationed here. All 12,000 tickets were
snapped up in two hours when they were given out Tuesday.
	   In the Stanley Fort garrison, buildings were festooned with
flags and banners that read ``The People's Liberation Army supports
Hong Kong's development.''
	   Soldiers in crisp, pale green fatigues played Chinese chess,
snooker and table tennis with the visitors. Several inscribed
patriotic phrases like ``the PLA and the people are one family''
for an enthusiastic audience.
	   One visitor, Lin Zao'an, 85, praised the Chinese troops for
``symbolizing the motherland,'' and brushed aside references to the
Tiananmen incident in Beijing in 1989, when army battalions fired
upon pro-democracy activists, killing hundreds, if not thousands.
	   ``Every country has its problems,'' said Lin, as his 3-year-old
grandson ran among the machine guns and automatic rifles on
display.

Libya honors 11 African leaders for breaking U.N. air embargo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi presented 11
African leaders with medals of honor in appreciation for their
violating a U.N. air embargo against Libya, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported Thursday.
	   Four of the African leaders were present at Wednesday night's
ceremony in the northern Libyan coastal town of Sirte where Gadhafi
presented the medals, MENA said.
	   They were presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Idriss
Deby of Chad, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and Isaias Afwerki of
Eritrea, MENA said.
	   Medals were also received on behalf of presidents Omar el-Bashir
of Sudan, Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, Yaya Jammeh of Gambia,
Laurent Kabila of Congo, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Blaise Campaore
of Burkina Faso and Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central African
Republic.
	   All the 11 African leaders have in the past three months flown
to Libya in violation of U.N. sanctions that ban air travel there.
	   The Organization of African Unity announced in June that it
would no longer abide by the air embargo against Libya.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim also received a medal
Wednesday ``for his role in serving the causes of justice and peace
in Africa,'' MENA said.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions in 1992 to try to
force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted by Britain and the
United States in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.

French car manufacturer Renault to build plant in Brazil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French car manufacturer Renault announced plans
Thursday to build a car-engine plant in Brazil, an investment worth
580 million francs (dlrs 104 million).
	   The plant will be located on the Curitiba assembly plant site.
It will produce 1-liter and 1.6-liter engines and account for 80
percent of the production the French company needs in South
America.
	   The plant is expected to begin production by the year 2000.
About 250 people will be employed at the plant.

Howard angered by charges of racism against his countrymen

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Thursday he gets very angry when he hears Australians described as
racist or intolerant.
	   But he admitted that he had made mistakes and said Australian
society and history are not without blemish.
	   ``And, in particular, our treatment of our indigenous people
(the Aborigines) is something that readily comes to mind when I
talk about blemishes,'' Howard said.
	   Howard was speaking to reporters two days before the country's
national elections Saturday.
	   One reporter had asked what impact the far right, anti-Asian,
anti-Aboriginal politician Pauline Hanson has had on Australia.
	   Howard said opinion polls show that Hanson's One Nation party
has lost much of its support in the past few months; it is down to
about 7 percent in most areas.
	   ``I think Australians, over time, have demonstrated their
inherent tolerance,'' Howard said.
	   ``I get very, very angry when people describe Australians as
racist or intolerant,'' he added.
	   The One Nation party won more than 23 percent of the popular
vote and 11 of 89 seats in the Queensland state elections in June.
	   Howard said the quality of public debate in Australia might have
improved since then because people now realize that simplistic
solutions, like those One Nation offers, do not work.
	   He said his main criticism of One Nation is that it describes
Australians according to their race.
	   ``That is wrong. That is repugnant to Australian society,'' he
said.
	   Howard said anyone who had embraced this country had as much
right to call Australia home as he, himself, has.
	   ``All people, regardless of their background, are entitled to
decent treatment,'' he said.
	   Howard pledged again that he would make no deals with the One
Nation party after Saturday's election.

Small victory for government may be big loss for Howard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Even if John Howard leads his
conservative government back into power in the national election
Saturday, he may lose the grand prize of the prime ministership,
political analysts say.
	   Howard led his Liberal-National party coalition to victory in
1996, winning a big majority of 93 of 148 votes in the key lower
house of Parliament, compared to the main Labor opposition party's
49.
	   But polls during the campaign have shown that Labor is within
striking distance of winning the government.
	   With adjustments made for defections from the government to
independent ranks and the creation of new electorates because of
population shifts, Labor needs a 4 percent swing nationally to pick
up 27 electorates to have the 76 votes in Parliament it needs to
rule.
	   Polls show Labor and the conservative coalition each have around
42 percent of the vote, with a margin of error of around 2 percent.
	   With the coalition pulling away in the last days of the
campaign, most analysts are forecasting a Howard victory, but with
a loss of up to 20 seats.
	   Part of Labor's positive showing is put down to voter
unhappiness with Howard's plan to introduce a flat 10 percent tax
on goods and services. The tax is unpopular in polls and was
soundly rejected last time it was proposed, at a 1993 election.
	   It is generally accepted that if the tax were not proposed, the
coalition would walk back into power with the loss of perhaps a
handful of seats.
	   Some observers say that if Howard wins with a substantially
reduced majority, he will lose stature and authority within his own
party, prompting a challenge to his leadership.
	   ``One seat may be enough to save the government. It won't be
enough to deliver John Howard another three years (of
leadership),'' Michael Millett, political correspondent for The
Sydney Morning Herald, wrote this week.
	   Howard said Thursday he does not expect to remain leader if the
coalition loses. ``As far as I am concerned it's `good night nurse'
for me,'' he said.
	   But if the coalition wins, no matter what the majority, ``I
would contemplate serving out a mandate ... for three years,''
Howard said.
	   Waiting in the wings is Treasurer Peter Costello, whose ambition
even Howard has acknowledged as legitimate.
	   During the campaign, Costello has declared his intention to
support Howard if the coalition is returned to government. But he
has been unable to silence the speculation.

Schroeder starts early talks on new German government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder was
opening preliminary talks with Greens party leaders Thursday on
forming a new German government.
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, has said he wants to move swiftly
to set up a coalition after defeating Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
elections Sunday and returning the left to power in Germany after
16 years.
	   Formal coalition talks open Friday, but leaders of both parties
wanted to discuss the agenda and timetable on Thursday, sources on
both sides said.
	   The mainstream Social Democrats and the small, sometimes radical
Greens share a range of goals, such as fighting unemployment,
cutting taxes and granting dual citizenship to long-time foreign
residents.
	   But Greens positions on foreign and defense policy _ disbanding
NATO, limiting foreign missions of German soldiers and cutting
troop strength _ promise tough negotiations.
	   Party officials say the aim is to have a new government
confirmed within three weeks so Schroeder can attend an Oct. 24-25
summit of European leaders in Austria.

Firebomb damages TV van
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A small firebomb Thursday destroyed a van
belonging to a private television station, police said.
	   The predawn attack against the Skai television vehicle was the
latest in a wave of arson strikes mostly against foreign targets
and Greek media. Small leftist groups have claimed responsibility
for most of the incidents, which have damaged property but caused
few injuries.
	   A previously unknown organization, the Brigade of Fallen Angels,
called media outlets and claimed it carried out the attack on the
Skai van. The motive for the attack was not immediately known.
	   Skai played a central role in a bungled police raid last week to
free three hostages held by an escaped convict. The hostage-taker
called a Skai anchorman and issued demands and threats during a
live broadcast.
	   Authorities stormed the apartment and 12 people were injured,
including a hostage and the police chief, who later resigned. The
hostage-taker died later in a prison hospital when he choked on his
vomit while heavily sedated.

Three South Korean men arrested for alleged plotting with North
</HEADLINE>
Korea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A former presidential aide and two
businessmen have been arrested on charges of trying to get North
Korea to stage a brief, armed border skirmish to sway the results
of South Korea's presidential election last year.
	   The plot was designed to help the campaign of Lee Hoi-chang, the
then ruling party's candidate to succeed outgoing President Kim
Young-sam, prosecutors said Thursday. They pointed to Oh Jong-eun,
46, an aide to Kim, as the ringleader.
	   In return for North Korea's help, the three promised the
impoverished communist state a large amount of food and fertilizer
if Lee won the election, prosecutors said in a briefing for
journalists.
	   North Korea declined the offer, and President Kim Dae-jung, then
an opposition leader, eventually won the Dec. 18 election by a
margin of 300,000 votes, or less than 1 percent.
	   Oh and the two businessmen were arrested secretly early last
month by South Korea's main intelligence agency, the Agency for
National Security Planning. Prosecutors said they would be indicted
on charges of violating national security and election laws.
	   They said Han Sung-ki, a 39-year-old businessman, met with North
Korean officials in Beijing eight days before the presidential
election and asked them to provoke a brief gun fight with South
Korean troops at the truce village of Panmunjom.
	   Prosecutors said Oh, Han and another businessman, Chang
Sok-jung, 48, concocted the plot. It was not clear what Chang's
role was.
	   ``We are waiting for the prosecution to determine whether the
high-level party leadership was involved in this shocking plot,''
said Park Jie-won, President Kim Dae-jung's chief spokesman.
	   The now opposition Grand National Party claimed no knowledge of
the case.
	   ``It's baseless and outrageous. This is a sinister plot to
destroy the opposition party,'' said Ahn Sang-soo, the spokesman of
the No. 1 opposition group.
	   National security issues have often swayed South Korean politics
since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. Time and again, military
threats from North Korea, either real or rumored, sent voters
rallying around the conservative ruling party.
	   A former head of the government's main intelligence agency was
sentenced last week to five years in prison for plotting to destroy
President Kim's election campaign last year by depicting him as a
communist.

Government considers Soviet-style economic plan
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government convened Thursday to discuss a plan
that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other
hard currencies and greatly increase the number of rubles in
circulation.
	   President Boris Yeltsin discussed the plan with a visiting
regional governor, who proposed banning the free circulation of the
dollar and introducing a so-called gold ruble, which would be tied
to the country's gold reserves.
	   The Russian government has allowed the U.S. dollar and other
currencies to circulate freely since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and Russia now has more dollars in its economy than any
country besides the United States, according to U.S. officials.
	   It's not yet clear if the new proposals will be approved. They
are designed to help the government maintain its own hard currency
reserves, and if implemented, would greatly restrict the flow of
foreign currencies in the Russian economy.
	   Liberal economists have warned that such measures would
inevitably spur the black currency market and could do even more
damaged to the crumbling Russian economy.
	   Opening a Cabinet session Thursday, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said the government had already paid off some of its
long-running wage debts, including 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 87
million) owed to the military.
	   ``Thus, we have solved our two-month debt on military
salaries,'' he said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Primakov also said that the government on Thursday paid money to
defense industry workers, sent subsidies to the ailing coal
industry and allocated money in overdue students' stipends.
	   He didn't say where the government, which collected only half of
the planned amount of taxes last month, had found the funds.
	   Yeltsin, meanwhile, met with Gov. Eduard Rossel of the Urals
region of Sverdlovsk. The two men discussed Rossel's plan for a
ruble backed by gold reserves, but it was not clear whether the
president favored the idea.
	   The economic plan under consideration by the Cabinet sets an
ambitious spending program, including compensation to the poor for
steep price rises and generous subsidies to stagnant Russian
industries.
	   The blueprint, published in the respected business daily
Kommersant on Thursday, gives no clue as to where the money would
come from. The newspaper said the obvious answer would be the
generous printing of new money, which is increase inflation.
	   Hoping to avoid the further fall of the ruble, the plan calls
for tight currency controls. It would ban Russians from buying hard
currency or taking more than dlrs 500 abroad.
	   It also envisages a greater government role in determining the
rate of the ruble. The government would take into account Russia's
balance of payments, the size of the Central Bank's foreign
exchange and gold reserves, and the inflation rate.
	   The Russian Central Bank's reserves rose by dlrs 400 million in
the third week of September, and stood at dlrs 12.4 billion on
Sept. 25, the bank's press office said Thursday. The Central Bank
didn't explain the reason for the rise.
	   In order to prop up the ruble, the plan would also virtually ban
commercial banks from hard currency speculation, oblige exporters
to sell most of their hard-currency earnings at the
government-controlled rate and shut loopholes allowing them to keep
hard currency abroad.
	   The plan also calls for the nationalization of some Russian
commercial banks and using their assets to provide credits to
industries.
	   The document has been drafted by a group of economists led by
Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in
charge of economic strategy.

Prime minister optimistic that India will sign nuclear test ban
</HEADLINE>
treaty &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's prime minister expressed
optimism Thursday that talks with the United States would conclude
successfully and enable New Delhi to sign the nuclear test ban
treaty by September 1999.
	   Back home after a nine-day foreign tour which included his
speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said some doubts remained about the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, but New Delhi had accepted the substance of the agreement
by announcing a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing.
	   ``Regarding CTBT, I conveyed our preparedness to bring our
ongoing discussions with key interlocutors to a successful
conclusion so that the entry into force of the CTBT is not delayed
beyond September 1999,'' Vajpayee said of his U.N. visit in a
statement.
	   He did not name the ``key interlocutors,'' but the phrase has
often been used by officials in recent months to refer to the
high-level U.S. delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, who has held a series of discussions with Indian
negotiator Jaswant Singh.
	   The United States wants India and Pakistan to sign the CTBT and
take steps toward reconciliation to end their bitter 50-year
rivalry.
	   The talks between Talbott and Singh began as a damage-control
exercise after India tested five nuclear devices at an underground
desert site in May, provoking rival tests by Pakistan and raising
fears of a nuclear war in South Asia. Washington imposed economic
sanctions against both nations.
	   ``I reiterated our commitment to universal and nondiscriminatory
global nuclear disarmament and our earnest desire to work with all
other countries, particularly the nuclear weapon states, to
eliminate this category of weapons of mass destruction,'' Vajpayee
said.
	   The CTBT must be signed and ratified by 44 countries with
nuclear powers before it can go into effect. Forty-one of those 44
states have signed: India, Pakistan and North Korea have not. Of
those 41 signatories, 10 have ratified the treaty: Australia,
Austria, Brazil, Congo, France, Germany, Japan, Peru, Slovakia, and
Britain.
	   The slow movement in the discussions on the CTBT is believed to
be the main reason for the postponement this week of a visit by
U.S. President Bill Clinton planned for November.
	   But chances for progress in the Talbott-Singh talks have
increased in recent days following steps taken by the United
States, India and Pakistan.
	   On Tuesday, U.S. lawmakers agreed to give Clinton the power to
lift some sanctions against India and Pakistan, flexibility he had
said he needed in order to negotiate with the two countries about
their nuclear policy.
	   In an address to the U.N. General Assembly last week, Pakistani
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said his country was ready to adhere to
the test ban treaty if India did.
	   On Thursday, Vajpayee reported substantial progress in his
discussions with Sharif in New York, where the two leaders met for
two hours.
	   ``I believe a new beginning has been made in our relations with
Pakistan,'' he said in the statement.

Trial to oust Jehovah's Witnesses postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A civil trial to prohibit the activities of the
Jehovah's Witnesses in Russia has been adjourned until November, a
representative of the denomination said Thursday.
	   The trial opened Tuesday, after the Moscow city prosecutor filed
a suit against the Jehovah's Witnesses under a religion law passed
last year.
	   The accusations include charges that the group destroyed
families and encouraged its followers to refuse medical assistance,
said Yaroslav Sivulsky, the public affairs representative for the
Jehovah's Witnesses.
	   ``These are absurd accusations; there is no evidence. It's
typical religious intolerance,'' Sivulsky said.
	   He added that the court case was an attempt to sway Russia's
official policy against the Jehovah's Witnesses.
	   Sivulsky said that the group had made a series of petitions at
the court session Tuesday, including a request that the Moscow city
Department of Justice be a party to the case. The department
registers religious organizations in the capital.
	   The request was accepted.
	   ``They must declare their position in writing, because until now
there have been no documents from their side,'' Sivulsky said.
	   The law on religion passed last year enshrines the Russian
Orthodox Church as the country's predominant religion and curtails
the rights of many other churches.
	   Jehovah's Witnesses claim to be the fifth largest Christian
group in Russia.
	   Russian investigators have launched four separate criminal cases
against the Jehovah's Witnesses, and all have been dropped for lack
of evidence, Sivulsky said.

Palestinians arrest man linked to Hamas bomb factory

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence said Thursday
they have arrested a Hamas activist and former chemistry student
who stashed nearly a ton of explosives in his home right next to
Palestinian police headquarters on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   In the Israeli-controlled center of Hebron, meanwhile, troops
enforced a curfew imposed after an assailant, apparently a
Palestinian, threw two hand grenades at Israeli troops Wednesday,
injuring 11 soldiers and 11 Palestinian passers-by.
	   Israeli soldiers also sealed the Palestinian-run parts of town,
barring Palestinians from entering or leaving. Hebron is home to
450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians.
	   The assailant had escaped into the Palestinian-controlled
sector, apparently after being shot in the leg by an Israeli
soldier. Israel filed a sharp protest with the Palestinian
Authority, saying it must do more to catch the fugitive.
	   Coming amid U.S. efforts to conclude agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the attack boosted Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is not cracking down hard enough on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not hand over more West Bank land
until the Palestinians rein in militants.
	   The Hamas bomb factory was located in a two-story home just
several yards from Palestinian police headquarters, a fortress-like
building on a hill on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   During a raid Monday, some 800 kilos of explosives were seized
and a resident of the building, Hisham Sharabati, was arrested, a
Palestinian intelligence official said Thursday.
	   Sharabati is a former chemistry student who spent 10 months in
an Israeli jail, said his father Hamdan. The elder Sharabati denied
that his son had hidden explosives in the ground-floor storage
area. Hamdan Sharabati said his son sold cosmetics and stored some
of the materials used in making the merchandise in the house.
	   Sharabati's brother, Adel, was briefly detained for questioning,
but released.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
following renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to
carry out suicide bombings in retaliation for the killing of two
Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   Over the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which ended at sundown
Wednesday, Israel had sealed its borders with the West Bank and
Gaza Strip to prevent possible violence. The closure was gradually
eased on Thursday to allow several thousand Palestinians to return
to jobs in Israel.
	   Also Thursday, Netanyahu briefed his Cabinet on his meetings in
the United States with Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton
earlier this week.
	   Israeli and U.S. officials have been upbeat, suggesting that
Israel and the Palestinians had basically resolved their
differences on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that some
differences remained. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington, said one point of contention was
whether Palestinian police could enter the nature reserve.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. envoy Dennis
Ross are to return to the region Tuesday to prepare another Mideast
summit in Washington in mid-October, Palestinian negotiators said.

China bans poultry from Australia's New South Wales
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hoping to avoid an outbreak of a disease that
could threaten poultry farms, China on Thursday banned imports of
birds and poultry from an Australian state.
	   The ban, announced by Chinese quarantine officials, follows the
discovery last month of a virulent strain of Newcastle disease on
two poultry farms in Australia's New South Wales state.
	   Imports of all bird and poultry products are prohibited under
the ban issued by China's State Bureau of Exit-Entry Inspection and
Quarantine, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The bureau ordered local quarantine inspectors to conduct
``rigid and strict inspection on ships, airplanes and trains
entering China,'' Xinhua reported.
	   China's own poultry farms were suspected last year of being the
source of an outbreak of a deadly bird flu that infected 18 people
in neighboring Hong Kong, six of whom died.
	   Although the strain of Newcastle disease in Australia is not
believed to pose a risk to humans, it quickly works through poultry
flocks. Some 1,200 chickens died on the two New South Wales farms
before quarantine officials confirmed the outbreak.

Activists protest human rights violations in Southeast Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Human rights activists marched to five
Southeast Asian embassies in Bangkok Thursday to protest what they
say are increasing human rights violations in the region.
	   With banners reading ``Freedom, Justice and Reform'' written in
five languages, about two dozen marchers descended on the embassies
of Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.
	   ``The madness, Dr. Mahathir, why?'' and `` Dr. Mahathir, we
question your justice,'' read two of the banners, referring to
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir's deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, was fired early last month and
arrested 18 days later on charges of sexual misconduct and
corruption, which he has called politically motivated. Police have
broken up demonstrations by supporters of Anwar's demands for
political reform.
	   The marchers submitted petitions to the five ambassadors
expressing their concerns, particularly about the growing tensions
in Malaysia and Myanmar.
	   Since May, Myanmar's military government has arrested more than
900 members of the democratic opposition led by Nobel Peace
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   ``There have been continued violations of people's rights for
social and political issues and the situations are more severe in
certain countries,'' said Debbie Stothard, an activist leader.
	   She said police brutality and continued harassment of protesters
in Malaysia were frightening.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government convened Thursday to discuss a plan
that would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other
hard currencies and greatly increase the number of rubles in
circulation.
	   President Boris Yeltsin discussed the plan with a visiting
regional governor, who proposed banning the free circulation of the
dollar and introducing a so-called gold ruble, which would be tied
to the country's gold reserves.
	   The Russian government has allowed the U.S. dollar and other
currencies to circulate freely since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and Russia now has more dollars in its economy than any
country besides the United States, according to U.S. officials.
	   It's not yet clear if the new proposals will be approved. They
are designed to help the government maintain its own hard currency
reserves, and if implemented, would greatly restrict the flow of
foreign currencies in the Russian economy.
	   Liberal economists have warned that such measures would
inevitably spur the black currency market and could do even more
damage to the crumbling Russian economy.
	   Opening a Cabinet session Thursday, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said the government had already paid off some of its
long-running wage debts, including 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 87
million) owed to the military.
	   ``Thus, we have solved our two-month debt on military
salaries,'' he said, according to Russian news agencies.
	   Primakov also said that the government on Thursday paid money to
defense industry workers, sent subsidies to the ailing coal
industry and allocated money in overdue students' stipends.
	   He didn't say where the government, which collected only half of
the planned amount of taxes last month, had found the funds.
	   Yeltsin, meanwhile, met with Gov. Eduard Rossel of the Urals
region of Sverdlovsk. The two men discussed Rossel's plan for a
ruble backed by gold reserves, but it was not clear whether the
president favored the idea.
	   The economic plan under consideration by the Cabinet sets an
ambitious spending program, including compensation to the poor for
steep price rises and generous subsidies to stagnant Russian
industries.
	   The blueprint, published in the respected business daily
Kommersant on Thursday, gives no clue as to where the money would
come from. The newspaper said the obvious answer would be the
generous printing of new money, which would increase inflation.
	   Hoping to avoid the further fall of the ruble, the plan calls
for tight currency controls. It would ban Russians from buying hard
currency or taking more than dlrs 500 abroad.
	   It also envisages a greater government role in determining the
ruble's exchange rate. The government would take into account
Russia's balance of payments, the size of the Central Bank's
foreign exchange and gold reserves, and the inflation rate.
	   The Russian Central Bank's reserves rose by dlrs 400 million in
the third week of September, and stood at dlrs 12.4 billion on
Sept. 25, the bank's press office said Thursday. The Central Bank
didn't explain the reason for the rise.
	   In order to prop up the ruble, the plan would also virtually ban
commercial banks from hard currency speculation, oblige exporters
to sell most of their hard-currency earnings at the
government-controlled rate and shut loopholes allowing them to keep
hard currency abroad.
	   The plan also calls for the nationalization of some Russian
commercial banks and using their assets to provide credits to
industries.
	   The document has been drafted by a group of economists led by
Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in
charge of economic strategy.

Hungarian minority party won't leave the Romanian government yet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Hungarian minority party said
Thursday it would postpone a decision on whether to leave the
Romanian government and the ruling coalition, a party spokeswoman
said.
	   The party had threatened to pull out unless a solution to a
political standoff over a Hungarian-language state university could
be found by Wednesday.
	   Late Wednesday the government compromised, saying it would set
up a Hungarian-German university called Petofi-Schiller. The
government asked the education minister to prepare a report by mid
November.
	   ``The leaders of the party put back their decision till
Saturday,'' said Veronica Sarkany, a spokeswoman for the Hungarian
party.
	   After a five-hour meeting behind closed doors, Hungarian party
executives said they would decide at a national meeting Saturday
whether to accept the government's offer or leave the government.
	   ``We appreciated the government decision and the fact that the
coalition proved it wanted to solve this crisis,'' said Hungarian
party leader Bela Marko on national radio.
	   The Union of Democratic Hungarians which represents the
interests of Romania's 1.7 million Hungarians was promised the
university in 1996, but the government backed down after parliament
blocked the legislation to set it up.
	   Romanian lawmakers refer to bitter historical disputes and say
that European norms do not require the Hungar to have their own
state university. Transylvania, where most Hungarians live, has
changed hands over the centuries. There are a few thousand ethnic
Germans living in Romania.
	   Marko said earlier this week that the party would definitely
withdraw from the government and coalition if they didn't get their
Hungarian university.
	   In 1996, the coalition agreed to set up a Hungarian-language
university, but parliament's upper house refused to approve the
necessary modification to the existing education law.

Gadhafi says wont hand over suspects if they are tried in air base

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libya will not hand over two suspects in the
Lockerbie bombing for trial in a former U.S. air base in the
Netherlands because it fears they may be kidnapped by the United
States, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said.
	   ``America is able, in case the trial is held in an American
base, to kidnap the suspects and take them to America,'' the Libyan
leader said Wednesday night. His comments were carried by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency on Thursday.
	   ``Libya will not hand over the two suspects in the Lockerbie
case for trial in Holland if the American-British-Dutch insistence
to hold the trial in a military base in Holland continues,'' MENA
quoted Gadhafi as saying.
	   The Dutch and British governments on Sept. 18 signed an
agreement to use Camp Zeist, 32 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
the Dutch capital, Amsterdam, for the proposed trial of the two
Libyans. Soesterberg was a U.S. Air Force base from 1954 to 1993.
	   Libya has accepted a compromise proposal by the U.S. and British
governments to try the suspects in the Netherlands by Scottish
judges under Scottish law. But it has demanded assurances for the
safety and handling of the two men.
	   Britain and the United States have rejected the Libyan demands.
	   A Libyan team is expected at U.N. headquarters this week to work
with the organization's top legal officer on clarifying questions
about the trial of the two Libyans.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions, that ban direct
flights to and from Libya, in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to
surrender the two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   Also Wednesday, Gadhafi presented 11 African leaders with medals
of honor in appreciation for violating the U.N. air embargo against
Libya, MENA said.
	   Four of the leaders were present at the ceremony in the northern
coastal town of Sirte.
	   They were presidents Ibrahim Bare Mainassara of Niger, Idriss
Deby of Chad, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Isaias Afwerki of
Eritrea, MENA said.
	   Medals were also received on behalf of presidents Omar el-Bashir
of Sudan, Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali, Yaya Jammeh of Gambia,
Laurent Kabila of Congo, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Blaise Campaore
of Burkina Faso and Ange-Felix Patasse of the Central African
Republic.
	   All the 11 African leaders have in the past three months flown
to Libya in violation of the air embargo.
	   The Organization of African Unity announced in June that it
would no longer abide by the air embargo.
	   OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim also received a medal
Wednesday ``for his role in serving the causes of justice and peace
in Africa,'' MENA said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. and
one of Japan's largest lenders, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., said
Thursday they will join forces to set up a Tokyo-based mutual fund
business.
	   The planned 3 billion yen (dlrs 22 million) venture is the
latest move by an American financial powerhouse to expand in Japan,
but marks the first such capital tie-up with a top-ranked Japanese
bank.
	   Under the agreement, the two banks will split the management and
ownership of the new venture, which will develop and market
investment trusts _ a kind of mutual fund _ in Japan.
	   Through DKB's nationwide retail network of 340 branch offices,
the deal gives J.P. Morgan, America's fourth-largest bank, access
to an estimated dlrs 9 trillion pool of personal financial assets
held by Japanese savers and investors.
	   ``This partnership is an important step for us as we continue to
expand our global customer reach through strategic partnerships
with world-class providers like DKB,'' said Keith Schappert,
president of J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., the bank's
fund management subsidiary.
	   J.P. Morgan's existing asset management operations in Japan
focus solely on institutional clients.
	   For DKB, it represents an opportunity to sharpen asset
management skills as Japan's financial industry undergoes a
sweeping deregulation effort known as the ``Big Bang,'' a set of
reforms designed to spur competition between banks, brokers and
insurers.
	   ``Both J.P. Morgan Investment Management and our bank share the
same vision of the importance of the asset management business in
Japan and on the opportunities presented by Japan's Big Bang,''
Taira Hosaka, a DKB senior managing director, said in a statement.
	   While J.P. Morgan and DKB said their alliance would be limited
to investment management, Japan's Nihon Keizai financial daily
reported Thursday that the venture may eventually expand into areas
such as investment banking _ the lucrative business of underwriting
new stocks and bonds for companies.
	   The two companies said the new fund retailing venture could be
set up as soon as early next year once it has been granted a
license to operate.
	   J.P. Morgan joins a growing list of American financial giants
with plans to dramatically expand their presence in Japan.
	   In June, New York-based Travelers Group Inc. paid dlrs 1.6
billion for a controlling stake in Nikko Securities Co., the
country's third-largest brokerage house. A month later, Prudential
Insurance Co. and Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. agreed to set up a
joint investment trust company in Japan.
	   Merrill Lynch and Co. hired 2,100 former employees of the failed
Yamaichi Securities Co. in February to staff more than 30 Japanese
branch offices. Fidelity Investments Co. also started to establish
a nationwide retail network in Japan earlier this year.
	   The agreement between J.P. Morgan and DKB was announced after
the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Earlier Thursday, DKB had denied local media reports that an
agreement had been reached, saying talks were still under way.
Shares of the bank sank almost 12 percent, closing at 505 yen (dlrs
3.70).

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Bangkok's city government announced
Thursday it is opening a center to attract and assist foreign
investors interested in opening businesses in the Thai capital.
	   ``As a direct result of the unprecedented economic turmoil
throughout the Southeast Asian region, it is necessary to once gain
build confidence in Thailand,'' the city's statement said.
	   Thailand is mired in its worst economic crisis in modern times.
Investment has fallen off, although some companies, attracted by
lower prices for real estate, products and services because of the
bad economy, have chosen to invest or expand their operations in
Thailand.
	   The new center is similar to the national government's Board of
Investment, which assists foreign investors in the country, except
that is hopes to steer investment to the capital.
	   The national government, however, is trying to steer more
investment to the outer provinces to create a better distribution
of wealth.
	   Called Bangkok ONE, the new office is intended as a one-stop
service center to provide information, help coordinate with
government agencies and offer legal and financial advice, a press
release from the city administration said.
	   The center will also have computers, Internet access, faxes and
other communications and office services available for investors.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers voted
Thursday on whether to give up their right to strike for 10 years
as part of a management recovery plan that would allow Asia's
oldest carrier to reopen.
	   It was the second time in 11 days that the 6,700 members of
PAL's largest union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they
rejected the proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving
much of the country without air service.
	   Members were given until Friday noon to vote, but counting could
begin Thursday night if voting is completed earlier, said Labor
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma.
	   Many union members believed the government would not allow the
57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Under the plan, workers would suspend their collective
bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent
share of the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights and expose them to management abuses.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Major Year 2000 glitches that might
cripple an Asian stock exchange could see the Australian Stock
Exchange host regional companies temporarily, the exchange's chief
said Thursday.
	   Australian Stock Exchange managing director and chief executive
Richard Humphry said the exchange was looking at ways to fast-track
the processing needed to allow a company to temporarily list on the
local exchange in the event of a major technological problem
elsewhere.
	   ``This is a voluntary thing'' for affected companies, Humphry
told reporters.
	   ``But it means those companies could continue to trade if their
own markets happen to go off-line for whatever period.
	   ``The problem ... is it may be something that's just not a
24-hour glitch, it may be a significant failure that requires time
to fix.
	   ``It's really to allow those companies to survive.
	   ``We've already had an approach from an Indonesian company to
list with the Australian Stock Exchange, a significant one. And its
principally because of the current difficulties Indonesia is
experiencing,'' he said.
	   Humphry said such a scenario could see new arrivals to the
Australian Stock Exchange become dual-listed in their home markets
and here.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Thursday the Philippines has made a final decision to withdraw as
host of World Expo 2002 because of economic difficulties.
	   ``This expo will only expose us to debts,'' Estrada said in a
radio interview with station DZMM. ``My decision is final. It will
not push through.''
	   Estrada said the government would have to spend 6 billion pesos
(dlrs 135 million) to host the event, money that could be better
used on projects that would ease poverty.
	   He said he has studied cases of several other countries that
failed to recoup their expenses in hosting the exposition,
including this year's host, Portugal.
	   ``We cannot afford to lose money,'' he added.
	   Estrada had earlier said he will drop the hosting of the event
but reconsidered the decision a few days later when some businesses
proposed that private companies pay for the costs.
	   Several businessmen and former tourism secretary Mina Gabor were
against the withdrawal, saying it could damage the image of the
Philippines. Gabor lobbied for the Philippines to win in June over
Australia to host the exposition.
	   Gabor said at least 3.7 million tourists would be expected to
attend the exposition. About 60 countries were expected to
participate.
	   Former President Fidel Ramos also urged Estrada to reconsider
and offered to help raise funds, officials said.
	   Estrada said he preferred to use the money for agriculture to
build roads and irrigation dams and for mass housing projects.
	   He has said the event may result in useless and costly
structures similar to ones built at a special economic zone north
of Manila for a trade exposition in June.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd. said
Thursday it has sold its Tokyo headquarters building and the land
underneath it to a group company.
	   The real estate was sold Wednesday to Chobuil Corp. for 96.35
billion yen (dlrs 708 million), LTCB said. The bank said it will
post a 51.91 billion yen (dlrs 381 million) profit from the sale.
	   LTCB is at the center of political debate over whether to use
taxpayers' money to help clean up the Japanese banking industry's
mounting bad debt problem.
	   Earlier this week, two lending affiliates of the troubled LTCB
filed for bankruptcy.
	   But the bank said the sale was part of the bank's
previously-announced restructuring plan, which included the sale of
assets. As a result, there is no change to LTCB's earnings
forecast, the bank said.
	   After the sale, LTCB will rent the property from Chobuil, a real
estate company in which LTCB has a minority ownership stake.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and J.P. Morgan
and Co. of the United States have reached a basic agreement to
jointly set up an investment-trust company here by the year's end,
Japanese newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The deal marks the first capital tie-up between a large Japanese
commercial bank and a foreign financial institution, the Nihon
Keizai business daily said in a front-page story.
	   The official announcement is expected later Thursday, newspaper
reports said.
	   Under the agreement, the 50-50 venture between the DKB and J.P.
Morgan groups will have an initial capitalization of 3-5 billion
yen (dlrs 22-37 million), they said.
	   The entity will create and manage investment trusts _ Japan's
version of mutual funds. The funds will be sold to Japanese
consumers by DKB and other financial companies, the reports said.
	   DKB and J.P. Morgan may eventually expand the scope of their
alliance to include investment banking _ the lucrative business of
underwriting new stocks and bonds for companies, the newspapers
said.
	   In the past, foreign financial companies have had difficulty
setting up operations in Japan and buying out domestic rivals. But
the Japanese government has begun to remove regulations that have
sheltered domestic banks, brokers and insurers from competition in
sweeping deregulation dubbed the ``Big Bang.''
	   Japanese institutions are now rushing to form alliances with
each other and with foreign financial giants as part of their
efforts to stay competitive.

Sri Lankan military admits loss of town to Tamil rebels
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's military conceded Thursday
that Tamil Tiger guerrillas have captured Kilinochchi, one of the
largest towns in the war-ravaged north, in a three-day battle which
left nearly 1,200 dead on both sides.
	   ``We have pulled back from Kilinochchi. We have vacated the
town,'' said Brigadier Sunil Tennekoon, the military's spokesman.
	   Government soldiers have formed a new defensive line near the
town of Paranthan, about three kilometers (two miles) north of
Kilinochchi, Tennekoon said.
	   The rebel assault, the biggest battle in more than two years,
began on Sunday and ended Tuesday. Kilinochchi had previously been
controlled by the Tamil guerrillas from 1990 until the military
captured it in November 1996.
	   Civilians fled the town when fighting heightened two years ago.
It was not clear how many people lived in the town since no census
has been done in nearly two decades.
	   But the military claimed that the capture of the smaller town of
Mankulam, 30 kilometers (18 miles) to the south, on Tuesday was
militarily more important.
	   Rebels dug in behind bunkers had fiercely resisted the onslaught
on Mankulam for more than a year, but finally withdrew from the
battered town 245 kilometers (150 miles) north of the capital
Colombo as government troops encircled it.
	   Mankulam and Kilinochchi lie along a strategic highway that
would link the isolated military controlled northern town of
Jaffna, with the government-held south of the Indian Ocean island.
Proceeding slowly, the military has wrested two-thirds of the
highway from the rebels since May 1997.
	   Tennekoon said 535 soldiers were killed, 443 at Kilinochchi and
92 at Mankulam, and another 400 wounded. Ten more were missing.
	   The guerrillas handed over 600 bodies on Wednesday, saying they
were those of soldiers, to the International Committee of the Red
Cross, but the army says only 400 of those were of government
troops.
	   The military has not suffered such casualties since 1996, when
1,240 soldiers were killed when rebels overran a garrison at
Mullaittivu, 280 kilometers (175 miles) north of Colombo.
	   The military's admitted death toll was lower than the figure of
915 soldiers which journalists had calculated from Red Cross
reports, hospital accounts and earlier sketchy reports from the
defense ministry.
	   The military claims to have killed 620 rebels, 520 at
Kilinochchi and at least 100 at Mankulam. Thirty-six rebel bodies
recovered by the army were to be handed over to the Red Cross late
Thursday. More than 150 of those killed were women rebel fighters,
Tennekoon said.
	   Another 26 guerrillas, some of them teenagers as young as 15,
surrendered at Mankulam, he said.
	   The total death toll was still uncertain on Thursday.
Journalists haven't been allowed near the fighting, and civilians
and humanitarian organizations are also staying away.
	   Complete control of the highway could be a turning point in the
protracted war. It would open a land route to the Jaffna peninsula,
a former rebel stronghold in the north that the army captured two
years ago. For now, the government is relying on expensive air and
sea deliveries of food and other commodities to Jaffna's
half-million residents.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that Tamils are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983.

Japanese stocks close at 12-year lows, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon bond and currency prices,
details on trading thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The latest bad news about Japan's economy and
worries about an overnight drop on Wall Street sent Japanese share
prices to new 12-year lows Thursday. The dollar advanced against
the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues fell
209.27 points, or 1.56 percent, closing at 13,197.12 _ the second
straight day of lows not seen since February 1986. On Wednesday,
the Nikkei had lost 415.04 points, or 3 percent.
	   ``The outlook is still very tough,'' said Dhia Amir, a senior
institutional sales trader at Nomura Securities Co.
	   After a brief early rally, stocks fell as dismay set in about
the results of the latest quarterly Bank of Japan survey of
business sentiment, traders said.
	   The report, released just before the start of trading Thursday,
showed a key business condition diffusion index for big
manufacturers sank to a worse-than-expected minus 51, down from
minus 38 in the previous survey in June.
	   Investors also sold off shares following Wall Street's dip
overnight, traders said.
	   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 237.90
points, or 3 percent, to 7,842.62 on worries that interest rates
have not been lowered enough to boost flagging corporate profit
growth.
	   In Tokyo, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 27.85
points, or 2.61 percent, to 1,015.72. It had declined 19.33 points,
or 1.82 percent, the previous day.
	   Shares of banks, electronics exporters and steelmakers were
among the biggest losers.
	   Retreats exceeded gains 1,020 to 186, with 94 issues closing
unchanged. An estimated 600 million shares changed hands on the
first section, up from 565 million the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar rose against the yen in reaction to the
disappointing results of the Bank of Japan survey, traders said.
	   In late afternoon, it was trading at 136.28 yen, up 0.56 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of
136.75 yen overnight. It traded as low as 135.75 yen and as high as
136.90 yen.
	   Selling of yen for dollars picked up pace after the Nikkei stock
average looked like it might crash through the psychologically
important level of 13,000 points in early afternoon trading,
traders said.
	   The Nikkei, which sank as low as 13,018.75 Thursday before
recovering slightly, has not traded below 13,000 since January
1986.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.720 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.765
percent, driving its price up to 109.79 yen from 109.35 yen.

	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Explosives thrown out of a passing
car damaged police headquarters in the Tajik capital on Thursday,
shattering windows but causing no casualties.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition leaders on Thursday
hailed Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's announcement that he will
resign in a month and said his departure can't come soon enough.
	   ``He should not prolong his time in office,'' said Jozef
Moravcik, who was prime minister for six months in 1994 and now is
a top representative of the opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   Meciar, Slovakia's authoritarian ruler for virtually its entire
six years of independence, said in an emotional TV appearance
Wednesday night that he would quit when the new Parliament convenes
Oct. 29.
	   In his first public comments since parliamentary elections last
Friday and Saturday, he said on a talk show on state TV that he
would not serve in the new legislature or seek any government
office. But he left open whether he would step down as chairman of
the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
	   He also sang an impromptu farewell song to Slovaks with tears in
his eyes: ``God be with you, I did not hurt any of you.''
	   His ouster as premier was forced by last week's national
elections, in which his governing party was outpolled by opposition
parties. But the opposition and some analysts had expected that the
56-year-old Meciar, who has been widely criticized for
anti-democratic practices, might fight to cling to power.
	   Meciar's party received 27 percent of the vote, more than any
other party. But an opposition alliance led by the Slovak
Democratic Coalition won enough votes to form a strong governing
majority.
	   Despite announcing his departure, Meciar remained defiant,
criticizing the opposition and defending his record.
	   ``What could I have offered as premier? Everything that is in
me: my knowledge, strength, my skills as an organizer and
negotiator,'' he said. ``Yes, I was artful. Sometimes I was even
foxy. I used ruses and tactics,'' he said.
	   ``However, what should I have done as premier of a small
nation?'' he added, saying he stood up to big powers such as the
United States and Germany.
	   NATO and the European Union, wary of Meciar's undemocratic
methods, bypassed Slovakia for consideration for early membership.
	   ``We have not been against integration, we have been against
Slovakia being dominated,'' Meciar said.
	   He predicted that inflation will now rise, development will be
inhibited and the economy will grow unstable.
	   ``I think that it was a very confused performance,'' said
Moravcik. ``His psychological state was presented completely. And
his state was like this for the past four years. He wasn't quite
normal.''
	   Kalman Petocz, a top representative of the Hungarian Coalition
Party, which also is in the opposition alliance, hailed Meciar's
resignation but said he should have admitted defeat more
gracefully.
	   ``He cried, sang and talked,'' Petocz said. ``He could have done
it (resigned) in a more cultural and civilized way.''

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ A Lahore High Court judge who is hearing
corruption charges against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's
husband stepped down on Thursday, saying he was ''too angry'' at
the accused to be fair.
	   Justice Faqir Mohammed Kokar, one of two judges hearing the
case, withdrew, saying accusations leveled against him by Ms.
Bhutto's husband Asif Ali Zardari had angered him.
	   ''I am too angry and I don't think I can be fair,'' Kokar said.
A government official will appoint another judge.
	   Previously Zardari had said one of the two judges hearing his
case had made a deal with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to convict
him. Zardari did not name the judge.
	   Zardari repeated his accusations when he appeared in court
Thursday in the eastern Punjab capital of Lahore.
	   ``You people will not do justice,'' he told the court.
	   Zardari faces several charges of corruption involving alleged
wrongdoings and abuse of power during his wife's last term in
office.
	   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed from power in 1996 on
charges of widespread corruption, economic mismanagement and abuse
of power.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ A truck driver was killed and his
passenger injured in a land mine explosion in southern Armenia,
security officials said Thursday.
	   The truck hit the mine Wednesday in the village of Nuvady in the
Syunik region, near Armenia's border with Azerbaijan and Iran,
according to the regional press service of the Interior and
Security Ministries.
	   The region is strewn with mines laid during the six-year
conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, which ended with a
cease-fire in 1994. The ethnic Armenian-majority enclave declared
independence from Azerbaijan in 1991; Azerbaijan considers it a
rebel province supported illegally by Armenia.
	   Two schoolchildren were killed in a land mine explosion in the
region on Sept. 21, and five children were injured in another land
mine blast on Monday.

Total corporate half-year profits down 80 percent in Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Hit by the Asian economic crisis, combined
profits for 190 listed Singapore companies in the latest half-year
plummeted by 80 percent, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Their combined profits for the six months ended June 30 shrank
to 660 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 390 million) from 3.26
billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 1.93 billion) in the same period
last year, before the financial crisis swept through Asia, The
Straits Times said.
	   In a summary after the period for reporting first-half earnings
ended Wednesday, the newspaper said 133 of the companies had
managed to post interim profits totaling 1.98 billion Singapore
dollars (dlrs 1.17 billion).
	   But losses totaled 1.32 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 781
million) for the other 57, it added.
	   The newspaper also noted that about 62 percent of the 133
profitable companies saw their profits fall as regional turmoil and
recessions in neighboring countries began to pinch in Singapore,
which relies heavily on trade with other Asian countries.
	   Domestic spending has slumped, local property prices continue to
fall, and banks are facing increasing numbers of non-performing
loans, the report said.
	   Hardest hit have been the electronics industry _ considered the
basis of Singapore's manufacturing sector, the property market, and
banks strapped with bad regional loans.
	   Normally a strong performer, national shipping carrier Neptune
Orient Lines suffered losses of 241 million Singapore dollars (dlrs
143 million), the largest of any local company this reporting
season.
	   High-tech IPC Corp. chalked up a 221 million Singapore dollar
(dlrs 131 million) loss for the half-year after it sold off its
struggling personal computer business.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Human rights activists marched to five
Southeast Asian embassies in Bangkok Thursday to protest what they
say are increasing human rights violations in the region.   With
banners reading ``Freedom, Justice and Reform'' written in five
languages, about two dozen marchers descended on the embassies of
Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.
	   ``The madness, Dr. Mahathir, why?'' and `` Dr. Mahathir, we
question your justice,'' read two of the banners, referring to
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir's deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, was fired early last month and
arrested 18 days later on charges of sexual misconduct and
corruption, which he has called politically motivated. Police have
broken up demonstrations by supporters of Anwar's demands for
political reform.
	   The marchers submitted petitions to the five ambassadors
expressing their concerns, particularly about the growing tensions
in Malaysia and Myanmar.
	   Since May, Myanmar's military government has arrested more than
900 members of the democratic opposition led by Nobel Peace
laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   ``There have been continued violations of people's rights for
social and political issues and the situations are more severe in
certain countries,'' said Debbie Stothard, an activist leader.
	   She said police brutality and continued harassment of protesters
in Malaysia were frightening.
	   Also Thursday, Forum-Asia, a regional human rights group, issued
an open letter to Mahathir urging him to immediately release Anwar
and his supporters from detention.
	   The group also called on Malaysia's government to abolish the
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite imprisonment without
trial.
	   ``The continued harassment and intimidation of Mr. Anwar's
supporters, including his wife and lawyers, the families of those
arrested, the political parties, aggravates the tension, creating a
climate of fear among the people,'' Forum-Asia said.

Levi workers go on strike after company announces closure plans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A strike closed down the Belgian units
of bluejeans giant Levi Strauss Thursday, two days after the U.S.
company announced three Belgian plants would be eliminated as part
of a European restructuring plan.
	   Company officials said production facilities in Belgium and
France were singled out because of high labor costs and
overcapacity.
	   Unions said they would keep the factories closed for the rest of
the week to protest the expected loss of almost 1,000 jobs in
Belgium.
	   ``The situation is at the moment that employees are not working,
there is nobody on sight,'' said Levi spokesman Mark Elliott.
	   A fourth Levi's facility, which is not threatened by
restructuring plans, was also hit by labor action Thursday in a
show of solidarity with the other Levi's workers.
	   Meanwhile, Elliot said that work has continued without any
interruption in Levi's French factories.
	   About 7,500 of the company's 30,000 employees are based in
Europe. The layoffs will represent about 20 percent of the
company's European staff.
	   Levi Strauss and Co. has said it was forced to restructure
because of falling demand for denim jeans.

2 FBI agents injured in Kenyan traffic accident, lose gun
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Two FBI agents were slightly injured in a
traffic accident in Kenya and in the confusion lost a pistol and
walkie-talkie, police said Thursday.
	   A minivan ran a red light at a downtown intersection Wednesday,
ramming the right side of the agents' rented car, said police
spokesman Emmanuel Mwachiti.
	   Agents Bryant Ling and Mark Allan were in the back seat of the
car. They were taken to Nairobi Hospital where Allan was admitted
with bruises on various parts of his body, and Ling was treated and
released, Mwachiti said. The agents' Kenyan driver was treated for
a knee injury.
	   The East African Standard newspaper said the agents lost two
pistols, but Mwachiti said police were aware of only one handgun
and a walkie-talkie.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy referred all questions to the
police, ``who are investigating the accident.''
	   FBI agents have been in Kenya to investigate the Aug. 7
terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy. The blast killed 248 people,
including 12 Americans.
	   Another explosion almost at the same time in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania killed 11 people, all of them Africans.

Dalai Lama not linked with CIA, his government says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The Dalai Lama's administration
acknowledged Thursday its movement received dlrs 1.7 million a year
in the 1960s from the CIA, but denied reports that the Tibetan
leader benefited personally from his annual subsidy of dlrs
180,000.
	   ``Though the CIA was involved in the early guerrilla operations
waged by Tibetan freedom fighters, the Central Tibetan
Administration would like to categorically state that there was no
direct connection between the CIA and His Holiness the Dalai
Lama,'' the Tibetan government-in-exile said in a statement.
	   The statement was faxed to The Associated Press from the
northern Indian town of Dharamsala, where the Tibetan
administration has been based for four decades.
	   The funds allocated for the resistance movement were spent on
training of volunteers and guerrilla operations against the
Chinese, and the subsidy earmarked for the Dalai Lama was spent on
setting up offices in Geneva and New York and international
lobbying activities, the statement said.
	   The decade-long covert program to support the Tibetan
independence movement was part of the CIA's worldwide effort to
undermine Communist governments, particularly in the Soviet Union
and China, newspaper reports said last month.
	   The statement said all financial transactions were handled by
Gyalo Thondup, the Dalai Lama's elder brother, who did not keep the
spiritual leader informed of such activities because of his young
age at the time and religious sensibilities.
	   ``Even the CIA and other involved intelligence authorities were
denied meetings with ... (the Dalai Lama) despite their repeated
requests,'' the statement added.
	   According to a Los Angeles Times report last month based on
declassified papers, the CIA helped support Tibetan guerrillas in
Nepal, a military training site in Colorado, Tibetan causes in New
York and Geneva, education for Tibetan operatives at Cornell
University, and supplies for reconnaissance teams.
	   By 1968, the CIA dropped its training programs inside the United
States and cut the program's budget to below dlrs 1.2 million a
year, the Times said. The support finally ended in the early 1970s
after the Nixon administration's diplomatic opening to China.
	   In recent years, Congress has approved about dlrs 2 million
annually in funding for Tibetan exiles in India. Congress also has
urged the Clinton administration to spend another dlrs 2 million
for democracy activities among Tibetans, the newspaper said.
	   The Dalai Lama, 63, a revered spiritual leader both in his
Himalayan homeland and in Western nations, fled Tibet in 1959 after
a failed uprising against Chinese military rule, which began in
1950.

Masked men kill 73 in attack on `black magic' in East Java
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of masked murderers has killed
at least 73 people suspected of practicing ``black magic'' in
eastern Java in the last two months, security officials said
Thursday.
	   Police said there had been such killings almost daily since
early August in the regency of Banyuwangi, about 830 kilometers
(518 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   In the latest attacks, seven villagers accused of dabbling in
black magic were murdered Tuesday and Wednesday nights, a military
officer said.
	   He said the killers, wearing ninja-like black dress and masks,
attacked their victims at night. Some were found dead with their
throats cut, he added.
	   Speaking to The Associated Press by telephone, on condition of
anonymity, two officers said a number of suspects have been
arrested, but so far the real motives of the killings were still
not clear.
	   They added, however, that since the beginning, some witnesses
and neighbors had said the victims were suspected to be
practitioners of black magic.
	   News reports said Purnomo Sidik, regent of Banyuwangi, believed
the killings were conducted by a well-organized group that was paid
up to 1 million rupiah (dlrs 90) per victim.

Leopard sends 6 to hospital before stabbed to death with
</HEADLINE>
screwdriver &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A leopard mauled two
bicyclists near Kruger wild game park, then jumped onto a flat-bed
truck and slashed four passengers before the driver stabbed it
death with a screwdriver, news agencies reported Thursday.
	   The incident happened in the Northern Province village of
Hazyview shortly after dawn the day before.
	   ``The animal jumped out and attacked my brother Santos as he was
crossing a small stream.... It had him by the throat,'' Reason
Chauke, 28, told the Africa Eye News Service.
	   ``It all happened so quickly that I was shocked, but when he
started screaming, I picked up some large stones and started
pelting the leopard,'' he said. ``The next thing I knew was that it
had turned and attacked me.''
	   After attempting to drag Chauke away, the animal broke off the
attack and ran off. Minutes later, the truck pulled up, driver
Tinos Mkansi having spotting the bicycles and pools of blood.
	   ``I almost had a heart attack. The bloody animal leapt onto my
windscreen as I came to a halt,'' he said. ``It then jumped into
the back ... in the middle of my passengers,'' biting and slashing
in a frenzy.
	   Mkansi, 49, grabbed a screwdriver and stabbed the leopard
repeatedly til it collapsed. Then he drove the injured to Matikwana
Hospital.
	   ``I couldn't believe it and thought it was some kind of animal
trick,'' the South African Press Association quoted Mkansi as
saying. ``So I kicked it really hard a couple of times to make sure
it was really dead.''
	   Two injured passengers were treated for minor lacerations and
discharged, according to the national news agency. The others
sustained more serious injuries but were expected to survive.
	   Police spokesman Inspector James Ngoepe said rangers from the
Kruger Park would examine the leopard to see whether it had been
suffering from any disease.
	   The attack is the second one in two months near Kruger park. A
ranger was attacked and killed last August.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While international outrage grew at
reports of massacres of Kosovo civilians, ethnic Albanian leaders
and an international aid organization declared a day of mourning
Thursday in honor of a volunteer doctor killed in Kosovo.
	   Sheptim Robaj, an ethnic Albanian doctor working for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, died Wednesday of
injuries sustained when his vehicle hit a landmine.
	   The death highlighted the difficulties and dangers for aid
groups trying to help some of the estimated 275,000 Kosovo
residents driven from their homes this year by fighting between
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   ``The ICRC will suspend its activities throughout the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia as a mark of respect for Dr Sheptim Robaj,''
the Red Cross said in a statement Thursday.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova proclaimed Thursday a day
of mourning in Kosovo, in memory of the killed doctor.
	   Also Thursday, the U.N. Security Council and representatives of
the Contact Group of the five leading world powers were to hold an
emergency meeting at U.N. headquarters in New York, to discuss the
fighting between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo that has left hundreds dead.
	   On Wednesday, residents of the western village of Golubovac said
that Serbian forces surrounded a pocket of refugees there last
Saturday and singled out at least 13 men to kill. They said the
victims were already buried, but pointed to saucer-sized pools of
dried blood and empty cartridges in front of a fence where they
said the refugees were shot.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) to the north, including those of women and
children.
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are
among the most gruesome developments since the offensive began in
February.
	   Investigators for the International War Crimes Tribunal are in
Kosovo, but a tribunal spokesman in The Hague, Netherlands,
declined to discuss their work.
	   In another claim, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said late
Wednesday that Serb police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles
Tuesday in Vranic in southwestern Kosovo. The New York organization
said one of its researchers saw the bodies of four ethnic Albanian
men who had been killed, including one who was apparently executed
at close range and another whose face had mutilated.
	   ``The atrocities committed by the Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army are at the core of the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo
and must be stopped immediately,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of the group's Europe and Central Asia division.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence for
Kosovo, whose population is mostly ethnic Albanian.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed late
Wednesday that 18 more bodies had been found nearby in the area
around a third village, Glogovac. They said all showed clear signs
of torture and that three were shot in the back of the head. The
claim could not be confirmed, and it was possible it referred to
the Golubovac site.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanian accounts.
Both sides have been accused of massacres in Kosovo.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
retreat to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   In Tirana, capital of neighboring Albania, Interior Ministry
spokesman Artan Bizhga said Thursday fighting involving about 100
Serb soldiers took place 300 meters (yards) within Yugoslav
territory early Wednesday.
	   He said Albanian border guards also saw a low-flying military
helicopter, but claimed there was no shooting from the Albanian
side of the border.

It's now official: George Graham is Spurs manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ George Graham returned to London on Thursday as
the new manager of Tottenham, the fierce cross-town rival of his
former club Arsenal.
	   After weeks of speculation and negotiations, Graham left his job
as manager of Leeds to take over at struggling Spurs.
	   The appointmenet was announced by Tottenham in a statement to
the London stock exchange.
	   The 53-year-old Scot, who had been at Leeds for three seasons
but was eager to move back to London, reportedly signed a four-year
deal worth 6 million pounds (dlrs 10 million).
	   Graham succeeds Swiss coach Christian Gross, who was fired
nearly a month ago. David Pleat has served as caretaker manager
since then.
	   Graham will be in charge for Spurs' game at Derby on Saturday.
	   Tottenham, which flirted with relegation last season, currently
lies 13th in the 20-team table with nine points from seven games.
	   Graham's replacement at Leeds was not immediately announced. His
assistant, David O'Leary, Coventry manager Gordon Strachan and
Leicester boss Martin O'Neill have all been mentioned as possible
candidates.
	   Graham, a standout player with Arsenal in the early 1970s,
gained great success as a manager at Highbury, winning two league
championships before leaving under a cloud in 1995.
	   He served a one-year ban from soccer for taking a kickback from
a Norwegian agent over a transfer deal. He took the Leeds job after
the ban ended in the summer of '96.
	   Last season, Graham guided Leeds to fifth place in the Premier
League and a berth in the UEFA Cup. In his last game in charge of
Leeds, the club gained the UEFA Cup second round Tuesday by ousting
Maritimo of Portugal after a penalty shootout.
	   His move to Tottenham will spice up the rivalry between Spurs
and Arsenal even more than usual. In recent years, Tottenham
followers have been jealous of Arsenal's success, especially the
two league titles under Graham in 1989 and '91 and the Cup Winners
Cup triumph in '94.
	   The Gunners also won the league and FA Cup titles last season
under French coach Arsene Wenger. Spurs have not lifted the league
title since 1961 and the FA Cup since '91.
	   In newspaper interviews publised Thursday, Graham promised to
recreate the brand of soccer played under the legendary Spurs boss
Bill Nicholson in the 1960s.
	   ``I know what Spurs mean to the people,'' he said. ``I am not in
the business of tearing down monuments to past glories. I haven't
done it at Leeds. Nobody respects the legacy of Don Revie and his
magnificent football teams more than me.
	   ``I am a long-time admirer of the fantastic football produced
under Bill Nicholson. I am honoured even to be considered as a
successor. Let the fans be assured I know where they come from and
what they long for.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Two FBI agents were slightly injured in a

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan soldiers have located the
wreckage of a small plane that disappeared last week, but there was
no sign of the pilot or the four passengers, including a
high-ranking military officer, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The government-owned New Vision, citing a senior security
official, said the nine-seater twin-engine plane crashed into the
eastern slopes of the Rwenzori Mountains about 3,000 feet above sea
level, near Kisomoro, a trading town 270 kilometers (170 miles)
west of the capital Kampala.
	   The newspaper said it was feared the passengers may have been
abducted by Allied Democratic Forces rebels operating in the area.
	   Uganda has troops inside the neighboring Democratic Republic of
Congo trying to flush out the ADF rebels who have been carrying out
attacks against civilian and military targets in western Uganda.
	   The military source did not rule out the possibility that the
plane was shot down, although a military spokesman dismissed this
earlier in the week.
	   The military spokesman's office refused to comment Thursday on
the report.
	   Among the passengers was Lt. Col Jet Mwebaze, brother of acting
Chief of Staff James Kazini.
	   The Israeli Embassy in Nairobi confirmed that an Israeli
businessman, Zeev Schiff, was also on the plane. The newspaper
identified a third passenger as Arif Mulji, an Indian who owned an
electrical firm in Kampala. The newspaper said the fourth passenger
was a Congolese identified only as Taban and said the pilot was
Enos Luwuzu.
	   The newspaper said the plane, which took off from Entebbe
airport Sept. 25, was heading due west toward Kasese, which is
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the crash site. However,
previous reports had said the plane was heading toward Bunia in
northeastern Congo, which could explain why it crashed north of its
destination.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Police arrested six men and
seized two pipe bombs, but said Thursday there was no link to the
fatal explosion five weeks ago at a Planet Hollywood restaurant.
	   Acting on an informant's tip, police surrounded a house in the
Cape Flats slum area and confiscated two unexploded pipe bombs,
senior superintendent John Sterrenberg said.
	   But they turned up no link the men to the Aug. 25 blast that
ripped through the crowded restaurant, killing two people and
injuring 26.
	   ``There is no evidence to link them to Planet Hollywood,''
Sterrenberg said.
	   After that blast, a caller to a local radio station claimed
responsibility on behalf of the group Muslims Against Global
Oppression, which later denied carrying out the attack.
	   Three people detained days after the bombing were released
without charge and there have been no subsequent arrests.
	   Bombings and shootings are a common occurence on the Cape Flats
as crime lords and vigilantes battle for turf.
	   Sterrenberg declined to give additional details on the suspects,
who were arrested Wednesday night.

Arafat briefs Mubarak on his Washington talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat briefed
President Hosni Mubarak Thursday on his talks with U.S. and Israeli
officials, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   The briefing comes two days after a White House-brokered deal
was reached in Washington on a further Israeli troop pullback from
the West Bank.
	   Arafat accepted an Israeli offer to withdraw from over 13
percent of the West Bank's land, 3 percent of which will be a
``nature reserve.''
	   Arafat's talks with Mubarak in the Mediterranean city of
Alexandria Thursday focused on his meetings in Washington with U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. The Two Arab leaders also discussed U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's planned visit to the region next week,
MENA said.
	   Albright is scheduled to travel to the Middle East to lay the
groundwork of, and prepare the negotiating schedule for a
mid-October summit in the United States during which it is hoped
the withdrawal accord will be signed.
	   Arab reaction to Arafat's acceptance of the Israeli proposal has
ranged from outright opposition to cautious welcome. Hardline Syria
and Iraq charge that Arafat has made too many concessions.
	   Mubarak and Arafat were joined in their meeting Thursday by
Mubarak's political advisor Osama el-Baz, Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat and Nabil Abourdeneh, Arafat's advisor.
	   Erekat said in an interview with an Egyptian television station
Thursday that U.S. guarantees were needed to implement the latest
deal.
	   ``The guarantees to implement the agreement is an important
issue because we don't want to reach an agreement with Israel which
will not be implemented,'' Erekat said.
	   He said Israel had not respected previous agreements made with
Palestinians.
	   The U.S. proposal was essentially a ``collection of ideas
presented by the U.S. administration to bridge the gap between
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators,'' Erekat said.

Germany's interest rates likely unchanged as stock market plunges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Even as Germany's stock market plunged
5 percent in early trading, a senior central banker Thursday said
there was no need to cut interest rates, as the United States did
earlier this week.
	   The statement by Deutsche Bundesbank official Ernst Welteke
increased expectations there will be no change to Germany's key
interest rates after the bank's regular policy meeting Thursday.
	   There was sufficient turbulence on global financial markets and
the Bundesbank shouldn't add to it by making hectic or isolated
moves, Welteke told German radio Deutschlandfunk.
	   The issue of interest rate cuts in Europe is tricky, since rates
across Europe need to be unified by Jan. 1, when 11 of the European
Union's 15 states will merge their monetary policies and launch a
single currency, the euro.
	   Lowering Germany's rate will make it even harder for countries
among the 11 which have higher rates to converge on the lower rate.
	   Germany's key interest rate is 3.3 percent.
	   The chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party, Oskar
Lafontaine, who is tapped to become the next finance minister, has
called for a cut in interest rates.
	   Welteke said he understood why Lafontaine was calling for a cut,
but added that lower German rates were not a cure-all for Germany's
high unemployment, nor would they give zest to the economy.
	   Economists are growing gloomy about Germany's 1998 economic
growth, projecting growth at 2.5 percent, compared to the outgoing
government's official projection of around 3 percent.
	   In elections Sunday, the outgoing conservative coalition
government led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl was defeated by the Social
Democratic Party.
	   Welteke's remarks came as German share prices plunged in early
trading with bad news piling up on international markets,
especially Japan and Wall Street, and a weakening U.S. dollar.
	   Traders said investors were disheartened by the last two days'
losses in stock markets in Tokyo and New York.

Malaysia's bruised former finance minister sparks concern of police
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Bruises on the face of jailed
dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on newspaper front pages for two
days and downloaded from the Internet, are blemishing the image of
Malaysian police.
	   After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had
beaten himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police
custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an
investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   ``We can't accept this and we will undertake full
investigations,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying in Thursday's New
Straits Times. ``The police cannot harm their detainees in the
course of their interrogation.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for
office. The two had differed over economic policy as the country
veered into recession and Anwar has said the 72-year-old Mahathir
feared him as an alternative leader.
	   Local newspapers that are normally pro-Mahathir have splashed
close-up photos of Anwar's badly bruised face for two days. People
are peering at the pictures, downloading copies from the Internet,
discussing whether Mahathir, who also oversees the police as home
affairs minister, knew what was happening to the man he had once
groomed as his successor.
	   It was not the first time that a Malaysian has said he was
tortured or mistreated in police custody. But there has been no one
as high-profile as Anwar.
	   ``What I experienced was chicken feed compared to Anwar,'' Syed
Husin Ali, head of the opposition Malaysian People's Party, said
Thursday. In a book about his six-month detention under the same
law that kept Anwar away from family and lawyers for 10 days, Syed
described being hit and deprived of sleep.
	   ``At least I didn't have bruises on my face, although I was
slapped and hit on the stomach,'' Syed told The Associated Press.
	   Anwar's bruises raise ``alarming questions about the state of
governance in the country,'' said Lim Kit Siang, leader of the
opposition Democratic Action Party.
	   If Mahathir did not know of the alleged beatings, it suggests
the police acted on their own.
	   At a series of rallies before his arrest, Anwar led throngs in
chanting for Mahathir's resignation and a more open, less corrupt
government. His arrest Sept. 20 was followed by street protests and
hundreds of additional arrests.
	   Before his arrest, Anwar designated his wife, Azizah Ismail, as
the leader of the new ``reform'' movement. But police have banned
her from speaking publicly.
	   On Thursday, she was summoned for the third time to police
headquarters for questioning about an interview with regional
television network CNBC. She had expressed fears that her husband
would be injected with the HIV virus to prove allegations of
homosexuality, and police are investigating possible charges of
sedition against her.
	   She called the repeated interviews ``pressure and harassment.''
	   Her attorney Sivarasa Rasiah said he also was questioned. ``The
Bar Council might have something to say about this later because
defense attorneys are not expected to be interrogated by the
police,'' he said.
	   Anwar, who pleaded innocent this week to five charges of sodomy
and five of corruption, told the court that police beat him the
night he was arrested, ``until blood seeped down my nose,'' leaving
him half-conscious.
	   His allegations, accompanied by pictorial evidence, brought
prompt expressions of disapproval, from the U.S. State Department,
the Australian government, Amnesty International, and the finance
ministers of other countries who used to meet with Anwar at
international conferences.
	   On Thursday, the Indonesian government, where security forces
have been accused for years of mistreating prisoners, said it
regretted the reports about Anwar's injuries and that the
allegations have placed in doubt a visit to Malaysia by President
B.J. Habibie.
	   It was an embarrassing blot on Mahathir's assurances that Anwar
would have a fair and open trial, and the national police chief's
declaration at a news conference last week that the former finance
minister was ``safe and sound in our custody.''
	   A day after police said they would conduct their own
investigation of Anwar's treatment, Mahathir said the
attorney-general would undertake the probe.
	   ``He is injured and we must know how it happened,'' said
Mahathir.
	   An eye doctor examined Anwar Tuesday and determined his retina
wasn't permanently damaged but said the wounds had come from being
``assaulted.''

NATO hones military plans, differences persist over U.N. mandate

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Amid growing pressure for international
intervention to stop the killing in Kosovo, NATO's top
decision-making body met for the second day running Thursday to
fine-tune plans for air strikes against Serb forces.
	   NATO officials said the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
was unlikely to take any major political decisions on launching air
raids, but would continue to review military preparations.
	   The council, made up of ambassadors from the 16 NATO allies,
failed Wednesday to overcome differences over whether the alliance
needs a clearer mandate from the United Nations before it can
attack the Serbs.
	   The United States says no further U.N. resolution is needed, but
some European allies are concerned about the legality of acting
without explicit authorization from the U.N.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in Rome that
intervention without a U.N. mandate was ``inconceivable''
	   NATO officials said the alliance was waiting to see a report on
Kosovo to be presented to the Security Council next week by U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   The U.N. chief is expected to indicate whether the Serbs are
complying with last week's Security Council resolution which urges
a cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday warned NATO
air strikes could follow Annan's report.
	   NATO's military have been working for months on plans for to
intervene in Kosovo where Serbian security forces began a crackdown
of ethnic Albanian separatists in February. Hundreds have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their
homes.
	   Pressure for international intervention mounted in recent days
after the discovery of massacred ethnic Albanian villagers
including women and children.
	   Last weekend, NATO moved a step closer to action by asking its
member nations to come forward with pledges of planes to be used in
an eventual air campaign.
	   Canada, Britain, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal have already announced plans to send warplanes. The United
States has yet to say publicly what it will contribute to the
force, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were ready for
action in the region.

Golota gets home crowd advantage for first time

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ For the first time in his notorious
career, Polish heavyweight Andrew Golota gets the home crowd
advantage in his crucial bout Friday against aging former champion
Tim Witherspoon.
	   Golota, 30, acknowledged the pressure of finally fighting
professionally in front of local fans 10 years after winning an
Olympic bronze medal in Seoul.
	   ``I have been waiting for such a night in Poland,'' he said
Wednesday at a pre-fight news conference packed with local
journalists. ``Believe me, it is hard to put it into words.''
	   But Witherspoon, hoping to join other middle-aged veterans in a
bid for another title fight, warned Polish fans to expect
disappointment.
	   ``I know he's your favorite, but I'm sorry to say that I'm going
to win,'' the 40-year-old American insisted.
	   Both fighters get dlrs 200,000 for the scheduled 10-round bout
in Wroclaw, in southwest Poland. Polish media describe it as
decisive, with the victor getting contender status while the
vanquished gains a palooka label.
	   ``The Loser Will Die,'' trumpeted the daily Przeglad Sportowy
(Sports Review) newspaper Thursday.
	   Recent history and motivation favor Golota, known more for his
three professional losses than his 31 victories, 27 by knockout.
	   He was ahead two times against former champion Riddick Bowe in
1996, only to get disqualified both times for low blows. Then WBC
champion Lennox Lewis knocked him out in the first round of a title
fight last year.
	   A chair-throwing brawl in the ring after the first Bowe fight
and a dlrs 5,000 fine for secretly using the painkiller lidocaine
90 minutes before the Lewis fight added to Golota's unsavory
reputation.
	   Golota fled Poland for Chicago in 1990 after being charged with
assault in a barroom brawl. He returned for the first time last
year to visit his mother and paid a dlrs 7,000 fine in the case.
	   Now he makes his first professional appearance in his native
land in what is being billed as the first pro heavyweight bout
staged in the former communist country.
	   Coming off three straight wins, Golota, who is trained by Lou
Duva, wants a big victory to bring another title shot and help
build interest in boxing at home.
	   Witherspoon, who held the WBC and WBA titles at different times,
lost his last two fights to fall to 46-7, with 31 knockouts. His
last title fight, a one-round knockout loss in 1986 to James
``Bonecrusher'' Smith, occurred when Golota was a teen-age amateur.
	   ``Golota is one of the best fighters in the world and, in my
opinion, he should be a world champion in the future,'' Witherspoon
said. ``But he's got hard luck, because ... he's boxing against
me.''
	   Organizers hope the fight shows Poland can stage world-class
boxing. Tickets will have world-class prices _ as high as 1,000
zlotys (almost dlrs 300), which is more than many Poles earn in a
month.

Taiwan warns of major upheaval in China in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Despite outward stability, China is on the
verge of possibly catastrophic upheaval that could have a major
impact on Taiwan, a government specialist on China affairs said
Thursday.
	   China faces ``major structural changes'' in 1999 because of a
confluence of negative developments including the Asian financial
crisis, disastrous summer flooding and a sputtering domestic
economy, said Lin Chong-pin, a vice chairman of the Cabinet's
Mainland Affairs Council.
	   Lin cited a pattern of radical change every 10 years, from Mao
Tse-tung's 1959 Great Leap Forward drive for collectivization,
during which millions starved, through the bloody suppression of
democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen square in 1989.
	   Taiwan needs to follow developments in China carefully and
prepare a response, Lin said.
	   Lin also warned that China likely will launch a new offensive
against Taiwan's diplomatic relations around the time of a meeting
between top negotiators in China. The visit by Taiwan's top envoy
to China beginning Oct. 12 will be the highest level contact
between the sides since China broke off negotiations in 1995.
	   China claims Taiwan as a breakaway province with no right to
diplomatic relations. For decades, the sides have engaged in a
diplomatic tug of war, and China has succeeded in reducing the
number of countries formally recognizing Taiwan to just 27.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalist government driven from
China's mainland by Communist forces in 1949.

Newspaper says United States to release Israeli spy Pollard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli newspaper reported Thursday that
U.S. President Bill Clinton has agreed to release Jonathan Pollard,
an American serving a life term for spying for Israeli.
	   Israeli government spokesman Moshe Fogel said Pollard's fate was
discussed during a meeting earlier this week between Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Fogel refused comment on Thursday's report in the Yediot Ahronot
daily that Clinton agreed in principle to grant early release to
Pollard, a former U.S. naval analyst who was jailed 13 years ago
and was recently awarded Israeli citizenship.
	   However, Israeli army radio quoted Netanyahu's office as denying
the report.
	   Pollard's wife Esther, who has been leading a strident campaign
for her husband's release, also said the report was untrue.
	   She called it a leak to cover up the Israeli government's
failure to act. She said that every time an Israeli prime minister
meets a U.S. president, there are leaks about the imminent release
of Pollard.
	   She told Israel radio that high-level sources in Washington said
``the subject had not been brought up in serious fashion and
therefore no agreement was reached.''
	   Pollard was arrested outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington
in 1985. It emerged later that he was recruited to spy for Israel
by a shadowy Israeli intelligence-gathering body in the United
States. Until recently, the Israeli government disavowed Pollard,
and called his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   The present Israeli government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison.

Russian literary expert receives high Russian honor

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin presented Russia's highest
honor on Thursday to one of Russia's most famous Soviet-era
dissidents, a staunch defender of Russian culture.
	   Dmitry Likhachyov, a 91-year-old literary historian who spent
four years in one of the Soviet Union's harshest prison camps,
received the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called _ named after the
first Christian missionary _ for contributions to the development
of national culture.
	   ``You achieved high success in a great many areas, showing
professionalism and mastery,'' Yeltsin told Likhachyov, one of
about 25 eminent Russians who received awards Thursday. ``With your
works, you serve the people. With your works, you serve the
fatherland.''
	   Born in 1906, Likhachyov works at the St. Petersburg Institute
of Literature. He is an expert in Russian literature of the
11th-17th centuries.
	   He spent four years in the Solovki labor camp, located in a
former monastery on a northern Russian island.
	   Likhachyov later grew to be a moral authority in Russia for his
impassioned defense of the country's cultural heritage. He has
fought to protect the purity of texts written by Russia's most
famous poet, Alexander Pushkin, to whom counterfeiters have long
attributed fake diaries.
	   Likhachyov also informally served as Yeltsin's advisor on such
issues as the July burial of Czar Nicholas II and his family in St.
Petersburg. And he strongly supported the drive for a television
channel devoted to culture, which Yeltsin signed into reality last
year.
	   Likhachyov was the first person to receive the order since
Yeltsin restored it on July 1, 1998. It was first created by Peter
the Great in 1698.
	   The order, one of the top honors in Russia, is awarded for
exceptional service promoting the prosperity, grandeur and glory of
Russia, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Likhachyov said he would use the meeting with Yeltsin to discuss
threats to culture brought on by Russia's financial problems.
	   ``Against the background of the current crisis, the position of
culture is simply tragic,'' he said, according to ITAR-Tass. ``One
must come to realize that no economic upsurge is possible if
culture grows decadent.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While international outrage grew at
reports of massacres of Kosovo civilians, ethnic Albanian leaders
and an international aid organization declared a day of mourning
Thursday in honor of a volunteer doctor killed in Kosovo.
	   Sheptim Robaj, an ethnic Albanian doctor working for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, died Wednesday of
injuries sustained when his vehicle hit a land mine.
	   The death highlighted the difficulties and dangers for aid
groups trying to help some of the estimated 275,000 Kosovo
residents driven from their homes this year by fighting between
Serb forces and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   ``The ICRC will suspend its activities throughout the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia as a mark of respect for Dr. Sheptim
Robaj,'' the Red Cross said in a statement Thursday.
	   Ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova proclaimed Thursday a day
of mourning in Kosovo, in memory of the killed doctor.
	   Also Thursday, the U.N. Security Council was holding informal
consultations after British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called for
an emergency meeting to condemn the weekend massacre of ethnic
Albanian civilians in the forests around Obrija.
	   The council wasn't expected to take any major action Thursday. A
statement to the press, condemning the massacre, was the likely
outcome, council diplomats said.
	   The call for the meeting, however, came as NATO ambassadors were
finalizing plans for airstrikes against Serbs. The Contact Group of
six states _ the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Russia _ was arranging to meet in London Friday to discuss the
fighting between Serb security forces and ethnic Albanian rebels in
Kosovo that has left hundreds dead.
	   On Wednesday, residents of the western village of Golubovac said
that Serbian forces surrounded a pocket of ethnic Albanian refugees
there last Saturday and singled out at least 13 men to kill. They
said the victims had already been buried, but pointed to
saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty cartridges in front of
a fence where they said the refugees were shot.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) to the north, including those of Albanian
women and children.
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are
among the most gruesome developments since the offensive began in
February.
	   Investigators for the International War Crimes Tribunal are in
Kosovo, but a tribunal spokesman in The Hague, Netherlands,
declined to discuss their work.
	   In another claim, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said late
Wednesday that Serb police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles
Tuesday in Vranic in southwestern Kosovo. The New York-based rights
organization said one of its researchers saw the bodies of four
ethnic Albanian men who had been killed, including one who was
apparently executed at close range and another whose face had been
mutilated.
	   ``The atrocities committed by the Serbian police and the
Yugoslav army are at the core of the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo
and must be stopped immediately,'' said Holly Cartner, executive
director of the group's Europe and Central Asia division.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is seeking independence for
Kosovo, whose population is mostly ethnic Albanian.
	   The ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Information Center claimed late
Wednesday that 18 more bodies had been found around a third
village, Glogovac, in the Drenica region. The center said the
victims all showed clear signs of torture and that three were shot
in the back of the head. The claim could not be confirmed, and it
was possible it referred to the Golubovac site.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanian accounts.
Both sides have been accused of massacres in Kosovo.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
return to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   In Tirana, capital of neighboring Albania, Interior Ministry
spokesman Artan Bizhga said Thursday that about 100 Serb soldiers
were involved in a clash just 300 meters (yards) within Yugoslav
territory early Wednesday.
	   He said Albanian border guards also saw a low-flying military
helicopter, but claimed there was no shooting from the Albanian
side of the border.

Joe Ozaki, Idoki take first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HIGASHI-IBARAKI, Japan (AP) _ Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki and Koki
Idoki shot one-under-par 71s Thursday, taking a one-stroke lead
with 27 players yet to finish the rain-delayed first round of the
120 million yen (dlrs 882,000) Japan Open Golf Championship.
	   Darkness halted play after 87 of the 114 players had finished 18
holes. The first round was to be completed Friday morning.
	   The 42-year-old Joe Ozaki, youngest of three Ozaki brothers,
shot five birdies and four bogeys on the 7,160-yard, par-72 Oarai
Golf Club course.
	   Idoki had two birdies and one bogey.
	   ``I needed energy on each hole because of strong rain. I feel
like I played two rounds,'' said Joe Ozaki, who is seeking his
first victory of the season and 26th of his Japan PGA Tour career.
	   Defending champion Craig Parry of Australia shot a 72 with two
birdies and two bogeys and shared third place with Chen Tze-chung
of Taiwan and five Japanese _ Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, Joe's eldest
brother; Hidemichi Tanaka; Yasuharu Imano; Nobumitsu Yuhara and
Takeshi Nakajima.
	   At 73 were Americans Brandt Jobe and Peter Teravainen and five
Japanese.
	   Among the 27 yet to finish the first round were Eduardo Herrera
of Colombia and Hsieh Chin-sheng of Taiwan.
	   The winner will receive 24 million yen (dlrs 176,000).

El Al: Israeli cargo plane carried nerve gas component
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam
in 1992 was carrying a chemical that reportedly can be used in
making the nerve gas sarin, an airline official confirmed Thursday.
	   El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman told The Associated Press that
``the plane was carrying dimethyl methylphosphonate'' which
according to the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad is a a key
component of Sarin.
	   Klieman said the Dutch government has known this for six years
because the name of the chemical was listed on the cargo manifest
handed over by Israel shortly after the crash.
	   The cargo plane crashed into an apartment building, killing 43
people. Reports about weapons and dangerous chemicals aboard the
plane surfaced shortly afterwards.
	   This week, the NRC Handelsblad reported that the El Al plane was
carrying 50 gallons of dimethyl methylphosphonate. The chemical can
also be used as a flame retardant, and in the manufacture of
plastic.
	   The newspaper said the shipment was headed to Israel's
Biological Institute in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes Ziona. Recent
reports have said Israel was making chemical and biological weapons
there. The government has not commented on those claims.
	   Klieman confirmed that the intended recipient was listed on the
manifest, but would not comment whether it was the Biological
Institute.
	   Israel's Civil Aviation Authority is to look into the report,
according to Transport Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadiah. He said
Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom did not order a new investigation
of the crash; rather, only a check into the specific claim about
nerve gas components.
	   Klieman said El Al transports all materials in accordance with
international regulations. He said the chemical dimethyl
methylphosphonate is approved for transport on both passenger and
cargo planes.
	   Ovadiah said Israel turned over all cargo manifests to the
Netherlands after the crash. Referring to the reports about nerve
gas components, he said there is ``nothing new here, but we're
checking it anyway.''

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Asian stock markets shuddered in Thursday's trading
after Wall Street's best-known index sank below 8,000 overnight,
triggering declines in regional bourses from Sydney to Seoul.
Investors sent share prices in Tokyo spiraling to new 12-year lows
in dismay about the sputtering Japanese economy and the sell-off in
New York overnight. Japan's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues fell 209.27 points, or 1.56 percent, closing at
13,197.12 _ the second straight day of lows not seen since February
1986. Investors in foreign markets worry that signals a slowdown in
economic growth _ bad for foreign companies dependent on exports to
the huge American market. Share prices on the Korean Stock Exchange
fell 1.5 percent to 305.64 points Thursday. Taiwan's benchmark
index fell 131.89 points, or 1.9 percent, closing at 6,702.06. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange index slipped 32.32 points, or
2.6 percent, to 1,227.32. (WORLD MARKETS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund opens its
annual meeting Thursday trying to prevent a fragile world economy
from turning into a global recession. If the U.S. economy weakens
more than expected, if Japan fails to end its recession, or if
further bad news from Asia sends more investors fleeing from Latin
America, the current slowdown could deepen into recession, the
international lending agency warned Wednesday. At the IMF-World
Bank meeting, finance ministers and central bank governors from 182
nations will grapple with how to overhaul the international
financial system. Behind the scenes, key countries including the
United States will work to assemble a multibillion-dollar rescue
package for Brazil and press Russia's new economic team not to
print more rubles to try spend its way out of crisis. U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin will outline the U.S. agenda for the global
economy in a speech in New York. Japan will present plans to spend
about dlrs 30 billion to support nations in Southeast Asia, where
the financial troubles erupted 14 months ago before spreading to
flatten Russia and threatening Latin America. (GLOBAL ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government convened Thursday to discuss a
plan to prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other hard
currencies and greatly increase the number of rubles in
circulation. President Boris Yeltsin met with a regional governor
who proposed banning the free circulation of the dollar and
introducing a so-called gold ruble tied to the country's gold
reserves. Foreign currencies have circulated freely since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, and Russia now has more dollars in
its economy than any country besides the United States, U.S.
officials say. Liberal economists have warned that restrictions on
hard currency would spur the black market and damage the crumbling
economy. On Thursday, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the
government had paid off some long-running wage debts to the
military and sent subsidies to the ailing coal industry. He didn't
say where the government, which collected only half of the planned
amount of taxes last month, found the funds. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers began
voting Thursday on giving up their right to strike for 10 years as
part of a management recovery plan that would let Asia's oldest
carrier reopen. It was the second time in 11 days that the 6,700
members of PAL's largest union have voted on the rescue plan. Last
week, they rejected the proposal, forcing the airline to shut down
and leaving much of the country without air service. Members were
given until Friday noon to vote. Many union members believed the
government would not let the 57-year-old flag carrier close. But
when government-enlisted foreign carriers began flying some
domestic routes Monday, union leaders reversed their position and
agreed to accept the management plan in exchange for a 20 percent
share of the company's stock and seats on its board. The agreement
must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators and PAL's
creditors. (PHILIPPINES-PAL)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Even as Germany's stock market plunged
5 percent in early trading, a senior central banker Thursday said
there was no need to cut interest rates, as the United States did
earlier this week. The statement by Deutsche Bundesbank official
Ernst Welteke increased expectations there will be no change to
Germany's key interest rates after the bank's regular policy
meeting Thursday. There was sufficient turbulence on global
financial markets and the Bundesbank shouldn't add to it by making
hectic or isolated moves, Welteke told German radio
Deutschlandfunk. The issue of interest rate cuts in Europe is
tricky, since rates across Europe need to be unified by Jan. 1,
when 11 of the European Union's 15 states will merge their monetary
policies and launch a single currency, the euro. Lowering Germany's
key 3.3 interest rate will make it even harder for countries among
the 11 which have higher rates to converge on the lower rate. The
chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party, Oskar Lafontaine,
who is tapped to become the next finance minister, has urged a rate
cut. (GERMANY-INTEREST RATES)

North Korea says its satellite can be seen by naked eye
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea followed up claims to have
launched its first satellite by saying Thursday the ``Bright Star
No. 1'' will be visible to the naked eye this weekend.
	   The reclusive communist state first made the claim when it fired
a rocket over Japan on Aug. 31. U.S. officials first said the
rocket was a three-stage ballistic missile, but concluded later
that North Korea had launched a very small satellite that failed to
achieve orbit.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday
that the satellite will be visible in various parts of Korea
between 4:50 a.m. (1950 GMT) and 5:30 a.m. (2030 GMT) Saturday and
Sunday.
	   The two-sentence dispatch gave no further detail.
	   Whether it was a missile or satellite, Washington considered the
rocket launch a bold demonstration of North Korea's growing missile
technology that posed threats to two key Asian allies, Japan and
South Korea, and U.S. military bases there.
	   North Korea has said the satellite was circling the earth
transmitting revolutionary hymns praising the late President Kim Il
Sung and his heir and son, Kim Jong Il.
	   But U.S. and South Korean officials said they failed to detect
such transmissions, much less the satellite itself.
	   The launch came amid U.S. efforts to curb North Korea's missile
sales to Middle Eastern countries.
	   North Korea reportedly is trying to develop ballistic missiles
with sufficient range to hit Hawaii and Alaska.

Schroeder starts early talks on new German government

and outgoing foreign minister; ADDS byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder opened
preliminary talks with Greens party leaders Thursday on forming a
new German government.
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, has said he wants to move swiftly
to set up a coalition after defeating Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
elections Sunday and returning the left to power in Germany after
16 years.
	   The talks, however, were expected to be difficult as the future
coalition partners hammer out ideological differences on such
central policy questions as defense, energy and transportation.
	   ``Getting clarity on the issues is more important than speed,''
said Rudolf Scharping, Schroeder's consultant on foreign affairs
and possibly the next defense minister, as he headed into the
talks.
	   Greens' leaders did not comment as they headed into the meeting,
held over lunch in the offices for Saarland state in Bonn.
	   Formal coalition talks open Friday, but leaders of both parties
wanted to discuss the agenda and timetable on Thursday, sources on
both sides said.
	   The mainstream Social Democrats and the small, sometimes radical
Greens share a range of goals, such as fighting unemployment,
cutting taxes and granting dual citizenship to long-time foreign
residents.
	   But Greens positions on foreign and defense policy _ disbanding
NATO, limiting foreign missions of German soldiers and cutting
troop strength _ promise tough negotiations.
	   Party officials say the aim is to have a new government
confirmed within three weeks so Schroeder can attend an Oct. 24-25
summit of European leaders in Austria.
	   Social Democratic party chairman Oskar Lafontaine met earlier
with outgoing Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to discuss the handover
of one of the key ministries from the outgoing center-right
government.

Norwegian unemployment falls to 2.2 percent in September
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Norway's official unemployment rate fell to
2.2 percent at the end of September from 2.6 percent one month
earlier and 3.0 percent in September 1997, the state Labor
Directorate announced Thursday.
	   The agency said 51,200 people were registered as being
completely unemployed in late September, compared to 59,100 in late
August and 68,100 one year ago.
	   The main reason for the decline in the jobless rate was that the
number of people employed in state work and training programs
increased to 11,900 in September from 8,900 in August. The official
unemployment rate does not include those employed in government
programs.

Controversial ex rugby chief Louis Luyt launches political party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Politicians who might agree with
his conservative views and those who clearly don't said Thursday
the party being formed by former rugby chief Louis Luyt won't be a
significant factor in next year's national elections.
	   Widely known for a rugby-related legal spat with President
Nelson Mandela, Luyt's proposed Federal Alliance would focus on
anti-crime and law-and-order issues, and attempt to coordinate
opposition to the ruling African National Congress.
	   The Democratic Party ``has learned with amusement and amazement
of the formation of the FA party,'' said Douglas Gibson, chairman
of the small, mainly white group. ``Amusement because Mr. Luyt
seems to think that it is a simple matter to form a new political
party.''
	   The African National Congress, which convincingly won 1994's
all-race elections that ended apartheid, also seemed unimpressed.
	   ``Our people will make their judgement in 1999 and we have
nothing to fear, including the proposed party to be lead by Louis
Luyt,'' said ANC spokesman Thabo Masebe.
	   Luyt attracted international attention when he blocked an
inquiry by Mandela into the South African Rugby Football Union.
Mandela wanted to investigate alleged racism and mismanagement.
	   The union required Mandela to take the witness stand, angering
many blacks and some whites who saw it as an attempt to humiliate a
man considered the hero of the anti-apartheid struggle and above
reproach.
	   Luyt won the case, but resigned as president of the sports
union. He was replaced last month by Silas Nkanunu, who is black.
	   National Party spokeswoman Juli Kilian said the only party that
would benefit from Luyt's plans would be the ANC, as the Federal
Alliance would further split the already divided opposition groups.
	   The Zulu-nationalist Inkatha Freedom Party and the United
Democratic Movement, another new opposition grouping, also said
they do not plan to join Luyt's party.
	   Kilian said the National Party supported the idea of an
opposition alliance in next year's elections, but it would have to
be broad-based and multi-racial _ something Luyt's party is
unlikely to be.
	   With his image as a conservative bruiser willing to take on the
African National Congress-led government, Luyt may win sympathy
from some whites, but is unlikely to attract many black votes.
	   Many black people see rugby, which is hugely popular with
whites, as a symbol of apartheid oppression.

Slovak opposition says Meciar's departure can't come too soon

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition leaders on Thursday
hailed Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's announcement that he will
resign in a month and said his departure can't come soon enough.
	   ``He should not prolong his time in office,'' said Jozef
Moravcik, who was prime minister for six months in 1994 and now is
a top representative of the opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   Meciar, Slovakia's authoritarian ruler for virtually its entire
six years of independence, said in an emotional TV appearance
Wednesday night that he would quit when the new Parliament convenes
Oct. 29.
	   In his first public comments since parliamentary elections last
Friday and Saturday, he said on a talk show on state TV that he
would not serve in the new legislature or seek any government
office. But he left open whether he would step down as chairman of
the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
	   He also sang an impromptu farewell song to Slovaks with tears in
his eyes: ``God be with you, I did not hurt any of you.''
	   His ouster as premier was forced by last week's national
elections, in which his governing party was outpolled by opposition
parties. But the opposition and some analysts had expected that the
56-year-old Meciar, who has been widely criticized for
anti-democratic practices, might fight to cling to power.
	   Meciar's party received 27 percent of the vote, more than any
other party. But an opposition alliance led by the Slovak
Democratic Coalition won enough votes to form a strong governing
majority.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has
declared the elections free and fair.
	   Despite announcing his departure, Meciar remained defiant,
criticizing the opposition and defending his record.
	   ``What could I have offered as premier? Everything that is in
me: my knowledge, strength, my skills as an organizer and
negotiator,'' he said. ``Yes, I was artful. Sometimes I was even
foxy. I used ruses and tactics,'' he said.
	   ``However, what should I have done as premier of a small
nation?'' he added, saying he stood up to big powers such as the
United States and Germany.
	   NATO and the European Union, wary of Meciar's undemocratic
methods, bypassed Slovakia for consideration for early membership.
	   ``We have not been against integration, we have been against
Slovakia being dominated,'' Meciar said.
	   He predicted that inflation will now rise, development will be
inhibited and the economy will grow unstable.
	   ``I think that it was a very confused performance,'' said
Moravcik. ``His psychological state was presented completely. And
his state was like this for the past four years. He wasn't quite
normal.''
	   Kalman Petocz, a top representative of the Hungarian Coalition
Party, which also is in the opposition alliance, hailed Meciar's
resignation but said he should have admitted defeat more
gracefully.
	   ``He cried, sang and talked,'' Petocz said. ``He could have done
it (resigned) in a more cultured and civilized way.''

Kia Motors announces terms of third auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Creditor banks of Kia Motors Corp.
said Thursday they will sell off the bankrupt automaker to the
buyer demanding the smallest debt reduction.
	   In two previous failed auctions, the banks had agreed to write
off only dlrs 2.1 billion of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt. That
satisfied none of the potential buyers, all of which demanded
further debt reductions.
	   The new, sweetened auction terms will make a third round of
bidding successful, Kia officials said. Potential buyers must
submit their bids by Oct. 12, and the successful bidder will be
announced a week later.
	   This week, Kia invited to the new auction Ford Motor Co. and
General Motors Corp. of the United States and Hyundai Motor Co.,
Samsung Motors Corp. and Daewoo Motor Co. of South Korea.
	   In the third auction, the bidder demanding the smallest debt
write-off will be named ``primary bidder.''
	   If the difference between the debt write-offs demanded by the
primary bidder and second best bidder is bigger than 700 billion
won (dlrs 500 million), the primary bidder wins the auction.
	   Otherwise, the banks will consider other factors as well, such
as terms of debt repayments, to decide on the eventual buyer.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse last year helped erode investor confidence in
South Korea's industries, leading to a flight of capital.
	   General Motors was invited but did not take part in two previous
auctions. Ford participated in the first auction but withdrew from
the second, saying that Kia's debts were too much for it to handle.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stock prices plunged from Asia to Europe on
Thursday, with traders nervously selling shares in response to the
drop on Wall Street that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average
below 8,000 points.
	   Blue chips in London sank to new lows for the year, while prices
in Frankfurt were off by more than 5 percent in early dealings
following losses in Asia that pushed Tokyo shares to fresh 12-year
lows.
	   Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock
Exchange nosedive on Wednesday, even though the U.S. central bank
had eased interest rates a day earlier by a quarter-point. Many had
been looking for a bigger cut.
	   Investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall Street could
signal a possible slowdown in economic growth _ a bad omen for the
many foreign companies dependent on exports to the huge U.S.
market.
	   ``There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a
direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high
percentage of their earnings from overseas markets,'' said Pelham
Smithers, a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd.
	   In London, Europe's biggest market, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was off 115.2 points, or 2.3 percent, at
4,949.2 by late morning, tumbling through the 5,000-point level
that had been undercut only briefly last month.
	   Frankfurt traders pushed the electronic Xetra DAX index down by
5.3 percent to 4,196.88 on fears of a global recession. In Paris,
the CAC 40 index showed showed more big losses.
	   Earlier, Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues fell 209.27 points, or 1.56 percent, closing at 13,197.12 _
the second straight day of lows not seen since February 1986.
	   Markets in Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and many
Southeast Asian nations also dipped after the Dow average tumbled
237.90 points, or 3 percent, on Wednesday to close at 7,842.62.
	   U.S. stocks dropped across the board Wednesday as investors
registered fears that Tuesday's interest rate cut by the U.S.
Federal Reserve would not be sufficient stimulus to buoy
fourth-quarter corporate earnings. Some high-profile U.S. profit
warnings fueled the sell-off.
	   Most global markets plunged Thursday, with traders nervously
waiting for Wall Street to open again.
	   ``The smaller-than-expected lowering of interest rates by the
U.S. Federal Reserve has a chain reaction,'' said Lee Won-ho, an
analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul, where prices fell by
1.5 percent on Thursday. ``It is affecting Wall Street, the
Japanese market, ours and others.''
	   Hong Kong markets were closed Thursday for the Chinese National
Day holiday, but Singapore's Straits Times Index ended down 23.63
points, or 2.5 percent, at 916.02 as a result of the Asia-wide
slump, traders said.
	   ``Singapore has pretty much followed what's going on in equities
regionally,'' said Timothy Wong, head of research at
Singapore-based brokerage Vickers Ballas.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence said Thursday
they have arrested a Hamas activist and former chemistry student
who stashed nearly a ton of explosives in his home right next to
Palestinian police headquarters on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin, meanwhile, acknowledged that
the Islamic militant group was having problems making good on
threats to carry out attacks against Israelis in retaliation for
the killing of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli soldiers last month.
	   Yassin said Palestinian and Israeli security forces had stepped
up their came against Hamas. However, a Hamas ``response will come
at the appropriate time, even if it is delayed,'' Yassin told a
news conference in Gaza City.
	   In Israeli-controlled downtown Hebron, troops enforced a curfew
imposed after an assailant, apparently a Palestinian, threw two
hand grenades at Israeli troops Wednesday, injuring 11 soldiers and
11 Palestinian passers-by.

Germany's interest rates unchanged as stock market plunges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in lede with rates unchanged, edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's central bank decided
Thursday to leave the country's key interest rates unchanged,
despite turbulence on world markets and even as the German stock
market plunged 5 percent.
	   The inaction was expected, with senior bank officials this week
saying they didn't see any need to cut rates, despite a cut in the
United States earlier in the week aimed at bolstering the economy
there.
	   Germany's key interest rate is 3.3 percent.
	   Senior Deutsche Bundesbank official Ernst Welteke said there was
sufficient turbulence on global financial markets and the
Bundesbank shouldn't add to it by making hectic or isolated moves.
	   The issue of interest rate cuts in Europe is tricky, since rates
across Europe must be unified by Jan. 1, when 11 of the European
Union's 15 states will merge their monetary policies and launch a
single currency, the euro.
	   Lowering Germany's rate would make it even harder for countries
among the 11 which have higher rates to converge on the lower rate.
	   The chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party, Oskar
Lafontaine, who is tapped to become the next finance minister, has
called for a cut in interest rates.
	   Welteke told German radio Deutschlandfunk that he understood why
Lafontaine was calling for a cut, but that lower German rates were
not a cure-all for Germany's high unemployment, nor would they give
zest to the economy.
	   Economists are growing gloomy about Germany's 1998 economic
growth, projecting growth at 2.5 percent, compared to the outgoing
government's official projection of around 3 percent.
	   In elections Sunday, the outgoing conservative coalition
government led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl was defeated by the Social
Democratic Party.
	   Welteke's remarks came just before German share prices plunged 5
percent to 4,160.46 points, a drop of 270.45 points, in midday
trading.
	   The drop was in reaction to bad news piling up on international
markets, especially Japan and Wall Street, and a weakening U.S.
dollar.
	   Traders said investors were disheartened by the last two days'
losses in stock markets in Tokyo and New York.

Rebels kills six in western Uganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Rebels attacked a village in western
Uganda and killed six civilians before soldiers drove them off, a
military spokesman said Thursday.
	   The attack occurred overnight Wednesday in the village of
Chiondo near Kasese, 270 kilometers (170 miles) west of the capital
Kampala, said the spokesman, who identified himself only as Lt.
Majera.
	   Majera said the attackers were believed to be rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces who operate from bases in the foothills of
the Rwenzori Mountains that straddle the Uganda-Congolese border.
	   He said the rebels likely fled back to their bases after the
attack.
	   Majera said the attackers avoided a nearby army post when they
shot up the village. It was the gunfire that alerted the soldiers,
he said, adding that they killed two of the assailants.
	   The various rebel groups operating in the region often attack
with knives or machetes, either to save on ammunition or because
they don't have guns.
	   He had no further details.
	   Under an agreement earlier this year with Congo, Uganda sent
troops into the neighboring country to flush out the ADF fighters.
President Yoweri Museveni insists they will remain there until
Ugandan security is guaranteed, despite Congolese President Laurent
Kabila's protests that Uganda is backing Congolese rebels
attempting to topple him.
	   The anti-Kabila rebels claim the Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance
Army, which operates in northern Uganda and enjoys support from
Sudan, is fighting alongside Kabila's forces together with Sudanese
soldiers.
	   The government-owned daily New Vision reported Thursday that LRA
leader Joseph Kony was badly wounded last week and is in hospital
in Juba, the largest town still under government control in
southern Sudan.
	   The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which is fighting the
government in Khartoum for autonomy for southern Sudan, has waged
pitched battles with government troops in the past week as it moves
on Juba, spokesmen for both sides say.
	   New Vision quoted Ugandan Minister of State for Security Muruli
Mukasa as saying Kony's largest camp at al-Gabelain, 38 kilometers
(24 miles) south of Juba, was destroyed last week when the SPLA
took control.
	   Muruli said the LRA had been planning to bomb several sites in
the Ugandan capital, including the Parliament building, state-run
Radio Uganda, unidentified embassies and other public sites, the
newspaper said.

Malaysia's bruised former finance minister sparks concern of police

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 14th graf, `Three ... Blackman,' that police
went to Singapore to interview journalists about Anwar, wife;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Bruises on the face of jailed
dissident Anwar Ibrahim, splashed on newspaper front pages for two
days and downloaded from the Internet, are blemishing the image of
Malaysian police.
	   After first suggesting that the former deputy prime minister had
beaten himself on the face, neck and arms during 10 days in police
custody, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called for an
investigation of the wounds Anwar displayed in court Tuesday and
Wednesday.
	   ``We can't accept this and we will undertake full
investigations,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying in Thursday's New
Straits Times. ``The police cannot harm their detainees in the
course of their interrogation.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for
office. The two had differed over economic policy as the country
veered into recession and Anwar has said the 72-year-old Mahathir
feared him as an alternative leader.
	   Local newspapers that are normally pro-Mahathir have splashed
close-up photos of Anwar's badly bruised face for two days. People
are peering at the pictures, downloading copies from the Internet,
discussing whether Mahathir, who also oversees the police as home
affairs minister, knew what was happening to the man he had once
groomed as his successor.
	   It was not the first time that a Malaysian has said he was
tortured or mistreated in police custody. But there has been no one
as high-profile as Anwar.
	   ``What I experienced was chicken feed compared to Anwar,'' Syed
Husin Ali, head of the opposition Malaysian People's Party, said
Thursday. In a book about his six-month detention under the same
law that kept Anwar away from family and lawyers for 10 days, Syed
described being hit and deprived of sleep.
	   ``At least I didn't have bruises on my face, although I was
slapped and hit on the stomach,'' Syed told The Associated Press.
	   Anwar's bruises raise ``alarming questions about the state of
governance in the country,'' said Lim Kit Siang, leader of the
opposition Democratic Action Party.
	   If Mahathir did not know of the alleged beatings, it suggests
the police acted on their own.
	   At a series of rallies before his arrest, Anwar led throngs in
chanting for Mahathir's resignation and a more open, less corrupt
government. His arrest Sept. 20 was followed by street protests and
hundreds of additional arrests.
	   Before his arrest, Anwar designated his wife, Azizah Ismail, as
the leader of his new ``reform'' movement. But police have banned
her from speaking publicly.
	   On Thursday she was summoned for the third time to police
headquarters for questioning about an interview with regional
television network CNBC Asia. She had expressed fears that her
husband would be injected with the HIV virus to prove allegations
of homosexuality, and police are investigating possible charges of
sedition against her. She called the repeated interviews ``pressure
and harassment.''
	   Three Malaysian police officers traveled to Singapore Thursday
to ask CNBC news anchors how they had arranged to get the Sept. 21
interview with Azizah and one with Anwar on Sept. 3. CNBC refused
to answer questions about its news gathering, said vice president
of news programming Chris Blackman.
	   Anwar, who pleaded innocent this week to five charges of sodomy
and five of corruption, told the court that police beat him the
night he was arrested, ``until blood seeped down my nose,'' leaving
him half-conscious.
	   His allegations, accompanied by pictorial evidence, brought
prompt expressions of disapproval, from the U.S. State Department,
the Australian government, Amnesty International, and the finance
ministers of other countries who used to meet with Anwar at
international conferences.
	   On Thursday, the Indonesian government, where security forces
have been accused for years of mistreating prisoners, said it
regretted the reports about Anwar's injuries and that the
allegations have placed in doubt a visit to Malaysia by President
B.J. Habibie.

Prime minister to attend IMF, World Bank meetings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's Prime Minister Radu Vasile
left Thursday for Washington where he will meet with international
lenders who have withheld loans due to stalled reforms.
	   Vasile, who is accompanied by his new Finance Minister Decebal
Traian Remes, will attend the annual meeting of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund, national radio reported.
	   Vasile said Romania must find ways of support from the banks as
well as paying back its loans.
	   After paying two tranches of about dlrs 86 million each, the
International Monetary Fund suspended a dlrs 430 million loan in
1997 due to the government's slow progress in reforming the
economy.
	   The government has come under fire from all sides after it
abruptly dismissed former Finance Minister Daniel Daianu last week
and appointed Remes, a unknown Liberal party member.
	   Vasile will meet World Bank President James Wolfensohn and
Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary
Fund, radio said.

Ozone hole above Antarctic biggest ever for September, expert says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The so-called ``ozone hole'' above the Antarctic
this September was the largest and deepest ever recorded for the
month, the World Meteorological Organization said Thursday.
	   The surface area of the gap in the ozone, a protective layer
that shields the earth from damaging ultraviolet rays, is more than
15 percent bigger than ever before and now covers an area two and a
half times the size of Europe, WMO expert Rumen Bojkov said.
	   ``The dilution (of the ozone layer) is very, very serious,''
Bojkov said. ``We could expect any other year to have a very strong
depletion, but this year it's a bit stronger than any of the
previous years.''
	   Reduction of the ozone layer can allow harmful ultraviolet rays
from the sun to reach the earth's surface. Too much UV radiation
can cause skin cancer and destroy the tiny plants at the beginning
of the food chain.
	   Scientists expect a reduction in the ozone over the Antarctic
each September. But one aspect of this September's ozone hole is
that it has expanded outside Antarctica and covered a huge swathe
of Pacific and Atlantic ocean including the southern tip of South
America.
	   A WMO base station in Tierra del Fuego, in southern Argentina,
reported a ``very unusual'' low level of ozone in the atmosphere,
Bojkov said.
	   The ozone reduction is more severe than in previous years
because the whirlpool-like wind that develops in the stratosphere
above the South Pole annually, the polar vortex, is larger than
before, Bojkov said.
	   The cause of the Antarctic ozone depletion is the chlorine and
bromine released by man-made chemical compounds such as
chlorofluorocarbons which are contained in some aerosols.
	   Bojkov said the maximum level of chlorofluorocarbons has not yet
been reached. It will reach that level in two to three years and
will continue to be high for the next 10-15 years.
	   The WMO is urging governments to strengthen collaboration in
monitoring and research of the problem and to adhere to the
Montreal Protocol under which commits countries to taking measures
to eliminate production and use of ozone-depleting substances.

Philippine Airlines workers vote to determine airline's future
</HEADLINE>

heavy voting in PAL regional offices, grafs 3-4; trims &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine Airlines workers voted
Thursday on whether to give up their right to strike for 10 years
as part of a management recovery plan that would allow Asia's
oldest carrier to reopen.
	   It was the second time in 11 days that the 6,700 members of
PAL's largest union have voted on the rescue plan. Last week, they
rejected the proposal, forcing the airline to shut down and leaving
much of the country without air service.
	   Members were given until Friday noon to vote and counting would
begin after that, said government labor official Eliot Cojuangco.
	   Cojuangco said the turnout was heavy at PAL regional offices,
based on initial returns.
	   Many union members had believed the government would not allow
the 57-year-old flag carrier to close. But when government-enlisted
foreign carriers began flying some domestic routes Monday, union
leaders reversed their position and agreed to accept the management
plan.
	   The agreement must be formally endorsed by workers, regulators
and PAL's creditors.
	   Under the plan, workers would suspend their collective
bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent
share of the company's stock and seats on its board.
	   The union has been split over the proposal, with militant
members saying a suspension of the bargaining agreement would
violate workers' rights and expose them to management abuses.
	   ``This is our last card,'' union president Alex Barrientos told
workers Thursday. ``As your leader, I am not giving away your
rights.''
	   Barrientos said he has not visited the union office for several
days after some militant workers threatened to shoot him.
	   ``If they want an explanation of why we agreed to the plan, they
can always call me,'' he said.
	   Renato Ramos, a union board member opposed to the plan, said
workers were being asked to ``choose between two coffins.''
	   Hundreds of workers marched to the presidential palace Tuesday
to protest the plan and urge the government to take over the
airline, which has been ravaged by strikes and Asia's currency
crisis.
	   President Joseph Estrada says the government cannot because it
does not have the money to underwrite daily losses of up to 45
million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Estrada, who helped broker the agreement with union leaders,
also urged the workers to ratify the plan.
	   ``I have assured the labor union that as president I will always
protect them. I will not abandon them,'' he said.
	   He asked union members to consider not only their welfare but
also that of millions of Filipinos affected by PAL's shutdown.
	   PAL chairman and chief stockholder Lucio Tan has been meeting in
Europe with creditors to ask them not to repossess the airline's
planes ahead of its possible reopening.

Grenade hits apartment of Greek Embassy official.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- A grenade was hurled at the apartment of a
Greek Consulate official in the southern town of Gjirokastra
Wednesday night, but no one was injured, the state news agency ATA
reported Thursday.
	   The incident happened at 10:25 p.m. (2025 GMT) when unidentified
people threw a grenade at the balcony of Eva Tsoliou, the secretary
of the consulate in Gjirokstra, a town 145 kilometers (90 miles)
south of capital Tirana.
	   ATA said a room was damaged but Tsoliou was not injured.
	   The southern town near the Greek border has often been the site
of explosions this year.
	   Police said they were investigating the latest incident.

Britain's top police chief apologizes to parents of slain black
</HEADLINE>
teen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The chief of Britain's largest police force
apologized Thursday to the parents of a black teenager whose
stabbing death five years ago focused attention on relations
between police and minorities.
	   Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon told Stephen
Lawrence's parents that he accepts the ``anger and frustration''
directed at him.
	   ``I deeply regret that we have not brought Stephen's racist
murderers to justice and I would like to personally apologize again
today to Mr. and Mrs. Lawrence for our failures,'' Condon said,
from his seat a few feet away from Neville and Doreen Lawrence at a
public inquiry into the case.
	   ``We have heard what people have been saying and I accept that a
central concern is that the Met is racist. I acknowledge that we
have not done enough to combat racist crime and harassment,'' he
added.
	   Stephen Lawrence, 18, was stabbed in April 1993 at a London bus
stop by a group of white attackers.
	   The Lawrence family has said police acted slowly and
incompetently in resolving the case. Two men were charged, but
prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to pursue the
case. A private criminal prosecution, admissible under English law,
also collapsed.
	   The Lawrence family has called for Condon to resign.

Report: Myanmar heroin productions fuels regional AIDS crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GRANT PECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's massive drug trade has
contributed to an HIV/AIDS epidemic that is spilling into
neighboring countries, a private activist group said Thursday.
	   The Southeast Asian Information Network, a group opposed to
Myanmar's military regime, said the country faces a public health
crisis because of a dramatic increase in heroin production and use
after the junta seized power in 1988.
	   Myanmar's export of heroin, along with cross-border migration,
has spread a rapid rise in HIV/AIDS cases to nearby areas of India
and China, the group said in a report titled ``Out of Control 2.''
	   The group also alleged the involvement of high-ranking members
of Myanmar's military government in the drug trade.
	   Myanmar, also called Burma, has long been one of the world's top
producers of opium and its derivative, heroin. Until recently, most
of the heroin found in the United States had made its way from the
Golden Triangle region where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and
Thailand meet.
	   The report estimated Myanmar's heroin trade at dlrs 1.2 billion
in 1997, commenting that ``clearly narcotics are among the
country's largest exports, and of great benefit'' to the junta.
	   ``With sharp increases in military spending, but a severe
shortage of foreign exchange, there is indeed no other comparable
source of income which can explain the junta's financial status
(other) than revenues from heroin exports,'' the report said.
	   It said people alleged to be ``drug barons'' have been
encouraged to make huge legitimate investments in the Myanmar
economy.
	   While most heroin is sold abroad, Myanmar ``has a little
acknowledged but widespread domestic heroin market,'' said the
report, adding that Rangoon, Mandalay and the other cities and
towns under central government control have large numbers of
intravenous drug users. Some rural and ethnic areas, notably the
Kachin state, also have large drug user communities, it said.
	   It estimated that as of 1997, 400,000 to 600,000 people were
infected with HIV out of a population of nearly 50 million.
	   The report said Yunnan, the Chinese province closest to
Myanmar's drug-producing areas, has the highest rate of HIV
infection for that nation.
	   It said the Chinese Ministry of Health recently reported that
80.4 percent of all HIV infections in China were detected in
Yunnan, along with 60.0 percent of all confirmed AIDS cases.
	   It blamed heroin exported from Myanmar for major epidemics of
HIV infection in two other areas of China, the northwestern region
of Xinjiang and Guangxi province, bordering Yunnan to the west.
	   There has been a considerable rise in the amount of heroin
crossing into India since the signing of an Indo-Burma trade treaty
in 1995, it said, charging that involvement of the Myanmar army is
key to the distribution of the drug.
	   The report said several heroin refineries ``are reportedly
placed well within the reach'' of Myanmar army units but apparently
operate unmolested.
	   Myanmar officials could not be contacted to comment on the
report, but in the past have defended their drug-fighting record,
pointing to record numbers of narcotics seizures and arrests in
recent years.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican on Thursday appealed to the
governors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to
consider cutting the debt of poor countries when they meet next
week in Washington.
	   ``Today the international financial order faces many
challenges,'' said the appeal, issued by the Pontifical Council for
Justice and Peace. ``The needs of the poorest countries should not
be considered second class.''
	   The council reminded the World Bank and the IMF of Pope John
Paul II's previous calls for a substantial cut, if not outright
cancellation, of the debts many developing countries owe to
international financial institutions.

Parliament to file complaint against finance minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Leaders of the lower house of parliament called
Thursday for criminal charges to be filed against the finance
minister for underfunding the legislature.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, the chairman of the lower house or State
Duma, said that Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov was guilty of
``malicious, premeditated action'' in allowing the government's
debts to the Duma to pile up.
	   President Boris Yeltsin reappointed Zadornov to the finance
minister's post last Friday. He had served in the post under former
Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and Sergei Kiriyenko.
	   ``The Duma will demand the initiation of criminal proceedings
against Finance Minister Zadornov for paralyzing the work of state
bodies,'' Seleznyov said.
	   ``We don't have a single sheet of paper, and we don't duplicate
deputies' statements any more,'' Seleznyov added.
	   The Moskva Hotel, where many deputies live during parliamentary
sessions, has demanded that deputies vacate their rooms because
their bills are unpaid, said Nikolai Troshkin, head of the Duma
staff.
	   He said the Duma's heating system had been cut off, and that
transport and printing services had been denied because of the
legislature's unpaid bills.
	   Seleznyov said that the government owed the Duma about 150
million rubles (dlrs 93 million).

Doctors find heart of Vietnam's oldest woman in wrong place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ When Vietnam's oldest woman was
hospitalized last week, doctors made a surprising discovery _
several of her internal organs aren't where they're supposed to be.
	   X-rays and scanners found 118-year-old Le Thi Co's heart on the
right, liver on the left, stomach to the left and spleen on the
right.
	   Dr. Nguyen Ba Luong of Thong Nhat hospital in Ho Chi Minh City
was quoted by the Tuoi Tre newspaper Thursday as saying such
reversals are rare.
	   Luong was told by Co's relatives that this was the first time
she had ever been hospitalized. She was brought in with a lung
infection but had herself discharged Monday and went home.
	   Identity papers dating back to the French occupation of Vietnam
say Co was born in 1880. She was married at age 19 and had 12
children who survived birth, seven of whom are still alive. Her
extended clan now consists of more than 500 people.
	   ``Our family line accounts for more than 40 percent of the
neighborhood,'' Co's 10th child, Pham Van Lo, was quoted as telling
the Vietnam News Service. ``We've never been rich, but we get
along.''
	   Lo said that as recently as five years ago, her mother still
made her own food and carried her own water to cook. While Co hates
drinking and smoking, Lo said she hates television even more.
	   ``She says they show too much kissing,'' Lo said.

Poll: Majority of Russians oppose printing more money
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A majority of Russians oppose proposals for the
government to print more money to ease the economic crisis,
according to results of a poll released Thursday.
	   The pollsters also said nearly half of all Russians believe
early presidential elections will be held, and that the percentage
of Russians who consider themselves middle class shrank by 3
percent in the past month, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The nationwide poll was conducted Sept. 19 among 1,500 Russians
by the Public Opinion Fund, which gave no margin of error.
	   According to the pollsters, 57 percent of the respondents in the
survey said they opposed proposals to print more money, fearing it
would fuel inflation. Twenty-five percent supported the idea.
	   Residents of relatively affluent Moscow and St. Petersburg were
more likely than people elsewhere in the country to oppose
expanding the money supply, but the idea was opposed by a majority
of rural-dwellers also.
	   Forty-nine percent of the poll's respondents said they expected
presidential elections to be held before 2000, when the next
election is scheduled, the pollsters said.
	   And of those polled, 16 percent said they considered themselves
to be middle class, down from 19 percent in August. Asked what
constituted the middle class in Russia, 57 percent said it was made

After police show of force, Chinese farmers call off protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Threats by officials and a show of force by
police forced farmers outside a south China provincial capital to
abandon a planned protest Thursday, a rights group reported.
	   Farmers outside Changsha city blocked construction of a science
park last month after the well-connected developer was three months
late in paying them for their land, the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democratic Movement reported.
	   Authorities sent 700 regular and armed police to clear away the
protesters in Tianmashan village on Sept. 22, and police arrested
six farmers and beat more than 20, some severely, the Hong
Kong-based group said. It gave the following account:
	   When more than 300 villagers marched on the Hunan provincial
government the following day, officials agreed to provide
compensation. But the villagers were not satisfied, saying the rate
was well below the market price, and they vowed to stage another
protest Thursday, China's National Day.
	   Local officials threatened the villagers against staging the
protest, saying the government ``was not made of bean curd,'' the
Hong Kong-based group said.
	   An official with the city police department denied the report.
``Nothing like that happened in Changsha. It's a rumor,'' said the
official, who gave only his surname, Li.
	   China has been hit by hundreds of mostly small-scale protests
over the past two years by farmers and workers upset over layoffs,
government policies and perceived official indifference or
corruption.
	   The Information Center said one of those connected to the
science park development was the brother-in-law of Wang Maolin,
Hunan's Communist Party secretary.

NATO hones military plans, differences persist over U.N. mandate

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Amid growing pressure for international
intervention to stop the killing in Kosovo, NATO's top
decision-making body met Thursday for a second day to fine-tune
plans for airstrikes against Serb forces.
	   NATO officials said the meeting of the North Atlantic Council
was unlikely to make any major decisions on launching air raids,
but would continue to review military preparations.
	   NATO's military have been working for months on plans for to
intervene in Kosovo where Serbian security forces began a crackdown
of ethnic Albanian separatists in February. Hundreds have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their
homes.
	   Pressure for international intervention mounted in recent days
after the discovery of massacred ethnic Albanian villagers
including women and children.
	   The council, made up of ambassadors from the 16 NATO allies,
failed Wednesday to overcome differences over whether the alliance
needs a clearer mandate from the United Nations before it can
attack the Serbs.
	   The United States says no further U.N. resolution is needed, but
some European allies are concerned about the legality of acting
without explicit authorization from the United Nations.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in Rome that
intervention without a U.N. mandate was ``inconceivable''
	   NATO officials said the alliance was waiting to see a report on
Kosovo to be presented to the Security Council next week by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The U.N. chief is expected to indicate whether the Serbs are
complying with last week's Security Council resolution which urges
a cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday warned NATO
air strikes could follow Annan's report.
	   Over the weekend, NATO moved a step closer to action by asking
member nations to pledge planes to be used in an eventual air
campaign.
	   Canada, Britain, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal have already announced plans to send warplanes. The United
States has yet to say publicly what it will contribute to the
force, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were ready for
action in the region.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong celebrated China's National Day
Thursday with parades, carnivals, banquets and a sobering reminder
that worse economic times may be ahead.
	   In a message to Hong Kong's 6.7 million people, Chief Executive
Tung Chee-hwa praised China's economic achievements but reminded
Hong Kong that it is ``facing the most serious challenges in recent
decades.''
	   Tung was joined by hundreds of Hong Kong and mainland
dignitaries and other citizens at an early morning flag-raising
ceremony outside the massive convention center where Britain handed
over the territory to China in July 1997.
	   But some people said they had no mood, or money, to celebrate.
	   Restaurants that staged lavish banquets last year reported
business had fallen by up to 30 percent this year. People also were
forgoing exotic vacations to stay home for the public holidays
Thursday and Friday.
	   ``The economy's so bad. I'm not in the mood to celebrate,'' said
Carol Ng, 30, a secretary, buying groceries at a market.
	   Ng said she celebrated the holiday last year dining out with her
family in a fancy Chinese restaurant, just weeks before the stock
market crashed.
	   Hong Kong is mired in its first full-blown recession in 13 years
_ the economy is expected to shrink 4 percent this year, and
unemployment is at a 15-year high.
	   About 500 local and foreign workers staged a peaceful rally
Thursday against layoffs and pay cuts.
	   ``The government has done nothing. Nothing,'' said Alice Lee,
30, who has lost her job of 12 years as a pager service operator.
	   But Tung remained upbeat, saying in his message that Hong Kong
can revive its economy ``with the staunch support of our
motherland'' and the Hong Kong people's ``tenacity, flexibility and
creativity.''
	   To boost confidence, Chinese officials have repeatedly pledged
support for the territory and promised not to devalue China's
currency. A yuan devaluation would put heavy pressure on Hong
Kong's currency link to the U.S. dollar.
	   As fears that China would meddle in Hong Kong's affairs and curb
civil rights have largely failed to materialize, Hong Kong people
are becoming more open to the mainland.
	   In a clear sign of closer ties, thousands of Hong Kong citizens
enjoyed a rare chance to visit the barracks of Chinese People's
Liberation Army troops stationed here.
	   In the Stanley Fort garrison, buildings were festooned with
flags and banners that read ``The People's Liberation Army supports
Hong Kong's development.''
	   Soldiers in crisp, pale green fatigues played Chinese chess,
snooker and table tennis with the visitors. Several inscribed
patriotic phrases like ``the PLA and the people are one family''
for an enthusiastic audience.
	   One visitor, Lin Zao'an, 85, praised the Chinese troops for
``symbolizing the motherland,'' and brushed aside references to the
Tiananmen incident in Beijing in 1989, when army battalions fired
upon pro-democracy activists, killing hundreds, if not thousands.
	   ``Every country has its problems,'' said Lin, as his 3-year-old
grandson ran among the machine guns and automatic rifles on
display.
	   About a dozen demonstrators staged a protest outside an official
cocktail reception, calling for an end to one-party rule in China
and a reassessment of the Tiananmen protests, branded as
anti-government activities.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence said Thursday
they have arrested a Hamas activist and former chemistry student
who stashed nearly a ton of explosives in his home right next to
Palestinian police headquarters on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin, meanwhile, acknowledged that
the Islamic militant group was having problems making good on
threats to carry out attacks against Israelis in retaliation for
the killing of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli soldiers last month.
	   Yassin said Palestinian and Israeli security forces had stepped
up their campaign against Hamas. However, a Hamas ``response will
come at the appropriate time, even if it is delayed,'' Yassin told
a news conference in Gaza City.

A return to the past _ Makah poised to resume whale hunting

<TEXT>
	   NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) _ For centuries, gray whale hunting was a
defining characteristic of the Makah Indian Tribe, which used every
part of the animal to help nurture the nation.
	   But the hunts ended some 70 years ago as demand for whale oil
brought the animals to the brink of extinction. Tribal members
these days admit they don't even know what whale meat tastes or
smells like.
	   They will soon get a chance to find out. The Makah are returning
to whaling, and have permission to hunt as early as Thursday.
Tribal members have been preparing for the event for months,
practicing on their 32-foot (9.75-meter) hand-hewn cedar canoe, the
Hummingbird.
	   Like their ancestors, they will paddle out and strike first with
a harpoon. But in a departure from tradition, they will use a
.50-caliber rifle to kill the whale and at least two motorized
boats to tow it home.
	   The hunters paddled their canoe out to within 50 yards (meters)
of a gray whale Wednesday in a ``dress rehearsal,'' said Keith
Johnson, head of the tribal whaling commission.
	   The coming hunt has been a cause of celebration for the
2,200-member tribe. The would-be whalers feel they are helping to
unify their community, which is struggling with a jobless rate of
55 percent, faltering fishing runs and a changing logging industry.
	   ``I'm hearing drumming from houses where I never thought I'd
hear drumming,'' says crew member Darrell Markishtum.
	   Not everyone is celebrating the resumption of the tradition.
	   A candlelight vigil for the whales was held Wednesday in Port
Angeles, 50 miles (80 kilometers) east. ``Please help save the
whales,'' read a flier handed out by the dozens of people who
gathered downtown. It declared Wednesday ``the last free day for
whales.''
	   A lawsuit filed by conservation groups was rejected in court in
September. Some mainstream environmental groups do not oppose the
hunt, saying commercial whaling is more of a threat.
	   But the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a Los Angeles group
that prides itself on ``interventions'' to save whales from
commercial whalers, has vowed to disrupt the hunt. The Coast Guard
said it will enforce a 500-yard (meter) protective zone around the
Makah as they hunt.
	   The Makah live 120 miles (190 kilometers) from Seattle at the
northwesternmost point of the continental United States.
	   For thousands of years, the Makah gleaned a life from the
Pacific and the forested Northwestern coast, taking berries, roots,
deer and elk from the land, and shellfish, salmon, halibut, seal
and whale from the sea.
	   Gray whales, which grow up to 50 feet (15 meters) and can weigh
40 tons, were prime targets as they migrated to Alaska in the
spring and Mexico in the fall.
	   The Makah would paddle out in canoes and spear the whale
repeatedly with cedar harpoons with mussel-shell points and barbs.
The harpoons had ropes connected to air-filled sealskin bladders,
which would act as floats, allowing the Makah to track the whale
and drive it to exhaustion.
	   Before petroleum refining, whale blubber was widely used for
lamp oil, and the arrival of New England whalers in the 1800s
ultimately reduced the whale's numbers from an estimated 30,000 to
4,000 early this century.
	   The Makah stopped whaling in the 1920s when the often fruitless
hunts began taking them farther from shore. In 1973 gray whales
were put on the first Endangered Species List.
	   The gray whale population has since climbed back to about
22,000, and the animal was removed from the Endangered Species List
in 1994, prompting the Makah to reassert the whaling rights they
were granted in an 1855 treaty.
	   The International Whaling Commission approved the hunt nearly a
year ago, allowing the tribe to take up to five whales a year from
1998 through 2002.
	   Under Makah protocols, meat and oil from each kill must be
distributed to tribal members before another whale is taken.
	   Since none of the Makahs has whaled, the ones who will go on the
hunt met last winter with Eskimo whalers from Alaska and Russia to
learn how it is done.
	   For months, the Makah whalers have gathered before dawn to
practice paddling with slim, hand-carved paddles of cedar or yew.
On the water, the eight-man crew sings whaling songs that help set
the pace or urge the whale to swim closer to shore.
	   Though modern technology _ the rifle, a steel harpoon _ will
give the Makah some advantages, the hunt is still risky. New
England whalers called the gray whale ``devil fish'' for its
tendency to fight rather than flee. And the sea is cold and rough.
	   ``I would say the whale definitely has the advantage,'' said
Coast Guard Cmdr. Rich Coster. ``Whales are very dangerous when
they're wounded,'' he said, adding that the man firing the rifle
``better make the first shot count.''

Mahathir plans dinner for 50,000 to celebrate Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is
planning a dinner for 50,000 people to thank all the Malaysians who
helped in organizing the Commonwealth Games, the national news
agency said Thursday.
	   Saturday's dinner at the Bukit Jalil Stadium, the main venue for
the 10-day games that ended Sept. 21, will cost the treasury 2
million ringgit (dlrs 530,000), Bernama news agency said.
	   Although political developments and the arrest of former deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim distracted from the success of the
Games, Mahathir has insisted on celebrating.
	   Despite street protests and demonstrations demanding his
resignation, he declared a holiday on Sept. 28 in honor of the
national squad's 10 gold, 14 silver and 12 bronze medals. Malaysia
stood fourth in the overall medal tally.
	   Mahathir plans to present prizes worth 2.2 million ringgit (dlrs
580,000) to the medal winners.

Palestinians arrest man linked to Hamas bomb factory

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence officials said
Thursday they had arrested a Hamas activist and former chemistry
student who stashed nearly a ton of explosives in his home right
next to Palestinian police headquarters on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin, meanwhile, acknowledged that
the Islamic militant group was having problems making good on
threats to carry out attacks against Israelis in retaliation for
the killing of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli soldiers last month.
	   Yassin said Palestinian and Israeli security forces had stepped
up their campaign against Hamas. However, a Hamas ``response will
come at the appropriate time, even if it is delayed,'' Yassin told
reporters in Gaza City.
	   In Israeli-controlled downtown Hebron, troops enforced a curfew
imposed after an assailant, apparently a Palestinian, threw two
hand grenades at Israeli troops Wednesday, injuring 11 soldiers and
11 Palestinian passersby.
	   Israeli soldiers also sealed the Palestinian-run parts of town,
barring Palestinians from entering or leaving. Hebron is home to
450 Jewish settlers and 130,000 Palestinians.
	   The assailant escaped into the Palestinian-controlled sector,
apparently after being shot in the leg by an Israeli soldier.
Israel filed a sharp protest with the Palestinian Authority, saying
it must do more to catch the fugitive.
	   Coming amid U.S. efforts to conclude agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the attack boosted Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is not cracking down hard enough on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not hand over more West Bank land
until the Palestinians rein in militants.
	   The Hamas bomb factory was located in a two-story home just
several yards (meters) from Palestinian police headquarters, a
fortress-like building on a hill on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   During a raid Monday, some 800 kilos (1,760 pounds) of
explosives were seized and a resident of the building, Hisham
Sharabati, was arrested, a Palestinian intelligence official said
Thursday.
	   Sharabati is a former chemistry student who spent 10 months in
an Israeli jail, said his father Hamdan. The elder Sharabati denied
that his son had hidden explosives in the ground-floor storage
area. Hamdan Sharabati said his son sold cosmetics and stored some
of the materials used in making the merchandise in the house.
	   Sharabati's brother, Adel, was briefly detained for questioning,
but released.
	   Israel has been on heightened alert for the past three weeks
following renewed threats by Hamas, an Islamic militant group, to
carry out suicide bombings in retaliation for the killing of two
Hamas fugitives by Israeli troops.
	   Over the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur, which ended at sundown
Wednesday, Israel sealed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to prevent possible violence. The closure was gradually eased
on Thursday to allow several thousand Palestinians to return to
jobs in Israel.
	   Also Thursday, Netanyahu briefed his Cabinet on his meetings in
the United States with Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton
earlier this week.
	   Israeli and U.S. officials have been upbeat, suggesting that
Israel and the Palestinians had basically resolved their
differences on an Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent of the
West Bank.
	   Under a compromise, 3 percent of that land is to be set aside as
a nature reserve in which Israel retains control over security.
	   However, Palestinian negotiators said Wednesday that some
differences remained. Hassan Abdel Rahman, the Palestinian
representative in Washington, said one point of contention was
whether Palestinian police could enter the nature reserve.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. envoy Dennis
Ross are to return to the region Tuesday to prepare another Mideast
summit in Washington in mid-October, Palestinian negotiators said.

Guilty verdict in kidnapping and murder of businessman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A city court convicted a father and
son Thursday on charges relating to the kidnapping of two members
of a wealthy German family and the murder of one.
	   Rainer Koerppen, 50, was sentenced to life imprisonment for one
count of murder and two counts of kidnapping. His son, 28-year-old
Sven, was sentenced to 12 years in prison for one count of
kidnapping, one of accessory to kidnapping and one of accessory to
murder.
	   The Koerppens were charged in the kidnapping and murder of
businessman Jakub Fiszman in 1996, and in the 1991 kidnapping of
Fiszman's 6-year-old nephew. Rainer Koerppen once worked as a house
painter for the Fiszman family.
	   Fiszman, 40, was kidnapped outside his Frankfurt office on Oct.
1, 1996. The next day, he called relatives to arrange a ransom
payment. It was the last they heard from him.
	   Fiszman's brother, Georg, paid 4 million marks (dlrs 2.6
million) ransom on Oct. 10. On Oct. 18, police found the money
buried in the garden of Rainer Koerppen's parents in Wiesbaden.
Police arrested the Koerppens the next day.
	   The Koerppens also are charged with kidnapping Georg Fiszman's
son and one of his son's friends in 1991. Peter Fiszman, 6 years
old at the time, and his playmate were kidnapped in Cologne.
	   Prosecutors say the kidnappers demanded 2 million marks (dlrs
1.3 million) ransom and sent a photograph of the children standing
in front of a cellar wall. The children were returned unharmed two
days later.
	   The case was unsolved at the time. Prosecutors will not say
whether the Fiszman family paid the ransom money.

Philippine stocks fall sharply on Wall Street slide; index down 2.6
</HEADLINE>
percent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks moved sharply lower
Thursday in a broad sell-off triggered by the steep fall on Wall
Street overnight, traders said.
	   The peso, meanwhile, closed slightly higher against the dollar,
underpinned by relatively light demand for the U.S. currency.
	   Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities, said there was
little activity in the stock market, with most participants content
to cash profits racked up in the previous three days.
	   ``We're all just waiting for the next shoe to fall,'' said Kane,
who expects further profit-taking to hound the market.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index dropped 32.32
points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,227.32 after gaining 21.47 points
Wednesday.
	   The broader All Shares Index fell 8.23 points to 407.40
following a 6.53-point gain Wednesday.
	   Losers trounced gainers 59 to 23, while 34 remained unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co., the day's most actively
traded stock, accounted for 63 percent of total trades, and closed
down 15 pesos (34 cents), or 1.6 percent, at 905 pesos (dlrs
20.57).
	   Lourdes Dipasupil, research head of RCBC Securities, said a
number of unresolved issues, such as the Philippine Airlines'
closure and a growing number of loan delinquencies, were capping
the market's advance.
	   ``There's still a lot of overhang,'' she said.
	   Banking stocks fell on worries that an impending increase in
their reserve requirement would boost non-performing loans.
	   The central bank has ordered banks to increase their reserves to
17 percent from 15 percent effective Friday to siphon off around 22
billion pesos (dlrs 500 million) in excess liquidity.
	   The central bank is worried banks would use the funds to
speculate in the currency market.
	   The dollar averaged 43.974 pesos for the day, down from 44.027
pesos on Wednesday. It reached a day-high of 44.050 pesos and
closed at 43.950 pesos.
	   The weaker Japanese yen pushed the dollar over the sensitive
level of 44 pesos in early transactions. But a lack of demand for
the dollar at that level saw bids rolled back in later trading.
	   Market watchers believe the increase in the reserve requirement
of commercial banks will not have a marked impact on currency
trading.
	   The effect of the increase will also be lessened by a
two-percentage point cut in the central bank's overnight borrowing
and lending rates, effective Friday. The overnight borrowing rate,
its main tool to control domestic liquidity, is currently 16
percent and the overnight lending rate is 18 percent.

El Al: Israeli cargo plane carried nerve gas component
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam
in 1992 was carrying a chemical that reportedly can be used in
making the nerve gas sarin, an airline official confirmed Thursday.
	   El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman told The Associated Press that
``the plane was carrying dimethyl methylphosphonate'' which
according to the Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad is a a key
component of sarin.
	   Klieman said the Dutch government has known this for six years
because the name of the chemical was listed on the cargo manifest
handed over by Israel shortly after the crash.
	   The cargo plane crashed into an apartment building, killing 43
people. Reports about weapons and dangerous chemicals aboard the
plane surfaced shortly afterwards.
	   This week, the NRC Handelsblad reported that the El Al plane was
carrying 50 gallons (190 liters) of dimethyl methylphosphonate. The
chemical can also be used as a flame retardant, and in the
manufacture of plastic.
	   The newspaper said the shipment was headed to Israel's
Biological Institute in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes Ziona. Recent
reports have said Israel was making chemical and biological weapons
there. The government has not commented on those claims.
	   Klieman confirmed that the intended recipient was listed on the
manifest, but would not comment whether it was the Biological
Institute.
	   Israel's Civil Aviation Authority is to look into the report,
according to Transport Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadiah. He said
Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom did not order a new investigation
of the crash; rather, only a check into the specific claim about
nerve gas components.
	   Klieman said El Al transports all materials in accordance with
international regulations. He said the chemical dimethyl
methylphosphonate is approved for transport on both passenger and
cargo planes.
	   Ovadiah said Israel turned over all cargo manifests to the
Netherlands after the crash. Referring to the reports about nerve
gas components, he said there is ``nothing new here, but we're
checking it anyway.''

Nigeria's Abubakar pushes reforms, new role in world community
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Saying Nigeria cannot remain a ``toddler''
in the world community, the country's military ruler said Thursday
he was committed to moving this West African nation toward a major
role in international affairs.
	   Speaking on the anniversary of Nigeria's 1960 independence from
Britain, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar said Nigeria's new foreign
policy was ``aimed at ensuring that our country resumes its
rightful place as an accepted and respected member of the world
community.''
	   Abubakar, who just returned from a trip to Britain, France, the
United States and a speech before the U.N. General Assembly, has
been trying to shift Nigeria away from its pariah status under the
rule of his predecessor, the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abacha's record of human rights abuses had left the country
politically isolated, with junta leaders unable even to travel to
many countries because of visa restrictions that had been placed
upon them.
	   Abubakar, however, stressed that a new era was upon Nigeria and
that Africa's most populous nation must mature into a global
player.
	   ``We cannot remain toddlers forever in the global community,''
Abubakar said in the nationwide television broadcast early Thursday
morning, adding Nigeria must ``finally begin to fulfill our great
destiny which fate has thrust on use as the world's largest black
nation.''
	   Abubakar, who was thrust to power in early June following
Abacha's sudden death by a heart attack, has quickly shifted the
country's direction, freeing political prisoners, welcoming foreign
envoys and announcing presidential elections and a shift to
civilian rule next year.
	   Abubakar also used the speech to announce the closure of a major
source of corrupt profits for Nigeria's junta.
	   He said the dual exchange rate system _ which allowed the junta
and it's cronies to purchase foreign currency at deeply reduced
prices _ would be discontinued by the beginning of next year.
	   The system was greatly abused during Abacha's rule, and his
family, friends and allies used the loophole to buy millions of
dollars in foreign currency at a fraction of their value. It was
also a major target of criticism among Nigeria's political
opposition as well as potential investors and international
lenders.
	   Abubakar, who said he had also been holding discussions with a
number of potential lender countries, said the dual system would be
replaced by a market-determined rate.
	   In the dual exchange rate system, the government purchased
dollars at a rate of 22 naira to 1 U.S. dollar. On the open market,
one dollar sells for about 80 naira.
	   The system was manipulated by junta officials to enable them to
funnel away profits for themselves.
	   Nigeria's economy all but came to a halt during Abacha's tenure,
dragged down by widespread corruption and mismanagement.
	   Abubakar also warned, though, that decreases in oil prices would
mean that Nigeria's budget would have to be redrawn, and warned of
belt-tightening.
	   Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer and the
petroleum industry is responsible for the vast majority of its
foreign earnings.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army said Thursday six
soldiers were killed and seven wounded in heavy fighting along the
Albanian border, heightening concern the Kosovo conflict could
spill over into a regional conflict.
	   International efforts to halt the bloodshed have taken on new
urgency after reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in
the embattled Serbian province, where Albanians form 90 percent of
the 2-million-strong population.
	   Britain has called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council on Thursday to discuss the fighting that has left hundreds
dead and forced at least 275,000 to flee.
	   The United States and other leading nations were also meeting
Friday in London on Kosovo. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Defense Secretary William Cohen planned to brief U.S. senators
on the massacres later Thursday in Washington.
	   Yugoslav sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
ethnic Albanian rebels from the Kosovo Liberation Army, apparently
operating from sanctuaries in Albania, attacked soldiers and border
guards Wednesday morning.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, Interior Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga said the fighting raged for nearly three hours about
300 meters (yards) inside Yugoslav territory. There were about a
hundred Serb soldiers.
	   Bizhga said five mortars exploded on Albanian territory near the
police station in the border village of Padesh. The ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence for Kosovo from Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and European powers fear the conflict could
spread to other southern Balkan countries with large ethnic
Albanian communities. The brutality of the Kosovo conflict, in
which both sides have been accused of atrocities, has added new
impetus to international efforts to halt the carnage.
	   In the latest purported atrocity, residents of Golubovac said
Wednesday that Serb forces surrounded a pocket of refugees last
Saturday and singled out at least 13 men to kill. They said the
victims were already buried, but pointed to saucer-sized pools of
dried blood and empty cartridges in front of a fence where they
said the refugees were shot.
	   Farmer Naim Hodzaj said in addition to the executions, Serb
police had killed several other men individually, including his
37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with gasoline and set
on fire. His brother's burned body lay on a path on the edge of the
woods.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac, including those of
women and children.
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are
among the most gruesome developments since the offensive began in
February.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanian accounts.
But Britain and Austria urged an international investigation into
what Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the
``bestial'' massacre at Obrija, which the Serbs call Gornje
Obrinje.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
retreat to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders and the Red Cross declared a day of
mourning today in honor of a volunteer doctor killed in Kosovo.
	   Sheptim Robaj, an ethnic Albanian doctor working for the Red
Cross, died Wednesday after his vehicle hit a land mine.
	   In a separate incident, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Serb
police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles Tuesday in Vranic in
southwestern Kosovo. The New York organization said one of its
researchers saw the bodies of four ethnic Albanian men who had been
killed, including one whose face had been mutilated.
	   A U.N. spokesman in Belgrade said fighting was still going on
near Suva Reka, southwest of Pristina, but the pullback was
continuing.
	   ``It appears there is a methodical, gradual withdrawal of the
military under way,'' said the spokesman, who gave his name as J.
Carter.

Malaysian police investigate how journalists got interviews
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian police traveled to
Singapore on Thursday to interview journalists about how they
obtained interviews with jailed politician Anwar Ibrahim and his
wife.
	   ``They had a list of questions wanting us to characterize the
interviews and how we obtained them,'' said Chris Blackman, vice
president of news programming for CNBC Asia, a regional network.
``We said we were not going to comment on any of our news
gathering.''
	   Anwar was fired as deputy prime minister and finance minister
Sept. 2, when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad called him morally
unfit. After leading a series of rallies calling for Mahathir's
retirement, Anwar was arrested Sept. 20. He appeared in court
Tuesday with bruised face, neck and arms and pleaded innocent to
charges of sodomy and abuse of power.
	   Police are investigating a possible case of sedition against
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, because of her Sept. 21 interview with
CNBC. She had expressed fears for her husband's health and
mentioned rumors that police might infect him with the HIV virus to
prove allegations of homosexuality. Anwar was held for nine days
without access to his lawyers or family under a law that allows
indefinite detention without charge.
	   On Thursday, police summoned Azizah for the third time to
headquarters to question her about the comments. She described it
as ``harassment and persecution.''
	   Her lawyer, Sivarasa Rasiah, said he also was questioned. ``The
Bar Council might have something to say about this later because
defense attorneys are not expected to be interrogated by the
police,'' he said.
	   The police first contacted Singapore-based CNBC last week,
asking that the journalists come to Malaysia, said Blackman.
	   When they refused, the officers went to Singapore and
interviewed three news anchors for half an hour, Blackman said.
They wanted to know how the interview with Azizah, and one with
Anwar the day after he was fired, had been arranged, Blackman
added.
	   The officers, who were not from the capital, but from Johor, the
Malaysian city across the border from Singapore, never indicated
what crime they were investigating, Blackman said.
	   They took notes, and called the conversation an ``interview, not
a police report,'' Blackman said. He characterized the meeting as
``quite friendly, informal, casual.''

Local and foreign workers protest against layoffs, pay cuts
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ About 500 local and foreign workers staged a
peaceful rally in a downtown square Thursday to ask the government
to help the unemployed, a day after five major companies announced
they were cutting staff or salaries.
	   The protesters, including factory and construction workers,
civil servants, postal workers, social workers, health care
specialists and teachers, urged Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa to
increase government spending to create more jobs.
	   They also asked the government for more welfare for the
unemployed, and for stronger protection for workers' collective
bargaining rights.
	   ``Unite against pay cuts. Against staff cuts. Protect workers'
rights,'' they chanted.
	   Lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan, secretary-general of the Confederation
of Trade Unions, said the government hasn't done enough to hold
down soaring jobless rates.
	   ``The workers are worried,'' he told the gathering. ``We're
worried whether we can still put food on our tables next day.''
	   Lee warned of more social unrest as unemployment shoots beyond
the current level of 5 percent, low for many countries but a
15-year high in this territory, mired in recession. More companies
are closing down, and others are firing staff and lowering wages to
stay afloat.
	   ``The government is pushing Hong Kong toward social instability.
It's playing with fire,'' he said.
	   On Wednesday, four major companies, including the territory's
flagship air carrier Cathay Pacific and filmmaker Golden Harvest,
announced they were laying off a total of 243 workers.
	   Listed luxury retailer Dickson Concepts also announced wage cuts
averaging 10 percent for its 1,600 workers.
	   Dickson's decision came two weeks after one of Hong Kong's
largest private employers, Hong Kong Telecommunications, announced
10 percent across-the-board salary reductions for its 13,800
employees.
	   About 1,500 workers protested outside the company's headquarters
one evening, and the company later withdrew the plan. It is still
negotiating with unionists on cost-cutting measures.
	   About 200 of the demonstrators Thursday were foreign domestic
workers, mostly Filipinos, who were protesting against a municipal
councilor's proposal to cut their minimum monthly wage of U.S. dlrs
494 by 20 percent.
	   ``It's really unfair,'' said Christina Guinsatao of Manila, an
official of Women Migrants Organization. ``Why should we take the
burden? We're the lowest earners in Hong Kong.''
	   Guinsatao, 37, said her unemployed husband and four young
children would not be able to survive if the government accepts the
proposal.
	   ``Don't sanction exploitation,'' one banner said.
	   Alice Lee, 30, who recently lost her job of 12 years as a pager
service operator, said she is growing increasingly impatient with
the government.
	   ``The government has done nothing. Nothing,'' said Lee, who's
making 40 percent less at her new job as a clerk.

Hungarian minority party won't leave the Romanian government yet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Hungarian party leader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The Hungarian minority party will
postpone a decision on whether to leave the Romanian government and
the ruling coalition, the party's leader said Thursday.
	   The Hungarians had threatened to pull out unless a solution to a
political standoff over a Hungarian-language state university could
be found by Wednesday.
	   But late Wednesday the government offered a compromise, saying
it would set up a Hungarian-German university called
Petofi-Schiller. The government asked the education minister to
prepare a report by mid November.
	   The Hungarians responded positively to the offer, but said the
final decision would be made at the party's national meeting, which
is to be held Saturday.
	   ``New elements have appeared which might change our former
decision of leaving the government,'' Bela Marko, head of the
Hungarian party, said at a news conference.
	   The Union of Democratic Hungarians which represents the
interests of Romania's 1.7 million Hungarians was promised the
university in 1996, but the government backed after parliament
blocked the legislation to set it up.
	   Romanian lawmakers refer to bitter historical disputes and say
that European norms do not require the Hungarians to have their own
state university. Transylvania has changed hands over the
centuries. There are a few thousand ethnic Germans living in
Romania.
	   Marko said earlier this week that the party would definitely
withdraw from the government and coalition if they didn't get their
Hungarian university.
	   In 1996, the coalition agreed to set up a Hungarian-language
university, but parliament's upper house refused to approve the
necessary modification to the existing education law.

Vienna university dissected bodies of Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Doctors and medical students at Vienna
University dissected nearly 1,400 bodies executed on orders of Nazi
courts and some victims' body parts remained on display up to this
year, researchers announced Thursday.
	   The bodies _ including those of eight Jews and hundreds of
others executed for resisting the Nazis _ were transferred to the
university's anatomy institute for research and teaching purposes,
said the authors of a report examining the role of the medical
faculty during Nazi rule in Austria.
	   The bodies came from the execution chambers of the main Vienna
court and not from Nazi death camps, as had been alleged, the
report said.
	   The report is the latest of a growing number of investigations
of this country and its institutions after Adolf Hitler
incorporated the land of his birth into Nazi Germany in 1938.
	   After World War II, Austria depicted itself as a victim of the
Nazis. But that image has been tarnished in recent years as
evidence piles up that many Austrians were eager co-participants in
Nazi atrocities.
	   Research into the medical faculty began last year, after
allegations that a highly acclaimed and popular anatomy atlas used
the bodies of Holocaust victims as the basis of highly detailed
drawings.
	   On Thursday, the researchers said those suspicions could not be
confirmed, although it was possible that bodies transferred by
court order after being executed by the Nazis in Vienna could have
served as models.
	   The atlas, ``Topographical Anatomy of the Human Being,'' was
compiled by Eduard Pernkopf, a leading Nazi who headed the
university's medical faculty after Hitler annexed Austria. Pernkopf
served as university rector from 1943 to 1945 and continued
updating the atlas until his death in 1955.
	   The report was commissioned by the university after the
Holocaust museum in Jerusalem asked for an investigation into the
Pernkopf book.
	   Vienna University Rector Alfred Ebenbauer cited ``our own
indifference and cowardice,'' in criticizing the time that elapsed
between the Nazi era and publication of the report, plus the fact
that it was drawn up only after outsiders asked for the
investigation.
	   Medical Faculty Dean Woflgang Schuetz said the investigation
came ``a generation too late.''
	   The report said that of the approximately 1,400 bodies
transferred to the anatomy institute by the courts between 1938 and
1945, about half were of victims executed for ``resisting the Nazi
regime.''
	   Of the hundreds of specimens remaining from that time, more than
200 were either established as having been remnants of Nazi victims
or are suspected as such, the report said. They were removed from
display and will be properly buried.
	   Some of the specimens were organs and body parts of physically
or mentally handicapped infants found deficient and killed by Nazi
doctors. Neurologist Heinrich Gross, accused of participating in
the killings and using the remains of the victims for research up
to the mid 1960s is being investigated on possible murder charges.
	   Austria's s new frankness began in 1988, when the 50th
anniversary of Hitler's annexation coincided with the furor
surrounding then-President Kurt Waldheim and his concealed past as
an intelligence officer in the German army during World War II.
	   Best-selling books, a recent documentary film and touring
exhibit have underscored the new interest in reexamining the Nazi
era. One book, ``Hitler's Vienna,'' traces how the Austrian capital
of the early 20th Century fed and formed the Nazi leader's views.
	   The film, titled in English ``East of Eden,'' reveals that
ordinary Austrian soldiers serving in Hitler's army knew of mass
executions and witnessed torture and looting on the eastern front _
denting the myth that only special units like the dreaded SS
perpetrated atrocities.
	   Questions about Pernkopf's anatomy book arose in 1995 when Yad
Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, approached Vienna
University and the Austrian government, asking whether Holocaust
victims were depicted in the atlas.
	   Last fall, physicians pressed the issue in letters published in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, questioning
whether use of the book was ethically proper.
	   In early editions of the atlas, swastikas and SS lightning-bolt
symbols were part of some of the artists' signatures. Those Nazi
emblems were airbrushed out of later editions.

Lisbon stock exchange suspends trading as shares plummet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Lisbon Stock Exchange suspended
trading for one hour and 45 minutes Thursday after the market went
into a tailspin, with the benchmark BVL-30 index plunging more than
14 percent in early business.
	   The exchange did not give specific reasons for the suspension,
but brokers said it was called because of panic selling as
investors rushed to unload shares amid a generalized fall across
world markets.
	   The sell-off drove the BVL-30 down by more than 567 points, or
14.4 percent, to 3373.9 points.
	   Powered by the government's privatization program, which drew
thousands of new private investors to the market, and a thriving
economy, the BVL-30 hit an all-time record high of 6176.89 points
in April.
	   Meanwhile, selling pressure on the Portuguese escudo triggered
intervention by the central bank to prop up the currency, according
to Lisbon traders who said investors were moving into ``safe
haven'' currencies like the Deutschmark.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stock prices plunged from Asia to Europe on
Thursday, with traders nervously selling shares in response to the
drop on Wall Street that pushed the Dow Jones industrial average
below 8,000 points.
	   Blue chips in London sank to new lows for the year, while prices
in Frankfurt were off by more than 5 percent in early dealings
following losses in Asia that pushed Tokyo shares to fresh 12-year
lows.
	   Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock
Exchange nosedive on Wednesday, even though the U.S. central bank
had eased interest rates a day earlier by a quarter-point. Many had
been looking for a bigger cut.
	   Investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall Street could
signal a possible slowdown in economic growth _ a bad omen for the
many foreign companies dependent on exports to the huge U.S.
market.
	   ``There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a
direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high
percentage of their earnings from overseas markets,'' said Pelham
Smithers, a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd.
	   In London, Europe's biggest market, the Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was off 129.3 points, or 2.6 percent, at
4,935.1 in the early afternoon, tumbling through the 5,000-point
level that had been undercut only briefly last month.
	   Frankfurt traders pushed the electronic Xetra DAX index down by
5.4 percent to a 14-month low of 4,189.47 points on fears of a
global recession. In Paris, the CAC 40 dropped 3.6 percent, while
Milan's MIB30 index was off 4.3 percent.

Russian grain harvest down sharply so far this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's grain harvest is down 47 percent so far
this year, agricultural officials said Thursday, supporting
predictions that this will be Russia's worst harvest in decades.
	   As of Thursday, the grain harvest totaled 43 million metric tons
(47 tons), down from 91 million metric tons (100 tons) last year,
according to Agriculture Ministry figures reported by the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   The ministry blamed the poor production partly on late September
rains that hampered the harvest. Many regions are still harvesting
their crops, even as snow is beginning to blanket portions of the
country.
	   Agricultural officials have already said they expect to harvest
only 56 million metric tons (62 tons) of grain this year, the
lowest since the 54.9 million-ton (60.5 million-ton) harvest of
1957.
	   Although the poor harvest comes at a terrible time, when
Russia's economic crisis makes imports far more expensive, the
government has insisted that it has sufficient grain and other food
reserves to get the country through the winter.

Woman poses as Padre Pio's 'spiritual daughter'

 &UR; Eds: updates with details of some victims, corrects age of Malerba

<TEXT>
	   BARI, Italy (AP) _ A women who posed as the ``spiritual
daughter'' of the late Italian mystic Padre Pio faces charges of
defrauding his believers of hundreds of thousands of dollars with
promises to cast out their devils or deliver miracle cures.
	   The case illustrates the power of Padre Pio, who has a worldwide
following that attracts millions of visitors to his tomb near Bari
every year.
	   Padre Pio was a Capuchin monk who skyrocketed to fame in 1918
when he began to bleed from his hands, feet and side, the first
priest in centuries to show signs of the stigmata.
	   Thirty years after his death, Padre Pio's followers still credit
him with miracles, intercessions and supernatural powers; many say
a powerful scent of flowers signals his spirtual presence.
	   The ANSA news agency said Filomena Malerba, a 61-year-old Bari
housewife, is believed by authorities to have traded on the Padre
Pio legend for three years, posing as his ``spiritual daughter''
and infiltrating a group of devotees.
	   Malerba _ with the help of a friend -- is suspected of cheating
people out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. Both women are
under house arrest, ANSA said.
	   When police raided Malerba's house, it said, they found huge
sums of money, jewelry and objects made of silver and gold her
victims had given her in payment.
	   ANSA said the alleged victims included a woman suffering from
leukemia, another whose son had tried to commit suicide and a third
who was depressed because of marital problems.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The army's bomb-disposal squad
neutralized an unexploded hand grenade outside the Israeli embassy
Thursday, officials said, and police suspect it was part of a

	   The grenade was found on the street, under a parked car, and
police cordoned off the whole neighborhood around the embassy

Government considers Soviet-style economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with deputy trade minister's comments, economic plan
to parliament next week. ADDS context. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos MOSB101-102 &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government discussed a plan Thursday that
would prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars and other hard
currencies and would greatly increase the number of rubles in
circulation.
	   President Boris Yeltsin discussed the plan with a visiting
regional governor, who proposed banning the free circulation of the
dollar and introducing a so-called gold ruble, which would be tied
to the country's gold reserves.
	   The Russian government has allowed the U.S. dollar and other
currencies to circulate freely since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, and Russia now has more dollars in its economy than any
country besides the United States, according to U.S. officials.
	   It's not yet clear if the new proposals will be approved. They
are designed to help the government maintain its own hard currency
reserves, and if implemented, would greatly restrict the flow of
foreign currencies in the Russian economy.
	   Liberal economists have warned that such measures would
inevitably spur the black currency market and could do even more
damage to the crumbling Russian economy.
	   Opening a Cabinet session Thursday, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said the government had already paid off some of its
long-running wage debts, including 1.4 billion rubles (dlrs 87
million) owed to the military.
	   Primakov also said that the government on Thursday had paid
money to defense industry workers, sent subsidies to the ailing
coal industry and allocated money in overdue students' stipends.
	   He didn't say where the government, which collected only half of
the planned amount of taxes last month, had found the funds.
	   Yeltsin, meanwhile, met with Gov. Eduard Rossel of the Urals
region of Sverdlovsk. The two men discussed Rossel's plan for a
ruble backed by gold reserves. Russian news agencies initially
reported that Yeltsin favored the plan, but his spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin denied that.
	   The economic plan under consideration by the Cabinet sets an
ambitious spending program, including compensation to the poor for
steep price rises and generous subsidies to stagnant Russian
industries.
	   The blueprint, published in the respected business daily
Kommersant on Thursday, gives no clue as to where the money would
come from. The newspaper said the obvious answer would be the
generous printing of new money, which would increase inflation.
	   Combined with currency controls, an increased money supply would
devastate the consumer market, which has already been hit hard by
the ruble's devaluation, critics say.
	   ``If they print new money, that will only make goods disappear
from the shelves,'' Kommersant said.
	   Hoping to avoid the further fall of the ruble, the government's
plan calls for tight currency controls. It would ban Russians from
buying hard currency or taking more than dlrs 500 abroad.
	   It also envisages a greater government role in determining the
ruble's exchange rate. The government would take into account
Russia's balance of payments, the size of the Central Bank's
foreign exchange and gold reserves, and the inflation rate.
	   In order to prop up the ruble, the plan would also virtually ban
commercial banks from hard currency speculation, oblige exporters
to sell most of their hard-currency earnings at the
government-controlled rate and shut loopholes allowing them to keep
hard currency abroad.
	   At a news conference, Deputy Trade Minister Ivan Gorbachev
acknowledged that currency controls would deal a harsh blow to
shuttle traders, who account for a large share of imports of
consumer goods. About 15 million people, or more than one tenth of
Russia's population, work as shuttle traders or are employed by
them, he said.
	   The plan also calls for the nationalization of some Russian
commercial banks and using their assets to provide credits to
industries.
	   The document has been drafted by a group of economists led by
Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in
charge of economic strategy.
	   The plan is to be sent to parliament early next week.

Vienna university dissected bodies of Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Doctors and medical students at Vienna
University dissected nearly 1,400 bodies executed on orders of Nazi
courts and some victims' body parts remained on display up to this
year, researchers announced Thursday.
	   The bodies _ including those of eight Jews and hundreds of
others executed for resisting the Nazis _ were transferred to the
university's anatomy institute after death for research and
teaching purposes, said the authors of a report examining the role
of the medical faculty during Nazi rule in Austria.
	   The bodies came from the execution chambers of the main Vienna
court and not from Nazi death camps, as had been alleged.
	   The report is the latest of a growing number of investigations
into the country and its institutions under Adolf Hitler. Austria,
annexed by Nazi Germany just before the war, for decades was
depicted as a victim of the Nazis. But that role has been tarnished
in recent years as evidence piles up that many Austrians were eager
co-participants in Nazi atrocities.
	   Research into the medical faculty began last year, after
allegations that a highly acclaimed and popular anatomy atlas used
the bodies of Holocaust victims as the basis of highly detailed
drawings. On Thursday, the researchers said those suspicions could
not be confirmed, although it was possible that bodies transferred
by court order after being executed by the Nazis in Vienna could
have served as models.
	   The atlas, ``Topographical Anatomy of the Human Being,'' was
compiled by Eduard Pernkopf, a leading Nazi who headed the
university's medical faculty after Hitler annexed Austria in 1938.
Pernkopf served as university rector from 1943 to 1945 and
continued updating the atlas until his death in 1955.
	   The report was commissioned by the university after the
Holocaust museum in Jerusalem asked for an investigation into the
Pernkopf book.
	   Vienna University Rector Alfred Ebenbauer cited ``our own
indifference and cowardice,'' in criticizing the time that elapsed
between the Nazi era and publication of the report, plus the fact
that it was drawn up only after outsiders asked for the
investigation.
	   Medical Faculty Dean Woflgang Schuetz said the investigation
came ``a generation too late.''
	   The report said that of the approximately 1,400 bodies
transferred to the anatomy institute by the courts between 1938 and
1945, about half were of victims executed for ``resisting the Nazi
regime.''
	   Of the hundreds of specimens remaining from that time, more than
200 were either established as having been remnants of from Nazi
victims or are suspected as such, the report said. They were
removed from display and will be properly buried.
	   Some of the specimens were organs and body parts of physically
or mentally handicapped infants found deficient and killed by Nazi
doctors. Neurologist Heinrich Gross, accused of participating in
the killings and using the remains of the victims for research up
to the mid 1960s, is being investigated on possible murder charges.
	   Austria's s new frankness began in 1988, when the fiftieth
anniversary of Hitler's annexation of the country coincided with
the furor surrounding then-President Kurt Waldheim and his
concealed past as a soldier in the German army in World War II.
	   Best-selling books, a recent documentary film and touring
exhibit early this year have underscored the new interest in
reexamining the Nazi era. One book, ``Hitler's Vienna,'' traces how
the Austrian capital of the early twentieth century fed and formed
the Nazi leader's views.
	   The film, titled in English ``East of Eden,'' reveals that
ordinary Austrian soldiers serving in Hitler's army knew of mass
executions and witnessed torture and looting on the eastern front _
denting the myth that only special units like the dreaded SS
perpetrated atrocities.
	   Questions about Pernkopf's anatomy book arose in 1995 when Yad
Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, approached Vienna
University and the Austrian government, asking whether Holocaust
victims were depicted in the atlas.
	   Last fall, physicians pressed the issue in letters published in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, questioning
whether use of the book was ethically proper.
	   In early editions of the atlas, swastikas and SS lightning-bolt
symbols were part of some of the artists' signatures. Those Nazi
emblems were airbrushed out of later editions.

Sudan claims crushed Ugandan, Eritrean forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese troops are chasing Ugandan and
Eritrean forces out of Sudan after crushing them in battles in the
south of the country, the interior minister said.
	   ``The army has now crushed the invaders and is only cleaning the
areas'' in the southern Eastern Equatoria province, Interior
Minister Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohammed Hussein told state-run
television Wednesday night.
	   The army ``has settled the matter against the Ugandan and
Eritrean aggression forces and are working to repulse them out of
our national borders,'' Hussein added.
	   Sudan has claimed that heavy clashes have been taking place in
southern Sudan since Sept. 14, when it said Ugandan and Eritrean
troops entered Sudan to support local rebel groups. Uganda and
Eritrea have denied the reports.
	   Hussein, speaking from the southern city of Juba, said Sudan
will become the ``graveyard for all outlaws and agents.''
	   Christian and Animist rebels have been waging a military
campaign against the Khartoum government since 1983 for more
autonomy for the southern districts.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to have received military
assistance from Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Both Uganda and the Sudanese government deny that they support
each other's insurgents.

Polish intellectuals oppose Zakopane bid for 2006 Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish intellectuals including two Nobel
laureates appealed Thursday for the government to drop the idea of
hosting the 2006 Winter Olympics in Zakopane.
	   ``There are places sacred for Polish culture, which one must not
trade,'' said 12 signatories of the appeal, published Thursday in
the daily Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
	   They included poets Wislawa Szymborska and Czeslaw Milosz, who
won Nobel Prizes in literature in 1996 and 1980 respectively, as
well as writers Stanislaw Lem and Ryszard Kapuscinski, and composer
Wojciech Kilar.
	   After the Olympics, the mountain resort near the border with
Slovakia will become ``garbage on the waste dump of our
civilization,'' said the letter addressed to Polish leaders and the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Zakopane, in the Tatra mountains 400 kilometers (250 miles)
south of Warsaw, made its bid in August to host the 2006 Olympics.
President Aleksander Kwasniewki and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek both
support the bid.
	   But environmentalists, intellectuals and some politicians oppose
the plan, arguing a mass sports event and its infrastructure would
ruin the natural environment of the region.
	   Much of the Zakopane area is in the Tatra National Park,
established in 1954 to protect plants and wildlife. It was
designated a natural reserve by UNESCO in 1992.
	   Tatra National Park features Kasprowy Wierch, which is Poland's
tallest mountain availalbe to skiers at 1,897 meters (6,557 feet).
It has two ski slopes, and park management has long resisted calls
to build more lifts, saying more skiers would damage the
environment.
	   Park directors argue that expanding the skiing area for the
Olympics would require cutting 10,000 trees in violation of an
environmental protection law.
	   ``We appeal for reason,'' the intellectuals said in their
letter. ``One must not break environmental laws and violate the
sacred character of the primeval harmony of the Tatra mountain
nature in order to achieve temporary gains.''
	   Kwasniewski, who headed the national Olympic committee from
1988-89, wants Poland to be the first post-communist country to
host the Games. The government and Zakopane officials believe
winning the bid would boost Poland's prestige and attract new
foreign investment.
	   Zakopane is one of six bidders for the 2006 Games. Others are
Sion, Switzerland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Turin, Italy; a joint
bid by Helsinki, Finland, and Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt,
Austria, making a three-country bid that includes regions of
Slovenia and Italy.

Palestinians arrest man linked to Hamas bomb factory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with clashes in Hebron, Arafat saying
Washington talks produced progress. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence said Thursday
they have arrested a Hamas activist and former chemistry student
who stashed nearly a ton of explosives in his home right next to
Palestinian police headquarters on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin acknowledged that the Islamic
militant group was having problems making good on threats to carry
out attacks against Israelis in retaliation for the killing of two
Hamas fugitives by Israeli soldiers last month.
	   Yassin said Palestinian and Israeli security forces had stepped
up their campaign against Hamas. However, a Hamas ``response will
come at the appropriate time, even if it is delayed,'' Yassin told
a news conference in Gaza City.
	   In Israeli-controlled center of Hebron, several dozen
Palestinian teen-agers hurled stones and firebombs at Israeli
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets and stun grenades. Two
Palestinians were injured.
	   The army had imposed a curfew on the downtown area Wednesday
after an assailant, apparently a Palestinian, threw two hand
grenades at Israeli troops, injuring 11 soldiers and 11 Palestinian
passersby.
	   In response to the grenade attack, Israeli soldiers also sealed
the Palestinian-run parts of town, barring Palestinians from
entering or leaving. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers and
130,000 Palestinians.
	   The assailant had escaped into the Palestinian-controlled
sector, apparently after being shot in the leg by an Israeli
soldier. Israel filed a sharp protest with the Palestinian
Authority, saying it must do more to catch the fugitive.
	   Coming amid U.S. efforts to conclude agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the attack boosted Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is not cracking down hard enough on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not hand over West Bank land until
the Palestinians rein in militants.
	   Arafat said Thursday that this week's top-level talks in
Washington have produced progress on a troop pullback. His positive
assessment appeared to contradict statements by Palestinian
negotiators who said little has been achieved in Washington.
	   Netanyahu briefed his Cabinet on the Washington talks.
	   The Hamas bomb factory was located in a two-story home just
several yards from Palestinian police headquarters, a fortress-like
building on a hill on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   During a raid Monday, some 800 kilos (1,800 pounds) of
explosives were seized and a resident of the building, Hisham
Sharabati, was arrested, a Palestinian intelligence official said
Thursday.
	   Sharabati is a former chemistry student who spent 10 months in
an Israeli jail, said his father Hamdan. The elder Sharabati denied
that his son had hidden explosives in the ground-floor storage
area. Hamdan Sharabati said his son sold cosmetics and stored some
of the materials used in making the merchandise in the house.
	   Sharabati's brother, Adel, was briefly detained for questioning,
but released.

Opposition politician stays away from Cambodian court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ An outspoken politician wanted for
questioning about anti-government demonstrations failed to appear
Thursday before a court investigating junior opposition leader Sam
Rainsy.
	   The Phnom Penh municipal court issued a summons last week to
Khem Sokha, former chairman of the Cambodian parliament's human
rights commission, but has been unable to deliver it.
	   After twice being prevented from leaving the country, Khem Sokha
has been in hiding for fear of arrest.
	   The threat of arrest has hung over the heads of opposition
politicians as negotiations continue with Hun Sen's ruling party
for the formation of a new government.
	   In elections July 26, Hun Sen won 64 of 122 seats in parliament,
but not the two-thirds needed to form the government alone.
	   The court is considering four charges against Sam Rainsy for his
prominent role in demonstrations that called for Hun Sen's ouster
following the elections. The opposition charged that intimidation
and fraud led to his victory. Khem Sokha also participated in the
protests.
	   Municipal Court Judge Mong Moni Chariya said the charges
included destruction of state property, incitement of violence and
incitement of racial hatred.
	   If a second summons for Khem Sokha is not answered, the judge
said, police would be ordered to bring the politician to court to
testify in the case against Sam Rainsy.
	   Cambodia's courts are widely seen as controlled by Hun Sen and
his ruling Cambodian People's Party.
	   Hun Sen called for the demonstration leaders' arrest after a
Sept. 7 grenade attack on his residence in the capital. He was not
home at the time and no one was injured.
	   A summons for questioning was issued for Sam Rainsy after the
attack, but also was never delivered to the former finance
minister, who took refuge at a United Nations office in Phnom Penh.
	   The opposition maintains that Hun Sen staged the grenade attack
as a pretext for cracking down on the street rallies.
	   Sam Rainsy gained immunity from prosecution last week when he
was sworn in as a member of parliament, an event that the judge
admitted was complicating efforts to try the opposition leader.
	   Sam Rainsy and the senior opposition party leader, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, have remained outside the country since the
ceremonial convening of parliament.
	   Sam Rainsy's party announced Wednesday that he would fly from
Bangkok to Washington on Thursday testify before the U.S. Senate
Foreign Relations Committee on Cambodia's political situation.
	   In a letter to Hun Sen released Thursday by Sam Rainsy, two U.S.
senators called on the Cambodian leader to respect the immunity of
opposition members of parliament and warned that they took ``a
personal interest'' in the safety of Khem Sokha.
	   Ranariddh has remained in Bangkok and does not plan to return to
Cambodia in the coming days unless the parliament reconvenes,
officials from his FUNCINPEC party said Thursday.
	   Ranariddh is taking a ``much-needed vacation, nothing related to
politics,'' FUNCINPEC spokesman Noranaridh Ananda Yath said.

Ford to cut 1,500 jobs in Spain over five years

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Ford automobile company in Spain plans
to cut 1,500 jobs at its Valencia factory over the next five years
following a union refusal to increase production, a company
spokesman said Thursday.
	   The spokesman noted that given the recent investment of 42
billion peseta (dlrs 300 million) investment in the new Focus
model, and the trade unions unwillingness to increase production,
Ford Espana has been forced to downsize its Valencia plant to
maintain efficiency.
	   Ford Espana, which employs 8,400 poeple, the unions had refused
to roduce 1,560 units of its two principal models _ the Focus and
the Ka.

Adams, Trimble remain at odds over IRA arsenal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The two politicians central to
making Northern Ireland's peace agreement work failed Thursday to
overcome their critical disagreement about Irish Republican Army
weaponry.
	   After a tense 75-minute meeting, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
said he ``cannot deliver'' weapons as the price for his IRA-allied
party's admission into a new cross-community administration for
Northern Ireland.
	   Emerging minutes later, Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble said he wouldn't let Sinn Fein take part in the
administration unless IRA commanders ``meet their side of the
bargain'' by starting to disarm in cooperation with an independent
commission.
	   The crisis illustrates one weakness of April's historic
agreement on how Catholics and Protestants should jointly govern
Northern Ireland:
	   To secure support from both Trimble and Adams _ polar opposites
in the long struggle over whether Northern Ireland should remain
part of Britain or unite with Ireland _ the agreement didn't set
specific deadlines for many important sections.
	   That has set the scene for a chronic argument over whether IRA
disarmament must start before other parts of the agreement kick in.
	   Trimble, chief representative of the north's British Protestant
majority, and moderate Catholic politician Seamus Mallon were
appointed in July to head the multi-party administration, which
will be drawn from Northern Ireland's new 108-seat Assembly.
	   According to the agreement, an administration of up to 12
members is supposed to take over many responsibilities from the
British government in February 1999. But Trimble has refused to
support Sinn Fein's eligibility to hold posts until the IRA starts
disarming.
	   Adams insists the accord does not require the IRA to start
disarming this year _ or at all. Its text committed Sinn Fein
members only to ``use any influence they may have'' to secure IRA
disarmament by May 2000.
	   Trimble just as steadfastly insists that the agreement set no
deadline for the administration to be fully formed either.
	   The accord's text, for example, leaves open the possibility that
Trimble and Mallon alone could represent the administration at its
first summit meeting with the Irish government, which the agreement
stipulated should happen by Oct. 31.
	   Mallon, whose Social Democratic and Labor Party is Sinn Fein's
moderate rival for Catholic votes, has criticized both Trimble and
Adams for mishandling the weapons issue.
	   He and SDLP leader John Hume met Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern in Dublin on Thursday to discuss how to resolve the deadlock.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The army's bomb-disposal squad
neutralized an unexploded hand grenade outside the Israeli embassy
Thursday, officials said, and police suspect it was part of a

	   The grenade was found on the street, under a parked car, and
police cordoned off the whole neighborhood around the embassy
before the bomb disposal squad arrived.
	   It was unclear why the grenade had not exploded, said an army

Grenade hits apartment of Greek Embassy official.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- A grenade was hurled at the apartment of a
Greek Consulate official in the southern town of Gjirokastra
Wednesday night, but no one was injured, the state news agency ATA
reported Thursday.
	   The incident happened at 10:25 p.m. (2025 GMT) when unidentified
people threw a grenade at the balcony of Eva Tsoliou, the secretary
of the consulate in Gjirokstra, a town 145 kilometers (90 miles)
south of capital Tirana.
	   ATA said a room was damaged but Tsoliou was not injured.
	   The southern town near the Greek border has often been the site
of explosions this year.
	   Police said they were investigating the latest incident.

Indonesia regrets Anwar's beating; presidential visit in doubt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A planned visit to Malaysia by
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie was in doubt Thursday following
allegations that police beat Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister after his arrest on sex charges.
	   State Secretary Akbar Tanjung voiced regret after Anwar
Ibrahim's claims of police brutality. However, he said the case had
not adversely affected relations with Malaysia.
	   Even so, he doubted Habibie would go ahead with a planned visit
to Kuala Lumpur this month.
	   Akbar, who is one of the government's top spokesmen, told
reporters the president had too many commitments at home.
	   The visit was to have been Habibie's first official overseas
trip as head of state since he replaced ex-President Suharto in May
following riots and protests.
	   ``Anwar was a former deputy prime minister and he is a leader
who should be respected,'' Akbar said. ``He like other citizens has
the right to be protected.''
	   Akbar said relations between the two Southeast Asian nations
remained good.
	   But ``it would be very difficult for the president to make a
visit at this time because the president has a very tight schedule
over the coming months,'' he said.
	   Anwar was fired by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
last month.
	   Bruises were apparent on his face when he appeared in court this
week. Anwar alleges police beat him until he fell unconscious after
his arrest.

Man sues president for pardoning his wife

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A man who complains that a
presidential pardon for his former wife ruined his relations with
his son is suing President Vaclav Havel for a symbolic dlrs 3, the
CTK news agency reported Thursday.
	   CTK said Havel has indicated he is willing to seek a settlement
but the man, Lubos Patera, wants to discuss the case with Havel
personally.
	   In 1993, Patera's former wife was sentenced to two years in
prison for abduction of their 2-year-old son from his home in 1991.
	   She appealed the verdict, but only a few days before an appeals
court was to convene Havel pardoned her.
	   The boy was kidnapped during a custody battle and is now with
Patera's former wife. Patera says she is neglecting the child and
obstructing his relations with his son.
	   He asks only for symbolic compensation of 100 koruna _
equivalent do dlrs 3.3 _ but wants to show the president that his
decision was ``highly immoral,'' CTK quoted him as telling a court.
	   The judge adjourned the trial after attorneys for both sides
indicated they may settle out of court.

Computer businessman gives money for permanent Hawking archive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAMBRIDGE, England (AP) _ Cambridge University received a dlrs
12.5 million gift from a Californian businessman to create a
science and technology library that will be home to physicist
Stephen Hawking's archives.
	   Gordon Moore, co-founder and former chairman of Santa
Clara-based Intel, the world's biggest maker of computer chips,
pledged the money to create what he hopes will be the most advanced
science library in Europe.
	   ``The University of Cambridge has a long history of doing
leading research into some of the most fundamental questions that
mankind can ask,'' Moore said. ``I find this exciting and uplifting
and am pleased to contribute where I can.''
	   Moore pledged the money through Cambridge's development office
in the United States.
	   Cambridge said the library would hold all of Hawking's papers
and electronic archive material, including an early draft of his
best-selling book, ``A Brief History of Time.''
	   Hawking, 56, is the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at
Cambridge, a post once held by Sir Isaac Newton.
	   Cambridge already houses the papers of Newton and Charles
Darwin.

Philippine president Estrada defends proposal to ban strikes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
on Thursday defended his support for a proposed ban on strikes
during economic crises, and rejected accusations that he was
veering toward strongman rule.
	   He said in radio interviews that he was ``100 percent in
agreement'' with a proposed law declaring a moratorium on strikes
in vital industries during serious economic downturns.
	   Estrada said strikes can lead to the closure of troubled
companies, citing debt-strapped Philippine Airlines, which closed
last week following a refusal by its largest union to support a
rehabilitation plan.
	   ``Once a company closes, the government will lose, tax payments
will stop. Workers also will lose because they will be jobless,''
he said.
	   Earlier, legislators and labor leaders had criticized Estrada
when he expressed support for the proposed law. Some said he was
advocating the same measures used by the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos.
	   Marcos declared martial law in 1972 and ruled as a strongman,
padlocking Congress, banning strikes and demonstrations and
curtailing press freedom. He was ousted in a popular revolt in
1986.
	   Estrada, however, tried to dispel fears of what critics called a
``Marcosian'' move.
	   ``We are not eliminating rights, we are just suspending them
while we are in a crisis,'' he said. ``We have to sacrifice our
rights temporarily.''
	   The legislation was proposed by Rep. Erico Aumentado following
PAL's closure. It seeks to prohibit strikes, pickets and lockouts
in transportation, communications, water, power, food, health and
housing businesses ``during the period of national economic crisis
or emergency situation as may be declared by the president.''

Police detain former editor of opposition newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Police detained the former editor of an
opposition-linked newspaper on suspicion of attempted rape,
officials said Thursday.
	   The city prosecutor's office in Kiev is investigating the
allegations against Oleksandr Horobets, said the press service of
the city's Interior Ministry department. It gave no further
details.
	   Horobets served as the editor in chief of Pravda Ukrainy
newspaper, whose publication was suspended by the Information
Ministry in late January because of alleged errors in its
re-registration papers.
	   Opposition media criticized the decision, saying it was part of
a pattern of harassment by the authorities.
	   Pravda Ukrainy has not resumed publication despite a July ruling
by the Supreme Arbitration Court, which overturned the Information
Ministry's publication ban.

Libyan jets ferry Chadian troops to Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HASSANE GUEDALLAH MAHAMAT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) _ Libyan Ilyushin transport aircraft
continued Thursday to ferry Chadian troops to Congo in an attempt
to supress an eight-week rebellion against President Laurent
Kabila.
	   The Libyan aircraft have been rotating between N'Djamena airport
and Congo for the past several days carrying members of the elite
Presidential Guard to an undisclosed location in Congo.
	   At the beginning of the week, the government of President Idriss
Deby confirmed in a statement that it was sending 1,000 troops to
back Kabila.
	   Other sources place the number of troops being sent at closer to
2,000.
	   Deby is in Libya in connection with celebrations commemorating
Moamar Gadhafi's 1969 overthrow of the monarchy.
	   There are unconfirmed reports that Libya is footing the bill for
Chadian involvement in the Congo conflict.
	   Reports in independent Chadian newspapers claim that Libya is
replacing France as the source of operating funds for Deby's
cash-strapped government.
	   On Wednesday from its stronghold in eastern Congo, the rebel
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) issued a strong protest against
Chadian intervention.
	   Zimbabawe, Angola and Namibia have already sent troops to
support Kabila, who took power in May 1997 after rebels backed by
Rwanda and Uganda ousted longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Kabila claims Rwanda and Uganda are now backing the rebels
trying to get rid of him.
	   Rwanda no longer denies the claim, and Uganda says it has troops
in Congo to defend its own security interests.
	   The RCD statement said the crisis in Africa's third-largest
nation is a ``Congolese-Congolese affair.''
	   ``The Chadian military involvement is a result of Kabila's
desire to continue to internationalize the crisis ...'' it said.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of Congolese ethnic Tutsi fighters,
other Conglese soldiers disgruntled at Kabila's leadership and
political opponents of the government _ claim Kabila is arming
former Rwandan Hutu soldiers and militiamen who participated in the
1994 genocide in Rwanda in which at least half a million people,
mainly minority Tutsis, perished.

Saeed's century rescues Pakistan to 258 for eight at stumps

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Saeed Anwar's maiden unbeaten
century rescued Pakistan from a precarious 147 for eight to 258 for
eight on the opening day of its first test against Australia on
Thursday.
	   When fading light forced play to a close five overs early, Anwar
was still working with Mushtaq Ahmed (26 not out) on an unfinished
ninth-wicket partnership of 106.
	   Anwar's unbeaten 132, his sixth hundred in his 33rd test,
featured a dozen fours and came off 234 balls.
	   On an eventful opening day, Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy
equaled Rodney Marsh's 355 dismissals behind the wicket. It also
saw Pakistan tumble to 147 for eight with leg-spinner Stuart
MacGill claiming three wickets in just seven deliveries.
	   But, the ninth-wicket pair of Anwar and Ahmed frustrated Mark
Taylor's Australians for 127 minutes and steadied the home team
with some brilliant batting.
	   Anwar, the left-handed opener, who was on 58 when Ahmed joined
him half an hour before tea, played with determination.
	   While the last session was entirely dominated by Anwar and
Ahmed, the Australians enjoyed success in the first two sessions,
claiming eight wickets with the aid of some superlative catching.
	   The 34-year-old Healy, playing in his 104th test, tied Marsh's
dismissals record early, catching Aamer Sohail and Muhammad Wasim
both within the first 31 balls.
	   Pakistan was off to a disastrous start with Sohail (4) getting
the bottom edge straight to Healy while attempting to leave Glenn
McGrath's delivery.
	   Wasim fell to a magnificent away swinger of Damien Fleming as
Healy dived to his right and grabbed the catch centimeters off the
ground.
	   Inzamamul Haq survived a confident leg before appeal off
Fleming's very first ball, and went on to acquire his 3,000th run
in 48th test. Justin Langer held a brilliant low catch at forward
short leg off McGrath's low full toss to dismiss the burly Pakistan
batsman.
	   With Pakistan struggling at 35 for three, veteran Salim Malik
faced a barrage of short pitched deliveries from McGrath and pulled
the first short delivery of the paceman to square leg boundary.
	   However, 34-year-old debutante Colin Miller erased Malik on his
fifth ball.
	   Pakistan continued to struggle in the post-lunch session with
only Moin Khan showing any life during a 59-run sixth-wicket
partnership with Anwar.
	   MacGill changed ends for his second spell and was immediately
rewarded with three quick wickets. He had Khan (39) caught at point
by Fleming and two balls later, Wasim Akram swept high into the
safe hands of Fleming fielding at deep square leg.
	   MacGill on the very next ball bowled the left-hander Mohammed
Hussein around his legs as Pakistan struggled to get near the 200
mark with 147 runs on board and eight wickets gone before Anwar and
Ahmed were involved in their unfinished century stand.

Heineken to double beer production in Thailand
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Despite Thailand's shaky economy, Dutch
brewer Heineken will pour 1 billion baht (dlrs 25 million) into
doubling its beer production in the Southeast Asian country, local
papers said Thursday.
	   The decision to increase production capacity at its Thai
breweries from 40 million to 90 million liters (10.4 million to
23.4 million gallons) in 1999 was based on the company's sales
growth estimates, Heineken (Thailand) General Manager Roland Pirmez
said, according to the Bangkok Post.
	   Sales of the Dutch beer in Thailand grew by 40 percent last year
and are expected to grow by at least 30 percent next year, the
newspaper reported.
	   ``We have the right strategy and the right market,'' the Post
quoted Pirmez as saying.
	   Thailand's beer market is estimated at about 45 billion baht
(dlrs 1.1 billion) a year. The market grew 10 percent last year
despite the country's financial crisis, the paper said.
	   In Asia, only Hong Kong recorded more sales of Heineken than
Thailand. The plan to double production capacity is likely to
reverse the ranking, Deputy General Manager Panya Pongtanya was
quoted as saying by the Post.
	   The company plans to invest more than 20 million baht (dlrs
500,000) to open beer gardens in Bangkok and other major tourist
destinations in Thailand.

Drug reports, UEFA loss, injuries plague Udinese
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Things are not getting any easier for Udinese.
	   Touched by a doping scandal, suddenly out of European cup action
and battling injuries, Udinese now must travel to Serie A leader
Fiorentina in Sunday's fourth round.
	   Newspapers here said Wednesday that a positive doping test from
an Udinese-Roma game in 1997 went unreported, leaving the Udine
club's management to try to deflect attention and deny that one its
players might be tainted. Later that day, the club was bounced out
of the UEFA Cup in the first round with a 1-0 loss to Germany's
Bayer Leverkusen.
	   And three key starters _ defender Alessandro Pierini, midfielder
Jonathan Bachini and winger Tomas Locatelli _ have leg injuries
that at the very least will limit their effectiveness, if they play
at all, Sunday at Florence.
	   Other games Sunday are: two-time defending champion Juventus of
Turin vs. Piacenza, Internazionale of Milan vs. Hidetoshi Nakata's
Perugia, Bologna vs. AC Parma, Lazio of Rome vs. Cagliari,
Salernitana vs. Empoli, Venezia vs. AC Milan, Vicenza vs. Bari, and
Sampdoria of Genoa vs. AS Roma at night.
	   While title contenders Juventus and Internazionale continue to
ease into the season with games against lowly clubs, this game
represents Fiorentina's second big clash in as many weeks.
	   The Florence club (3-0-0) holds a two-point standings lead over
Udinese, Roma and Inter, with Juventus and Milan three points back.
It's the first time Fiorentina has held sole possession of first
place since January 1982. The club won the second of its two Serie
A titles way back in 1969.
	   As usual, Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta is leading the way in
attack, but Fiorentina's secret to success so far has been a
newfound emphasis on defense thanks to first-year coach Giovanni
Trapattoni, the most successful headman in league history.
	   ``The secret is our coach,'' said 'keeper Francesco Toldo, who
has allowed three goals in seven games, including cup play. ``With
Trapattoni, everything is much simpler. You want an example? A year
ago, I would play along the penalty area box. I was the last of the
defenders, sort of a sweeper. I had to `cover' opponents'
counterattacks and communicate with my teammates. I practically
played more with my feet than with my hands. Now I just do my job:
goalkeeper.''
	   Toldo will be called on to stop the shots of the only striker
who is as in-form as Batistuta right now: Udinese's Marcio Amoroso
of Brazil. He and Batistuta share the league lead with five goals,
and Amoroso has scored twice each of the last two weeks.
	   Juventus has been struggling and is on the verge of a crisis.
	   The club drew 1-1 at lightly regarded Norwegian club Rosenborg
in the Champions League Wednesday, Juve's second straight draw in
European action. Juventus also must rebound from its 1-0 loss at AC
Parma last Saturday; the team did not lose a league game last
season until Week 14.
	   Piacenza has shown it is no pushover. The only Serie A team
without a single foreigner has drawn with Lazio, barely lost to
Inter 1-0, and defeated Vicenza 2-0.
	   The biggest disappointment for Juventus so far has been
Alessandro Del Piero, still without a goal.
	   Even more surprising than his trouble in front of the net has
been Nakata's cool there. The second Japanese player in Serie A
already has three goals, helping promoted Perugia stay close with
Juventus in a 4-3 loss, and manage draws with Lazio and Sampdoria.
	   Now Nakata goes against Inter, which has failed to demonstrate
consistency on defense.
	   Inter might still be without its two highly-paid strikers,
Roberto Baggio and Brazil's Ronaldo, who are both battling knee
injuries.

Three sentenced to death, two to life imprisonment in Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Three people have been sentenced to death
and two others to life in prison in the second drug-trafficking
ring cracked as the result of one man's last-minute confession, a
provincial judge said Thursday.
	   Pham Van Kha, chief judge in the northern province of Ninh Binh,
said Nguyen Khanh Loc, who was being led to a firing squad in
August 1997 on a drug-trafficking conviction, asked police to
postpone his execution in exchange for information.
	   A police captain and six of his associates were executed in
March for trafficking after being arrested on information provided
by Loc.
	   To cope with a growing addiction problem, Vietnamese legislators
in July 1997 toughened penalties for drug crimes. Over the past
year, more than 30 drug traffickers have been executed.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting along the Albanian
border between the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels left
six soldiers dead, the army said, and heightened concern the Kosovo
conflict could spill over into a regional one.
	   International efforts to halt the bloodshed have taken on new
urgency after reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians,
who are the vast majority in Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants.
	   Britain called an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council
for Thursday to discuss the fighting that has left hundreds dead
and forced at least 275,000 to flee.
	   The United States and other leading nations were also meeting
Friday in London on the province in Serbia, the main republic in
Yugoslavia. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Defense
Secretary William Cohen planned to brief U.S. senators on the
massacres later Thursday in Washington.
	   Yugoslav sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
rebels from the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, apparently
operating from sanctuaries in neighboring Albania, attacked
soldiers and border guards Wednesday morning.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, Interior Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga said the fighting raged for nearly three hours about
300 meters (yards) inside Yugoslav territory. There were about a
hundred Serb soldiers.
	   Bizhga said five mortars exploded on Albanian territory near the
police station in the border village of Padesh.
	   The United States and European powers fear the conflict could
spread to other southern Balkan countries with large ethnic
Albanian communities. The brutality of the Kosovo conflict, in
which both sides have been accused of atrocities, has added new
impetus to international efforts to halt the carnage.
	   In the latest reported atrocity, residents of Golubovac said
Wednesday that Serb forces surrounded a pocket of refugees last
Saturday and singled out at least 13 men to kill. They said the
victims were already buried, but pointed to saucer-sized pools of
dried blood and empty cartridges in front of a fence where they
said the refugees were shot.
	   Farmer Naim Hodzaj said in addition to the executions, Serb
police had killed several other men individually, including his
37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with gasoline and set
on fire. His brother's burned body lay on a path on the edge of the
woods.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac, including those of
women and children.
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are
among the most gruesome developments since the offensive began in
February.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanian accounts.
But Britain and Austria urged an international investigation into
what Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the
``bestial'' massacre at Obrija, which the Serbs call Gornje
Obrinje.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency called Western reports a
``media farce,'' and said the Obrija killing was staged to generate
more pressure on Serbia, the main republic in Yugoslavia.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
retreat to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders and the Red Cross declared a day of
mourning Thursday in honor of a volunteer doctor killed in Kosovo.
	   Sheptim Robaj, an ethnic Albanian doctor working for the Red
Cross, died Wednesday after his vehicle hit a land mine.
	   In a separate incident, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Serb
police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles Tuesday in Vranic in
southwestern Kosovo. The New York organization said one of its
researchers saw the bodies of four ethnic Albanian men who had been
killed, including one whose face had been mutilated.
	   A U.N. spokesman in Belgrade said fighting was still going on
near Suva Reka, southwest of Pristina, but the pullback was
continuing.
	   ``It appears there is a methodical, gradual withdrawal of the
military under way,'' said the spokesman, who gave his name as J.
Carter.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia does not have enough fuel reserves for what
is expected to be a colder-than-usual winter, a Cabinet minister
said Thursday.
	   Fuel supplies are only 85 percent of what is necessary to
provide power and heating during the winter, said Fuel and Energy
Minister Sergei Generalov.
	   Only about half of the required repair work on power and energy
plants and lines has actually carried out, he said at a news
conference following a government session that dealt with
preparation for the winter.
	   Generalov said the energy industry lacks money because consumers
have not paid their bills. The government is the largest debtor, he
said.
	   ``The chief problem is how to get the fuel to the necessary
spots and have them (consumers) pay for it,'' Generalov said.

 &UR; Military parade marks independence anniversary

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus marked its 38th independence
anniversary Thursday with an hour-long military parade.
	   The parade, which included heavy Russian T-80 tanks, lighter
armor and French anti-aircraft Exocet missiles, is ``an example of
the defense capability of Cyprus,'' said President Glafcos
Clerides.
	   Clerides, flanked by the defense ministers of Cyprus and Greece,
took the salute.
	   Greece, he said, ``has contributed significantly to our defense
capability.''
	   Greece and Cyprus have a joint defense dogma with Greek officers
comprising the senior staff of the Greek Cypriot conscript National
Guard.
	   ``Greece, by participating actively in the implementation of
this dogma against the common foreign threat, also feels proud
because _ Cypriots and Greeks _ we can guarantee the security, well
being, stability and peace in our region,'' Greek Foreign Minister
Akis Tzochatzopoulos said.
	   This year's parade took on added significance following Turkey's
warning that it will prevent, toward the end of the year, the
deployment of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles ordered by
Cyprus.
	   Clerides stressed in an independence day message that Cyprus
will continue to strengthen its defenses as Turkish troops continue
to occupy the northern third of the island.
	   He called on the U.N. Security Council to take steps to force
Turkey to abide by its resolutions calling for the withdrawal of
the Turkish troops and the reunification of the island.
	   The island was split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
an occupied north following a 1974 Turkish invasion in the wake of
an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway
Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by Turkey
which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   Clerides said he would cancel the deployment of the Russian
missiles if Turkey accepted his demilitarization proposal or if
there was progress in the deadlocked U.N.-sponsored talks for the
reunification of the island.

Election supervisors remove two elected Bosnian officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Election supervisors have
removed two elected Bosnian officials, holding their parties
responsible for violating election rules during nationwide
balloting two weeks ago, a statement said Thursday.
	   A panel of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe reviewing the Sept. 11-12 ballot canceled the election of
Pero Kozul, who ran for the ruling Croat Democratic Union for the
local assembly in southwestern Siroki Brijeg.
	   The reason was that local election officials had been found
invalidating ballots which were not marked by voters for the
Croatian party _ with the blessing of their chairman.
	   The panel also withheld payment for the officials involved and
banned them from overseeing elections in future.
	   In the second case, Dragan Jeftic of the Serb Radical Party for
the Bosnian Serb assembly was also denied his seat because the
local leader of his party had physically attacked election
officials from other parties.
	   In the northern city of Tuzla, a Muslim-led coalition was fined
1,000 German marks for violating election rules, including allowing
people to vote at their homes for the coalition.

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Saying Nigeria cannot remain a ``toddler''
in the world community, the country's military ruler said Thursday
he was committed to moving this West African nation toward a major
role in international affairs.
	   Speaking on the anniversary of Nigeria's 1960 independence from
Britain, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar said Nigeria's new foreign
policy was ``aimed at ensuring that our country resumes its
rightful place as an accepted and respected member of the world
community.''
	   Abubakar, who just returned from a trip to Britain, France, the
United States and a speech before the U.N. General Assembly, has
been trying to shift Nigeria away from its pariah status under the
rule of his predecessor, the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha.
	   Abacha's record of human rights abuses had left the country
politically isolated, with junta leaders unable even to travel to
many countries because of visa restrictions that had been placed
upon them.
	   Abubakar, however, stressed that a new era was upon Nigeria and
that Africa's most populous nation must mature into a global
player.
	   ``We cannot remain toddlers forever in the global community,''
Abubakar said in the nationwide television broadcast early Thursday
morning, adding Nigeria must ``finally begin to fulfill our great
destiny which fate has thrust on use as the world's largest black
nation.''
	   Abubakar, who was thrust to power in early June following
Abacha's sudden death by a heart attack, has quickly shifted the
country's direction, freeing political prisoners, welcoming foreign
envoys and announcing presidential elections and a shift to
civilian rule next year.
	   A key element of his reforms includes instituting a new
constitution for Nigeria, which would be based on a 1995 draft.
	   ``The government is establishing a committee which will organize
and collate views from various sections of the country so as to
come up with a more representative and acceptable document,''
Abubakar said of plans to finalize the new constitution.

UEFA hat-trick doesn't guarantee Collymore a starting place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Stan Collymore scored three goals in his comeback
game for Aston Villa in the UEFA Cup on Tuesday, yet is likely to
be on the bench for Saturday's Premier League game at Coventry.
	   It's a tough life playing for the league leader.
	   Villa is playing so well and has so many players in top form,
that Collymore's hat-trick against Norwegian team Stromgodset won't
be enough to guarantee a starting place at Highfield Road.
	   Paul Merson, who scored Villa's winner against Derby last week,
was ineligible for the game in Norway and will return for the
league game against the struggling Sky Blues.
	   Merson could slot into an advanced midfield position to allow
Collymore to partner in-form Julian Joachim in attack. But that
means no place for Lee Hendrie, who also has been in standout form
for the Villains and was rested for the UEFA Cup game to protect an
injury.
	   His team unbeaten in seven Premier League games with a
five-point lead and only one goal conceded, manager John Gregory
won't want to make changes to a successful lineup.
	   And he hopes the often outspoken and unpredictable Collymore
will appreciate that, the same as his team-mates do.
	   ``If I got a hat-trick I would be disappointed if I got left
out,'' said strike partner Joachim. ``You would feel like you were
guaranteed to play in the next game.
	   ``But competition for places is what a squad needs and it makes
you work harder and want to do even better.
	   ``Stan has been bursting at the leash to get into the team. He's
been on the sidelines for a while with injury and couldn't wait to
start a game,'' Joachim said.
	   ``I've sensed an extra determination there. He's had to stand
and watch while the team has been doing well and I'm sure he had
his mind set on doing well when he got a chance.''
	   Villa has every reason to collect three more points against
Coventry Saturday, having beaten the Sky Blues in their last six
Premier League meetings.
	   But Gordon Strachan's men will remind their Birmingham neighbor
that they also met in last season's FA Cup and Coventry triumphed
1-0 in the fifth round.
	   With a five-point lead, Villa is guaranteed to stay top while
second place Derby will be out to ruin George Graham's first game
in charge of Tottenham by scoring a home win at Pride Park.
	   Graham has taken over at ailing Spurs, arriving with a record of
big successes with north London rival Arsenal. The 53-year-old Scot
took the Gunners to two league titles, a Cup Winners Cup triumph as
well as domestic cup victories and has been moderately successful
since then at Leeds United.
	   Spurs lies 13th in the 20-club standings and last season went
close to relegation. Owner Alan Sugar wants the once-proud team to
be chasing honors once again.
	   The two biggest games of the weekend are being played on Sunday,
when Newcastle visits titlist Arsenal and Chelsea goes to
Liverpool.
	   Having struggled throughout last season, Newcastle, now under
the guidance of Ruud Gullit, has improved this term and is fifth
behind Villa, Derby, Wimbledon and West Ham.
	   Arsenal, despite its 3-0 crushing of Manchester United two weeks
ago, slipped back with a 1-0 loss at Sheffield Wednesday on
Saturday.
	   Liverpool's 2-0 loss to Manchester United last week knocked it
down to eighth while Chelsea has improved to halfway after a slow
start.
	   Third place Wimbledon hosts an Everton team which has won only
one of its seven outings and West Ham goes to surprise struggler
Blackburn, which is second from last in the standings and was
ousted from the UEFA Cup on Tuesday by Lyon.
	   Last place Southampton, which has one point from seven games, is
already four points adrift of the rest. Dave Jones' team won't be
high on confidence whens it faces up to mighty Manchester United
Saturday although Alex Ferguson's team has been leaking goals,
including five in two European Champions Cup games.
	   Having allowed Graham to move to Spurs for a reported 3 million
pounds (dlrs 5 million) compensation, seventh-place Leeds aims to
maintain its unbeaten start by beating Leicester at Elland Road.
	   Saturday's other games are Middlesbrough vs. Sheffield Wednesday
and Nottingham Forest vs. Charlton.
	   Division one leader Sunderland, unbeaten after five wins and
five draws, hosts mid-standings Bradford while Huddersfeld, level
on points but well behind on goals, hosts lowly but improving
Oxford.
	   Scottish league leader Rangers, whose nine-year streak of titles
was ended by Celtic last season, hosts promoted Dundee on Sunday.
That means Kilmarnock can at least temporarily go three points
clear Saturday by beating next-to-last Dunfermline at home.
	   Celtic, which has made a shaky start and is five points behind
Rangers in fifth place, hopes to improve by winning at Motherwell.

Rio's new swimsuit irks Church
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo NY190

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ From the tanga to the string
bikini, Rio beachwear is almost sinfully daring. But for the
Catholic Church, the latest creation goes too far.
	   It's a swimsuit for men _ with a picture of Jesus on the seat.
	   The suit made an instant splash when the popular boutique Blue
Man unveiled it at a show of beach fashions. The next day, model
and suit were all over Rio newspapers.
	   But the Catholic Church was not amused.
	   Rio's Cardinal Eugenio Sales called it an affront to the more
than 100 million Brazilian Catholics, and lawyers for the
archdiocese filed a lawsuit to ban the suit and charge boutique
owner David Azulay with ridiculing a religious symbol.
	   ``Men's swimming trunks are intimate clothing,'' said lawyer
Antonio Passos. ``There is no justification for using the image of
Jesus Christ ... on the backside of a human body.''
	   Azulay, whose creations often set trends for Rio summer
fashions, thinks the Church overreacted. After all, he said, the
Jesus image is common on T-shirts, medallions and other objects.
	   ``It's inquisition on the beach,'' Azulay said in an interview.
``They say it's mockery, but I think it's just unconventional.''
	   The swimsuit, which is conservatively large by Rio standards,
shows a stylized face of Jesus with eyes turned upward and wearing
the crown of thorns.
	   Designer Patrizia D'Angello said Azulay came to her with an idea

	   ``It was a tribute to good thoughts, to good things,'' she said.
``We never imagined that it would be considered profane.''
	   Azulay says he won't go to the mat over the suit. The Church is
too powerful _ and a conviction for ridiculing a religious symbol
carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison.

export, or just destroy the mold. I've got a thousand ideas.''
	   Besides, the suit already has served its purpose, designer

lined up on waiting lists to buy the suit _ if it's released.

Russian Foreign Ministry warns against force in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that NATO would
set ``an extremely dangerous precedent'' and destabilize
international relations if it went ahead with airstrikes in the
Kosovo province of Yugoslavia.
	   NATO's top decision-making body was meeting for the second day
Thursday to make plans for airstrikes against Serb forces in the
southern province.
	   NATO's use of force without explicit permission from the U.N.
Security Council could ``seriously aggravate the situation in the
region and deal a serious blow to the United Nations, the U.N.
Security Council and the entire system of international
relations,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   Rakhmanin said all international efforts now should be aimed at
persuading the Yugoslav army and ethnic Albanian rebels to stop
fighting and to enter peace negotiations without pre-conditions. He
also called for international cooperation to overcome the
humanitarian crisis threatening Kosovo.
	   A U.N. Security Council resolution passed last week urges a
cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting.
	   The 16 NATO allies have not yet resolved their differences over
whether a further U.N. resolution is needed to launch airstrikes.

Reports: Turkey sent 10,000 troops to Syrian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has sent 10,000 troops to its
southeastern border with Syria amid growing tensions between the
two neighbors, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The daily Milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw
convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer
(375-mile) border; the daily Cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops
were being deployed.
	   The Turkish General staff denied the reports and Defense
Minister Ismet Sezgin said Thursday that Turkey was seeking a
diplomatic solution.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels
fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast; it says rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan lives in Damascus.
	   Relations are also strained by the growing military and
diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel, which Damascus claims
destabilizes the region.

Vienna university dissected bodies of Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Doctors and medical students at Vienna
University dissected nearly 1,400 bodies executed on orders of Nazi
courts and some victims' body parts remained on display up to this
year, researchers announced Thursday.
	   The bodies _ including those of eight Jews and hundreds of
others executed for resisting the Nazis _ were transferred to the
university's anatomy institute for research and teaching purposes,
said the authors of a report examining the role of the medical
faculty during Nazi rule in Austria.
	   The bodies came from the execution chambers of the main Vienna
court and not from Nazi death camps, as had been alleged, the
report said.
	   The report is the latest of a growing number of investigations
of this country and its institutions after Adolf Hitler
incorporated the land of his birth into Nazi Germany in 1938.
	   After World War II, Austria depicted itself as a victim of the
Nazis. But that image has been tarnished in recent years as
evidence piles up that many Austrians were eager co-participants in
Nazi atrocities.
	   Research into the medical faculty began last year, after
allegations that a highly acclaimed and popular anatomy atlas used
the bodies of Holocaust victims as the basis of highly detailed
drawings.
	   On Thursday, the researchers said those suspicions could not be
confirmed, although it was possible that bodies transferred by
court order after being executed by the Nazis in Vienna could have
served as models.
	   The atlas, ``Topographical Anatomy of the Human Being,'' was
compiled by Eduard Pernkopf, a leading Nazi who headed the
university's medical faculty after Hitler annexed Austria. Pernkopf
served as university rector from 1943 to 1945 and continued
updating the atlas until his death in 1955.
	   The report was commissioned by the university after the
Holocaust museum in Jerusalem asked for an investigation into the
Pernkopf book.
	   Vienna University Rector Alfred Ebenbauer cited ``our own
indifference and cowardice,'' in criticizing the time that elapsed
between the Nazi era and publication of the report, plus the fact
that it was drawn up only after outsiders asked for the
investigation.
	   Medical Faculty Dean Woflgang Schuetz said the investigation
came ``a generation too late.''
	   The report said that of the approximately 1,400 bodies
transferred to the anatomy institute by the courts between 1938 and
1945, about half were of victims executed for ``resisting the Nazi
regime.''
	   Of the hundreds of specimens remaining from that time, more than
200 were either established as having been remnants of Nazi victims
or are suspected as such, the report said. They were removed from
display and will be properly buried.
	   Some of the specimens were organs and body parts of physically
or mentally handicapped infants found deficient and killed by Nazi
doctors. Neurologist Heinrich Gross, accused of participating in
the killings and using the remains of the victims for research up
to the mid 1960s is being investigated on possible murder charges.
	   Austria's new frankness began in 1988, when the 50th anniversary
of Hitler's annexation coincided with the furor surrounding
then-President Kurt Waldheim and his concealed past as an
intelligence officer in the German army during World War II.
	   Best-selling books, a recent documentary film and touring
exhibit have underscored the new interest in reexamining the Nazi
era. One book, ``Hitler's Vienna,'' traces how the Austrian capital
of the early 20th Century fed and formed the Nazi leader's views.
	   The film, titled in English ``East of Eden,'' reveals that
ordinary Austrian soldiers serving in Hitler's army knew of mass
executions and witnessed torture and looting on the eastern front _
denting the myth that only special units like the dreaded SS
perpetrated atrocities.
	   Questions about Pernkopf's anatomy book arose in 1995 when Yad
Vashem, the Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, approached Vienna
University and the Austrian government, asking whether Holocaust
victims were depicted in the atlas.
	   Last fall, physicians pressed the issue in letters published in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, questioning
whether use of the book was ethically proper.
	   In early editions of the atlas, swastikas and SS lightning-bolt
symbols were part of some of the artists' signatures. Those Nazi
emblems were airbrushed out of later editions.

Official results in Vladivostok election confirm winner _ nobody
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE ECKEL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ As suspected, an overwhelming
majority of Vladivostok voters rejected all 12 candidates in the
city's mayoral election, according to official results released
Thursday.
	   The figures released by Election Commission Chairman Ilya
Grinchenko showed that 54 percent of voters had rejected all
candidates for mayor in Sunday's polling, thereby voiding the
election.
	   Vladimir Shakhov, a member of parliament and chairman of an
insurance company, received the most votes of any candidate, 13.3
percent.
	   Questions about the election's legality remained unresolved a
week after a municipal court ruled that incumbent Mayor Viktor
Cherepkov, who was widely expected to win, violated electoral laws
by tapping public funds for use in his own campaign.
	   Regional Supreme Court Judge Viktor Sotnikov delayed hearing an
emergency appeal by Cherepkov lawyer Vladimir Kiriyenko and the
City Electoral Commission for the second time Thursday, instead
moving the case to Friday.
	   Grinchenko noted that the commission would officially appeal to
the regional legislature to evaluate legal contradictions between
regional and federal election law.
	   Despite declaring the elections officially void, the commission
reached no decision on a new date for mayoral voting.
	   By law, new elections are required to be held within three
months of an election being declared void.

El Al: Israeli cargo plane carried nerve gas component
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam
in 1992 was carrying a chemical that can be used in making the
nerve gas sarin, an airline official confirmed for the first time
Thursday.
	   El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman told The Associated Press that
``the plane was carrying dimethyl methylphosphonate,'' a key
component of sarin.
	   Klieman said the Dutch government has known this for six years
because the name of the chemical was listed on the cargo manifest
handed over by Israel shortly after the crash.
	   The cargo plane crashed into an apartment building, killing 43
people. Reports about weapons and dangerous chemicals aboard the
plane surfaced shortly afterwards.
	   This week, the NRC Handelsblad reported that the El Al plane was
carrying 50 gallons of the chemical. It can also be used as a flame
retardant, and in the manufacture of plastic.
	   The newspaper said the shipment was headed to Israel's
top-secret Biological Institute in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes
Ziona. Reports have said Israel was making chemical and biological
weapons there. The government has not commented on those claims.
	   Klieman confirmed that the intended recipient was listed on the
manifest, but would not comment whether it was the Biological
Institute.
	   Israel's Civil Aviation Authority is to look into the report,
according to Transport Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadiah. He said
Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom did not order a new investigation
of the crash; rather, only a check into the specific claim about
nerve gas components.
	   Klieman said El Al transports all materials in accordance with
international regulations. He said the chemical dimethyl
methylphosphonate is approved for transport on both passenger and
cargo planes.
	   Ovadiah said Israel turned over all cargo manifests to the
Netherlands after the crash. Referring to the reports about nerve
gas components, he said there is ``nothing new here, but we're
checking it anyway.''

Moroccan prime minister meets with Chirac

	   PARIS (AP) _ Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi met
Thursday with President Jacques Chirac to discuss ties between
France and the North African kingdom.
	   Morocco's debt repayment is expected to be the main topic of
discussion during Youssoufi's two-day visit. Youssoufi, who took
office earlier this year, said recently his country's global debt
was ``an enormous burden'' for his country.
	   Morocco's debt is estimated at dlrs 19 billion, equivalent to
almost 60 percent of the country's growth domestic product.
Moroccan Finance Minister Fathallah Oalalou has estimated that 17
percent of the debt is with France.
	   Before lunching at the Elysee Palace, Youssoufi visited the tomb
of French resistant Jean Moulin in the Pantheon.
	   During his visit, Youssoufi also will meet with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and other officials.

President says actress Danes should be banned from Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada, a former
movie star, said Thursday he believes Hollywood actress Claire
Danes should be banned from entering the Philippines for having
disparaged the country's capital.
	   ``She should not be allowed to come here. She should not even be
allowed to set foot here,'' Estrada said in reaction to a decision
by Manila's city council Tuesday to declare Miss Danes ``persona
non grata'' and ban all her movies from being shown in the city.
	   The council said it was insulted when Miss Danes called Manila
smelly, rat-infested and weird.
	   ``Her remarks were uncalled for,'' said Estrada.
	   Miss Danes, who appeared in the movies ``Romeo and Juliet,''
``Little Women'' and ``The Rainmaker,'' was in Manila for several
months early this year to shoot scenes for the movie ``Brokedown
Palace.'' Most of the sequences shot in Manila were done inside a
dilapidated hospital.
	   Councilor Kim Atienza, principal author of the resolution and a
son of Manila's mayor, said the ban will continue indefinitely
until Miss Danes makes a public apology. The council passed the
resolution 23-3.
	   Last week, Miss Danes said in a statement that she meant no
disrespect to Filipino people.
	   ``Because of the subject matter of our film `Brokedown Palace,'
the cast was exposed to the darker and more impoverished places of
Manila. My comments in Premiere magazine only reflect those
locations, not my attitude toward the Filipino people. They were
nothing but warm, friendly and supportive,'' she said.
	   Atienza dismissed the statement as an ``excuse made by Hollywood
press officers and not a genuine apology.''
	   ``We are not hard to appease but we know if an apology is true
or not,'' he added. ``We will lift the ban only if we are
satisfied.''
	   In an interview in Vogue magazine in April, Miss Danes described
Manila as a ``ghastly and weird city.''
	   More recently, she was quoted in Premiere magazine as saying
Manila ``smelled of cockroaches, with rats all over and that there
is no sewerage system and the people do not have anything _ no
arms, no legs, no eyes.''
	   Julio Logarta, one of three council members who voted against
the resolution, said the ban is a curtailment of freedom of
expression. Logarta also questioned the council's authority to ban
movies.
	   Miss Danes' reported comments have also been widely debated in
newspaper columns and editorial pages, with some newspapers
castigating the actress and others saying the city council should
clean up Manila instead of criticizing the remarks.

Pope will honor Croatian cardinal as a martyr for his faith
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ In line with his drive to honor Catholics
considered martyrs for their faith, Pope John Paul II will travel
Friday to Croatia to beatify a cardinal held as a hero by Catholics
but accused by Serbs of sympathizing with the Nazis.
	   John Paul has honored hundreds of martyrs during his nearly
20-year-papacy, and the beatification of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac
has been eagerly awaited in a country that is a Roman Catholic
outpost in the Balkans.
	   It will be John Paul's second trip to Croatia, following a 1994
visit that drew one million people to a Mass in Zagreb, the
capital. The Vatican was one of the first states to recognize
Croatia when it declared its independence from Yugoslavia.
	   The Vatican lists 80 percent of Croatia's 4.5 million population
as Catholic.
	   John Paul will fly to Zagreb, then travel Saturday morning to
Marija Bistrica, the country's leading Marian shrine, 52 kilometers
(30 miles) outside the capital, for the beatification.
	   While serving as Zagreb's archbishop in 1941, Stepinac supported
Croatia's German-backed puppet government led by dictator Ante
Pavelic.
	   By 1942, however, Stepinac denounced the regime's genocidal
policies, which led to the extermination of thousands of Serbs,
Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. Stepinac's own notes and recent
studies say he spoke out against the atrocities, and worked to save
lives, but many Serbs still consider him a war criminal.
	   After the war, the cardinal was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to prison for collaboration with the
Nazis. He died while under house arrest, the basis of the Vatican's
finding that he died for his faith.
	   He was convicted ``because of his unshakable fidelity to the
church,'' said the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano this
week.
	   The U.S.-based Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, a Jewish
group that seeks to expose any collaboration with the Nazis, had
asked the Vatican to postpone the beatification pending further
study of the cardinal's record.
	   It said Stepinac spoke out late and by then ``he was speaking
primarily about dead Jews, not live Jews.''
	   Beatification is the last formal step before possible sainthood.
	   During his papacy, John Paul has beatified 804 people, 594 of
them considered martyrs, according to Vatican statistics. They have
ranged from Vietnamese slain in the 17th century to priests killed
in anti-church campaigns during the Spanish Civil War.
	   John Paul will fly back to Rome Sunday evening, after a stop in
Split, on Croatia's Adriatic coast. The trip is the 84th foreign
tour of John Paul's papacy.

Malaysia denies it hindered Singapore's rescue efforts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia on Thursday dismissed
Singapore's accusation that officials impeded the rescue of a
British navy crewman after a helicopter crash in the South China
Sea.
	   ``Once Singapore officially requested approval for their search
efforts, we gave it immediately,'' Defense Minister Syed Hamid
Albar told reporters, adding that Malaysia also offered to assist.
	   Singapore officials said their search and rescue aircraft
arrived at the crash site 12 minutes later than necessary.
	   The rescue team lost search time last Wednesday because it had
to use a longer route to get to the scene of a British helicopter
crash in the South China Sea.
	   According to Singapore, Malaysia initially denied access to the
rescue aircraft. The go-ahead came 4 1/2 hours after the first
request. A British navy crewman, Lt. Toby Beale, was killed in the
crash.
	   Syed Hamid dismissed those allegations, saying that Singapore
had already sent a rescue aircraft into Malaysian airspace without
informing Kuala Lumpur or waiting for clearance.
	   He added that Singapore only made a verbal request for another
aircraft to enter Malaysian territory instead of faxing details of
the rescue mission. Singapore only sent a written request a few
hours later, he added.
	   Syed Hamid also accused Singapore of violating Malaysian air and
sea space at least seven times since Malaysia recently revoked the
long-standing agreement allowing all Singapore military aircraft to
enter its airspace while in transit or on search and rescue
missions.
	   The abrupt decision came amid a bitter row between the two
Southeast Asian neighbors.
	   They have recently squabbled over everything from the relocation
of a railroad border checkpoint to Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan
Yew's memoirs, which are critical of past Malaysian leaders.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army said Thursday six
soldiers were killed and seven wounded in heavy fighting along the
Albanian border, heightening concern the Kosovo conflict could
spill over into a regional conflict.
	   International efforts to halt the bloodshed have taken on new
urgency after reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in
the embattled Serbian province, where Albanians form 90 percent of
the 2-million-strong population.
	   In the latest allegation, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center claimed the bodies of 12 males -- including a
15-year-old boy -- were discovered Thursday in the Suva Reka region
about 45 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina. The report
could not be confirmed.
	   Britain has called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council on Thursday to discuss the fighting that has left hundreds
dead and forced at least 275,000 to flee.
	   The United States and other leading nations were also meeting
Friday in London on Kosovo. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Defense Secretary William Cohen planned to brief U.S. senators
on the massacres later Thursday in Washington.
	   Yugoslav sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
ethnic Albanian rebels from the Kosovo Liberation Army, apparently
operating from sanctuaries in Albania, attacked soldiers and border
guards Wednesday morning.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, Interior Ministry spokesman
Artan Bizhga said the fighting raged for nearly three hours about
300 meters (yards) inside Yugoslav territory. There were about a
hundred Serb soldiers.
	   Bizhga said five mortars exploded on Albanian territory near the
police station in the border village of Padesh. The ethnic
Albanians are fighting for independence for Kosovo from Serbia, the
main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and European powers fear the conflict could
spread to other southern Balkan countries with large ethnic
Albanian communities. The brutality of the Kosovo conflict, in
which both sides have been accused of atrocities, has added new
impetus to international efforts to halt the carnage.
	   Residents of Golubovac said Wednesday that Serb forces
surrounded a pocket of refugees last Saturday and singled out at
least 13 men to kill. They said the victims were already buried,
but pointed to saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty
cartridges in front of a fence where they said the refugees were
shot.
	   Farmer Naim Hodzaj said in addition to the executions, Serb
police had killed several other men individually, including his
37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with gasoline and set
on fire. His brother's burned body lay on a path on the edge of the
woods.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac, including those of
women and children.
	   The mass killings last weekend in the Drenica region, where
Serb-led forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian rebels, are
among the most gruesome developments since the offensive began in
February.
	   ``We rule out any possibility that our members did something
like this,'' Serb police Col. Bozidar Filic said. ``In that area,
we had clashes with terrorists and a number of them have been
arrested.''
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanian accounts.
But Britain and Austria urged an international investigation into
what Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the
``bestial'' massacre at Obrija, which the Serbs call Gornje
Obrinje.
	   ``This was not an act of war, it was plain cold murder,''
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said.
	   On Thursday, Yugoslavia's ambassador to Britain, Miroslav Pajic,
said his country was being subjected to a ``smear campaign'' aimed
at finding ``an excuse for air strikes.''
	   ``We are not so crazy to do something (like this) in heat of the
NATO threats of airstrikes against Yugoslavia and our people,'' he
told BBC television.
	   Pajsic said Yugoslavia would conduct their own investigation
into the killings.
	   Serb authorities promised earlier this week that troops would
retreat to their barracks after claiming victory over the KLA.
	   Ethnic Albanian leaders and the Red Cross declared a day of
mourning today in honor of a volunteer doctor killed in Kosovo.
	   Sheptim Robaj, an ethnic Albanian doctor working for the Red
Cross, died Wednesday after his vehicle hit a land mine.
	   In a separate incident, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Serb
police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles Tuesday in Vranic in
southwestern Kosovo.
	   The New York organization said one of its researchers saw the
bodies of four ethnic Albanian men who had been killed, including
one whose face had been mutilated.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt's political and economic reform
program has helped reduce the country's foreign debt by dlrs 20
billion since the beginning of the 1990s, President Hosni Mubarak
said was quoted as saying Thursday.
	   Since it first launched its economic reform and structural
adjustment program in 1991, Egypt has reduced its foreign debt from
dlrs 50 billion to dlrs 30 billion, Mubarak said in an interview
with the leading Al-Ahram newspaper.
	   He said foreign currency reserves had increased to dlrs 20
billion, enabling the country to pay its loans without imposing
additional taxes on its citizens to raise capital.
	   Meanwhile, Public Sector Minister Atef Obeid left for the United
States Thursday to participate in meetings with officials from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   Obeid told reporters prior to his departure that Egypt no longer
requires IMF financing for its privatization and reform programs.
	   Obeid said, however, that he would discuss with IMF officials
the possibility of receiving expert help, instead of financing,
from the fund for the next stage of the country's reform program.
	   During the next stage of the program, Egypt will focus on
boosting foreign investment and expertise, both of which are of
equal importance, Obeid said.
	   Obeid is joined on his week-long visit to the United States by
Egypt's finance and economy minister and the chairman of the
Central Bank.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government announced Thursday that it
will begin a sweep of illegal foreign workers as part of a campaign
to combat unemployment and create jobs for Jordanians.
	   Interior Minister Nayef Qadi said authorities will begin
checking work permits of the estimated 300,000 foreign workers in
the country. He said illegal workers will be deported.
	   The government says the bulk of foreigners are Egyptians with no
work permits and many without jobs, adding to the ranks of
unemployed Jordanians.
	   Unemployment is officially estimated at 14.4 percent of the
950,000-strong work force. Unofficial estimates are twice that
figure in a resource-barren country where the per capita income is
dlrs 1,150.
	   A meeting chaired by Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh on Wednesday
announced stringent measures to curb the inflow and presence of
foreign workers, such as deportation and hefty fines for those
without work permits.
	   Tarawneh told reporters last weekend that he planned to
gradually replace foreign workers with Jordanians and ban hiring
foreigners in certain unskilled jobs.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Port officials have begun implementing a new
5-percent reduction in duties, the English-language Egyptian
Gazette reported Thursday.
	   The tariff reduction, which went into effect Wednesday under a
presidential decree, applies to imported goods and commodities.
Imported passenger cars are excluded.
	   The reduction in duties is part of a comprehensive plan to
reduce all customs duties under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, said the Gazette, quoting customs officials.
	   A 2-percent reduction in sales tax is also planned under GATT.
 &UR; ___
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Share prices and turnover slipped at the
Baghdad Stock Exchange this week because of uncertainty over a
solution to Iraq's current crisis with the United Nations.
	   According to the market's bulletin released Thursday, the number
of shares traded slumped to 51.5 million from 69.4 million.
	   The value of shares in the three-day trading week ending
Wednesday declined to 381.4 million Iraqi dinars (dlrs 201,85) from
447.7 dinars (dlrs 238.1).
	   Shares of industrial companies dominated trading, the bulletin
said. Commercial banks came second but there was little activity in
the service sector, the bulletin said.
	   The volatile Iraqi dinar was on a roller-coaster ride this week
in response to reports emerging from New York on talks between
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
	   It gained about 7 percent on Aziz's arrival in New York but
slumped to 1,888 to the dollar on Thursday.
	   Of the 94 companies listed in the exchange, shares of only 52
were traded this week, the bulletin said.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices slipped further, but turnover
slightly increased on the stock exchange this week because activity
focused on shares of lucrative commercial banks and services firms,
brokers said Thursday.
	   A market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
declined by 1.27 percent to 171.25 points.
	   It said shares of industrial firms dropped by 0.24 percent,
commercial banks by 1.73 percent, insurance firms by 0.18 percent.
But shares of service companies increased by 0.28 percent.
	   Turnover nudged up by 12.5 percent to 4.5 million dinars (dlrs
6.3 million), the report added.
	   It said stocks of 88 firms were traded during the week.
 &UR; ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed at 2,159.5 points at the end of the trading week, 11.9
points, or 0.55 percent, lower than the previous week, the National
Investments Co. said Thursday.
	   In a weekly report about the exchange that lists 76 companies,
NIC said the market was moved by strong speculation and an
anticipated improvement in prices did not take place. It did not
provide any explanation.
	   Some 230.07 million shares changed hands this week, 39.76
percent lower than the previous week. The value of these shares
also fell by 33 percent to reach 65.42 million dinars (dlrs 213.79
million).
	   The stocks of 64 companies were traded, the report said. Only 5
companies closed higher, while 41 closed lower and 18 were
unchanged.

Newspaper says United States to release Israeli spy Pollard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout with Netanyahu saying he discussed Pollard
with Clinton, but that no decision was made, U.S. comment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
that he discussed the fate of Jonathan Pollard with U.S. President
Bill Clinton this week, but that no decision was made about a
possible release of the Israeli spy.
	   The daily Yediot Ahronot reported earlier Thursday that Clinton
agreed in principle to free Pollard who is serving a life term for
passing secret U.S. military documents to Israel.
	   The newspaper report was denied by a Clinton administration
official in Washington who said granting early release to Pollard
would be met by strong opposition within the U.S. government. The
official spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   A statement released after a meeting of Netanyahu's Cabinet said
the prime minister told his ministers that the Pollard issue was
raised during his recent U.S. visit, but that no decision was made.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, was arrested
outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985.
	   It emerged later that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a
shadowy Israeli intelligence-gathering body in the United States.
Until recently, Israeli governments disavowed Pollard, and called
his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison.

Common ground narrow as rival parties head to mediation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Political leaders staked out antagonistic
positions Thursday in advance of mediation to resolve differences
that led to an army mutiny and last week's South Africa-led
intervention.
	   Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili of the ruling Lesotho Congress
Party, which controls 79 of the 80 seats in parliament, said in a
television broadcast that he will not share political power, the
South African Press Association reported.
	   Leaders of opposition groups that garnered 39 percent of the
vote in last May's national elections claim power must be shared,
and amnesty be given to Lesotho Defense Force rebels who resisted
the intervention.
	   The Lesotho Council of Chiefs and King Letsie III's brother
endorsed the amnesty on Wednesday, and requested the constitution
be changed to allow the king greater political autonomy.
	   Representatives of the parties were scheduled to meet
face-to-face for the first time in weeks Friday at U.N.
headquarters in the capital Maseru.
	   Also Thursday, mail service from South Africa, which encircles
the Lesotho mountain kingdom, resumed for the first time since
Sept. 16. About 7,000 kg (about 7.5 tons) had built up.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A Sydney gambler has bet 1,000
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 590) that Pauline Hanson's right-wing
populist One Nation will win government on Saturday -- at odds of
250-1.
	   The long shot was laid with leading betting agency CentreBet,
which said Australians had wagered more than 600,000 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 350,000) on the election outcome by the end of
Thursday.
	   Less than two days out from the election, the Alice
Springs-based agency said support was spread evenly between the
conservative governing coalition led by Prime Minister John Howard
at 1-3 and the Labor Party led by Kim Beazley at 2-1 -- too close
to call a result.
	   CentreBet manager Gerard Daffy said bookmakers were usually in
the best position to call the outcome of an event such as an
election because, unlike opinion polls, people backed their beliefs
with money.
	   However, Poll98 -- the third Australian federal election on
which CentreBet had taken bets -- had him baffled.
	   ``At this time in the last (1996) election, interest in Labor
had petered out and the big money was all going one way, to the
coalition,'' Daffy said.
	   ``This time it's more evenly spread. I'd have to say, strictly
impartially, it could go one way or the other. It's that close.''
	   The biggest bet so far has been 50,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 29,000) on the conservatives to win at the then-quoted odds of
2-5.
	   Not to be forgotten in this Australian election was a Norwegian
man who put 80 Krone -- that's 20 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
11.60) -- on One Nation to win, at early odds of 150-1.
	   ``He bet on a woman in the Danish federal election too, with
similar odds.
	   Maybe he's got a fixation on betting on women in elections,''
Daffy said of the puzzling bet.

Cadet with submachine gun deserts in Volga River city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A cadet deserted his post in a Volga River city,
taking with him a Kalashnikov submachine gun and 60 cartridges, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   The cadet stopped a car and forced the driver to take him to a
village outside the city of Togliatti, then knifed the driver and
fled into a forest, the news agency said, quoting the Russian
Interior Ministry.
	   It gave no other details.

Ten thousand teachers protest budget cuts and low salaries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Thousands of teachers called on the
government to resign Thursday as they marched through the capital
to protest their falling living standards and education budget
cuts.
	   Trade Union leaders claimed the government acted illegally when
it slashed the education budget by 1 trillion lei (dlrs 110
million) in September.
	   In an attempt to rein in spending, the government took away 7.5
trillion lei (dlrs 825 million) from the health, defense,
education, culture and research budgets, provoking a wave of
dissatisfaction among state employees.
	   ``The government endangers the education system in Romania and
has made any salary raise impossible,'' said Razvan Bobulescu, head
of the union representing the education staff, on national radio.
	   ``Thieves! Down with the government!'' shouted more than 10,000
people bused into the capital from cities around the country.
	   They convened outside government headquarters, following 6,000
workers from the energy and drivers' unions who on Wednesday
protested poverty and feared job cuts.
	   Most teachers earn less than the average national salary of 1.2
million lei (dlrs 122), said Bobulescu.
	   ``I have two boys and my salary is only 800,000 (dlrs 88). Thank
God my husband is a lawyer,'' said Despina Narita, a teacher from
the Black Sea port of Constanta.
	   Many schools have shabby and inadequate furnishings. In some
places, children attend classes in three shifts a day due to
understaffing.

El Al: Israeli cargo plane carried nerve gas component
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to specify that chemical can sted reportedly can
be used to make sarin; EDITS to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in Amsterdam
in 1992 was carrying a chemical that can be used in making the
nerve gas sarin, an airline official confirmed for the first time
Thursday.
	   El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman told The Associated Press that
``the plane was carrying dimethyl methylphosphonate,'' a key
component of sarin.
	   Klieman said the Dutch government has known this for six years
because the name of the chemical was listed on the cargo manifest
handed over by Israel shortly after the crash.
	   The cargo plane crashed into an apartment building, killing 43
people. Reports about weapons and dangerous chemicals aboard the
plane surfaced shortly afterwards.
	   This week, the NRC Handelsblad reported that the El Al plane was
carrying 50 gallons (190 liters) of the chemical. It can also be
used as a flame retardant, and in the manufacture of plastic.
	   The newspaper said the shipment was headed to Israel's
top-secret Biological Institute in the Tel Aviv suburb of Nes
Ziona. Reports have said Israel was making chemical and biological
weapons there. The government has not commented on those claims.
	   Klieman confirmed that the intended recipient was listed on the
manifest, but would not comment whether it was the Biological
Institute.
	   Israel's Civil Aviation Authority is to look into the report,
according to Transport Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadiah. He said
Transport Minister Shaul Yahalom did not order a new investigation
of the crash; rather, only a check into the specific claim about
nerve gas components.
	   Klieman said El Al transports all materials in accordance with
international regulations. He said the chemical dimethyl
methylphosphonate is approved for transport on both passenger and
cargo planes.
	   Ovadiah said Israel turned over all cargo manifests to the
Netherlands after the crash. Referring to the reports about nerve
gas components, he said there is ``nothing new here, but we're
checking it anyway.''

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has sent 10,000 troops to its
southeastern border with Syria amid growing tensions between the
two neighbors, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The daily Milliyet quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw
convoys of armored vehicles approaching the 600-kilometer
(375-mile) border; the daily Cumhuriyet said around 10,000 troops
were being deployed.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin denied any troop movement along
the border, but said Turkey's patience was running out. President
Suleyman Demirel was harsher during parliament's opening session
Thursday.
	   ``I declare to the world that we retain our right to counter
Syria, which has not given up its hostile attitude despite all our
warnings and peaceful approaches,'' he said.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Turkish Kurdish rebels
fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast; it says rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan lives in Damascus.
	   Relations are also strained by the growing military and
diplomatic ties between Turkey and Israel, which Damascus claims
destabilizes the region.

Arafat says progress made in Washington talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Thursday that this week's top-level talks in Washington have
produced progress on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Arafat's positive assessment appeared to contradict earlier
statements by Palestinian negotiators who said little has been
achieved during Arafat's meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop pullback from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a tougher Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Israel has said it would hand over 10 percent of the land in
full and set aside 3 percent as a nature reserve. In those areas,
Israel would retain full security control for the time being.
	   Asked Thursday whether the Washington meetings produced progress
on a security agreement and special conditions for a nature
reserve, Arafat said ``yes.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Palestinian negotiators have said differences remained on the
issue of the nature reserve and the two sides are still far apart
on a new agreement on security cooperation.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to visit the
Middle East next week to prepare another Mideast summit in
Washington in mid October.
	   Asked whether he expected an agreement to be signed soon on a
West Bank troop pullback, Arafat said: ``We have to wait and see
until the next meeting which will take place between me and
Netanyahu and Albright.''

After Euro slump, Real Madrid to meet a buoyant Betis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CIARAN GILES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Hung over from an unexpected European
Champions League defeat, Real Madrid this weekend faces Betis which
lies second from bottom in the Spanish league but whose morale
soared following a 5-0 win in continental play.
	   At the top with 10 points and undefeated in league play, Real
was riding the crest of a wave until Wednesday's 2-1 defeat by
Spartak in Moscow after going ahead 1-0.
	   Its opponent Sunday, Betis, appears to have had the opposite
luck. After four domestic rounds so far, it lies No. 19 in the
20-team division with two points from draws. But then in UEFA cup
play Tuesday it hammered Danish side Vejle 5-0.
	   ``Let's hope that the good run continues against Madrid,'' said
Ivan Perez, a former Real Madrid player and the scorer of a
hat-trick in the Vejle game.
	   As fans and club directors desperately seek results to justify
the millions spent on new players, including 35 million dollars on
Brazilian World Cup star Denilson, a defeat for Betis could throw a
serious question mark over the future of Chilean coach Vicente
Cantatore who took over Betis just days before the season's start.
	   In Saturday's only league game, defending league champion FC
Barcelona travels to Valencia in search of a victory to prevent
leader and archival Real Madrid extending the four-point lead it
holds over the Catalan side.
	   Barcelona, which has not lost in six European and domestic
games, will likely be feeling triumphant following its neat 2-0
downing of Denmark's Brondby in the Champions League.
	   Valencia, which like Barcelona has six points, will lack
Rumanian World Cup ace Adrian Ilie, out for two weeks because of a
left-leg muscle injury.
	   Zaragoza, who lies No. 2 in the league just a point behind Real
Madrid, looks as if it should have little trouble maintaining the
chase when it visits No. 18 Extremadura which has only garnered two
points so far this season.
	   Hector Cuper's Mallorca, in No. 3 with eight points, faces a
tough task away against Tenerife without injured Argentine
international goalkeeper Carlos Roa.
	   Meanwhile, Atletico de Madrid at No. 4 and three points behind
Real, will be glad to welcome back recently injured midfielders
Yugoslav Vladimir Jugovic and Brazil's Juninho for a game against
middle-ranking Oviedo.
	   In other fifth-round games, Real Sociedad hosts Deportivo de La
Coruna, Espanyol welcomes Villareal, Valladolid is at Salamanca,
Athletic de Bilbao travels to Celta and Alaves receives Racing.

Daimler-Benz opens 19-building complex at Potsdamer Platz

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With fireworks and music, Daimler-Benz inaugurates
on Friday its 19-building complex at Potsdamer Platz, the former
``crossroads of Europe'' that was leveled during World War II and
bisected for decades by the Berlin Wall.
	   The Daimler Benz grand opening is one more sign that the revival
of Potsdamer Platz as Berlin's new commercial center _ key to the
return of the German government to Berlin next year _ is nearing
completion.
	   Under construction for four years, the 4-billion-mark
(dlrs-2.3-billion) Daimler-Benz complex has apartments, shops,
theaters and offices. The tallest building in the complex is the
office tower for Daimler-Benz's financial service Debis, designed
by Italian architect Renzo Piano.
	   With its 20 stories of terra-cotta tile, the office tower, open
for almost a year, already has become something of a landmark; a
green illuminated cube on top of the building is visible for miles
across the city.
	   The Daimler-Benz complex, which has three new streets and a
square named after Marlene Dietrich, is the largest of the many
building projects that have made the 27 acres of Potsdamer Platz
the biggest construction site in Europe.
	   The other big investor, Sony, is spending $630 million to build
its European headquarters on the site, a tower designed by
Chicago-based architect Helmut Jahn.
	   Before World War II, Potsdamer Platz was one of Europe's busiest
intersections _ and site of the first traffic signal on the
continent.
	   What was not destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II was
torn down when the area became part of the Cold-War no man's land
between East and West Berlin.
	   In addition to entertainment festivities, Daimler-Benz will
celebrate the opening of its center by keeping the site's some 100
shops open until midnight over the weekend. Stores in Germany
usually are open until 4 p.m. on Saturdays and closed on Sundays.

Karlsson equals course record on opening day Belgacom Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds : Will be updated at end of Thursday's play &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ Sweden's Robert Karlsson equaled the
course record at Royal Zoute Thursday to take the early lead ahead
Nick Faldo during the first round of the Belgian Belgacom Open.
	   Karlsson took full advantage of the clear, windless conditions
and shot a 7-under-par 64 to match the record set by Spain's Miguel
Angel Jiminez in 1992. Faldo shot one of his best rounds this year
for a 65.
	   Lee Westwood was trying to make the most of the absence of
Scotland's Colin Montgomerie to maintain a chance to squeeze past
the Order of Merit leader during the season-ending Volvo Masters at
the end of the month.
	   Westwood, who needs to win the 400,000-pound (dlrs 680,000)
Belgian Open to keep his challenge going, shot a 4-under-par-67,
three shots off the early pace. The Englishman is currently 112,000
pounds behind Montgomerie's leading 760,077 pounds. A win here will
give Westwood 66,600 pounds (dlrs 113,220).
	   Karlsson, who finished second behind Montgomerie at the German
Masters last week, kept his good form going, shooting seven birdies
during his record-equaling round on the semi-links course.
	   ``It's great to go round on such a good course without a bogey
on your card,'' said the Swede, who is 18th on the European Tour
money list.
	   Montgomerie pulled out of the event at the last moment. Bernhard
Langer withdrew because of an illness in the family.
	   Royal Zoute has been extremely kind to Faldo in the past and he
won here in 1994, the last time the Belgian Open was held. Seeking
his form of old, Faldo has been getting some good rounds together
but none more so than Thursday's.
	   After making eight birdies on the way to a 65, he said. ``I
don't know when I last did that.''
	   ``I sank nearly everything,'' he said of his putting on the
treacherous Zoute greens. The course in the North Sea resort is
tucked just inside the coastline and when the winds get going, it
is a tough challenge to the world's greatest players. On Thursday,
the course was at its kindest.

Report: Wreckage of missing plane found; no sign of five passengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan soldiers have located the
wreckage of a small plane that disappeared last week, but there was
no sign of the pilot or the four passengers, including a
high-ranking military officer, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The government-owned New Vision, citing a senior security
official, said the nine-seater twin-engine plane crashed into the
eastern slopes of the Rwenzori Mountains about 3,000 feet above sea
level, near Kisomoro, a trading town 270 kilometers (170 miles)
west of the capital Kampala.
	   The newspaper said it was feared the passengers may have been
abducted by Allied Democratic Forces rebels operating in the area.
	   Uganda has troops inside the neighboring Democratic Republic of
Congo trying to flush out the ADF rebels who have been carrying out
attacks against civilian and military targets in western Uganda.
	   The military source did not rule out the possibility that the
plane was shot down, although a military spokesman dismissed this
earlier in the week.
	   The military spokesman's office refused to comment Thursday on
the report.
	   Among the passengers was Lt. Col Jet Mwebaze, brother of acting
Chief of Staff James Kazini.
	   The Israeli Embassy in Nairobi confirmed that an Israeli
businessman, Zeev Schiff, was also on the plane. The newspaper
identified a third passenger as Arif Mulji, an Indian who owned an
electrical firm in Kampala. The newspaper said the fourth passenger
was a Congolese identified only as Taban and said the pilot was
Enos Luwuzu.
	   The newspaper said the plane, which took off from Entebbe
airport Sept. 25, was heading due west toward Kasese, which is
about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the crash site. However,
previous reports had said the plane was heading toward Bunia in
northeastern Congo, which could explain why it crashed north of its
destination.

At least 55 people dead or missing in heavy rainstorm in Korea

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new casualty figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tropical storm Yanni moved out of
South Korea Thursday, leaving at least 27 people dead and 28 others
missing, government officials said.
	   The storm also washed away rail lines and highways and flooded
vast residential areas and 252,000 hectares (622,440 acres) of rice
paddies, a quarter of South Korea's total crop land, they said.
	   ``A considerable reduction in rice production is feared because
the damage was done only a few weeks before harvest was to begin,''
Lee Eun-ho, an Agriculture Ministry official, said on MBC-TV.
	   Before the storm, the government predicted a third straight
bumper rice harvest this year. Rice is the staple food of South
Korea's 44 million people.
	   Hardest hit was North Kyongsang province, which received up to
51.6 centimeters (20.3 inches) of rain in less than six hours. The
province reported 11 people killed and 19 others missing.
	   About one-third of Pohang, a major industrial city in the
province with a population of 650,000, was flooded, forcing 2,000
people to flee their homes, officials said.
	   Casualty figures increased as communications to remote villages
were restored.
	   Outside Pohang, Pohang Iron and Steel Co., the world's second
largest steel mill, reported no damage from the storm.
	   In Pusan, the nation's largest port, three people were missing
in a landslide. A Russian freighter moored at the port ran aground
after drifting in rough seas for several hours, officials said.
	   About a dozen people were either killed or missing in other
parts of the southern coastal regions, they said.

Sudan claims army crushed Ugandan, Eritrean forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese troops are chasing Ugandan and
Eritrean forces out of Sudan after crushing them in battles in the
south of the country, the interior minister said.
	   Sudan has claimed that heavy clashes have been taking place in
southern Sudan since Sept. 14, when it said Ugandan and Eritrean
troops entered Sudan to support local rebel groups. Uganda and
Eritrea have denied the reports.
	   ``The army has now crushed the invaders and is only cleaning the
areas'' in the southern Eastern Equatoria province, Interior
Minister Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohammed Hussein told state-run
television Wednesday night.
	   The army ``has settled the matter against the Ugandan and
Eritrean aggression forces and are working to repulse them out of
our national borders,'' Hussein added.
	   Christian and Animist rebels have been waging a military
campaign against the Khartoum government since 1983 for more
autonomy for the southern districts.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.
	   Southern Sudanese rebels are believed to have received military
assistance from Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea.
	   Both Uganda and the Sudanese government deny that they support
each other's insurgents.

Blair prepares for visit to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair plans a five-day visit
next week to Hong Kong and China, where he is expected to address
the continued Chinese occupation of Tibet.
	   Blair is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Tuesday.
	   During his visit, he plans to meet with Premier Zhu Rongji to
address the Asian financial crisis, human rights, Hong Kong and
international terrorism, the prime minister's office said.
	   Blair's spokesman, speaking with customary anonymity, said the
prime minister would not be ``hectoring'' or ``table-thumping'' on
his first visit to China, but instead would seek change through
dialogue and persuasion.
	   During his tour, Blair also is expected to visit Shanghai and
meet Mayor Xu Kuangdi, whose administration is aggressively
promoting Shanghai as a center for international investment.
	   Traveling with Blair will be a a large business contingent,
including representatives from Rolls-Royce, British Aerospace and
British Airways.
	   Blair is scheduled to arrive Oct. 9 in Hong Kong, where he will
contend that skeptics about the territory's future after Britain
transferred rule to China in 1997 were proved wrong, his spokesman
said.

Chechen president fires government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov dismissed his
government Thursday, sharply criticizing some ministers but giving
no immediate reason for the mass firing, a Russian news agency
said.
	   Maskhadov has been under increasing criticism from political
opponents, who have been demanding his resignation.
	   According to Interfax, Maskhadov dismissed all Cabinet ministers
as well as the heads of all federal agencies and organizations. He
said he would appoint eight new deputy prime ministers in charge of
the major ministries.
	   He praised the ministers of road transportation and agriculture,
despite firing them, but sharply criticized the ministers of oil,
construction and economy, Interfax said.
	   Without elaborating, he told a news conference that some
ministers ``will answer to law enforcement agencies as well as the
people,'' according to the report.
	   Maskhadov said the old government would remain in office until a
new government has been named, sometime next week.
	   The Chechen government, which considers itself fully independent
of Russia, has struggled with runaway crime and violence, as well
as an economy in ruins. Russia still considers Chechnya a
semiautonomous Russian republic.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest move by a U.S. financial powerhouse
to expand in Japan, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co.
said Thursday it will join forces with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. to
sell mutual funds in Japan.
	   The 3 billion yen (dlrs 22 million) deal marks the first time a
foreign company has formed a venture with a top-ranked Japanese
bank.
	   The companies agreed to split the management and ownership of
the new venture, which will develop and market investment trusts _
Japan's version of mutual funds.
	   The tie-up would give J.P. Morgan a big leg up in reaching
Japanese savers, who have collectively stashed away an estimated
dlrs 9 trillion, by giving the bank access to DKB's network of 340
branches across Japan.
	   ``Most important for us was the reputation DKB enjoyed with its
clients, the service it provided them, its large customer base, and
its distribution network at home,'' said Keith Schappert, president
of J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc., the bank's fund
management subsidiary.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo, one of Japan's largest banks, hopes to gain
know-how from J.P. Morgan in the latest financial products.
Japanese banks have been scrambling to sharpen their asset
management skills as the country's ``big bang'' deregulation drive
brings greater competition between banks, brokerages and fund
managers.
	   ``Both J.P. Morgan Investment Management and our bank share the
same vision of the importance of the asset management business in
Japan and on the opportunities presented by Japan's Big Bang,''
said Taira Hosaka, a DKB senior managing director.
	   Initially the tie-up will focus only on investment trusts, but
Hosaka said he would ``like to discuss the possibility of expanding
into private banking.''
	   Japan's Nihon Keizai financial daily reported Thursday that the
venture may eventually expand into areas such as investment banking
_ the lucrative business of managing sales of new stocks and bonds
for companies.
	   The two companies said the new venture would be set up as soon
as it is granted a license to operate, which could happen as soon
as early next year.
	   J.P. Morgan joins a growing list of American financial giants
with plans to dramatically expand their presence in Japan.
	   In June, New York-based Travelers Group Inc. paid dlrs 1.6
billion for a controlling stake in Nikko Securities Co., the
country's third-largest brokerage house. A month later, Prudential
Insurance Co. and Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. agreed to set up an
investment trust company in Japan.
	   Merrill Lynch and Co. hired 2,100 former employees of the failed
Yamaichi Securities Co. in February to staff more than 30 Japanese
branch offices. Fidelity Investments Co. also started to establish
a nationwide retail network in Japan earlier this year.
	   The agreement between J.P. Morgan and DKB was announced after
the close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Newspaper says United States to release Israeli spy Pollard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
that he discussed the fate of Jonathan Pollard with U.S. President
Bill Clinton this week, but that no decision was made about a
possible release of the Israeli spy.
	   The daily Yediot Ahronot reported earlier Thursday that Clinton
agreed in principle to free Pollard, who is serving a life term for
passing secret U.S. military documents to Israel.
	   The newspaper report was denied by a Clinton administration
official in Washington who said the U.S. government would oppose
any early release for Pollard. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   A statement released after a meeting of Netanyahu's Cabinet said
the prime minister told his ministers that the Pollard issue was
raised during his recent U.S. visit, but that no decision was made.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, was arrested
outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985.
	   It emerged later that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a
shadowy Israeli intelligence-gathering body in the United States.
Until recently, Israeli governments disavowed Pollard, and called
his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison.

Iraq says U.S. will fail in bid to overthrow Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that Washington will be
wasting money and effort if it tried to topple President Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   The Iraqi Parliament said in a statement that it `strongly
denounces'' moves by the U.S. Congress to provide nearly dlrs 100
million in military aid to Iraqi opposition groups.
	   On Tuesday, key republicans introduced bills that would
authorize President Bill Clinton to give $97 million to Iraqi
rebels and $2 million to Radio Free Iraq, set up under earlier
legislation.
	   The Clinton administration has not responded to the move
circulated by Republican congressmen that would, in effect, openly
commit the United States to overthrow the regime.
	   ``The representatives of the Iraqi people strongly condemn the
persistence of American Congress to interfere in the domestic
affairs of our land,'' said the 25-member Parliament in the
statement which was carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``This aggressive behavior blatantly violates the U.N. Charter
and international law and the right of the peoples to choose their
regime without foreign mandate,'' the statement added.
	   It said the Iraqi people had elected Saddam as their president
``with all freedom and fairness'' in a referendum in 1995 in which
the Iraqi leader was the sole candidate.
	   The statement said Iraq's disparate opposition groups were
``isolated and trivial'' and Washington will reap nothing from them
``but despair and humiliation.''

Australians bet on election outcome

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A Sydney gambler has bet 1,000
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 590) that Pauline Hanson's right-wing
populist One Nation party will win the government in Saturday's
election _ at odds of 250-1.
	   The long shot was laid with leading betting agency CentreBet,
which said Australians had wagered more than 600,000 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 350,000) on the election outcome by the end of
Thursday.
	   Less than two days before the election, the Alice Springs-based
agency said support was spread evenly between the conservative
governing coalition led by Prime Minister John Howard at 1-3 and
the Labor Party led by Kim Beazley at 2-1 _ too close to call a
result.
	   CentreBet manager Gerard Daffy said bookmakers were usually in
the best position to call the outcome of an event such as an
election because, unlike in opinion polls, people backed their
beliefs with money.
	   However, Poll98 _ the third Australian federal election on which
CentreBet had taken bets _ had him baffled.
	   ``At this time in the last (1996) election, interest in Labor
had petered out and the big money was all going one way, to the
coalition,'' Daffy said.
	   ``This time it's more evenly spread. I'd have to say, strictly
impartially, it could go one way or the other. It's that close.''
	   The biggest bet so far has been 50,000 Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 29,000) on the conservatives to win at the then-quoted odds of
2-5.
	   Not to be forgotten in this Australian election was a Norwegian
man who put 80 kroner _ that's 20 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
11.60) _ on One Nation to win, at early odds of 150-1.
	   ``He bet on a woman in the Danish federal election too, with
similar odds.
	   ``Maybe he's got a fixation on betting on women in elections,''
Daffy said of the bet.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks opened sharply lower on Wall Street on
Thursday, extending a global selling spree amid worries of lower
corporate profits ahead and fears of new financial crises.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which tumbled 237.90 points on
Wednesday, fell an additional 78.27 to 7,764.35 in the early going
Thursday. The Dow's 12.4 percent slide in the third quarter, which
ended Wednesday, was its worst quarterly performance in eight
years. The blue-chip average began the day down 65.63 points from
where it began this year and almost 1,500 points, or 16 percent,
from its July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   Broader market indicators also were losing more ground Thursday.
	   Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo shares falling
1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares were falling sharply
in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rates
unchanged.
	   Blue chips in London sank 2.8 percent to new lows for the year,
while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, was down 6 percent in
the afternoon, and the main indicator in Paris was down 3.6
percent.
	   The selloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into U.S.
Treasury securities, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty.
Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell further below 5 percent
Thursday morning, reaching levels unseen for long-term government
bonds since 1967.
	   Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock
Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on Wednesday, even though the Federal
Reserve had lowered a key interest rate one-quarter percentage
point on Tuesday. Some traders were disappointed that the cut was
not deeper amid fears a go-slow approach would not do enough to
counter the economic crises that have swept through Asia and Russia
and are threatening Latin America.
	   ``The smaller-than-expected lowering of interest rates by the
U.S. Federal Reserve has a chain reaction,'' said Lee Won-ho, an
analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul, South Korea, where the
main stock index fell by 1.5 percent Thursday. ``It is affecting
Wall Street, the Japanese market, ours and others.''
	   There also are worries about where the next financial market
crisis may erupt after last week's dlrs 3.6 billion private bailout
of Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut.
	   In addition, investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall
Street could signal a possible slowdown in economic growth _ a bad
omen for the many foreign companies dependent on exports to the
huge U.S. market.
	   ``There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a
direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high
percentage of their earnings from overseas markets,'' said Pelham
Smithers, a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd.
	   A new survey in Japan said confidence among small- and
medium-sized businesses about the economy plunged to its worst
level since the Bank of Japan began the quarterly samplings in
1967.

Hamas leader acknowledges group has trouble carrying out attack
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The leader of Hamas said Thursday
that a crackdown by Israeli and Palestinian security forces was
making it difficult for the Islamic militant group to carry out
threats to attack Israelis.
	   Hamas is trying to retaliate for last month's killing of two of
the group's fugitives by Israeli soldiers.
	   ``The military wing of Hamas faces grave difficulties,
especially now that there is cooperation by the Palestinian
Authority, Israel and America,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin told a news
conference.
	   A Hamas ``response will come at the appropriate time, even if it
is delayed,'' Yassin said.
	   Yassin said there had been increasing pressure on Hamas by
Israeli and Palestinian security forces. ``They arrest our men and
confiscate our weapons, but no matter how difficult they make it
for us we will not stop our resistance,'' he said.
	   Earlier this week, Palestinian intelligence raided a Hamas bomb
factory in the West Bank town of Hebron and seized nearly a ton of
explosives. On Tuesday, a Hamas activist was killed when a car with
powerful explosives blew up in the West Bank.
	   Despite the recent setbacks for the group, Israeli security
officials have said the Palestinian Authority is not doing enough
to prevent attacks on Israelis.
	   Tensions between Israel and Hamas rose Sept. 11 after two Hamas
fugitives, brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah, were shot and killed
by Israeli soldiers near the West Bank town of Hebron. Hamas'
military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, vowed to retaliate by carrying
out bombings in Israel, but has not done so.

UEFA postpones Albania-Greece soccer match because of unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ European soccer's governing body
Thursday postponed a match between Albania and Greece because of
political turmoil in Albania.
	   The Euro 2000 qualifying match, which had been scheduled for the
Albanian capital Tirana on Oct. 10, will be held instead Nov. 18,
said a statement from UEFA.
	   ``By taking this step, UEFA wishes to allow the host association
to stage the match in optimum conditions, particularly as far as
the security of the Greek delegation is concerned,'' the statement
said.
	   Albania has been gripped by a clash between the ruling Socialist
party and the opposition Democrats since the Sept. 12 slaying of
popular politician Azem Hajdari, a close aide to opposition leader
and former President Sali Berisha. The killing sparked riots in
Tirana.
	   ``UEFA assumes that the internal political situation will have
improved by mid-November,'' the statement said.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ For the first time in his notorious
career, Polish heavyweight Andrew Golota gets the home crowd
advantage in his crucial bout Friday against aging former champion
Tim Witherspoon.
	   Golota, 30, acknowledged the pressure of finally fighting
professionally in front of local fans 10 years after winning an
Olympic bronze medal in Seoul.
	   ``I have been waiting for such a night in Poland,'' he said
Wednesday at a pre-fight news conference packed with local
journalists. ``Believe me, it is hard to put it into words.''
	   But Witherspoon, hoping to join other middle-aged veterans in a
bid for another title fight, warned Polish fans to expect
disappointment.
	   ``I know he's your favorite, but I'm sorry to say that I'm going
to win,'' the 40-year-old American insisted.
	   Both fighters get dlrs 200,000 for the scheduled 10-round bout
in Wroclaw, in southwest Poland. Polish media describe it as
decisive, with the victor getting contender status while the
vanquished gains a palooka label.
	   ``The Loser Will Die,'' trumpeted the daily Przeglad Sportowy
(Sports Review) newspaper Thursday.
	   Recent history and motivation favor Golota, known more for his
three professional losses than his 31 victories, 27 by knockout.
	   He was ahead two times against former champion Riddick Bowe in
1996, only to get disqualified both times for low blows. Then WBC
champion Lennox Lewis knocked him out in the first round of a title
fight last year.
	   A chair-throwing brawl in the ring after the first Bowe fight
and a dlrs 5,000 fine for secretly using the painkiller lidocaine
90 minutes before the Lewis fight added to Golota's unsavory
reputation.
	   Golota fled Poland for Chicago in 1990 after being charged with
assault in a barroom brawl. He returned for the first time last
year to visit his mother and paid a dlrs 7,000 fine in the case.
	   Now he makes his first professional appearance in his native
land in what is being billed as the first pro heavyweight bout
staged in the former communist country.
	   Coming off three straight victories, Golota, who is trained by
Lou Duva, wants a big victory to bring another title shot and help
build interest in boxing at home.
	   Witherspoon, who held the WBC and WBA titles at different times,
lost his last two fights to fall to 46-7, with 31 knockouts. His
last title fight, a one-round knockout loss in 1986 to James
``Bonecrusher'' Smith, occurred when Golota was a teen-age amateur.
	   ``Golota is one of the best fighters in the world and, in my
opinion, he should be a world champion in the future,'' Witherspoon
said. ``But he's got hard luck, because ... he's boxing against
me.''
	   Organizers hope the fight shows Poland can stage world-class
boxing. Tickets will have world-class prices _ as high as 1,000
zlotys (almost dlrs 300), which is more than many Poles earn in a
month.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is
facing international condemnation _ and the increasing threat of
NATO action _ for a Serb massacre on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   The Security Council was holding an emergency meeting Thursday
at U.N. headquarters in New York, beginning at 4:30 p.m. (2030
GMT), after British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called for the
council to condemn the weekend massacre of civilians in the forests
around Obrija.
	   ``I think what we have seen is plain murder,'' Cook said
Thursday. ``Milosevic has outraged the whole of the world
community.''
	   A statement to the press, condemning the massacre, was the
likely outcome of the meeting, council diplomats said.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition leaders on Thursday
hailed Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's announcement that he will
resign in a month, saying his departure can't come soon enough.
	   ``He should not prolong his time in office,'' said Jozef
Moravcik, who was prime minister for six months in 1994 and now is
a top representative of the opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   Meciar, Slovakia's authoritarian ruler for virtually its entire
six years of independence, said in an emotional TV appearance
Wednesday night that he would quit when the new Parliament convenes
on Oct. 29.
	   Meciar's ouster as prime minister was forced by the results of
parliamentary elections last Friday and Saturday in which his
governing party was outpolled by opposition parties. But the
opposition and some analysts had expected that the 56-year-old
Meciar, who has been widely criticized for anti-democratic
practices, might fight to cling to power.
	   In his first public comments since the elections, Meciar said on
a talk show on state TV that he would not serve in the new
legislature or seek any government office. But he left open whether
he would step down as chairman of his party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia.
	   He also sang an impromptu farewell song to Slovaks with tears in
his eyes: ``God be with you, I did not hurt any of you.''
	   Meciar's party received 27 percent of the vote, more than any
other party. But an opposition alliance led by the Slovak
Democratic Coalition won enough votes to form a strong governing
majority.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has
declared the elections free and fair.
	   Despite announcing his departure, Meciar remained defiant,
criticizing the opposition and defending his record.
	   ``What could I have offered as premier? Everything that is in
me: my knowledge, strength, my skills as an organizer and
negotiator,'' he said. ``Yes, I was artful. Sometimes I was even
foxy. I used ruses and tactics.''
	   ``However, what should I have done as premier of a small
nation?'' he added, saying he stood up to big powers such as the
United States and Germany.
	   NATO and the European Union, wary of Meciar's undemocratic
methods, bypassed Slovakia for consideration for early membership.
	   ``We have not been against integration, we have been against
Slovakia being dominated,'' Meciar said.
	   He predicted that inflation will now rise, development will be
inhibited and the economy will grow unstable.
	   ``He cried, sang and talked,'' Petocz said. ``He could have done
it (resigned) in a more cultured and civilized way.''

Europol wants major role in fight against counterfeit euros
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The European Union's police agency
Thursday said members states must join forces to fight
counterfeiters of the euro, the union's common currency which will
be in circulation in 2002.
	   Solidarity in targeting forgers and other criminals will boost
the efficiency and effectiveness of the 15 members' national law
enforcement agencies, European police officials said Thursday.
	   ``It is of the utmost importance that the counterfeiting of the
euro needs to be tackled by all,'' said Jurgen Storbeck, the chief
of Europe's police agency Europol.
	   The single currency goes into force on Jan 1. 1999. The first
bank notes are expected to be in circulation in the second half of
2002.
	   ``We need a common approach. This is no longer a national
problem,'' Storbeck said said at a gathering to mark the entry into
force of the Europol Convention which provides the legal foundation
for Europol to carry out its tasks.
	   The agency's mandate includes fighting cross-border trafficking
of illicit drugs and nuclear materials as well as illegal
immigration, stolen vehicles and money laundering.
	   Europol does not have its own police force, instead it
facilitates the exchange of police intelligence between its members
via a powerful data base. Before the creation of Europol, countries
did not have a computer system to share information about criminal
activity.
	   But as organized crimes become more sophisticated so must law
enforcement techniques, said officials.
	   ``We must be fully aware that one single country cannot
successfully take up arms against organized crime, said Austrian
Interior Minister Karl Schloegl, whose country holds the rotating
European Union presidency.
	   ``No country by itself can counter and combat this new form of
criminality,'' he added.
	   Combating cross-border terrorism and containing the influx of
organized crime from Eastern Europe are other major challenges for
Europol, said Schloegl.
	   As the agency widens its scope of crime-fighting authority, it
is implementing a computer system that all members will be able to
access for information. Currently, only Europol, based in an
ivy-covered building in The Hague, has access to the entire system
of data from the 15 countries.
	   The system is expected to be operational at the end of 2000.

Ukraine to resume drafting conscripts for military service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will resume drafting conscripts for
military service this fall despite pressing financial problems in
the country's army, Defense Minister Oleksandr Kuzmuk said
Thursday.
	   Some 50,000 people will be drafted in the next several months,
he said.
	   President Leonid Kuchma suspended the military draft last spring
after the Defense Ministry said it did not need any more
conscripts.
	   However, Ukrainian media speculated that the suspension was due
to a lack of funds, and cited Kuzmuk's earlier complaints that his
ministry would have enough money to cover only 46 percent of what
the army needs this year.
	   Ukraine's army, like that in other former Soviet republics, has
been badly hurt by the Soviet collapse and ensuing economic
problems. The force has been reduced by nearly one-third from its
pre-independence level of 900,000 men.
	   Kuzmuk said the army was expected to have 320,000 servicemen by
the end of the year, after the draft is completed. Conscripts serve
for 18 months.
	   The Interfax news agency said 10,000 people would be cut from
the military in 1999, although it was not clear whether they would
be enlisted men or senior officers.
	   Ukraine's Security Council secretary Volodymyr Horbulin told
reporters on Thursday that Ukraine needs an army of around 350,000
men to maintain its security.

Brittan says China increasingly affected by Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With World-Markets &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - European Union Foreign Trade
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan warned Thursday that the financial
turmoil in Asia was beginning to take a more serious toll on China.
	   ``The unsettling impact of the regional crisis on Chinese policy
makers is clearer than before,'' Brittan said. Brittan said Chinese
exports are suffering and that China's target of 8 percent growth
this year looks seriously under threat.
	   But he warned devaluation will not solve China's problems.
	   ``Whilst times may be tough, policies of reform, market openness
and international engagement are the only viable responses for
China,'' he said.
	   Brittan noted that Japan should also move fast to implement a
package of tax cuts and public spending the government has already
announced.
	   ``We do not accept that they can solve their problems through
export-led growth,'' he said.
	   He was speaking as part of a panel of experts at a debate on the
Asian crisis, held at the European parliament. The debate was
organized by the European Institute of Asian Studies.
	   Earlier this week, the World Bank warned that Asia's financial
turmoil could get worse. In a report, it said the crisis had spread
to markets around the world and posed risks to global expansion.
	   Referring to Malaysia, Brittan said Malaysia's Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad decision to isolate his country's economy may
produce short-term benefits but did not address the country's
fundamental problems.
	   Malaysia's economic problems are its worst in more than three
decades. The economy contracted by almost 7 percent in the second
quarter of 1998, pushing it into full-blown recession.

Vienna university dissected bodies of Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with other Austrian restitution moves; trims.
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Doctors and medical students at Vienna
University dissected nearly 1,400 bodies executed on orders of Nazi
courts and some victims' body parts remained on display up to this
year, researchers announced Thursday.
	   The bodies _ including those of eight Jews and hundreds of
others executed for resisting the Nazis _ were transferred to the
university's anatomy institute for research and teaching purposes,
said the authors of a report examining the role of the medical
faculty during Nazi rule in Austria.
	   The bodies came from the execution chambers of the main Vienna
court and not from Nazi death camps, as had been alleged, the
report said.
	   The report is the latest of a growing number of investigations
of this country and its institutions after Adolf Hitler
incorporated the land of his birth into Nazi Germany in 1938.
	   After World War II, Austria depicted itself as a victim of the
Nazis. But that image has been tarnished in recent years as
evidence piles up that many Austrians were eager co-participants in
Nazi atrocities.
	   Research into the medical faculty began last year, after
allegations that a highly acclaimed and popular anatomy atlas used
the bodies of Holocaust victims as the basis of highly detailed
drawings.
	   On Thursday, the researchers said those suspicions could not be
confirmed, although it was possible that bodies transferred by
court order after being executed by the Nazis in Vienna could have
served as models.
	   The atlas, ``Topographical Anatomy of the Human Being,'' was
compiled by Eduard Pernkopf, a leading Nazi who headed the
university's medical faculty after Hitler annexed Austria. Pernkopf
served as university rector from 1943 to 1945 and continued
updating the atlas until his death in 1955.
	   In early editions of the atlas, swastikas and SS lightning-bolt
symbols were part of some of the artists' signatures. Those Nazi
emblems were airbrushed out of later editions.
	   The report was commissioned by the university after the
Holocaust museum in Jerusalem asked for an investigation into the
Pernkopf book.
	   Vienna University Rector Alfred Ebenbauer cited ``our own
indifference and cowardice,'' in criticizing the time that elapsed
between the Nazi era and publication of the report, plus the fact
that it was drawn up only after outsiders asked for the
investigation.
	   Medical Faculty Dean Wolfgang Schuetz said the investigation
came ``a generation too late.''
	   The report said that of the approximately 1,400 bodies
transferred to the anatomy institute by the courts between 1938 and
1945, about half were of victims executed for ``resisting the Nazi
regime.''
	   Of the hundreds of specimens remaining from that time, more than
200 were either established as having been remnants of Nazi victims
or are suspected as such, the report said. They were recently
removed from display and will be properly buried.
	   Some of the specimens were organs and body parts of physically
or mentally handicapped infants found deficient and killed by Nazi
doctors. Neurologist Heinrich Gross, accused of participating in
the killings and using the remains of the victims for research up
to the mid 1960s is being investigated on possible murder charges.
	   Austria's s new frankness began in 1988, when the fiftieth
anniversary of Hitler's annexation coincided with the furor
surrounding then-President Kurt Waldheim and his concealed past as
an intelligence officer in the German army during World War II.
	   Best-selling books, a recent documentary film and touring
exhibit have underscored the new interest in reexamining the Nazi
era. One book, ``Hitler's Vienna,'' traces how the Austrian capital
of the early twentieth Century fed and formed the Nazi leader's
views.
	   The film, titled in English ``East of Eden,'' reveals that
ordinary Austrian soldiers serving in Hitler's army knew of mass
executions and witnessed torture and looting on the eastern front _
denting the myth that only special units like the dreaded SS
perpetrated atrocities.
	   Most recently, Austria has announced a wide-ranging search of
its museums with a view to returning works of art taken or coerced
from Jews by the Nazis. And a major Austrian bank is negotiating on
compensating Holocaust victims for gold stolen from them during the
Nazi era.
	   A government commission has been formed to look into the issue
of Nazi-era forced labor and ``aryanization'' _ expropriating
Jewish businesses and giving them to Nazi party members.

Sierra Leone's notorious rebel leader appears in court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The country's most notorious rebel
leader, Foday Sankoh, appeared in court Thursday to answer to
charges of treason, but continued to stall the proceedings by
saying he had no lawyer.
	   It was Sankoh's third appearance before Justice Samuel Ademosu
and the third time his trial was held over.
	   If found guilty, Sankoh could face the death penalty. Sixteen
civilians, including five journalists, were sentenced to death for
treason in related cases in August.
	   Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, was allied
with a military junta that seized power in 1997 but was ousted 10
months later by a Nigerian-led West African intervention force.
	   The rebel front has been accused of widespread atrocities
throughout the country as part of its longstanding and often
macabre campaign to topple successive governments.
	   Since the February ouster of the country's junta, the RUF and
remnants of the military government have been accused of torture,
rape, and the almost systematic maiming of thousands of civilians
in rural Sierra Leone. To terrorize local communities, RUF rebels
are known to have hacked off the hands or feet of suspected
government sympathizers, gouge out the eyes of their victims and
rape women in full view of family members.
	   Accounts of the atrocities have been documented by aid workers
and journalists.
	   Sankoh, an elusive character, is seen as the mastermind behind
the terror campaign.
	   Standing handcuffed before the judge, Sankoh said he was unable
to afford a lawyer to represent him, but urged the court to
continue with the trial.
	   ``You can carry on,'' Sankoh told Ademosu, ``God will provide
somebody to represent me.''
	   Sankoh's first court appearance was at the start of September
after he was sent back Sierra Leone in July from Nigeria, where he
was being held on gun smuggling charges.
	   His next court appearance is scheduled for Monday.

Food supply among flood victims Bangladesh's biggest problem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA , Bangladesh (AP) _ The biggest challenge before
flood-ravaged Bangladesh is to ensure proper management of food
distribution, a senior official said.
	   Mohammad Anisuzzaman, Adviser to the Prime Minister on food and
agriculture, in an interview published in the Daily Star newspaper
Thursday, said dispatching food quickly to needy people through a
disciplined distribution network was a problem.
	   Anisuzzaman, who enjoys the status of a cabinet minister, said
the food gap is estimated at more than four million metric tons but
could widen after second-phase assessment of the food position by
the middle of the month.
	   The worst monsoon floods in decades battering this delta nation
of 124 million people for more than two months killing more than
1,000 people. Millions were marooned in the flood waters, lost
their homes and crops leading to large scale food scarcity.
	   Anisuzzaman however, brushed aside the possibility of famine in
the country.
	   ``The international community has responded very favorably to
Bangladesh request for food which will be arriving the country's
ports in quick installments in coming days,'' he said
	   Already more than 750,000 metric tons of food grain have been
imported through private channels over the last three months and
another 67,000 tons imported by the government are expected to
arrive soon.
	   Besides, nearly 700,000 metric tons of foodgrain in government
stock is being distributed among flood victims, Anisuzzaman said.
	   Bangladesh's current foreign reserves stands at dlrs 1.8 billion
with government requests for dlrs 330 million waiting approval from
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The money will
be used to meet the balance of payment deficit caused mainly by
massive food purchase from the international market.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Venus Williams used her overwhelming
power to beat French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-3, 6-2
on Thursday and reach the semifinals of the dlrs 6.7 million Grand
Slam Cup.
	   Williams, 18, served hard on the fast indoor surface of Munich's
Olympiahalle and Sanchez-Vicario was unable to match the American's
powerful ground strokes.
	   Both players were inconsistent in the first set, Williams
dropping her serve twice and Sanchez-Vicario unable to hold three
times. A return by the Spaniard that went long gave Williams the
first set.
	   Williams broke serve for a decisive 3-2 lead in the second set
and gained another break to go up 5-2 after rallying from a 0-40
deficit by winning five straight points. She gained the break by
hitting an overhead smash.
	   The American served out the match in the next game, hitting a
perfect volley on her second match point.
	   Women are playing for the first time at the tournament that
brings together players with best records in the four Grand Slam
events of the year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and
Wimbledon.
	   Only one of the year's Grand Slam champions among the men is
here _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda.
	   But the eight women included all the champions and all the
top-ranked players except Monica Seles.
	   Two of the Grand Slam champions already have been eliminated _
Sanchez-Vicario and Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion who was
ousted Wednesday by Patty Schnyder.
	   The tournament is the most lucrative per head in tennis, and
Williams earned dlrs 200,000 for reaching the semifinals.
Sanchez-Vicario's consolation was dlrs 100,000.
	   Williams, ranked No. 5, brought her career record against
Sanchez-Vicario to 3-2. The American reached the semifinals of the
U.S. Open earlier this month and made the quarterfinals in the
other three Grand Slams.
	   Sanchez-Vicario won her fourth Grand Slam career title in Paris
this summer and is ranked No. 4 in the world.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb sources in Kosovo reported
Thursday that Yugoslav army forces and Serb special police have
withdrawn to their bases as demanded by the U.N. Security Council.
	   Kosovo's Serb-run Media Center, which reflects official
viewpoints, said that ``only police units needed to preserve public
security and order and guard communications, are out in the
field.''
	   Last Monday Serbian authorities pledged the withdrawal of troops
in an effort to avert NATO intervention in Kosovo. There was no

Stop your complaining about no hot water, state premier tells
</HEADLINE>
Victorians
 &UR; Eds: Note strong language in 6th graf. Adds warnings about
scaldings from boiling water, expands. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australians in Victoria state who
are without
	   natural gas for hot showers were fuming Thursday at their state
leader, who called his people sissies for complaining about the
crisis.
	   ``What are we coming to where the whole society, where our
underbelly is so soft?'' Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett
scolded on Wednesday night on a radio show.
	   A huge fire at Esso's Longford gas refinery in Victoria state
last Friday
	   killed two men and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without natural gas for at
least two weeks.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are
	   looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook their food.
	   Those people lucky enough to have electric hot water heaters are
finding out just how many friends they have, as people arrive with
towels and soap to impose on them.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
with electric hot water heaters so people can shower there -- a
relief as sweaty Victorias swelter in a heat wave that hit 89
degrees (32 Celsius) Thursday.
	   But Kennett told his people to stop ``bitching and moaning''
about cold showers and no cooking gas.
	   ``I mean, our grandparents use to have to boil water for a bath
every night,'' Kennett said.
	   But with business losing many millions of dollars and 100,000
workers laid off, callers to talk radio shows in Melbourne
castigated Kennett for his
	   criticism.
	   State ambulance service spokesman John Fasham said Thursday that
some children have been scalded seriously when parents accidentally
poured boiling water over them while they were in the bath.
	   On Tuesday, a restaurant exploded as the manager was trying to
convert it to bottled gas, injuring two people, one seriously.
	   Some industry sectors have speculated the aftermath of the fires
could last up to six months, even if gas is restored within a
couple of weeks.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   At least 100,000 workers in Victoria have been laid off as the
Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and brick-making plants,
bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   Victoria Trades Hall Council union chief Leigh Hubbard said by
next week 120,000 workers will be idled.
	   The Australian Industry Group estimates the crisis could cost
100 million
	   Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) each day it goes on,
which amounts to a third of the sate's production.
	   Economists estimate that the crisis will wipe half a percent off
Australia gross Domestic product if it lasts two weeks, the amount
the economy had been expected to grow in the next quarter.
	   The industrial crisis spread interstate, with other factories
that rely on business with Victoria having to lay off workers.
	   In South Australia, two of Australia's largest automotive
companies, Holden and Mitsubishi, announced they were preparing for
several days of lost
	   production because of a lack of parts from Victoria.
	   Funeral homes have turned to bottled gas in order to keep
crematoriums operating.
	   The state on Wednesday raised the fine for turning on gas
without authorization from 500 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290)
to 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,800).
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Police spokeswoman falsifies her diploma to get a job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - A police spokeswoman got her job
by a trick when she falsified a university diploma to be hired,
police said Thursday.
	   The police spokeswoman in the town of Pilsen, 100 kilometers (60
miles) southwest of Prague, beat four other candidates in an
interview because she pretended she finished her bachelor degree,
the CTK news agency quoted local police official Miloslav Mastera
as saying.
	   The spokeswoman refused to submit her diploma for several months
despite repeatedly being asked to do so. She finally submitted one
but the police called the university and found out it was false.
	   She was charged with fraud and, if convicted, faces up to two
years in prison.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi said
Thursday he hoped France would allow the North African country to
reschedule its debt payments.
	   ``The Moroccan people have high hopes that the French leaders
will be allies, and supportive of what we're doing in Morocco,''
Youssoufi told reporters after meeting with President Jacques
Chirac.
	   Morocco's debt repayment is expected to be the main topic of
discussion during Youssoufi's two-day visit. Youssoufi, who took
office earlier this year, said recently his country's global debt
was ``an enormous burden'' for his country.
	   Morocco's debt is estimated at dlrs 19 billion, equivalent to
almost 60 percent of the country's growth domestic product.
Moroccan Finance Minister Fathallah Oalalou has estimated that 17
percent of the debt is with France.
	   Before lunching at the Elysee Palace, Youssoufi visited the tomb
of French resistant Jean Moulin in the Pantheon.
	   During his visit, Youssoufi also will meet with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and other officials.

Premier warns EU entry refusal could destabilize Lithuanian
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Lithuania's prime minister told the
European Union Thursday it risked undermining reforms in his
country if the EU refused to invite the Baltic nation for
membership talks next year.
	   ``It would have a negative impact on the stability of our
country,'' Gediminas Vagnorius said. ``It would have a negative
opinion on our public opinion.''
	   Lithuania is hoping EU leaders will at agree their year-end
summit in Vienna, Austria, to open formal membership talks next
year.
	   The EU excluded Lithuania from a group of six nations which
started accession membership with the EU in March and told the
Baltic republic it needs to modernize its administration and reform
its economy before it can start talks.
	   ``Lithuania will do all it can to resolve its problems,''
Vagnorius said at a news conference with EU Commission President
Jacques Santer. ``We'll make so much progress that it will be
impossible not to invite us.''
	   The EU's executive Commission is scheduled to present progress
reports to the Vienna summit on each of the 11 candidates for
membership _ the six that have already started negotiations and
those still waiting.
	   Those in the second group _ Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania
and Bulgaria _ could be invited to start talks if they are judged
to have made sufficient progress.

Vienna university dissected bodies of Nazi victims
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two grafs at end with other Austrian restitution
moves; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE JAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Doctors and medical students at Vienna
University dissected nearly 1,400 bodies executed on orders of Nazi
courts and some victims' body parts remained on display up to this
year, researchers announced Thursday.
	   The bodies _ including those of eight Jews and hundreds of
others executed for resisting the Nazis _ were transferred to the
university's anatomy institute for research and teaching purposes,
said the authors of a report examining the role of the medical
faculty during Nazi rule in Austria.
	   The bodies came from the execution chambers of the main Vienna
court and not from Nazi death camps, as had been alleged, the
report said.
	   The report is the latest of a growing number of investigations
of this country and its institutions after Adolf Hitler
incorporated the land of his birth into Nazi Germany in 1938.
	   After World War II, Austria depicted itself as a victim of the
Nazis. But that image has been tarnished in recent years as
evidence piles up that many Austrians were eager co-participants in
Nazi atrocities.
	   Research into the medical faculty began last year, after
allegations that a highly acclaimed and popular anatomy atlas used
the bodies of Holocaust victims as the basis of highly detailed
drawings.
	   On Thursday, the researchers said those suspicions could not be
confirmed, although it was possible that bodies transferred by
court order after being executed by the Nazis in Vienna could have
served as models.
	   The atlas, ``Topographical Anatomy of the Human Being,'' was
compiled by Eduard Pernkopf, a leading Nazi who headed the
university's medical faculty after Hitler annexed Austria. Pernkopf
served as university rector from 1943 to 1945 and continued
updating the atlas until his death in 1955.
	   In early editions of the atlas, swastikas and SS lightning-bolt
symbols were part of some of the artists' signatures. Those Nazi
emblems were airbrushed out of later editions.
	   The report was commissioned by the university after the
Holocaust museum in Jerusalem asked for an investigation into the
Pernkopf book.
	   Vienna University Rector Alfred Ebenbauer cited ``our own
indifference and cowardice,'' in criticizing the time that elapsed
between the Nazi era and publication of the report, plus the fact
that it was drawn up only after outsiders asked for the
investigation.
	   Medical Faculty Dean Wolfgang Schuetz said the investigation
came ``a generation too late.''
	   The report said that of the approximately 1,400 bodies
transferred to the anatomy institute by the courts between 1938 and
1945, about half were of victims executed for ``resisting the Nazi
regime.''
	   Of the hundreds of specimens remaining from that time, more than
200 were either established as having been remnants of Nazi victims
or are suspected as such, the report said. They were recently
removed from display and will be properly buried.
	   Some of the specimens were organs and body parts of physically
or mentally handicapped infants found deficient and killed by Nazi
doctors. Neurologist Heinrich Gross, accused of participating in
the killings and using the remains of the victims for research up
to the mid 1960s is being investigated on possible murder charges.
	   Austria's s new frankness began in 1988, when the fiftieth
anniversary of Hitler's annexation coincided with the furor
surrounding then-President Kurt Waldheim and his concealed past as
an intelligence officer in the German army during World War II.
	   Best-selling books, a recent documentary film and touring
exhibit have underscored the new interest in reexamining the Nazi
era. One book, ``Hitler's Vienna,'' traces how the Austrian capital
of the early twentieth Century fed and formed the Nazi leader's
views.
	   The film, titled in English ``East of Eden,'' reveals that
ordinary Austrian soldiers serving in Hitler's army knew of mass
executions and witnessed torture and looting on the eastern front _
denting the myth that only special units like the dreaded SS
perpetrated atrocities.
	   Most recently, Austria has announced a wide-ranging search of
its museums with a view to returning works of art taken or coerced
from Jews by the Nazis. And a major Austrian bank is negotiating on
compensating Holocaust victims for gold stolen from them during the
Nazi era.
	   A government commission has been formed to look into the issue
of Nazi-era forced labor and ``aryanization'' _ expropriating
Jewish businesses and giving them to Nazi party members.

Polish intellectuals oppose Zakopane bid for 2006 Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish intellectuals including two Nobel
laureates appealed Thursday for the government to drop the idea of
hosting the 2006 Winter Olympics in Zakopane.
	   ``There are places sacred for Polish culture, which one must not
trade,'' said 12 signatories of the appeal, published Thursday in
the daily Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
	   They included poets Wislawa Szymborska and Czeslaw Milosz, who
won Nobel Prizes in literature in 1996 and 1980 respectively, as
well as writers Stanislaw Lem and Ryszard Kapuscinski, and composer
Wojciech Kilar.
	   After the Olympics, the mountain resort near the border with
Slovakia will become ``garbage on the waste dump of our
civilization,'' said the letter addressed to Polish leaders and the
International Olympic Committee.
	   Zakopane, in the Tatra mountains 400 kilometers (250 miles)
south of Warsaw, made its bid in August to host the 2006 Olympics.
President Aleksander Kwasniewki and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek both
support the bid.
	   But environmentalists, intellectuals and some politicians oppose
the plan, arguing a mass sports event and its infrastructure would
ruin the natural environment of the region.
	   Much of the Zakopane area is in the Tatra National Park,
established in 1954 to protect plants and wildlife. It was
designated a natural reserve by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1992.
	   Tatra National Park features Kasprowy Wierch, which is Poland's
tallest mountain available to skiers at 1,897 meters (6,557 feet).
It has two ski slopes, and park management has long resisted calls
to build more lifts, saying more skiers would damage the
environment.
	   Park directors argue that expanding the skiing area for the
Olympics would require cutting 10,000 trees in violation of an
environmental protection law.
	   ``We appeal for reason,'' the intellectuals said in their
letter. ``One must not break environmental laws and violate the
sacred character of the primeval harmony of the Tatra mountain
nature in order to achieve temporary gains.''
	   Kwasniewski, who headed the national Olympic committee from
1988-89, wants Poland to be the first former communist country to
host the Games. The government and Zakopane officials believe
winning the bid would boost Poland's prestige and attract new
foreign investment.
	   Zakopane is one of six bidders for the 2006 Games. Others are
Sion, Switzerland; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Turin, Italy; a joint
bid by Helsinki, Finland, and Lillehammer, Norway; and Klagenfurt,
Austria, making a three-country bid that includes regions of
Slovenia and Italy.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Yugoslav army said Thursday six
soldiers were killed and seven wounded in heavy fighting along the
Albanian border, heightening concern the Kosovo conflict could
spill over into regional warfare.
	   International efforts to halt the bloodshed have taken on new
urgency after reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in
the majority Albanian province, part of Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic.
	   In the latest allegation, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center claimed the bodies of 12 males _ including a
15-year-old boy _ were discovered Thursday in the Suva Reka region
about 45 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina. The report
could not be confirmed.
	   Trying to deflect international criticism _ and the growing
possibility of NATO intervention _ the Serb-run Media Center, which
reflects official views on Thursday announced a withdrawal of
combat forces from areas of conflict.
	   It said that ``only police units needed to preserve public
security and order and guard communications, are out in the
field.''
	   Last Monday Serbia promised the withdrawal of combat units.
There was no immediate comment from international observers in the
province on the Serb claim.

Ozone hole above Antarctic biggest ever for September, expert says

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The so-called ``ozone hole'' above the Antarctic
this September was the largest and deepest ever recorded for the
month, the World Meteorological Organization said Thursday.
	   The surface area of the gap in the ozone, a protective layer
that shields the earth from damaging ultraviolet rays, is more than
15 percent bigger than ever before and now covers an area two and a
half times the size of Europe, WMO expert Rumen Bojkov said.
	   ``The dilution (of the ozone layer) is very, very serious,''
Bojkov said. ``We could expect any other year to have a very strong
depletion, but this year it's a bit stronger than any of the
previous years.''
	   Reduction of the ozone layer can let harmful ultraviolet rays
from the sun reach the earth's surface. Too much UV radiation can
cause skin cancer and destroy the tiny plants at the beginning of
the food chain.
	   Scientists expect a reduction in the ozone over the Antarctic
each September. But this September's ozone hole has expanded
outside Antarctica and exposes a huge swath of Pacific and Atlantic
ocean including the southern tip of South America.
	   A WMO base station in Tierra del Fuego, in southern Argentina,
reported a ``very unusual'' low level of ozone in the atmosphere,
Bojkov said.
	   The ozone reduction is more severe than in previous years
because the whirlpool-like atmospheric phenomenon that develops in
the stratosphere above the South Pole annually, the polar vortex,
is larger than before, Bojkov said.
	   A polar vortex is a moving cyclone with a low pressure, cold
center in which ozone is less likely to be present.
	   An additional cause of ozone depletion is the chlorine and
bromine released by man-made chemical compounds such as
chlorofluorocarbons which are contained in some aerosols.
	   Bojkov said the maximum level of chlorofluorocarbons has not yet
been reached. It will reach that level in two to three years and
will continue to be high for the next 10-15 years.
	   The WMO is urging governments to strengthen collaboration in
monitoring and research of the problem and to adhere to the
Montreal Protocol under which commits countries to eliminating
production and use of ozone-depleting substances.

Expletive-ridden poem by late Beatle John Lennon up for auction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: note contents; the company Finan and Co. uses an ampersand &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A foul-mouthed poem written by the late Beatle
John Lennon will be put up for auction next week by the shocked fan
who received it almost 30 years ago.
	   The typed work, made up of a four-letter expletive repeated 104
times around the single word ``you,'' was sent to poet Susan Baker
in 1969 after she wrote to Lennon requesting a poem.
	   Signed and titled by Lennon and countersigned by his wife, Yoko
Ono, it consists of the expletive arranged in seven columns with
the word ``you'' at the center of the middle column.
	   ``Cataloguing the item was something of a problem as quite
obviously it could offend,'' said Robert Finan, of the auctioneers
Finan and Co., which will offer it for sale Oct. 10 in Wiltshire,
in western England.
	   ``I have avoided the use of the expletive and I am making sure
that the photocopies of the documents are not on show at the
viewing days,'' Finan said. ``This is obviously a very unusual
piece. Trying to put a price on it is very difficult indeed. We
shall just have to see what the market place decides.''
	   Ms. Baker was the manager of a band called the Barrow Poets,
which offered performances of both poetry and music.
	   The covering letter handwritten by Lennon also will be included
in the auction. It reads: ``Dear Susan, here's the poem you wanted
_ you can publish ... but not make a record of it _ for it turns
into a Song then _ OK?' ''

Government considers Soviet-style economic plan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov denied Thursday
his government plans to prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars
and other foreign currencies, and urged the International Monetary
Fund to continue disbursing an economic bailout package.
	   Primakov's statement followed Russian media reports that the
government was considering an economic plan that would effectively
reverse free-market reforms by imposing Soviet-style currency
restrictions and increasing the number of rubles in circulation.
	   ``All talk about a Draconian law allegedly being developed by
the Cabinet which would give the government a monopoly in foreign
currency dealings is not worth an eggshell,'' Primakov said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   Primakov refused to comment on Russian media reports about plans
to dramatically boost the money supply to pay such things as
overdue wages and pensions and subsidies to ailing industries. He
said a government delegation would fly to the United States on
Friday for talks on the issue with the IMF.
	   Primakov also strongly urged the IMF to deliver a previously
negotiated dlrs 4.3 billion loan that was put on hold after the
Russian financial crisis hit in August.
	   IMF officials said they want the Russian government to come up
with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and made it
clear that currency controls and boosting money supply were out of
the question.
	   The Russian government has allowed the U.S. dollar and other
foreign currencies to circulate freely since the 1991 collapse of
the Soviet Union, and Russia now has more dollars in its economy
than any country besides the United States, according to U.S.
officials.
	   Those who favor restricting or prohibiting foreign currencies
argue that would help the government maintain its own hard currency
reserves and would stabilize and strengthen the ruble.
	   Primakov said on national television that the economic plan
reported by the Russian media is purely preliminary. ``It's just
one of six versions under consideration,'' Primakov said, lashing
out at reporters for spreading ``speculations.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, met with Gov. Eduard Rossel
of the Urals region of Sverdlovsk on Thursday. The two men
discussed Rossel's plan for a ruble backed by gold reserves and his
proposal to ban foreign currency circulation.
	   Russian news agencies initially reported that Yeltsin favored
the plan, but his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin denied that.
	   The economic plan under consideration by the Cabinet sets an
ambitious spending program, including compensation to the poor for
steep price rises and generous subsidies to stagnant Russian
industries.
	   The blueprint, published in the respected business daily
Kommersant on Thursday, gives no clue as to where the money would
come from. The newspaper said the obvious answer would be the
generous printing of new money, which would increase inflation.
	   Combined with currency controls, an increased money supply would
devastate the consumer market, which has already been hit hard by
the ruble's devaluation, critics say.
	   ``If they print new money, that will only make goods disappear
from the shelves,'' Kommersant said.
	   Hoping to avoid the further fall of the ruble, the government's
plan calls for tight currency controls. It would ban Russians from
buying foreign currency or taking more than dlrs 500 abroad.
	   It also envisages a greater government role in determining the
ruble's exchange rate. The government would take into account
Russia's balance of payments, the size of the Central Bank's
foreign exchange and gold reserves, and the inflation rate.
	   To prop up the ruble, the plan would also virtually ban
commercial banks from foreign currency speculation, oblige
exporters to sell most of their foreign-currency earnings at the
government-controlled rate and shut loopholes allowing them to keep
foreign currency abroad.
	   The plan also calls for the nationalization of some Russian
commercial banks and using their assets to provide credits to
industries.
	   The document has been drafted by a group of economists led by
Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in
charge of economic strategy.
	   The plan is to be sent to parliament early next week.

Spain's Aznar rules out early elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar on Thursday
ruled out calling early elections, saying he would serve until his
term ends in 2000.
	   ``I do not have the slightest intention of moving up the
elections,'' he said in a radio interview.
	   ``Spain's parliamentary stability and progress are solid enough
to keep 2000 as the target year for holding the elections,'' said
Aznar, who took power in 1996 after nearly 14 years of Socialist
rule.
	   The newspaper El Mundo reported Tuesday that some in Aznar's
government and his center-right Popular Party favor moving up the
elections to coincide with local, regional and European Parliament
voting scheduled for June 1999.
	   Those who advocate early elections say the government should
cash in on what they see as a healthy economy, with growth robust
and interest rates low, before things turn sour in a time of global
economic jitters.
	   A fresh electoral mandate would also boost the government's
position in eventual talks with independence-seeking Basque
nationalists expected following the armed separatist group ETA's
recent ceasefire declaration, the paper said.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ A splashy tabloid stopped publishing on
Thursday, and government critics charged it was a victim of the new
leadership's preference for more conservative newspapers.
	   ``We were given word yesterday evening that we are suspended,''
said Kurir's chief editor, Gabor Szuecs. Copies of the last edition
_ four pages instead of the usual 24 _ was sold by editorial staff
Thursday on street corners.
	   ``It is unacceptable to suspend newspapers critical of the
government on the pretext of financial difficulties,'' said Laszlo
Kovacs, the chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, the biggest
opposition party.
	   Kurir was owned by Postabank, whose top management was fired by
the government several weeks ago once the government essentially
gained majority ownership in the bank by re-nationalizing it.
	   The bank was reportedly 110 billion forints (dlrs 512 million)
in the red and Kurir itself was losing money. But Szuecs, the chief
editor, said the daily Magyar Nemzet, also a money loser owned by
Postabank, continues to its subsidized existence.
	   Prime Minister Viktor Orban likes Magyar Nemzet and has promised
to create ``a more balanced media.'' His preference is center-right
to right, with strong nationalistic overtones.
	   Orban has also spoken in support of a draft bill tabled by Bela
Pokol, a deputy of the Smallholders' Party, Orban's junior
coalition partner.
	   If passed, the bill will force papers to print corrections or
retractions not only when it comes to errors but also for opinions
deemed unfavorable by the person or institution criticized. The
Vienna-based International Press Institute says such legislation
would constitute a ``a brutal attack against freedom of opinion and
also a starting point of a process of intimidation of the media.''

Ozone hole above Antarctic biggest ever for September, expert says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic is
the largest and deepest ever recorded for September, the World
Meteorological Organization said Thursday.
	   The surface area of the gap in the ozone, a protective layer
that shields the earth from damaging ultraviolet rays, is at least
15 percent larger than before and now exposes an area two and a
half times the size of Europe, WMO expert Rumen Bojkov said.
	   ``The dilution (of the ozone layer) is very, very serious,''
Bojkov said. ``We could expect any other year to have a very strong
depletion, but this year it's a bit stronger than any of the
previous years.''
	   Reduction of the ozone layer can let harmful ultraviolet rays
from the sun reach the earth's surface. Too much UV radiation can
cause skin cancer and destroy the tiny plants at the beginning of
the food chain.
	   Scientists expect a reduction in the ozone over the Antarctic
each September. But this September's ozone hole has expanded
outside Antarctica and exposes a huge swath of Pacific and Atlantic
ocean including the southern tip of South America.
	   A WMO base station in Tierra del Fuego, in southern Argentina,
reported a ``very unusual'' low level of ozone in the atmosphere,
Bojkov said.
	   The ozone reduction is more severe than in previous years
because the whirlpool-like atmospheric phenomenon that develops in
the stratosphere above the South Pole annually, the polar vortex,
is larger than before, Bojkov said.
	   A polar vortex is a moving cyclone with a low-pressure, cold
center where ozone is less likely to be present.
	   An additional cause of ozone depletion is the chlorine and
bromine released by manmade chemical compounds such as
chlorofluorocarbons, which are contained in some aerosols.
	   Bojkov said the maximum level of chlorofluorocarbons has not yet
been reached. It will reach that level in two to three years and
will continue to be high for the next 10-15 years.
	   The WMO is urging governments to strengthen collaboration in
monitoring and research of the problem and to adhere to the
Montreal Protocol, which commits countries to eliminating
production and use of ozone-depleting substances.

Mugging victim says Tom Cruise came to her rescue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tom Cruise got a chance to play a real-life hero,
according to a woman who says the actor came to her aid during a
mugging.
	   Rita Simmonds told the Evening Standard in Thursday's editions
that Cruise ran to her rescue Sept. 23 as attackers pulled open the
door of her Porsche and yanked off more than 70,000 pounds (dlrs
119,000) worth of jewelry.
	   ``Tom was brilliant,'' Simmonds, Cruise's neighbor, told the
newspaper. ``As soon as he heard the commotion, he rushed out.''
	   Cruise is renting a house near Regent's Park in London with his
wife, Nicole Kidman, and their children. Ms. Kidman is currently
appearing in a sold-out production of ``The Blue Room'' at a West
End theater.
	   Simmonds said Cruise and his bouncers chased the robbers down
the road. The robbers escaped, however, with some of her rings and
an antique Cartier watch worth 15,000 pounds (dlrs 25,500), she
said.
	   Simmonds told the paper she was badly bruised during the
assault.
	   No one answered repeated phone calls to the Metropolitan Police
press office.

AMs. Suspect in bombing confesses to links to Osama

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A man charged in the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Tanzania has confessed to having links to Islamic
militant Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind behind the
attacks here and in neighboring Kenya, a senior government official
said Thursday.
	   Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed told The Associated
Press Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, one of two men charged in the Dar
es Salaam embassy bombing, also said he knew two men charged in a
federal court in New York for the Nairobi bombing.
	   ``Mustafa (Ahmed) is either the mastermind behind the (Tanzania)
bombing or is a key person in the bombing conspiracy,'' Ameir said.
	   Ameir said Ahmed, an Egyptian with passports from Yemen, Congo
and Iraq, admitted during interrogation that he had warned Kenyan
intelligence officials about the plot to bomb the U.S. embassies.
He said Ahmed said the Kenyans then told the CIA.
	   Ameir said he believed the Egyptian, whom he called ``wily and
elusive,'' was not telling investigators everything he knew about
the bombings.
	   Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian from Zanzibar, were
formally charged Sept. 21 with 11 counts of murder in the Aug. 7
blast that killed 11 people. A simultaneous blast at the U.S.
embassy in Nairobi killed 248 people and injured more than 5,000.
	   Ameir said investigators were uncovering more and more
information linking the two embassy bombings and contacts in the
Middle East, but he did not give details.
	   He said Ahmed admitted that he knew personally bin Laden, a
Saudi exile reportedly living in Afghanistan who allegedly runs
al-Qaeda, or ``the base'' in Arabic _ a radical Islamic network
accused of orchestrating the bombings.
	   The two suspects in New York _ Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed
Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali _ are also linked to bin Laden.
	   In addition, Ameir said, Tanzanian and U.S. investigators
believe the funds to finance the Dar es Salaam bombing were
transferred from the Middle East to an account in the
Saudi-financed Greenland Bank of Tanzania Ltd., which also has
branches in Kampala and Nairobi.
	   The account was in Hemed's name.
	   Ameir said the Greenland Bank in Nairobi was also suspected of
having been used for transferring funds that financed the Nairobi
bombing.
	   ``A lot of fingers, a lot of leads, point to the Middle East,''
Ameir said.
	   Two other suspects, who investigators believe were staying at
Ahmed's home, are still being sought in connection with the
Tanzanian bombing.
	   They allegedly supplied the Egyptian with a Suzuki car that was
used to transport ingredients of the bomb. Investigators found
traces of chemicals used to make bombs in the car and in his home,
Ameir said.
	   He said investigators had also determined that a high-clearance
four-wheel drive vehicle, whose chassis had been modified, carried
the bomb into the grounds of the embassy located in a residential
neighborhood. The chassis was all that remained of the vehicle.
	   Ameir said witness told police that two men ``of Arab origin''
were seen in a car idling outside the embassy shortly before the
bomb went off.
	   He said investigators ``say it is possible the people inside the
car are the ones who set off the bomb using a remote control.''
	   Investigators had originally thought a blue water tanker truck
that regularly delivered water to the embassy and residences in the
neighborhood had carried the bomb.
	   The blast destroyed the tanker cab and turned the tank and
chassis upside down but left them nearly intact.
	   Ameir said investigators concluded that the truck had been on
its way out of the compound when the blast occurred and not on its
way in as previously indicated.

Dissidents call on China to respect international rights treaties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With China planning to sign a key U.N. rights
treaty next week, dissidents in China and in exile issued a
statement Thursday calling on Beijing to abolish laws that deprive
Chinese of basic rights in violation of international conventions.
	   Laws that must go include those that require government approval
before any organizations can be formed and allow for labor camp
sentences of up to three years without trial, the statement said.
	   It was issued by a group of Beijing dissidents trying to form a
China Democracy Party and overseas members of the U.S.-based Free
China Movement. The groups said in a statement faxed to The
Associated Press that they were disseminating the document in China
via the Internet.
	   ``We have seen the threat and harm caused by the lack of a fair
and independent legal system to freedom of association and other
freedoms,'' the statement said.
	   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said in Washington that
China will sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights in New York on Monday.
	   The covenant, one of two key U.N. rights treaties, calls on
signatories to allow freedom of expression, the press, religion and
association.
	   China already has signed the other main treaty, the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but
has not ratified it.
	   Unless China stops violating human rights and changes its laws
to comply with the treaties, its promise to abide by them will be
``simply a joke,'' Wang Xizhe, a longtime activist now in exile,
said in a news release.
	   Chinese authorities continue to hold labor and democracy
activists in detention centers, prisons and labor camps.
	   Authorities in the past two weeks have rejected attempts by
activists around the country to register the China Democracy Party.
Police have detained at least a dozen democracy campaigners, often
for short periods of time. Most have connections to the would-be
opposition party.
	   The Communist Party has not allowed any opposition parties to
form since it came to power 49 years ago.

Ex-communist party may boycott German parliament vote for

chancellor &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism is
considering abstaining from the parliament vote that would elect
Gerhard Schroeder chancellor, a party spokesman said Thursday.
	   They party would abstain if Schroeder succeeds in forming a
coalition between the Social Democrats, the party he led to power,
and the environmentalist Greens party, party spokesman Hanno
Harnisch said during a meeting of PDS federal legislators.
	   ``Schroeder always said he did not want to be elected chancellor
by us,'' Harnisch said.
	   The PDS won 5.1 percent of Sunday's vote, its strongest showing
ever in a federal election. Still, Schroeder has said from the
start he would not consider including the ex-communists in a
coalition, or even form a coalition that depended on the tacit
support of PDS legislators. Many in the west view the party as a
troubling remnant of the former communist East German state.
	   The parliament majority of the Social Democrats and Greens
combined provides enough votes for Schroeder to win confirmation as
chancellor. The vote is expected to take place on Oct. 27, the day
after the new parliament is scheduled to convene for the first
time.

Thousands of students turn out to protest for unpaid stipends

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ University students who haven't received their
federal living allowance in months turned out Thursday at protests
across Russia to demand the government pay them and their teachers
on time.
	   In Moscow alone, more than 2,000 students gathered on a cold day
outside Russia's main government building, and blocked a road for
an hour with police permission.
	   Breaking bottles, chanting slogans, and waving signs that read
``Students: Be realistic. Demand the impossible,'' the mostly young
crowd called for better living conditions in dormitories, free
higher education, and the payment of student stipends and teacher
salaries.
	   Every university student is supposed to receive a federally paid
living allowance. The stipends vary, but average around 150 rubles
(dlrs 10) each month. Many claim they haven't received their
stipends for more than four months.
	   ``We want a government that doesn't just put all the money in
its own pocket,'' said 18-year-old Maxim Nesnov. ``We must have
honesty. That's the most important thing. That the government
doesn't just work for itself, but for Russia.''
	   An estimated 17,000 students joined similar rallies in 13 other
Russian cities, all part of a day-long protest organized by the
Russian Association of Students' Trade Unions, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The government has also fallen far behind in its debts to budget
workers, pensioners, and the military. Many from these groups are
expected to come out in full force Oct. 7 for nationwide protests.
	   Some students also decried the condition of Moscow's
dormitories, many of which don't have even the most basic
amenities, they said.
	   ``There is no heating or hot water in our dorm,'' said
17-year-old Elena Bolunova, who studies at the Russian
Chemistry-Technology Institute. ``It's simply awful. We just want
something, some sort of improvement. But so far there's no
improvement at all.''
	   That may soon change. Under a drive to clear up the government's
old debts, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday the
government had paid off summer stipends and had earmarked money for
autumn stipends as well.
	   But many at the rally said they still hadn't received any of the
money they are owed. Others urged patience.
	   ``We can't judge the action of the new government because the
government is just formed,'' said Oleg Denisov, chairman of the
Association of Students' Trade Unions in Moscow. ``But if their
program doesn't work out, we'll protest again, maybe in a harsher
form. We are prepared for anything.''

Girl accuses police officer and eight other men of rape
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ People across Bosnia were
outraged Thursday after local police confirmed they are
investigating a police officer and eight other men for multiple
rape.
	   According to local media, on Sept. 3, a sixteen-year-old girl
approached a police officer to report that eight men had raped her
for 20 days in August.
	   Faruk Sijercic, a Tuzla police chief, refused to explain whether
the girl was locked up during that period or shed light on the
circumstances of the rape.
	   Local newspapers carried several call from citizens urging that
the case be solved right away.
	   Instead of following legal procedure after receiving the young
woman's complaint, the police inspector, who was identified only by
his initials S.J., allegedly raped her as well.
	   The media reports were based on the girl's claims.
	   After days of persistent rumors about the case, outrage exploded
late Wednesday after police spokesman Ekrem Avdic confirmed that
multiple rape was being investigated. But he refused to reveal any
details, saying a probe was underway.
	   Sijercic, the Tuzla police chief, told reporters that some 30
people had already been questioned in connection with the case.
	   The incriminated police inspector was suspended for not
informing anybody else about the girl's report and for ``losing his
notebook,'' Sijercic said.
	   ``I have no words to explain how outraged I am with the fact
that something like this can happen,'' said Semsa Djudjic, a
56-year old pensioner. ``If this case is not solved immediately, no
policeman in this town will ever be trusted again.''
	   Tuzla is the headquarters of the 8,500-strong contingent of
American troops serving in the NATO-led peace force.

Pope's beatification of WW II cardinal delights Croats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo ZAG-101 &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ When Pope John Paul II beatifies
Croatia's wartime Cardinal this weekend, he will be honoring one of
the Balkans' most controversial figures -- denounced as a Nazi
collaborator but hailed by many Croats as a national martyr.
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who will be beatified Saturday, was
tried by the Communists in 1946 and sentenced to 16 years
imprisonment for collaborating with the pro-Nazi Croatian puppet
state, established by the Germans during World War II.
	   For decades, Serbs and many Jews saw Stepinac as a symbol of the
fascist state that tried to exterminate them. His critics said he
blessed fascist Croat soldiers, maintained contacts with pro-Nazi
leader Ante Pavelic and carried out the regime's order to convert
Serbs, who are Orthodox Christians, to Catholicism.
	   After Croatia broke from Communist Yugoslavia in 1991, the new,
nationalist government rehabiliated Stepinac, who died in 1960, and
hailed him as a national hero.
	   For Croats, Catholicism is one of the foundations of their
national identity. The Catholic faith separates Croats from the
Orthodox Serbs who dominated the former Yugoslavia.
	   Stepinac was protrayed as a martyr -- the victim of Communist
attempts to suppress the Roman Catholic Church and stifle the
national aspirations of the Croat people. Some Croatian media
speculate that Stepinac was poisoned in prison.
	   The editor of Croatian television's religious program section.
Tonci Trstenjak, said he hoped the beatification ``will clear the
slandered face of Croatia.''
	   But the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked the Vatican to postpone
the ceremony, a step on the possible road to sainthood, until
independent researchers review Stepinac's role.
	   The widely differing views of Stepinac's life illustrate the
problems facing this newly independent nation struggling with its
wartime past and defining its own place in modern Europe.
	   As the nation prepares to honor Stepinac, another figure from
the Nazi-era past -- Dinko Sakic -- is in jail pending trial for
war crimes committed while serving as the commander of the
notorious fascist concentration camp of Jasenovac, where thousands
of Serbs, Jews and anti-fascist Croats died.
	   Sakic escaped to Argentina after the war and remained free until
June when he was extradited to Croatia to stand trial.
	   Stepinac's comments about the camp which Sakic ran are often
cited by Croats to defend the Cardinal as a religious leader who
was struggling to make the best of a bad situation during the war.
	   In public statements, Stepinac called the Jasenovac camp a
``shame.'' When greeting Pavelic at the entrance to the Zagreb
Cathedral, Stepinac looked at him and quoted the 7th Commandment:
``Thou shalt not kill.''
	   Stepinac's speeches show that as early as 1942, he was speaking
out, albeit carefully, against the excesses of the regime.''
	   ``All nations and races are from the God and they all have a
right to live,'' Stepinac said at a Mass in 1942 when killings in
Jasenovac and other camps were in full swing. ``That is why
Croatian church has always condemned injustice and violence
committed in the name of class, racist or ethnic theories.''
	   Stepinac's admirers also argue that ``allowing'' Stepinac
allowed Serbs and Jews to convert to Catholicism offered a chance
to escape persecution.
	   Croatia's Jewish community, whose 30,000 members perished during
the said the they were ``grateful'' to Stepinac for saving lives of
many Jews.
	   In a statement released Wednesday, they nevertheless say that
``the time will judge'' him.

UEFA postpones Albania-Greece match because of unrest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Thursday postponed the European
Championship quaifying match between Albania and Greece scheduled
for Oct. 10 in Tirana because of political turmoil in Albania.
	   The qualifying match will be rescheduled for Wednesday, 18, a
statement from UEFA said.
	   ``By taking this step, UEFA wishes to allow the host association
to stage the match in optimum conditions, particularly as far as
the security of the Greek delegation is concerned,'' the statement
said.
	   Albania has been gripped by clashes between the ruling Socialist
party and the opposition Democrats since the Sept. 12 slaying of
popular politician Azem Hajdari, a close aide to opposition leader
and former President Sali Berisha. The killing sparked riots in
Tirana.
	   ``UEFA assumes that the internal political situation will have
improved by mid-November,'' the statement said.

Greece calls for diplomacy first, then NATO military strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece on Thursday said it believed all
diplomatic means must be exhausted before the West takes any
military action in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
	   ``We believe that it is not possible to pursue results by taking
military action before the limits of dialogue and understanding are
exhausted, and we believe that they have not been exhausted,'' said
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas.
	   Greece worries that an escalation of the conflict in
Albanian-dominated Kosovo could endanger the entire Balkan region
if it spills over into Albania and Macedonia, which has a large and
restive Albanian minority of its own. Both countries border with
Greece.
	   Although Greece had close ties with Yugoslavia in the past, it
has slowly distanced itself from its President, Slobodan Milosevic,
and harshly criticized his actions in Kosovo.
	   Greece has also argued against any unilateral action by NATO,
saying its partners in the alliance must have first have the
approval of the United Nations security council.
	   ``We think that we should exhaust all peaceful methods to solve
the problem, and of course we will definitely need a decision from
the security council for any such action,'' said European Affairs
Minister George Papandreou.

Schroeder starts early talks on new German government

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Upbeat after preliminary coalition talks
with Greens party leaders, chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder said
Thursday he expects to complete negotiations on a new German
government within three weeks.
	   ``We have agreed that we will negotiate speedily,'' Schroeder
told reporters after the session. ``First we have to agree on a
solid program that is properly financed.''
	   Schroeder, a Social Democrat, has invited the ecology-minded
Greens to be his junior partner after he defeated Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in elections Sunday and returned the left to power in Germany
after 16 years.
	   Schroeder said both sides agreed the new parliament should hold
its first session on Oct. 26 and confirm him chancellor the next
day.
	   That would give time for conventions of both parties to approve
the envisioned coalition agreement on the preceding weekend, he
said.
	   Both sides talked optimistically after party leaders sounded
each other out for three hours.
	   ``We're off to a good start,'' said Franz Muentefering, the
Social Democrat's general manager.
	   Asked about the climate of the talks, Greens leader Joschka
Fischer said: ``I can't complain.''
	   Still, the formal negotiations starting Friday were expected to
be difficult as the future coalition partners hammer out
ideological differences on such central policy questions as
defense, energy and transportation.
	   But Fischer, the most prominent Greens moderate, stressed that
the party's leadership was committed to grabbing its first chance
to govern Germany at the national level.
	   ``We want to make this work together,'' he said, standing next
to Schroeder outside the offices of Saarland state in Bonn, where
the two sides met over lunch.
	   Schroeder said both sides agreed on a timetable and topics for
the talks, but that Cabinet posts were not yet discussed. He and
Fischer refused to discuss details of Thursday's meeting.
	   The Greens have demanded four Cabinet posts, but most analysts
say they can realistically hope only for three. Likely appointees
include Fischer, a former student radical and street fighter in the
1960s and '70s, as foreign minister.
	   The mainstream Social Democrats and the sometimes radical Greens
share a range of goals, such as fighting unemployment, cutting
taxes and granting dual citizenship to long-time foreign residents.
	   But Greens positions on foreign and defense policy _ disbanding
NATO, limiting foreign missions of German soldiers and cutting
troop strength _ promise tough negotiations.
	   The timetable leaves open whether Schroeder will attend an Oct.
24-25 summit of European leaders in Austria. The meeting is
intended to as a get-acquainted session with Schroeder.
	   Social Democratic party chairman Oskar Lafontaine met earlier
with outgoing Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to discuss the Kosovo
crisis and the handover of one of the key ministries from the
outgoing center-right government.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell further on Wall Street on Thursday,
extending a global selling spree amid fears of lower corporate
profits and new financial crises ahead.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which tumbled 237.90 points on
Wednesday, fell an additional 124.36 to 7,718.26 by late morning.
	   The Dow's 12.4 percent slide in the third quarter, which ended
Wednesday, was its worst quarterly performance for the Dow in eight
years. The blue-chip average began the day down 65.63 points from
where it began this year and almost 1,500 points, or 16 percent,
from its July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   Broader market indicators also were losing more ground.
	   Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo shares falling
1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares were falling sharply
in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rates
unchanged.
	   Blue chips in London sank 2.4 percent to new lows for the year,
while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, was down 5.5 percent
late in the trading day, and the main indicator in Paris was down
3.9 percent.

WASHINGTON: Camdessus said.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Camdessus said the discussions, which will get underway in
earnest on Saturday with a meeting of finance ministers and central
bank presidents from the seven largest industrial countries, should
focus on ways to improve surveillance activities of the IMF so the
agency can better spot troubles before they develop and review
proposals to upgrade regulation of banks.
	   Poor bank supervision contributed to the currency crises that
have leveled Russia and countries in Asia and are now threatening
Latin America.
	   ``If we want to make the world a better place then we have to go
for transparency, go for strengthening of financial and banking
systems and the orderly integration of emerging markets into the
world economy,'' Camdessus said.
	   The IMF took the lead in assembling more than $100 billion in
bailout packages for Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Russia
but has watched as the Asian nations have plunged into steeper
recession.
	   And in August, a botched currency devaluation and partial
default on foreign loans by Russia sparked a worldwide plunge in
stock markets, include in the United States, and caused investors
to begin fleeing many countries in Latin America.
	   Camdessus insisted that the IMF took the proper actions based on
its knowledge at the time in trying to cope with a crisis that
began in July 1997 in Thailand. But he conceded that the speed with
which economic troubles in one country can infect markets
half-a-world away has surprised him.
	   ``The nature of the virus was so strong and so quick in so many
places,'' he said. ``We did not see ... how the crisis in Russia
could prompt the lack of confidence in Latin America two weeks
later.''

Iraq says U.S. will fail in bid to overthrow Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on Radio Free Iraq, past U.S. funding &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that Washington will be
wasting money and effort if it tries to topple President Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   The Iraqi Parliament said in a statement that it ``strongly
denounces'' moves by the U.S. Congress to provide nearly dlrs 100
million in military aid to Iraqi opposition groups.
	   On Tuesday, key U.S. Republicans introduced bills that would
authorize President Bill Clinton to give dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
rebels and dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq, set up under earlier
legislation.
	   The aim of the radio station, which is scheduled to go on air
Oct. 15 from Prague, Czech Republic, is to broadcast pro-democracy
programs and objective news about Iraq.
	   The Clinton administration has not responded to the funding
proposal circulated by Republican congressmen that would, in
effect, openly commit the United States to overthrow the regime.
	   ``The representatives of the Iraqi people strongly condemn the
persistence of American Congress to interfere in the domestic
affairs of our land,'' said the 25-member Iraqi Parliament in the
statement which was carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``This aggressive behavior blatantly violates the U.N. Charter
and international law and the right of the peoples to choose their
regime without foreign mandate,'' the statement added.
	   It said the Iraqi people had chosen Saddam as their president
``with all freedom and fairness'' in a referendum in 1995. The
referendum required people to accept or reject Saddam as their
leader.
	   The statement said Iraq's disparate opposition groups were
``isolated and trivial'' and Washington will reap nothing from them
``but despair and humiliation.''
	   The United States has in the past allocated millions of dollars
for activities aimed at encouraging democratic opposition to
Saddam.
	   This includes funding of two main London-based opposition
groups, the Iraqi National Congress and Iraqi National Accord, and
setting up an opposition center in London to train dissidents on
the use of modern technology in propaganda against Saddam.

New Houston track a big guessing game for Indy-car drivers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ For the second time in three races, the
competitors in the CART Indy-car FedEx Championship Series are
getting their first look at a new track.
	   Last month, it was a temporary street circuit in Vancouver. This
week, it's a 2.703-kilometer (1.68-mile), 10-turn city street
circuit winding around the George R. Brown Convention Center on the
east side of Houston's downtown.
	   The biggest difference is that the CART series has been visiting
Vancouver for nine years and the new course was just a hundred
meters or so (a few hundred feet) from the previous layout, meaning
everyone was familiar with everything but the track.
	   Sunday's Texaco Grand Prix of Houston will be the first
open-wheel race in the Texas city, giving it lots of question
marks.
	   ``I didn't even know where downtown was,'' Al Unser Jr., who
visited Houston last week, said jokingly.
	   Unser, who leads all CART drivers with 20 victories on temporary
street circuits, drove a rental car through the streets which will
comprise the track once it opens for practice Friday.
	   ``It looks a bit wider than other temporary circuits,'' said
Unser, who has not won a race on any circuit in more than two
years. ``There are narrow spots, but the majority of the track
looks like it's wide enough for passing.
	   ``The course seems to have it all: it's smooth, has fast and
slower corners, as well as long and short straights.''
	   Michael Andretti, the winningest active driver on the Champ Car
circuit with 37 victories, said it's always a big guessing game
with new tracks.
	   ``You could look at Vancouver,'' Andretti said. ``It was a
totally new racetrack, and that's the way it is here. In our
series, it seems like every year we have at least one new racetrack
and you just go and deal with it.
	   ``It's the same for everybody, and you hope that your team has
done a little better job in their homework than the other teams,
then you just approach it from there. You just take the best
educated guess and go.''
	   Alex Zanardi, who already has clinched his second straight PPG
Cup championship and has announced he will race in Formula One next
year, says the only challenge remaining for him in CART is to add
more victories to the six he already has this season.
	   ``I like these kind of challenges,'' he said. ``I think I learn
fast, and I think my crew is very good at figuring out the correct
setup for the car very quickly. That should be an advantage for
us.''
	   Talking about his attitude about running the final three races
of 1998 for Target-Chip Ganassi Racing, Zanardi said, ``I haven't
lost one ounce of desire or determination. There are still three
championships to be won _ Houston, Australia and Fontana
(California). I want to win them all, and my crew wants to win them
all.''
	   Tom Anderson, managing director for the Ganassi team, which also
includes second-place Jimmy Vasser, said getting ready for a new
track like this one is difficult.
	   ``Obviously, two things we normally use in determining setup _
past track experience and on-track testing _ don't apply in
Houston,'' Anderson said. ``That leaves a combination of mechanical
simulation, computer software simulation and good old-fashioned gut
reaction on the part of the engineers.
	   ``Basically, you just acquire as many facts as you can that way
and then it's essentially a best-guess scenario. You never know how
close you are until you run on the track. We've been relatively
close at some of the tracks we've gone to, and we've been a bit off
at a couple of places, like Vancouver.
	   ``You'll see by the end of the first (practice) session who got
it right.''

Government considers Soviet-style economic plan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Primakov quotes in new grafs 6 and 8, trims

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov denied Thursday
his government plans to prohibit Russians from buying U.S. dollars
and other foreign currencies, and urged the International Monetary
Fund to continue disbursing an economic bailout package.
	   Primakov's statement followed Russian media reports that the
government was considering an economic plan that would effectively
reverse free-market reforms by imposing Soviet-style currency
restrictions and increasing the number of rubles in circulation.
	   ``All talk about a Draconian law allegedly being developed by
the Cabinet which would give the government a monopoly in foreign
currency dealings is not worth an eggshell,'' Primakov said,
according to Russian news agencies.
	   Primakov refused to comment on Russian media reports about plans
to dramatically boost the money supply to pay such things as
overdue wages and pensions and subsidies to ailing industries. He
said a government delegation would fly to the United States on
Friday for talks on the issue with the IMF.
	   Primakov also strongly urged the IMF to deliver a previously
negotiated dlrs 4.3 billion loan that was put on hold after the
Russian financial crisis hit in August.
	   The IMF credit would allow Russia to come out of the crisis
``with minimum losses,'' he said. If the payments are frozen or
significantly delayed, the government ``will not throw our country
to the winds'' and would be forced to ``take measures that could be
quite unpopular,'' Primakov said.
	   IMF officials said they want the Russian government to come up
with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and made it
clear that currency controls and boosting money supply were out of
the question.
	   Primakov snapped at the IMF, saying it should ``remember that we
have followed its advice to this day. ... Now our country has found
itself in a difficult position.''
	   The Russian government has allowed the U.S. dollar and other
foreign currencies to circulate freely since the 1991 collapse of
the Soviet Union, and Russia now has more dollars in its economy
than any country besides the United States, according to U.S.
officials.
	   Those who favor restricting or prohibiting foreign currencies
argue that would help the government maintain its own hard currency
reserves and would stabilize and strengthen the ruble.
	   Primakov said on national television that the economic plan
reported by the Russian media is purely preliminary. ``It's just
one of six versions under consideration,'' Primakov said, lashing
out at reporters for spreading ``speculations.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin, meanwhile, met with Gov. Eduard Rossel
of the Urals region of Sverdlovsk on Thursday. The two men
discussed Rossel's plan for a ruble backed by gold reserves and his
proposal to ban foreign currency circulation.
	   Russian news agencies initially reported that Yeltsin favored
the plan, but his spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin denied that.
	   The economic plan under consideration by the Cabinet sets an
ambitious spending program, including compensation to the poor for
steep price rises and generous subsidies to stagnant Russian
industries.
	   The blueprint, published in the respected business daily
Kommersant on Thursday, gives no clue as to where the money would
come from. The newspaper said the obvious answer would be the
generous printing of new money, which would increase inflation.
	   Combined with currency controls, an increased money supply would
devastate the consumer market, which has already been hit hard by
the ruble's devaluation, critics say.
	   ``If they print new money, that will only make goods disappear
from the shelves,'' Kommersant said.
	   Hoping to avoid the further fall of the ruble, the plan calls
for more government controls over the ruble rate, which would be
based not only on supply and demand, but such factors as balance of
payments, the size of the Central Bank's foreign exchange and gold
reserves, and the inflation rate.
	   The plan would also virtually ban commercial banks from foreign
currency speculation, oblige exporters to sell most of their
foreign-currency earnings at the government-controlled rate and
shut loopholes allowing them to keep foreign currency abroad.
	   The plan also calls for the nationalization of some Russian
commercial banks and using their assets to provide credits to
industries.
	   The document has been drafted by a group of economists led by
Yuri Maslyukov, a Communist who is first deputy prime minister in
charge of economic strategy.

Faces of Blair's Labor: Old, New _ and a sponsor too far
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Even in Tony Blair's ``New Labor''
party with its sponsored events, pop star backers and fashionably
centrist slogans, wearing a security pass dangling from a grocery
store ad was a capitalist step too far for many at the party's
annual conference.
	   Hundreds swapped the grocery necklaces for red ribbons issued by
trade unions or for plain chains _ not so much in defiance as in
nostalgia for the Labor Party's once-socialist past.
	   The Labor delegates who gathered together this week 17 months
after ousting a Conservative government on a surge of middle-class
support seemed as if they belonged to two parties _ one running the
country, and one still preaching the old message of wealth
redistribution.
	   And in the middle were the mildly rebellious, such as the
grocery-chain refuseniks or the occasional speaker who addressed
delegates as ``comrades'' _ the traditional Labor greeting until
the modernizers took things in hand.
	   Many activists admire Blair and revel in Labor's return to
power, but still feel uneasy.
	   ``I don't feel like being a walking advertisement for anybody,''
said John Robertson, a delegate from Glasgow. ``I don't really mind
the party being sponsored and I like Blair. But having things round
your neck's a bit much.''
	   After Blair's rousing keynote address pledging no easing of
anti-inflationary economic policies, commentators gibed that all he
needed was a handbag and a blonde wig to complete the likeness to
Margaret Thatcher, the Tories' formidable right-wing leader of the
'80s.
	   ``I look at all the glitz and glamour, but the Labor Party
doesn't change _ we have a vision of the future different from a
successful capitalist society,'' declared Tony Benn, a veteran
leftist lawmaker at a meeting of Tribune, a long-standing pressure
group on the party left.
	   However, most everything at the six-day conference, which ends
Friday, said something else.
	   As several hundred Tribunites met in a chilly theater for their
evening rally, Blair and his high-flyer lawyer wife, Cherie, were
at a 200-pound-a-head (dlrs 340) gala dinner sponsored by travel
company Thomas Cook in the Stakis, the only five-star hotel in this
northern seaside resort.
	   Sponsors were everywhere.
	   Some 230 companies and organizations paid up to 8,000 pounds
(dlrs 13,600) for stands in the exhibition area of the conference
center. There were give-away newspapers and free blood pressure
checks at a pharmaceutical company's stand. Even the press pack for
reporters was sponsored _ by a usually Tory-supporting tabloid, The
Express.
	   Labor didn't say how much it hoped to make, but published
reports estimated a handy 2 million pound (dlrs 3.4 million)
contribution to the party's annual income of about 21 million
pounds (dlrs 35.5 million).
	   Also sponsored was the ``Welcome'' sign at Blackpool's train
station. But that won't be needed again.
	   After nearly 70 years of alternating with the Conservatives in
holding its annual convention here, Labor is not returning anytime
soon to this blustry, faded town on the Irish Sea, saying
facilities are not quite up to scratch.
	   Instead of Blackpool _ with its rows of boardinghouses, slot
machines, flashing promenade lights and shops well-stocked with
refrigerator magnets and souvenir ashtrays _ Labor is heaading
south.
	   It has booked two rather more chic southern resorts, Bournemouth
and Brighton, for its conferences through to the year 2001.
	   To many here, there is a sense that Labor-voting Blackpool lost
the business by being, well, just not New Labor enough.
	   ``It's a load of rubbish them saying they are not coming here
because it's dirty or whatever,'' complained Shelpa Patel, manager
of the two-star Carlton Hotel. ``We've spent thousands of pounds on
upgrading hotels. And then they say we're not good enough.''

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The army's bomb-disposal squad
neutralized an unexploded hand grenade found outside the Israeli
embassy Thursday. Police anti-terrorist experts were investigating.
	   The grenade was found on the street, under a parked car, just
before noon (1000 gmt). Police cordoned off the whole neighborhood
around the embassy before the bomb disposal squad arrived.
	   Jos Colpin, spokesman for the Brussels state prosecutor, said
one of the grenade's safety pins had been left in place. He said
lethal potential of the devise was limited.
	   ``It's often used to spread panic because it makes an awful lot
of noise. If you want to kill a lot of people you would use
something different,'' Colpin said.
	   ``The anti-terrorism unit is looking into it but so far we have
no leads,'' he added.

 &UR; 2 FBI agents injured in Kenyan traffic accident, lose gun

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Two FBI agents investigating the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy here were slightly injured in a traffic
accident in Kenya and in the confusion lost a pistol and
walkie-talkie, police said Thursday.
	   A minivan ran a red light at a downtown intersection Wednesday,
ramming the right side of the agents' rented car, said police
spokesman Emmanuel Mwachiti.
	   Agents Bryant Ling and Mark Allan were in the back seat of the
car. They were taken to Nairobi Hospital where Ling was admitted
with bruises on various parts of his body, and Allan was treated
and released, Mwachiti said. The agents' Kenyan driver was treated
for a knee injury.
	   The East African Standard newspaper said the agents lost two
pistols, but Mwachiti said police were aware of only one handgun
and a walkie-talkie.

Arafat says progress made in Washington talks

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
said Thursday that this week's top-level talks in Washington have
produced progress on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Qureia said that during the
meetings ``the ice began to break'' between Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who had not talked for a year.
	   Despite such guarded optimism, the Palestinians said they were
skeptical that renewed U.S. mediation would produce an elusive
agreement on an Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Arafat said in Cairo that he was not certain Netanyahu really
meant business. ``I am not pessimistic or optimistic. My
experiences with Netanyahu have shown me that I should be cautious
because he has made many promises to so many leaders ... which he
did not keep,'' Arafat said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to visit the
Middle East next week to prepare another Mideast summit in
Washington in mid October.
	   At issue is a U.S. proposal for an Israeli troop pullback from
13 percent of the West Bank, in exchange for a tougher Palestinian
crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Israel has said it would hand over 10 percent of the land in
full and set aside 3 percent as a nature reserve. In those areas,
Israel would retain full security control for the time being.
	   Asked Thursday whether the Washington meetings produced progress
on a security agreement and special conditions for a nature
reserve, Arafat said ``yes.'' He did not elaborate.
	   However, Arafat spokesman Nabil Abourdeneh said differences on
the character of the nature reserve remained. The Palestinians
insist that the restrictions on land use remain in effect only
until May, the end of the five-year interim period of Palestinian
autonomy. Israel has not yet responded to that demand.
	   Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Thursday that the two sides have
already agreed on the implementation of most of the stages of the
U.S. peace initiative. He did not provide details.
	   Despite the apparent progress, Qureia said Thursday that the
Palestinians were determined to declare statehood in the West Bank
and Gaza in May. Earlier this week, Arafat had signaled a softening
of position on the issue. In his speech to the U.N. General
Assembly, he had not raised the subject, as initially planned.
	   However, Qureia said that once the interim period ended, there
would be a legal and political vacuum that would have to be filled
by giving a new status to the disputed lands.
	   ``For us that (new status) is a state, that is it,'' Qureia told
a news conference in Gaza City.
	   Israel and the United States want to prevent a unilateral
declaration of statehood. Netanyahu reiterated Thursday that he
would take unilateral measures if Arafat declares a state.

	   In addition to overhauling the architecture of the global
financial system, finance officials will spend time in
behind-the-scenes efforts to put together a rescue package of
perhaps dlrs 30 billion to bolster Brazil, the largest economy in
South America and the latest country to feel the effects of
panicked investors.
	   The threat that the current turmoil could turn into a global
recession was underscored by release Wednesday of an unusually
sober economic forecast by the IMF.
	   If the U.S. economy weakens more than expected, if Japan fails
to end its recession, or capital flight from Latin America is not
halted, then the world economy could be facing even bleaker
prospects, IMF economists warned.
	   Japan will present plans later in the meetings to spend about
dlrs 30 billion to aid nations in Southeast Asia, where the
financial troubles erupted 14 months ago.
	   Camdessus said that Japan, as the world's second largest
economy, had to do its part to implement stimulus programs and
banking reforms.
	   The IMF's ``World Economic Outlook'' said that the economic
turmoil has already cost millions of jobs and more than dlrs 600
billion in lost output _ the equivalent of a country the size of
Canada shutting down for a year, the IMF said.
	   The revised forecast slashes its estimate of growth, projecting
that the global economy will slow to a 2 percent growth rate this
year, the poorest showing in seven years, with only a slight
rebound to 2.5 percent growth in 1999. Both figures are a full
percentage point below estimates IMF made just five months ago.
	   ``Chances of any significant improvement in 1999 have also
diminished, and the risks of a deeper, wider and more prolonged
downturn have escalated,'' the IMF said in an unusually bleak
assessment.

Iraq says U.S. will fail in bid to overthrow Saddam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that Washington will be
wasting money and effort if it tries to topple President Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   The Iraqi Parliament said in a statement that it ``strongly
denounces'' moves by the U.S. Congress to provide nearly dlrs 100
million in military aid to Iraqi opposition groups.
	   On Tuesday, key U.S. Republicans introduced bills that would
authorize President Bill Clinton to give dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
rebels and dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq, set up under earlier
legislation.
	   The aim of the radio station, scheduled to go on air Oct. 15 is
to broadcast prodemocracy programs and news about Iraq from its
base in Prague, Czech Republic.
	   The Clinton administration has not responded to the funding
proposal circulated by Republican congressmen that would, in
effect, openly commit the United States to overthrow the regime.
	   ``The representatives of the Iraqi people strongly condemn the
persistence of American Congress to interfere in the domestic
affairs of our land,'' said the 25-member Iraqi Parliament in the
statement which was carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``This aggressive behavior blatantly violates the U.N. Charter
and international law and the right of the peoples to choose their
regime without foreign mandate,'' the statement added.
	   It said the Iraqi people had chosen Saddam as their president
``with all freedom and fairness'' in a referendum in 1995. The
referendum required people to accept or reject Saddam as their
leader.
	   The statement said Iraq's disparate opposition groups were
``isolated and trivial'' and Washington will reap nothing from them
``but despair and humiliation.''
	   The United States has in the past allocated millions of dollars
to encourage democratic opposition to Saddam.
	   This includes funding of two main London-based opposition
groups, the Iraqi National Congress and Iraqi National Accord, and
setting up an opposition center in London to train dissidents on
the use of modern technology in propaganda against Saddam.

IMF, warning of possible global recession, opens annual meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Combines previous, which UPDATES with Camdessus remarks. &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Federal Reserve made the right
decision in cutting a key interest rate earlier this week but
global powers must now do more to provide badly needed confidence
to halt a global economic crisis, the head of the International
Monetary Fund said Thursday.
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, briefing reporters on
what could turn out to be pivotal annual meetings of the 182-nation
lending organization, rejected suggestions that the IMF had badly
handled the world currency crisis.
	   But he said the seven richest countries needed to push for
stronger growth to offset steep recessions in many Asian nations
and Russia.
	   He praised the decision of the Federal Reserve to cut a key U.S.
interest rate by a quarter-point on Tuesday and suggested that
European monetary authorities should take similar steps.
	   Asked why stock markets, particularly in the United States, have
reacted so negatively to the U.S. central bank's rate cut,
Camdessus said he believed confidence will soon be restored,
especially if financial leaders in their discussions over the next
week show resolve.
	   ``If during the meeting, leaders take clear decisions and the
G-7 takes the lead for growth to help countries out of crisis, then
the markets will see this and not overreact,'' Camdessus said.
	   Camdessus said the discussions, which will get underway in
earnest on Saturday with a meeting of finance ministers and central
bank presidents from the seven largest industrial countries, should
focus on ways to improve surveillance activities of the IMF so the
agency can better spot troubles before they develop and review
proposals to upgrade regulation of banks.
	   Poor bank supervision contributed to the currency crises that
have leveled Russia and countries in Asia and are now threatening
Latin America.
	   ``If we want to make the world a better place then we have to go
for transparency, go for strengthening of financial and banking
systems and the orderly integration of emerging markets into the
world economy,'' Camdessus said.
	   The IMF took the lead in assembling more than $100 billion in
bailout packages for Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea and Russia
but has watched as the Asian nations have plunged into steeper
recession.
	   And in August, a botched currency devaluation and partial
default on foreign loans by Russia sparked a worldwide plunge in
stock markets, include in the United States, and caused investors
to begin fleeing many countries in Latin America.
	   Camdessus insisted that the IMF took the proper actions based on
its knowledge at the time in trying to cope with a crisis that
began in July 1997 in Thailand. But he conceded that the speed with
which economic troubles in one country can infect markets
half-a-world away has surprised him.
	   ``The nature of the virus was so strong and so quick in so many
places,'' he said. ``We did not see ... how the crisis in Russia
could prompt the lack of confidence in Latin America two weeks
later.''
	   In addition to overhauling the architecture of the global
financial system, finance officials will spend time in
behind-the-scenes efforts to put together a rescue package of
perhaps dlrs 30 billion to bolster Brazil, the largest economy in
South America and the latest country to feel the effects of
panicked investors.
	   The threat that the current turmoil could turn into a global
recession was underscored by release Wednesday of an unusually
sober economic forecast by the IMF.
	   If the U.S. economy weakens more than expected, if Japan fails

	   Japan will present plans later in the meetings to spend about
dlrs 30 billion to aid nations in Southeast Asia, where the
financial troubles erupted 14 months ago.

Netanyahu: U.S. has not agreed to release spy Pollard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES Netanyahu statement, UPDATES with McCurry statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
he discussed the fate of Jonathan Pollard during his visit to the
United States this week, but that no decision was made about a
possible release of the Israeli spy.
	   Netanyahu was speaking in a Cabinet meeting, a statement said.
	   Netanyahu did not say whether he discussed the Pollard case with
U.S. President Bill Clinton or with other officials.
	   The daily Yediot Ahronot reported earlier Thursday that during a
meeting with Netanyahu, Clinton agreed in principle to free Pollard
who is serving a life term for passing secret U.S. military
documents to Israel.
	   However, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said ``I
strongly doubt that the issue arose'' in the meeting between
Clinton and Netanyahu.
	   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the president and Netanyahu did not discuss the
issue of Pollard's release. The official said granting early
release to Pollard would be met by strong opposition within the
U.S. government.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, was arrested
outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985.
	   It emerged later that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a
shadowy Israeli intelligence-gathering body in the United States.
Until recently, Israeli governments disavowed Pollard, and called
his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison.

Poland needs to spend billions on improving roads
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Improving Poland's roads to European Union
standards by the year 2015 would cost 90 billion zlotys (dlrs 25.1
billion), Transport Minister Eugeniusz Morawski said Thursday.
	   The figure came from a government plan on developing
infrastructure in the former communist country now trying to join
Western organizations such as NATO and the European Union.
	   ``The poor state of infrastructure slows the country's economic
development down and makes international cooperation difficult,''
Morawski told a news conference.
	   According to the plan, which has been approved by a Cabinet
committee and now goes to the full Cabinet, Poland should spend a
total of 200 billion zlotys (dlrs 58.6 billion) for all its
infrastructure development by 2015.
	   Morawski cited road development as the most pressing need,
saying 37 percent of Poland's roads needed immediate repair and
another 42 percent required work within three years.
	   Money for road improvement could come from increasing excise tax
income for road development above the current 30 percent level;
income raised by selling off state assets; and EU money designated
for road improvement and other transportation needs, Morawski said.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Before Sunday's elections, Carsten
Schneider, 22, was a part-time bank clerk. Today, the Social
Democrat is the youngest member ever of Germany's 669-seat lower
house of parliament.
	   His horizons have improved considerably.
	   Along with the job, he gets: a monthly salary of 12,350 marks
(dlrs 7,395); a 6,344-mark (dlrs-3,798) expense account; free rides
on the German railway; a chauffeured limousine for getting to
government meetings around Bonn; and his own office in his
constituency of Erfurt.
	   Such perks are nothing new to Fred Gebhardt, 70, a Social
Democrat who quit the traditionally leftist party in February
because of its shift toward the center.
	   Gebhardt, of Frankfurt, is the oldest member of the lower house.
	   As such, he is entitled to give the opening speech of the first
session of the new parliament, set for Oct. 26.
	   The youngest member is entitled to listen.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The first component of the dlrs 21 billion
international space station will be launched next month as planned,
despite Russia's failure to build another key segment that
threatened to delay the whole project, officials said Thursday.
	   A cargo module built by the Russian Khrunichev company under
contract with the U.S. firm Boeing will be launched on Nov. 20, the
Russian Space Agency said.
	   The module has already been taken to the launch site at the
Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan.
	   NASA is expected to follow with the launch of a second part, an
American-built passageway, on Dec. 3.
	   There were fears those launches would be delayed because Russia
has not yet completed the service module that would serve as the
crew's living quarters.
	   The cash-strapped government has failed to pay for its
construction and it is unlikely to be completed in time for its
scheduled April launch date.
	   Some experts consider it too risky to leave orbiting modules in
space unmanned for a long time.
	   However, a Russian Space Agency spokesman said Thursday that
participants in the space station project had tentatively agreed to
carry out the first two launches as planned.
	   The final decision is to be announced on Friday following their
meeting in Moscow on Friday, spokesman Sergei Gorbunov said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The space station, a joint project of 16 countries including
Russia, the United States, the European Space Agency, Canada and
Japan, has already been pushed back a year because Russians have
missed two previous target dates.
	   The first crew will blast off in a Russian Soyuz rocket in
January 2000, six months later than the latest target and more than
1-1/2 years behind the original plan.

Danish 'keeper out with two weeks; to miss Denmark qualifiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel,
whose blunder cost Manchester United a victory against Bayern
Munich in the Champions League, will be out for two weeks with a
stomach injury.
	   Schmeichel, who aggravated the injury during Wednesday's 2-2
draw in Munich, will miss United's trip to Southampton on Saturday
as well as Denmark's European 2000 qualifiers against Wales on Oct.
10 and Switzerland on Oct. 14.
	   United manager Alex Ferguson said Thursday it is also doubtful
whether Schmeichel will be back for the club's home game against
Wimbledon on Oct. 17.
	   Schmeichel, though, should be back for United's third Champions'
League match against his former club Brondby in Copenhagen on Oct.
21.
	   Ferguson said he did not think Schmeichel's injury contributed
to the mistake which allowed Bayern to score a last-minute
equalizer in Wednesday's game.
	   Schmeichel collided with team-mate Jaap Stam and Brazilian
forward Elber was able to score his second of the game in the dying
minutes.

Council to convene urgent consultations on Kosovo massacre
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Britain saying council members have urged
`strong condemnation; Consultations scheduled to begin at 2030 GMT;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain's U.N. ambassador said Thursday he
had received clear support from members of the Security Council for
a strong condemnation of a massacre of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians.
	   The Security Council was holding an emergency meeting Thursday,
beginning at 4:30 p.m. (2030 GMT), after British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook called for the council to condemn the weekend slaughter
of civilians in the forests around Obrija.
	   Council president Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said Thursday
morning that he had received ``clear word from council members that
they want a strong condemnation of the recent atrocities on the
ground in Kosovo.''
	   A statement to the press condemning the massacre was the likely
outcome of the meeting, council diplomats said.
	   The meeting came as NATO ambassadors were finalizing plans for
airstrikes against Serbs and the Contact Group of states were
arranging to meet in London to consult on the situation.
	   Several allied nations have pledged to make planes available for
a strike. Germany has offered 14 Tornado fighter planes, the
Netherlands and Norway have each offered eight F-16 fighters and
Spain has pledged four F-18s.
	   The United States has declined to say publicly what forces it is
offering, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were ready
for action in the Balkans.
	   Both the council and NATO were awaiting word from
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on how to proceed. The U.N. chief is
to report, probably early next week, on the situation in Kosovo and
whether the Serbs have complied with the latest council resolution
urging a cease-fire.
	   The council threatened to consider unspecified measures if both
sides in the conflict failed to comply.
	   Greenstock said Britain had urged the organizations that are
contributing to the report _ NATO and the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, among others _ to send their input to
the U.N. chief as quickly as possible.
	   Cook warned that NATO airstrikes could follow Annan's report,
which is a regular 30-day update on the situation on the ground.
	   Cook also called for a meeting in London Friday of the six
countries represented in the so-called Contact Group on Yugoslavia:
the United States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia. He
said the meeting was to find a ``way forward on a political
settlement'' for Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Hundreds of residents in an
Amsterdam neighborhood where an El Al Boeing 747 freight plane
crashed and burned six years ago are suffering health problems they
link to the disaster, a commission reported Thursday.
	   Physicians in the Bijlmermeer neighborhood where the freighter
crashed Oct. 4, 1992, believe some 300 residents are suffering
psychiatric disorders and unspecified physical complaints as a
result of the crash.
	   Another 400 people are suffering complaints which the patients
themselves link to the Netherlands' worst air disaster, but which
doctors cannot attribute to the crash, according to a report by the
Netherlands Health Care Inspectorate presented to Dutch Health
Minister Els Borst.
	   Health problems common among residents living near the crash
site include nausea, headaches and extreme fatigue.
	   Doctors interviewed in the survey noted that patients'
complaints often intensified at times when media attention was
focussed on the disaster or around the anniversary of the crash.
	   On Wednesday, Dutch newspapers revealed that the jet was
carrying dimethyl methylphosphonate, a chemical which can be used
in the manufacture of the deadly nerve gas sarin.
	   According to 51 doctors interviewed in the health inspectorate
survey charting health problems in the Bijlmermeer, ``a high
proportion of the patients attributing their disorder to the crash
would be reassured if there were clarity about the cargo being
carried by the El Al jumbo (jet) and the potential effects this may
have had on their health.''
	   The Dutch government announced Wednesday it will hold a
parliamentary inquiry in an effort to clarify what was aboard the
plane when it crashed, killing at least 43 people.
	   Mystery still surrounds the exact cargo of the plane, which was
flying from Amsterdam to Israel when it crashed. The flight was
carrying a small amount of unspecified military equipment.

Russia and Japan come to agreement on fishing in disputed waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japanese boats may now fish in disputed waters off
Russia's east coast under a bilateral agreement that went into
effect Thursday.
	   The agreement, signed in February, allows Japanese boats to fish
off southern islands in the Kuril chain, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Previously, Japanese boats fishing in the disputed waters risked
being fired at by Russian patrol boats and having their crews
arrested.
	   The Kuril Islands are at the heart of a dispute that has kept
Russia and Japan from signing an official peace treaty ending World
War II. Both countries claim the islands, which the Soviet army
occupied at the end of the war.
	   Though the question of ownership is still not settled, Russian
leaders hoped the fishing agreement would ``be an example of how we
can cooperate in a civilized way without going against political
positions,'' said Alexander Posyukov, head of the Foreign
Ministry's Japan department, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   He said the agreement, aimed at curbing poaching in the waters,
allows Japanese boats to harvest a certain quota of fish in
exchange for ``relevant compensation'' to Russia, ITAR-Tass said,
providing no further details.
	   Relations between Russia and Japan have improved in the last
year, following two summits between President Boris Yeltsin and
former Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Russia and Japan have promised to sign a final World War II
treaty and fully normalize relations by 2000.

Leyland quits Marlins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEVEN WINE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Jim Leyland, having seen his World Series champions
broken apart in less than a year, left the Florida Marlins on
Thursday.
	   Leyland announced that he will not return as the Marlins'
manager next season, activating an escape clause that allows him to
take a dlrs 500,000 buyout if he quits within two weeks of the end
of the U.S. Major League Baseball regular season. The season ended
Sunday.
	   ``From a business standpoint, it didn't quite work out,''
Leyland said on a conference call from his Pittsburgh home.
	   ``I had to determine whether I was willing to go at the pace
that new ownership's going to set. I decided that I don't want to
do that.''
	   Leyland had said Wednesday he had revealed his decision only to
his wife and their two children. He said he was ready to ``shock
the world,'' but his departure had been largely expected.
	   ``When I said major shock in the papers, I think this is a major
shock,'' Leyland said Thursday. ``Maybe some of you don't. Some of
the coaches thought I'd make the decision to stay.''
	   Instead, Leyland chose not to remain with a team that is in
ownership limbo coming off a 54-108 season, the worst in the
National League since 1969.
	   Leyland has been mulling his options since the season ended
Sunday.
	   ``I wanted to get away from things and make what I thought was
the best decision,'' said Leyland, who led the Marlins to the World
Series championship in 1997.
	   There's been speculation he'll become the next manager of the
Colorado Rockies, who fired Don Baylor on Monday. Leyland and
Rockies owner Jerry McMorris are good friends, and the Rockies have
been awaiting permission from the Marlins to interview Leyland.
	   ``I've talked to nobody about a contract, but I've got a feel
for what's out there,'' Leyland said. ``Nobody has offered me
anything. I've had people inquire, `What are you going to do?' But
has anybody sat down and said, `We'd like to offer you a contract?'
Absolutely not.''
	   Millionaire commodities trader John Henry hopes to complete his
drls 150 million purchase of the team next week, but he has feuded
publicly with owner Wayne Huizenga during negotiations, raising
doubts as to whether they'll reach a deal.
	   If Henry completes the purchase of the 6-year-old franchise, he
faces the arduous challenge of lobbying for a new stadium.

	   Small parts of the aircraft were also recovered from the sea,
officials said. No other details were available.

flights.
	   Two weeks ago, the Defense Ministry said the airlines had
received unsigned letters saying planes would be attacked if they

Egypt lowers top tariff rate to 40 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt has cut its top customs tariff rate
from 50 percent to 40 percent in line with its international trade
commitments, a semi-official newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Tariffs were also reduced between five and 10 percentage points
across several customs categories covering electrical appliances,
trucks and household goods, the Al-Ahram daily reported.
	   The measures were mandated by a presidential decree, it said.
	   The reductions do not apply to tariffs on imported automobiles,
the newspaper said.
	   According to the International Monetary Fund, Egypt's top tariff
rate stood at 70 percent in mid-1996. It was reduced to 50 percent
in July 1997. The government has committed itself to further
reductions.
	   Finance Minister Mohieddin El Ghareeb said last month that the
government will initiate gradual but small reductions in customs
duties every year.
	   Egypt started structural economic reforms after singing an
agreement with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
in June 1991. The reforms include privatization of industries,
unification of the exchange rate, lowering of tariffs,
liberalization of banking and financial sector and a drop in budget
deficit.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Amid growing pressure for international
intervention to stop the killing in Kosovo, NATO's top
decision-making body took another step Thursday to prepare air
strikes against Serb forces.
	   NATO diplomats said the North Atlantic Council approved an
``activation request'' for the 16 allied nations to formally commit
war planes and other forces for an eventual air campaign.
	   However, the council, made up of ambassadors from the allied
nations, come no closer to taking a political decision to launch
air raids and failed to overcome differences over whether the
alliance needs a clearer mandate from the United Nations before it
can attack.
	   The United States says no further U.N. resolution is needed, but
some European allies are concerned about the legality of acting
without explicit authorization from the U.N.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in Rome that
intervention without a U.N. mandate was ``inconceivable.''
	   Calling for a fresh Security Council vote would allow Russia to
veto a resolution authorizing military action. Russian diplomats
restated Moscow's opposition to air strikes in a meeting Wednesday
with the NATO council.
	   NATO officials said the alliance was waiting to see a report on
Kosovo to be presented to the Security Council early next week by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan.
	   The U.N. chief is expected to indicate whether the Serbs are
complying with last week's Security Council resolution, which urges
a ceasefire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if the belligerents continue fighting.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday warned air
strikes could follow Annan's report and diplomats at NATO
headquarters said the decision to launch attacks could be taken by
the middle of next week.
	   NATO military planners say they have identified around 100 Serb
military installations as possible targets for air strikes both in
Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia, including anti-aircraft missiles,
radar units and command centers. NATO has not yet decided which or
how many targets would be hit in a first wave of raids.
	   In response to Serb claims that its combat forces were pulling
back in Kosovo, a senior NATO diplomat said the alliance has seen
reports of a ``tapering off'' of military activity, but was not yet
convinced a significant withdrawal was underway.
	   NATO's military have been working for months on plans to
intervene in Kosovo where Serbian security forces began a crackdown
of ethnic Albanian separatists in February. Hundreds have been
killed and an estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their
homes.
	   Pressure for international intervention mounted in recent days
after the discovery of massacred ethnic Albanian villagers,
including women and children.
	   Last weekend, NATO approved an ``activation warning'' which
asked member nations to informally indicate which forces they would
make available.
	   Canada, Britain, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal have already announced plans to send warplanes. The United
States has yet to say publicly what it will contribute to the
force, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were ready for
action in the region.

Sierra Leone's notorious rebel leader appears in court

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ The country's most notorious rebel
leader, Foday Sankoh, appeared in court Thursday to answer to
charges of treason, but continued to stall the proceedings by
saying he had no lawyer.
	   The self-admitted leader of Sierra Leone's brutal Revolutionary
United Front, Sankoh is believed to have masterminded a campaign of
terror in this small West African nation's countryside, where
thousands have been killed, maimed or rendered homeless.
	   It was Sankoh's third appearance before Justice Samuel Ademosu
and the third time his trial was held over. If found guilty, Sankoh
could face the death penalty. Sixteen civilians, including five
journalists, were sentenced in August to death for treason in
related cases.
	   Standing handcuffed before the judge, Sankoh said he was unable
to afford a lawyer to represent him, but urged the court to
continue with the trial.
	   ``You can carry on,'' Sankoh told Ademosu, ``God will provide
somebody to represent me.''
	   The leader of the RUF, Sankoh was allied with a military junta
that seized power in 1997 but was ousted 10 months later by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force.
	   The longtime rebel leader has not commented on the charges, but
has claimed the RUF is transforming into a legitimate political
movement.
	   His rebels, however, have been accused of widespread atrocities
throughout the country as part of a longstanding and often macabre
campaign to topple successive governments.
	   Since the February ouster of the country's junta, the RUF and
remnants of that military government have been blamed for the
torture, rape, and the almost systematic maiming of thousands of
civilians. To terrorize local communities, RUF rebels are known to
have hacked off the hands or feet of suspected government
sympathizers, gouge out the eyes of their victims and rape women in
full view of family members.
	   Accounts of the atrocities have been documented by aid workers
and journalists.
	   While Sankoh appeared in court, his rebels continued to wage war
in the countryside. Fighting was reported near the town of Kenema,
about 200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of the capital,
Freetown.
	   Aid workers and witnesses said civilians and soldiers had been
wounded and killed in the latest fighting. Exact figures were not
immediately available.
	   Sankoh's first court appearance was at the start of September
after he was sent back to Sierra Leone in July from Nigeria, where
he was being held on gun smuggling charges.
	   His next court appearance is scheduled for Monday.

Communist leader hints he will vote against budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hard-line Communist leader suggested
Thursday that his party would vote against the 1999 budget, a move
that could bring down Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
government.
	   ``Among Communist Refoundation's members throughout the country,
negative judgments clearly prevail,'' Fausto Bertinotti said at a
gathering of foreign correspondents.
	   Bertinotti reiterated his stance that the budget proposal does
not include strong enough measures to stimulate job creation,
especially in Italy's depressed south, where the unemployment rate
is more than 20 percent.
	   However, he said Refoundation will make a final decision on how
to vote during a national congress over the weekend.
	   Refoundation is not formally part of the government but Prodi
relies on its votes for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
Bertinotti's hard-line tactics have twice pushed the government to
the brink of collapse.
	   A vote against the budget would cause any number of shake-ups,
including Prodi's resignation, the formation of a new government or
early elections.
	   Bertinotti said he doubted early elections would be called
because it was too close to the so-called ``white semester,'' the
last six weeks of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's term, during
which Parliament cannot be resolved.
	   The leader of a small opposition party, former President
Francesco Cossiga, has said he will bail out Prodi on the budget if
necessary, but said the premier must resign in return.
	   Prodi's coalition, at two years and five months, has outlived
all but two of Italy's other 54 postwar governments.
	   The budget, designed to keep Italy in line with the requirements
for the common European currency, calls for dlrs 8 billion (13.5
trillion lire) in deficit-cutting measures. Italy is a charter
member of the currency club.

Price of cocoa hits lowest level in more than seven months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The price of cocoa _ a big export earner for
Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Nigeria _ has dropped to its
lowest level for more than seven months, the International Cocoa
Organization said Thursday.
	   The intergovernmental agency's latest daily cocoa market
indicator price fell from dlrs 1,669 per metric ton to dlrs 1,639 _
its lowest level since February.
	   The market's recent decline is due to worries that consumption
levels will drop because of international economic problems,
particularly in Russia. There are also fears that a strong cocoa
growing season in the West African countries will flood the market,
traders said.

Election supervisors remove two elected Bosnian officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on pre-election punishments, election results,
CORRECTS election date to Sept.12-13. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Election supervisors have
removed two elected Bosnian officials, holding their parties
responsible for violating election rules during nationwide
balloting two weeks ago, a statement said Thursday.
	   No such punishments have been meted out after the Sept. 12-13
elections, but in the pre-election period the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe removed more than 30 Bosnian
Serb, Croat and Muslim candidates from different lists for various
violations of election rules.
	   An OSCE panel reviewing the ballot canceled the election of Pero
Kozul, who ran for the ruling Croat Democratic Union for the local
assembly in southwestern Siroki Brijeg.
	   Local election officials _ with the blessing of their chairman _
were found invalidating ballots there that were not marked by
voters for the Croatian party .
	   The panel also withheld payment for the officials involved and
banned them from overseeing elections in future.
	   In the second case, Dragan Jeftic of the Serb Radical Party for
the Bosnian Serb assembly was also denied his seat because the
local leader of his party had physically attacked election
officials from other parties.
	   In the northern city of Tuzla, a Muslim-led coalition was fined
1,000 German marks for violating election rules, including letting
people vote from their homes for the coalition.
	   The OSCE is continuing to investigate the results of the
elections and is expected to certify them as valid in the next week
or so.
	   The ballot last month increased the share of pro-western parties
in national and local assemblies. But Nikola Poplasen, a Serb
hardliner, was elected president of the Bosnian Serb republic,
beating incumbent Biljana Plavsic.

Lord of Dance star facing lawsuit from former manager
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Court proceedings began Thursday involving Michael
``Lord of the Dance'' Flatley, who is being sued for 10 million
pounds (dlrs 17 million) by his former manager.
	   John Reid, who also managed Elton John, claims he was fired just
as the Irish dance production's popularity surged. He has filed
suit in High Court seeking compensation for what he contends is
breach of contract.
	   The proceedings are expected to last five weeks and include
testimony from Flatley.
	   Reid claims Flatley, who hung up his dancing shoes in July,
dismissed him early into the British run of ``Lord of the Dance.''
	   Reid's lawyer, Robert Englehart, told the court that his client
was ``summarily dismissed'' in a letter on Jan. 16, 1997 _ seven
months after the management contract was signed. The contract was
not due to expire until Oct. 15, 1998, Englehart said.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reports of massacres of ethnic
Albanian civilians in the embattled province of Kosovo have
heightened the likelihood of NATO air strikes against military
targets in Yugoslavia.
	   Trying to deflect international criticism _ and the growing
possibility of NATO intervention _ the Serb-run Media Center, which
reflects official views, on Thursday announced a withdrawal of
combat forces from areas of conflict.
	   ``Only police units needed to preserve public security and order
and guard communications are out in the field,'' it said. There was
no immediate confirmation from international observer forces in the
province. But, Serbia on Monday promised a withdrawal of combat
units.
	   Heavy fighting along the Albanian border, meanwhile, killed six
Serb soldiers and wounded seven on Wednesday, the Yugoslav army
said Thursday _ fueling concern the Kosovo conflict could spill
over into a regional one.
	   International efforts to halt the bloodshed took on new urgency
after the reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia where nine out of 10 people are ethnic
Albanians. Hundreds have been killed since Serbs began cracking
down on Albanian separatists in the province in February.
	   In the latest allegation, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said the bodies of 12 males _ including a
15-year-old boy _ were discovered Thursday in the Suva Reka region,
about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. The report
could not be independently confirmed.
	   However, it came just days after diplomats, journalists and
human rights workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies, including
those of women and children, killed last weekend in Obrija in the
Drenica region. On Wednesday, residents of nearby Golubovac said at
least 13 men were killed in another alleged massacre.
	   The U.N. Security Council was to hold an emergency meeting
Thursday after British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called on the
council to condemn the Obrija massacre.
	   ``I think what we have seen is plain murder,'' Cook said
Thursday at U.N. headquarters in New York. Yugoslav President
Sloboan Milosevic, he said, ``has outraged the whole of the world
community.''
	   The United States and other leading nations were also to meet
Friday in London on Kosovo. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Defense Secretary William Cohen planned to brief U.S. senators
on the massacres later Thursday in Washington.
	   Meanwhile, the Yugoslav army reported fierce fighting Wednesday
within several hundred yards (meters) of the Albanian border after
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels, apparently operating from
sanctuaries inside Albania, attacked Serb soldiers and border
guards.
	   Albanian Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said five
mortars exploded inside the Albanian border village of Padesh.
	   The United States and European powers fear the conflict could
spread to other southern Balkan countries with large ethnic
Albanian communities.
	   On Wednesday, residents of Golubovac said Serb forces surrounded
a pocket of refugees last Saturday and singled out at least 13 men
to kill. They said the victims were already buried, but pointed to
saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty cartridges in front of
a fence where they said the refugees were shot.
	   Farmer Naim Hodzaj said Serb police had killed several other men
individually, including his 37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was
doused with gasoline and set on fire. The brother's burned body lay
on a path on the edge of the woods.
	   There was no way to corroborate the ethnic Albanian accounts.
	   Britain and Austria urged an international investigation into
what Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel called the
``bestial'' massacre at Obrija.
	   Yugoslavia's ambassador to Britain, Miroslav Pajic, said his
country was being subjected to a ``smear campaign'' aimed at
finding ``an excuse for air strikes.''
	   ``We are not so crazy to do something (like this) in heat of the
NATO threats of airstrikes against Yugoslavia and our people,'' he
told BBC television today.
	   Pajsic said Yugoslavia would conduct their own investigation
into the killings.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it
does not expect the country's economic crisis to result in an
increase in emigration.
	   ``I don't think this will happen,'' said ministry spokesman
Vladimir Rakhmanin, according to Russian media.
	   Israeli Cabinet ministers have said they expect a sharp increase
in the immigration of Russian Jews if the crisis continues and are
making contingency plans to accommodate them.

Sudan claims crushed Ugandan, Eritrean forces
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with aid group reporting government raid on hospital &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudanese troops are chasing Ugandan and
Eritrean forces out of Sudan after crushing them in battles in the
south of the country, the interior minister said.
	   ``The army has now crushed the invaders and is only cleaning the
areas'' in the southern Eastern Equatoria province, Interior
Minister Brig. Abdel-Raheem Mohammed Hussein told state-run
television Wednesday night.
	   Sudan has claimed that heavy clashes have been taking place in
southern Sudan since Sept. 14, when it said Ugandan and Eritrean
troops entered Sudan to support local rebel groups. Uganda and
Eritrea have denied the reports.
	   Hussein, speaking from the southern city of Juba, said Sudan
will become the ``graveyard for all outlaws and agents.''
	   The army ``has settled the matter against the Ugandan and
Eritrean aggression forces and are working to repulse them out of
our national borders,'' Hussein added.
	   Meanwhile, a Norwegian aid group said a Sudanese military plane
bombed its hospital and a base in southern Sudan on Wednesday,
killing one civilian and injuring two others.
	   The Norwegian People's Aid said in a statement in Oslo that the
bombing on the town of Nimule followed the Sept. 28 cluster bombing
of NPA's hospital in Yei. The two hospitals along with those in
Chuckudum and Labone, also operated by the NPA, are the only ones
serving the people of southern Sudan, the statement said.
	   ``The result of these bombings are only terror against the
civilian population, as it has no military significance,'' NPA
spokesman Ivar Christiansen said in a statement.
	   Christian and animist rebels have been waging a military
campaign against the Khartoum government since 1983 for more
autonomy for the southern districts.
	   Some 1.5 million people have been killed in the fighting and
resulting famines.
	   Sudanese rebels are believed to have received military
assistance from Uganda, Ethiopia and Eritrea but they deny that.

Britain says Kosovo massacre the ``business of all humanity''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Renewing threats of force against
Yugoslavia, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Thursday that the
latest massacre of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo is ``the
business of all humanity.''
	   ``We don't want to use force,'' said Cook, addressing the annual
conference of the governing Labor Party in this north England town.
	   ``But today I warn (Serb) President Slobodan Milosevic that if
it will take force, Britain is ready to back force.''
	   Cook said he has also asked prosecutors at the War Crimes
Tribunal in The Hague to investigate the killings of 18 civilians,
mostly women and children. Their shot and mutilated bodies were
found this week in Kosovo, the mainly ethnic Albanian province of
the former Yugoslavia.
	   On Wednesday, Britain, with U.S. backing, called an emergency
meeting of the U.N. Security Council, and NATO proceeded with final
preparations for air strikes against Serb forces. Britain took over
the chairmanship of the Security Council on Thursday.
	   Cook said that Europe's relations with the Islamic world had
been damaged ``because we appear not to defend the human rights of
Muslim people in the Balkans.'' Muslims include ethnic Albanians.
	   ``I say this to President Milosevic: don't dare tell us that
such an atrocity is an internal affair,'' he added to applause from
delegates. ``Such an outrage to the laws of humanity is the
business of all humanity.''
	   On European-Islamic relations, Cook said that Iran
disassociating last month from a death threat against British
author Salman Rushdie meant a fresh start for Britain with Islamic
countries.
	   ``I want us to build on our new relationship a wider dialogue
between the West and the Islamic world to promote understanding and
to combat prejudice,'' said Cook.
	   Cook also said Britain wanted the European Union's new single
currency, the euro, to succeed.
	   ``Too many jobs in Britain depend on exports to Europe for it to
fail,'' he said. ``And when the time is right, we will make our
decision on whether to join on the basis of a hardheaded assessment
of whether it will be good for the economy in Britain and good for
jobs in Britain.''
	   Britain will not join the currency when it starts in January,
but is widely expected to do so after a few years.

Police: Woman poses as Padre Pio's 'spiritual daughter'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARI, Italy (AP) _ A women representing herself as the
``spiritual daughter'' of the late Italian mystic Padre Pio faces
charges of defrauding his believers of hundreds of thousands of
dollars with promises to cast out their devils or deliver miracle
cures.
	   The case illustrates the power of Padre Pio, who has a worldwide
following that attracts millions of visitors to his tomb in the
southern city of Bari every year.
	   Padre Pio was a Capuchin monk who skyrocketed to fame in 1918
when he began to bleed from his hands, feet and side, the first
priest in centuries to show signs of the stigmata.
	   Thirty years after his death, Padre Pio's followers still credit
him with miracles, intercessions and supernatural powers; many say
a powerful scent of flowers signals his spirtual presence.
	   Filomena Malerba, a 61-year-old Bari housewife, is believed by
authorities to have traded on the Padre Pio legend for three years,
posing as his ``spiritual daughter'' and infiltrating a group of
devotees, the ANSA news agency said Friday.
	   Malerba _ with the help of a friend _ is suspected of cheating
people out of roughly dlrs 600,000. Both women are under house
arrest during the fraud investigation, ANSA said.
	   When police raided Malerba's house, it said, they found huge
sums of money, jewelry and objects made of silver and gold her
victims had given her in payment.
	   ANSA said the alleged victims included a woman suffering from
leukemia, another whose son had tried to commit suicide and a third
who was depressed because of marital problems.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The European Union's police agency
Thursday said members states must join forces to fight
counterfeiters of the euro, the union's common currency which will
be in circulation in 2002.
	   Solidarity in targeting forgers and other criminals will boost
the efficiency and effectiveness of the 15 members' national law
enforcement agencies, European police officials said Thursday.
	   ``It is of the utmost importance that the counterfeiting of the
euro needs to be tackled by all,'' said Jurgen Storbeck, the chief
of Europe's police agency Europol.
	   The single currency goes into force on Jan 1. The first bank
notes are expected to be in circulation in the second half of 2002.
	   ``We need a common approach. This is no longer a national
problem,'' Storbeck said said at a gathering to mark the entry into
force of the Europol Convention which provides the legal foundation
for Europol to carry out its tasks.
	   The agency's mandate includes fighting cross-border trafficking
of illicit drugs and nuclear materials as well as illegal
immigration, stolen vehicles and money laundering.
	   Europol does not have its own police force, instead it
facilitates the exchange of police intelligence between its members
via a powerful data base. Before the creation of Europol, countries
did not have a computer system to share information about criminal
activity.
	   But as organized crimes become more sophisticated so must law
enforcement techniques, said officials.
	   ``We must be fully aware that one single country cannot
successfully take up arms against organized crime, said Austrian
Interior Minister Karl Schloegl, whose country holds the rotating
European Union presidency.
	   ``No country by itself can counter and combat this new form of
criminality,'' he added.
	   Combating cross-border terrorism and containing the influx of
organized crime from eastern Europe are other major challenges for
Europol, said Schloegl.
	   As the agency widens its scope of crime-fighting authority, it
is implementing a computer system that all members will be able to
access for information. Currently, only Europol, based in The
Hague, has access to the entire system of data from the 15
countries.
	   The system is expected to be operational at the end of 2000.

Report documents illegal sterilization of handicapped men, women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 225 physically or mentally handicapped
patients in state-run care facilities were sterilized without their
consent between 1995 and 1996, according to a government report
released this week.
	   Forced sterilization is ``infrequent, but not negligeable,'' the
report said, stressing that the practice, although violating French
law, is ``virtually tolerated.''
	   The report was commissioned last year by the Social Affairs
ministry in response to allegations of widespread and systematic
sterilizations in state-run care facilities.
	   According to the study, which examined sterilizations among the
general population over the two-year period, 423 vasectomies were
performed in total, with 15 of them on handicapped men.
	   Some 10,453 sterilizations were performed in total on women _
and 211 of them were handicapped. About 25 percent of the retarded
women were under 25.
	   About 22,000 sterilizations are performed yearly in France.
	   The report said involuntary sterilization represents ``an attack
on the dignity'' of the handicapped and is a way of ``denying them
normal sexual and erotic activity.''
	   For authors Drs. Maire-Laure Lagardere, Helene Strohl and
Bernard Even, sterilization ``is justifiable only on rare
occasions,'' namely in emergencies or regarding minors.
	   They said better, more affordable contraception must be made
available and suggested the creation of a proper legal framework so
that contraception could become mandatory in such cases.
	   ``Everything takes place as though no progress in contraception
has been made and as if the only substitute for the pill is tying
off the tubes,'' the authors wrote.
	   Last year, Nicole Diederich, a respected French researcher, said
involuntary sterilization programs had been on the rise ever since
hospitals and specialized institutions began allowing sexual
relations among handicapped patients 20 years ago.
	   Her comments came in the wake of findings that other European
countries also have had involuntary sterilization programs.

Latvia's stateless Russians uneasily eye citizenship referendum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ For many of Latvia's ethnic Russians, seven
years of independence has been seven years in the wilderness, and
they fear a national referendum on Saturday will leave them there.
	   With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of Latvia's
ethnic Russians _ about 45 percent of the country's residents _
became stateless: citizens of a vanished country, and facing high
obstacles in becoming citizens of the new land.
	   The referendum asks Latvian voters if they want to approve
measures that would lower the obstacles for ethnic Russians seeking
citizenship. But with nationalist sentiment high, few expect the
measures to pass.
	   ``It will be another message from Latvians that we are not
welcome in this country,'' said a discouraged 70-year-old woman who
gave her name only as Lena.
	   ``We Russians have long understood that we're not really wanted
here. But this referendum will drive that message home,'' she said
as she sat in a Riga park with her granddaughter.
	   After the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Latvia in 1940, hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Russians poured in, most of them sent under
Josef Stalin's drive to ``russify'' Soviet lands. Many lived in
communities that were entirely Russian-speaking.
	   The influx was so enormous that today, only about 52 percent of
the people in this country of 2.5 million are ethnic Latvans. The
waves of Russians were deeply resented by Latvians, and critics say
the country's citizenship laws have no rationale but sheer spite.
	   Under the so-called ``windows'' system, the older an ethnic
Russian is, the longer he has to wait to apply for citizenship; the
oldest wuld have to wait until 2003. The provision is seen by most
Russians as clearly aimed at punishing those who were part of the
vast first wave of russification.
	   Children born of stateless parents even after Latvian
independence are not granted citizenship _ even if they've never
set foot outside the country and speak no language but Latvian.
	   The laws have been sharply criticized by the West and have
sparked denunciations and threats of economic retaliation from
Russia. As tensions with Russia escalated this spring, the
parliament passed amendments eliminating the windows system and
granting citizenship to all children born in Latvia since
independence. But Latvian nationalists forced the issue to a
referendum.
	   Among the nationalists is Prime Minister Guntars Krasts. He
believes the current laws are more than reasonable and that
granting citizenship to children who may not speak Latvian is going
too far.
	   ``With these amendments, our citizenship laws would be some of
the most liberal in the world and certainly the most liberal in
Europe,'' he said in an interview.
	   Although many have said that turning down the citizenship
amendments would torpedo Latvia's cherished goal of joining the
European Union, Krasts dismisses the argument.
	   ``If there is an extremely negative reaction to this referendum
passing, it would be surprising ... it wouldn't be fair,'' he said.
	   Saudina Skaidite, selling flowers in the shadow of Riga's
towering independence monuent, sees it the same way.
	   ``If a person wants to be Latvian, then that person should speak
Latvian,'' she said. ``Why should the outside world not see that as
reasonable?''
	   Resentment may be high, but outward signs of it are low. Most
ethnic Russians say their day-to-day contact with Latvians is
friendly. Store clerks may start a transaction in Latvian, but
switch into Russian without raising an eyebrow. Intermarriage is
common.
	   But Russians without citizemship also complain bitterly about
the hassle of having to apply and re-apply for assorted
non-citizens docments, including resident permits and aliens
passports. They say they often have to stand in long lines for
hours on end, then try to reason with stone-faced Latvian
bureaucrats.
	   ``These offices are the main contacts Russians have with the
Latvian state, and it has created a very negative image among
Russians,'' said 31-year-old Alex Krasnitsky, an ethnic Russian
journalist born in Latvia. ``Russians have been very offended,
humiliated by it all.''
	   But ethnic Russian Konstantin Kazakov, 25, said not having
citizenship doesn't bother him. He speaks good Latvian and feels
confident he could pass the language test, but isn't hurrying to
apply.
	   ``Unfortunately you can't get Latvian citizenship and not serve
in the Latvian army,'' said Kazakov. ``I don't want to serve in the
Latvian or any army. I'll get my Latvian citizenship in a few
years, when I'm too old to be drafted.''
	   Unlike Kazakov, some 60 percent of Russian-speakers in Latvia
speak little or no Latvian, and so aren't in a position to chose
whether to take or forego citizenship.
	   Out of 200,000 Russian-speakers who have a right to at least
apply for citizenship, fewer than 20,000 have even bothered and
only 10,000 have been naturalized.
	   Despite the problems, many Russians here say that the current
economic chaos in Russia makes them thankful to live in Latvia _
under whatever circumstances _ where the economy is relatively
strong.
	   ``We see what's happening in Russia, and it's a mess,'' said
20-year-old Alina Zemerova, an economics student. ``I'm very happy
to tie my future to this country.''

Lisbon stock exchange suspends trading as share prices plummet

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with shares recovering in 4th graf, finance minister
quote in 5th graf

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Lisbon Stock Exchange suspended
trading for one hour and 45 minutes Thursday after the market went
into a tailspin, with the benchmark BVL-30 index plunging more than
14 percent in early dealings.
	   The exchange did not explain the suspension, but brokers said it
was called because of panic selling as investors rushed to unload
shares amid a generalized fall across world markets.
	   The sell-off drove the BVL-30 down by more than 567 points, or
14.4 percent, to 3373.9 points.
	   However, the market recovered later in the day, ending almost 9
percent down at 3604.32 points.
	   Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco said there was no need for
panic. ``The economy is in good health and gives no cause for a
lack of confidence. Portuguese companies are more solid now than
they have been for 12 or 13 years,'' Sousa Franco said on state
television.
	   Powered by the government's privatization program, which drew
thousands of new private investors to the market, and a thriving
economy, the BVL-30 hit a record high of 6176.89 points in April.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lankan military officials said a
naval gunboat on Thursday recovered the bodies of three of the 55
people aboard a commercial plane missing for two days after flying
near rebel-held territory in the north.
	   A life vest with the insignia of the Lionair Antonov AN-24 was
also found near the bodies, a few miles (kilometers) off the coast
of the Tamil rebel-held fishing village of Nachchikudah, said the
officials, who asked not to be named.
	   The plane left the Palali airport in Jaffna on Tuesday afternoon
and lost radio contact within minutes. There was no distress signal
from the crew, the officials said.
	   The bodies would be brought Friday to the capital, Colombo, for
identification.
	   Those aboard the Ukrainian-built plane included four Russian
crew members, three Sri Lankan crew members and 48 Sri Lankan
passengers.
	   Officials couldn't say for certain whether the plane had crashed
or was downed by Tamil Tiger rebels fighting a separatist war in
northern Sri Lanka since 1983.
	   The Jaffna peninsula, on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean
island, is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by air and sea
because of fighting between the army and secessionist ethnic Tamils
along the land route.
	   Lionair is one of two private companies providing civilian air
service between Colombo and Jaffna. The airlines' planes normal
flight path is over a coastal route, past rebel-held areas.
	   Small parts of the aircraft was also recovered from the sea,
officials said. No other details were available.
	   The government on Thursday ordered both airlines to suspend
flights.
	   Two weeks ago, the Defense Ministry said the airlines had
received unsigned letters saying planes would be attacked if they
did not cease service. The other airline, Monara Air, stopped
flights for two days, but then decided to resume.
	   Though the letters were anonymous, suspicion fell on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam separatists, who have tried to
sabotage attempts to restore normalcy on Jaffna.
	   Earlier this month, the rebels were blamed for a bombing that
killed the new mayor of Jaffna city, the main city on the
peninsula, along with its military and police commanders.
	   The rebels fighting for an ethnic Tamil homeland have been
driven across a broad lagoon into the jungles of the Sri Lankan
mainland.
	   In 1983, the rebels blew up a plane of Air Lanka on the ground
at Colombo airport, killing 14 people. They have not since attacked
civilian planes.

Russian teen convicted of ordering parents' killings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A 14-year-old boy was sentenced to 10 years in
prison for paying two men 3,000 rubles (about dlrs 185) to kill his
parents, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Thursday.
	   Sergei Sokolov let the two killers into his home in the
Novosibirsk region of Siberia, where they stabbed his mother and
father with knives, the news agency said.
	   His mother died quickly, but his father survived, so Sokolov
gave the attackers a hammer to finish killing him, it said.
	   The teen-ager told the Iskitim City Court that his father beat
him, but the court ruled he had his parents killed so he could
inherit their money.
	   The two men hired by Sokolov were each sentenced to 20 years in
a maximum security prison.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Even as the Yugoslav army reported
heavy fighting against ethnic Albanian insurgents, allied Serbian
authorities on Thursday announced a pullback of combat units from
regions of recent bloodshed.
	   The conflicting reports _ new fighting and a pullback that would
mean an end to fighting _ highlighted the confusion and turmoil in
Kosovo more than seven months after Serbian and Yugoslav
authorities began a crackdown on ethnic Albanian guerrillas
fighting to separate Kosovo from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting called to
coordinate international action, Serbia moved to try to defuse
sentiment that could lead to possible NATO air strikes against
Serbian and Yugoslav targets.
	   International momentum to punish the authorities gathered
momentum after western reporters and diplomats discovered more than
a dozen bodies of ethnic Albanian villagers massacred and mutilated
several days ago. Another alleged Serb massacre was reported on
Tuesday by Albanian sources, who said the bodies of 11 men and a
15-year-old boy were found in the Suva Reka region about 45
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina. That report could not
be confirmed.
	   In Belgrade, Serbian authorities denied outright that any
massacres were committed.
	   Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj said the bodies many reporters
saw in the village were planted by ethnic Albanians and western
experts. He added the whole case was an ``orchestrated propaganda
war.''
	   Western countries were staging the massacre ``to push through
... a NATO attack decision in the U.N. Security Council,'' he told
reporters.
	   Seselj threatened to retaliate against NATO soldiers abroad and
foreigners and pro-western Serbs in Yugoslavia, in case of any such
attack.
	   ``We do not underestimate NATO strength, but we have to defend
ourselves,'' he said.
	   ``Maybe we would not be able to bring down their missiles or
planes, but their soldiers all around the world will be our enemies
and subjected to our attacks wherever they are available.''
	   In Kosovo, the Yugoslav army said Thursday six soldiers were
killed and seven wounded in heavy fighting along the Albanian
border, heightening concern the Kosovo conflict could spill over
into regional warfare.
	   But the Serb-run Media Center, which reflects official views, on
Thursday announced a withdrawal of combat forces from areas of
conflict.
	   It said that ``only police units needed to preserve public
security and order and guard communications, are out in the
field.''
	   Last Monday Serbia promised the withdrawal of combat units.
There was no immediate comment from international observers in the
province on the Serb claim.
	   The U.N. Security Council was scheduled to meet later Thursday
to discuss the fighting that has left hundreds dead and forced at
least 275,000 to flee.
	   The United States and other leading nations were also meeting
Friday in London on Kosovo. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Defense Secretary William Cohen planned to brief U.S. senators
on the massacres later Thursday in Washington.
	   The United States and European powers fear the conflict could
spread to other southern Balkan countries with large ethnic
Albanian communities.
	   The brutality of the Kosovo conflict, in which both sides have
been accused of atrocities, has added new impetus to international
efforts to halt the carnage.
	   The new atrocities reports came Wednesday from residents of
Golubovac. They said that Serb forces surrounded a pocket of
refugees last Saturday and singled out at least 13 men to kill.
They said the victims were already buried, but pointed to
saucer-sized pools of dried blood and empty cartridges in front of
a fence where they said the refugees were shot.
	   Farmer Naim Hodzaj said in addition to the executions, Serb
police had killed several other men individually, including his
37-year-old brother Ramadan, who was doused with gasoline and set
on fire. A burned body lay on a path on the edge of the woods.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac, including those of
women and children.
	   In a separate incident, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Serb
police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles Tuesday in Vranic in
southwestern Kosovo.
	   The New York organization said one of its researchers saw the
bodies of four ethnic Albanian men who had been killed, including
one whose face had been mutilated.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Feasibility studies for a proposed gas
pipeline running through three countries in West Africa are
expected to begin next year, the project's implementation committee
said at a meeting in the Ghanaian capital.
	   Initial studies for the pipeline, which would supply gas from
Nigeria for power generation and commercial and industrial use to
Ghana, Benin and Togo, had already been completed, said the
meeting's chairman Abdullah Jibril Oyekan of Nigeria.
	   Experts from the project's member states also discussed legal
and technical details at the one-day meeting.
	   So far, six companies including Nigeria Gas Company, Shell
Petroleum Development Company, Chevron and Ghana National Petroleum
Corporation have shown interest in the project and contributed to
sponsor the studies.
	   The World Bank-backed project which has been under discussion
since 1995, is expected to provide an urgently needed alternative
supply of an energy for the region.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) - Two commercial banks on Thursday
announced increases in their their prime lending rates, signaling
the start of a broader increase in the cost of borrowing.
	   South African-owned Stanbic Bank said in a notice published in
the local press here that it was raising its prime lending rate to
40.5 percent, starting Friday, while locally owned First Bank said
its rate had risen to 41.5 percent.
	   In both cases, the rate went up by 3 percentage points.
	   Both blamed the increase on Harare imposing a jump in the
statutory reserve requirement - the percentage of cash deposits
that commercial banks are obliged by law to lodge with the central
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe - to 25 percent from 20 percent last
Friday.
	   Last week finance minister Herbert Murerwa announced a package
of measures to stem the collapse of the currency, the Zimbabwe
dollar (ZWD), which has plunged more than 50 percent against the
dollar since August 1997. It closed Thursday at ZWD 31.50 to the
U.S. currency.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ United Nations agencies, donors and
private aid groups operating in Mozambique are to send emergency
food aid to thousands of people who are facing acute hunger around
the country.
	   The decision to send 1,600 tons of maize and 2,000 tons of beans
was reached after the agencies and donors as well as the government
met Wednesday night in Maputo.
	   Distribution will begin within 10 days.
	   About 300,000 people are affected by shortages of food and water
in various parts of Mozambique, particularly in the southern
provinces of Gaza and Inhambane and in Sofala, Zambezia and Manica
provinces in the center of the country.
	   Crops were washed away by last February's flooding, which also
destroyed roads.

WWF: one-third of earth's natural wealth lost in 25 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: World Wide Fund for Nature is known as World Wildlife Fund in
North America. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ The planet lost almost a third of its
natural resources and animals between 1970 and 1995, the World Wide
Fund for Nature said in a study released Thursday.
	   Freshwater environments such as rivers and lakes were the worst
hit, with species they contain declining at a rate of some 6
percent annually between 1990 and 1995, according to the 36-page
Living Planet Report.
	   ``These figures are a stark indication of the deteriorating
health of natural ecosystems,'' said Jonathan Loh, one of the
report's authors.
	   ``Most concerning of all is the decline of freshwater lakes,
rivers and wetlands'' which, the study said, may contain as little
as half the number of creatures in 1995 they possessed in 1970.
	   The populations of more than half of 227 species of freshwater
birds, fish and mammals tracked had shrunk. Less than 10 percent
had increased in number.
	   The report estimated that human pressure on natural resources is
growing at a rate of around 5 percent per year. The figure is based
on consumption of grain, sea fish, wood, fresh water and cement,
and emissions of carbon dioxide.
	   Most of the world's fish stocks are either fully exploited or in
decline because of overfishing, the report said.
	   It put the average annual catch of sea fish for the early 1990s
at 84 million tons, double the catch in 1960. On top of that, some
27 million tons of fish annually are caught and then discarded, it
said.
	   The number of creatures in the seas and oceans over the 25-year
period studied dropped by an estimated 30 percent, while some 10
percent of the world's natural forest cover was lost.
	   The study recommends further controls on fishing and the removal
of government fishing subsidies, more efficient water use by
farmers, pollution controls and limits on the expansion of cities
into the countryside.
	   The report, based on information from national statistics and
international studies, was produced in association with the World
Conservation Monitoring Center and the New Economics Foundation, a
British-based research and campaigning group.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Even as the Yugoslav army reported
heavy fighting against ethnic Albanian insurgents, allied Serbian
authorities on Thursday announced a pullback of combat units from
regions of recent bloodshed.
	   The conflicting reports _ new fighting and a pullback that would
mean an end to fighting _ highlighted the confusion and turmoil in
Kosovo more than seven months after Serbian and Yugoslav
authorities began a crackdown on ethnic Albanian guerrillas
fighting to separate Kosovo from Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
	   Ahead of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting called to
coordinate international action, Serbia moved to try to defuse
sentiment that could lead to possible NATO air strikes against
Serbian and Yugoslav targets.
	   International momentum to punish the authorities gathered
momentum after western reporters and diplomats discovered more than
a dozen bodies of ethnic Albanian villagers massacred and mutilated
several days ago. Another alleged Serb massacre was reported on
Thursday by Albanian sources, who said the bodies of 11 men and a
15-year-old boy were found in the Suva Reka region about 45
kilometers (30 miles) southwest of Pristina. That report could not
be confirmed, and it was not known whether the victims _ most of
them men of fighting age _ were armed.

Tajik government, opposition urge bandits give up weapons

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government and opposition of Tajikistan issued
a joint call Thursday to criminal groups in the Central Asian
country to give up their weapons and surrender, a news agency
reported.
	   The government and opposition said there are at least two groups
that are ``killing people, taking hostages and committing (other)
crimes,'' Interfax said.
	   ``To eliminate bloodshed, we are urging members of these groups
and especially unexperienced young people to relinquish their
weapons and return to normal civilian life,'' the statement said.
	   Tajikistan has been torn by civil strife since gaining
independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in lede with stock market down 7.6 percent, adds
 &UR; Germany's interest rates unchanged as stock market plunges &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's central bank decided
Thursday to leave the country's key interest rates unchanged,
despite turbulence on world markets and even as the German stock
market plunged 7.6 percent.
	   The inaction was expected, with senior bank officials this week
saying they didn't see any need to cut rates, despite a cut in the
United States earlier in the week aimed at bolstering the economy
there.
	   Germany's key interest rate is 3.3 percent.
	   Senior Deutsche Bundesbank official Ernst Welteke said there was
sufficient turbulence on global financial markets and the
Bundesbank shouldn't add to it by making hectic or isolated moves.
	   The issue of interest rate cuts in Europe is tricky, since rates
across Europe must be unified by Jan. 1, when 11 of the European
Union's 15 states will merge their monetary policies and launch a
single currency, the euro.
	   Lowering Germany's rate would make it even harder for countries
among the 11 which have higher rates to converge on the lower rate.
	   The chairman of Germany's Social Democratic Party, Oskar
Lafontaine, who is tapped to become the next finance minister, has
called for a cut in interest rates.
	   Welteke told German radio Deutschlandfunk that he understood why
Lafontaine was calling for a cut, but that lower German rates were
not a cure-all for Germany's high unemployment, nor would they give
zest to the economy.
	   Economists are growing gloomy about Germany's 1998 economic
growth, projecting growth at 2.5 percent, compared to the outgoing
government's official projection of around 3 percent.
	   In elections Sunday, the outgoing conservative coalition
government led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl was defeated by the Social
Democratic Party.
	   Welteke's remarks came just before German share prices plunged
7.6 percent to put the DAX index at 4094.62, a drop of 336.29
points at the close of trading.
	   The drop was in reaction to bad news piling up on international
markets, especially Japan and Wall Street, and a weakening U.S.
dollar.
	   Traders said investors were disheartened by the last two days'
losses in stock markets in Tokyo and New York.

Graham pledges return to winning ways
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Graham quotes
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ George Graham, whose management style is based on
method and passion rather than flair and entertainment, began his
new job as manager of Tottenham on Wednesday with a pledge to make
Spurs a winning team again.
	   The 53-year-old Scot, who guided Spurs' north London rival
Arsenal to league titles in 1989 and '91, said he would impose his
own style of management on the sliding White Hart Lane club to try
to achieve the same success.
	   If his spells at Arsenal and, more recently, Leeds are a guide,
that would mean soccer without frills, placing achieving results
ahead of thrilling the fans.
	   ``I am not going to change. The players want to be successful
and play in a successful team and to be up their challenging,''
Graham said at a news conference at White Hart Lane. ``I have got
to convince them that my way of dealing with things is the way.
	   ``The first thing to do here is to get this club back up the
league and challenging for honors. In the next two years it is to
get them in the top six. If we can get them there then, hopefully,
we can compete with the big boys.''
	   Graham also has to deal with the intense rivalry that exists
between his former club and his new one.
	   While Arsenal, who also won the league and FA Cup double last
season under French coach Arsene Wenger, has achieved many
successes in the last decade, Spurs has just one FA Cup title in
1991. Spurs hasn't won the league title since 1961.
	   Graham made a brief reference to his successful spell with
Arsenal.
	   ``When I was manager of another north London club, Spurs were up
there with us,'' he said. ``Then they started drifting a little
bit.
	   ``With the talent that Spurs have in the present team they
should be further up the league. If I were a Tottenham fan I would
be looking at wanting a winning team. I will try to give them that
as quickly as possible.''
	   Graham, who had been at Leeds for three seasons but was eager to
move back to London, reportedly signed a four-year deal with
Arsenal worth 6 million pounds (dlrs 10 million).
	   He succeeds Swiss coach Christian Gross, who was fired nearly a
month ago. David Pleat has served as caretaker manager since then.
	   Tottenham, which flirted with relegation last season, currently
lies 13th in the 20-team table with nine points from seven games.
	   Graham likely will get some reminders from the Arsenal fans
about the way he left Highbury under a cloud in 1995.
	   He was fired by the club and served a one-year ban from soccer
for taking a kickback from a Norwegian agent over a transfer deal.
He took the Leeds job after the ban ended in the summer of '96.
	   Last season, Graham guided Leeds to fifth place in the Premier
League and a berth in the UEFA Cup. In his last game in charge of
Leeds, the club gained the UEFA Cup second round Tuesday by ousting
Maritimo of Portugal after a penalty shootout.
	   Graham's replacement at Leeds was not immediately announced. His
assistant, David O'Leary, Coventry manager Gordon Strachan and
Leicester boss Martin O'Neill have all been mentioned as possible
candidates.

Bus driver's first novel is Britain's latest literary sensation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo LMN102 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``I hope you won't be writing about buses being
late,'' Magnus Mills tells a journalist who kept him waiting 20
minutes in the rain.
	   The voice is flat _ not angry, not welcoming _ and the lean
6-foot-2 (1.8-meter) frame of Britain's newest literary sensation
is slouched against a tree outside his local pub.
	   Gibes about bus schedules are touchy because Mills drives a
double-decker, and had already spent a full shift that day driving
the 137 route between south London and Oxford Circus.
	   But he's resigned to attracting reporters because he's this
oddity: a bus driver who wrote a first novel, got it published and
has been nominated for Britain's premier literary prize.
	   He's got publishing deals in the United States, France and
Scandinavia, and he's sold the film rights. He even got a generous
blurb from the reclusive Thomas Pynchon, who hailed ``a demented,
deadpan comic wonder, this rude salute to the dark side of contract
employment ...''
	   And all without writing a word about buses.
	   ``The Restraint of Beasts,'' a deadpan fantasy about building
fences and the mystery of sausages, is rated the longshot among the
six finalists for the 20,000-pound (dlrs 34,000) Booker Prize to be
awarded Oct. 27, up against such heavyweights as Ian McEwan, Beryl
Bainbridge and Julian Barnes.
	   The hype already has spawned a backlash, with one critic
contending Mills was nominated only because he drives a bus.
	   ``If that's the reason, then I don't want the prize,'' he says
with uncharacteristic heat.
	   The book was written in Mills' spare time, with ideas flowing as
he jogged or showered or rode his bike.
	   Literary plotting can't be done while piloting a bus through
London's teeming streets, he explains, because ``you've got to
really care about exactly where you're putting the bus
traffic-wise.''
	   Mills, a 44-year-old native of Bristol, built fences in England,
Scotland and even Australia before settling in London in 1986.
	   ``The Restraint of Beasts'' unrolls in his flat voice, in the
monotonous way of working life.
	   Tam, Richie and the nameless narrator do their fencing jobs
well, for the most part. They don't muse on the meaning of life or
chafe against their limited horizons, but just get on with it _
whether tightening a high-tensile wire, or pausing now and again
for the necessary work of burying someone killed entirely by
accident.
	   The book got lots of attention in Britain after The Sunday Times
reported in August that Mills received a 1 million pound (dlrs 1.7
million) advance.
	   The true figure was 10,000 pounds (dlrs 17,000) from his
publisher, he says, and 15,000 pounds (dlrs 25,500) for the film
rights. Not enough to give up bus driving for now.
	   Mills says outsiders don't understand the intricacies of bus
driving _ intricacies he doesn't try to explain _ but the book
defends the mysterious integrity of work:
	   ___
	   ``Hard job, fencing, isn't it?'' he began.
	   ``It's OK,'' replied Tam.
	   ``Must be repetitive knocking all those posts in, though. First
one, then another, then another after that.''
	   ``You get used to it,'' I said.
	   ``Yes, but repeating the same thing over and over again, enough
to drive you mad. All that repetition.''
	   The more he went on like this, the more it began to sound as if
he didn't know what he was talking about.
	   ___
	   For Mills' fencers, the long view means thinking about New
Year's Eve during Christmas week. They don't ask ``Is that all
there is?'' They don't turn the day's events into metaphors.
	   ``I skip over those parts when I read books,'' says Mills, who
boasts of not using adverbs. ``Actions and what people say are
what's important.''
	   The key relationships are between males, and women just drift
through, perhaps spending the night. One takes her leave with the
remark, ``I'm not a fence post, you know.'' The narrator remarks:
``I wasn't sure what she meant by that.''
	   Mills volunteers that ``a woman once said that to me.'' Did the
relationship flourish? ``Just put 'He shrugged,' '' Mills says.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains dislodged a hillside in central
Mexico killing 12 people early Thursday, and two others died when a
swollen river swept away their truck, the Mexican Red Cross said.
	   The mudslide occurred in Tenextepango, a town in eastern Morelos
state about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Mexico City, Red
Cross radio operator Agustin Pineda said by telephone from the
Morelos capital, Cuernavaca. The victims included six children.
	   Rains forced the Ahuelhueyo River to overflow in the area.
Several homes were reported damaged and 120 people were left
homeless.
	   The Iztamatitlan River in northern Morelos state swelled
Thursday morning, sweeping a truck carrying three people. One
survived and the other two were killed, Pineda said.
	   A wide swath of Mexico has been inundated this week, with at
least 16 other people dying in mudslides and floods.
	   Eight people were killed in the eastern state of Puebla
Wednesday after heavy rainfall caused more than 50 mudslides, local
media reported Thursday.
	   Police in the western state of Jalisco said the bodies of a
father and son were found Wednesday. The two had been swept away by
currents while trying to cross the Gallinas River, about 45 miles
(70 kilometers) west of the state capital of Guadalajara.
	   At least five people died early Monday when a soaked hillside
gave way at the southern edge of Mexico City. A woman died in
Chiapas state when floodwaters swept away a taxi.
	   Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, killing at least
185 people and breaking apart the state's road and bridge system.
	   Mexico City remained on a state of alert Thursday and officials
were urging families to leave their wood and sheet-metal shacks
built illegally near rivers and on steep hillsides. Most people,
however, have refused to leave for fear that they will not be
allowed to return.
	   Television footage showed the water level at La Herradura dam in
Huixquilucan, just 6 miles (10 kilometers) outside Mexico City,
less than a yard (meter) below the dam's ridge Thursday.

Mandela cancels appointments, goes on vacation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ After suffering a bout of
exhaustion, President Nelson Mandela cancelled his appointments for
10 days and went on vacation, his office said Thursday.
	   The 80-year-old president was on holiday in Maputo, Mozambique,
his office said. Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, is from the
neighboring country.
	   He was expected back in Cape Town Oct. 11.
	   Fatigue caused Mandela to curtail activities while on a trip to
Canada last weekend. Doctors gave him a clean bill of health.

Volkswagen, Ford discuss ending joint venture at Portugal plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ German automaker Volkswagen AG and Ford
Motor Co., which own an assembly plant south of Lisbon in a 50-50
joint venture, said Thursday they were in negotiations for
Volkswagen to take over full ownership.
	   The dlrs 2.7 billion plant, known as AutoEuropa and located in
the town of Palmela, produces minivans which are marketed
independently by the parent companies.
	   The companies said in a brief statement that a change in
ownership ``will make it possible to take greater advantage of the
Palmela factory's production capacity.''
	   Officials of the two companies, contacted by telephone, declined
to comment further.
	   In 1997, AutoEuropa produced 131,000 minivans for VW, Ford and
VW's Spanish subsidiary SEAT. The vans are marketed as the Ford
Galaxy, VW Sharan and SEAT Alhambra in Europe and abroad.
	   The plant employs 5,000 people.

Flooding in Liberia drives 5,000 from their homes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Heavy rains has triggered flooding in
northwestern Liberia, where more than 5,000 people have fled their
homes to escape rising waters in recent weeks.
	   At least eight people have been killed in the floods and about
160 homes have been washed away, rescue workers were quoted as
saying in Thursday's Inquirer newspaper.
	   The worst of the flooding in Grand Capemount County, near the
border with Sierra Leone, has affected at least 20 villages, the
newspaper reported.
	   Grand Capemount County is still struggling to recover from
brutal civil war fighting that ended in 1995, but has periodically
flared up. Some of the worst fighting was centered in the
predominantly rural county.
	   ``We are in double trouble,'' said Tenneh Freeman, the mayor of
Robertsport City in Grand Capemount County. ``After years of
fighting, we are now facing natural disasters.''
	   In September, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said heavy rains throughout the Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea
region had halted the repatriation of tens of thousands of people
displaced by various conflicts in the area.
	   The UNHCR has repatriated about 80,000 of the 480,000 Liberians
who fled their country during the civil war. Many of the returning
refugees had moved to the Grand Capemount County area to resettle.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tauziat beating Davenport &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Nathalie Tauziat rallied to upset U.S.
Open champion Lindsay Davenport 4-6, 6-1, 7-5 at the Grand Slam Cup
on Thursday, preventing an all-American semifinal in the dlrs 6.7
million tournament.
	   The first American in action Thursday, Venus Williams, used her
overwhelming power to beat French Open champion Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario 6-3, 6-2 to set up a semifinal showdown with
Tauziat.
	   Tauziat, Wimbledon runner-up, overcame 12 double-faults and 37
unforced errors to beat Davenport, who is ranked No. 2 in the world
and who could take over the top spot next week.
	   Since losing to Tauziat in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon,
Davenport had won four tournaments, also beating the Frenchwoman on
the way to her U.S. Open title earlier this month.
	   Tauziat turned the match at the start of the second set when she
broke serve in the first game.
	   In the third, the two traded breaks throughout the set. Serving
for the match at 5-4, Tauziat saw Davenport rip a backhand passing
shot that made it 5-5.
	   But Davenport again dropped her serve, allowing Tauziat to serve
for the match for the second time. Davenport saved one match point
with a lob but Tauziat fired her sixth ace to advance.
	   Williams, 18, served hard on the fast indoor surface of Munich's
Olympiahalle and Sanchez-Vicario was unable to match the American's
powerful ground strokes.
	   Both players were inconsistent in the first set, Williams
dropping her serve twice and Sanchez-Vicario unable to hold three
times. A return by the Spaniard that went long gave Williams the
first set.
	   Williams broke serve for a decisive 3-2 lead in the second set
and gained another break to go up 5-2 after rallying from a 0-40
deficit by winning five straight points. She gained the break by
hitting an overhead smash.
	   The American served out the match in the next game, hitting a
perfect volley on her second match point.
	   ``I played well, but I didn't always capitalize on my
opportunities,'' Williams said.
	   Women are playing for the first time at the tournament that
brings together players with best records in the four Grand Slam
events of the year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and
Wimbledon.
	   Only one of the year's Grand Slam champions among the men is
here _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda.
	   But the eight women included all the champions and all the
top-ranked players except Monica Seles.
	   Three of the Grand Slam champions already have been eliminated _
Davenport, Sanchez-Vicario and Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion
who was ousted Wednesday by Patty Schnyder.
	   Top-ranked Martina Hingis, the Australian Open champion, plays
Schnyder, her Swiss teammate, in the other semifinal.
	   The tournament is the most lucrative per head in tennis, and
Williams and Tauziat earned dlrs 200,000 for reaching the
semifinals. Davenport and Sanchez-Vicario got dlrs 100,000.
	   Williams, ranked No. 5, has won the last three of her five
matches against Sanchez-Vicario. The American reached the
semifinals of the U.S. Open earlier this month by beating
Sanchez-Vicario and made the quarterfinals in the other three Grand
Slams.
	   Sanchez-Vicario won her fourth Grand Slam career title in Paris
this summer and is ranked No. 4 in the world.

Palestinians say new mobile homes are beginning of Jewish
</HEADLINE>
settlement &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EL DAVID, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian officials said Thursday
that eight new mobile homes set up in a remote area of the West
Bank, half a mile from the nearest community, is a new settlement
and a violation of peace accords.
	   Israel's military government in the West Bank said the trailers
stood on land belonging to the El David settlement which is located
on a hilltop about 800 meters, or half a mile, from the trailer
park.
	   Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to
halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build
new settlements but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu supports
expanding new settlements to accommodate what he terms ``natural
growth.''
	   The term is loosely defined and the Jewish settler movement
usually plants trailer homes on hilltops near older, existing
settlements, defines them as neighborhoods, and then slowly moves
in families to the new area.
	   Land is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Palestinians hope to create a future state on much of the West Bank
land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. But
successive Israeli government have encouraged Jewish settlement in
those areas and today some 150,000 Jewish settlers live throughout
the West Bank.
	   Khalil Tufakji, chief cartographer for Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority charged that the new trailers were the
beginning of a separate settlement and not part of El David.
	   ``It's a new location and new settlers will be there. This is a
violation of agreements,'' Tufakji told The Associated Press.
	   Peter Lerner, a spokesman for the military government, said the
trailers were set up with the approval of the Israel's defense
ministry and would not remain in the area permanently. The trailers
were set-up for a temporary period until a school can be renovated
in the El-David settlement, Lerner said.
	   ``Every settlement begins with a trailer. They put up a trailer
and then they start to build, I don't care what they call it,''
said Hagit Yaari, a spokeswoman for Israel's Peace Now movement,
which monitors settlement construction.
	   Noham Ochana, a youth counselor on the site, 15 youths live in
the trailers, which he said were brought in about six months ago by
a movement serving troubled teen-agers.

Bulgaria names squad for game against England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ New Bulgarian coach Dimitar Dimitrov on
Thursday named his team for next week's European qualifying game in
England, making several changes to a side that was humiliated 3-0
last month against Poland.
	   Center forward Lyuboslav Penev, who scored three goals for his
Spanish team Celta in Tuesday's UEFA Cup match, and Kaiserlautern's
midfielder Marian Hristov were both called back.
	   Dimitrov named 20 players, 11 of them based abroad including
star striker Hristo Stoichkov, who plays this season for Japan's
Kashiva Reysol.
	   Bulgaria faces England on Oct. 10 at and four days later
Bulgaria plays Sweden in Burgas, where the team suffered a
humiliating 3-0 loss to Poland last month.
	   ``I couldn't afford to do any experiments and call young players
in the team, because the games with England and Sweden are going to
be very tough and experience will be the major factor,'' said the
39-years-old Dimitrov.
	   The match at Wembley will be his debut as national team coach.
	   His predecessor Hristo Bonev, who resigned after the defeat
against Poland, kept players out of the team like Penev and
Hristov. In addition, one of best playmakers in the Bundesliga,
Krasimir Balakov of Stuttgart, refused to play for the national
team under Bonev.
	   The squad _ Goalkeepers: Zdravko Zdravkov (Istanbulspor),
Dimitar Ivankov (Levski Sofia);
	   Defenders: Radostin Kishishev (Liteks Lovech), Ivailo Petkov
(Istanbulspor), Zlatomir Zagorcic (Lietks), Ivailo Yordanov
(Sporting Lisbon), Vladimir Ivanov (Borussia), Valentin Naidenov
(CSKA Sofia);
	   Midfielders: Kostadin Vidolov (Istanbulspor), Ilia Gruev
(Neftochimik Burgas), Zlatko Yankov (Adanaspor Turkey), Mitko
Trendafilov (Neftochimik), Milen Petkov (CSKA Sofia), Daniel
Borimirov (Munich 1860), Georgi Balchev (Slavia Sofia), Ilian Iliev
(AEK Athens);
	   Forwards: Hristo Stoichkov (Kashiva Reysol), Lyuboslav Penev
(Celta), Marian Hristov (Kaiserslautern), Georgi Ivanov (Levski
Sofia).

Hungarian government and Jewish communities agree on compensation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The Hungarian government and the
Federation of Hungarian Jewish Communities signed an agreement
Thursday on collective compensation for communist-era
confiscations, the state news agency MTI reported.
	   The financial basis for the funding is real estate that belonged
to the Jewish communities and fell victim to nationalization under
the communists.
	   Instead of getting back the actual property _ 152 schools and
other buildings _ the assessed value of which is 13,511,000,000
forints (dlrs 63 million), the Jewish community collectively is to
get a percentage annually, starting with the current year, when 608
million forints (dlrs 2.9 million) will be paid.
	   ``The money will be mainly used for education, religious
services, social welfare, health service, and charity ends,''
Gusztav Zoltai, executive director of the Federation, said.
	   There are between 80,000 and 100,000 Jews in Hungary. Some
600,000 were killed in the Holocaust.
	   When the communists assumed full power in 1948, they started a
wave of nationalizations that spared no one, including the Jewish
community.
	   On June 20, 1997, a similar agreement, the first of its kind,
was signed between the Hungarian government and the Vatican.

Jordan calls on Israel to stop building in Jerusalem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Jordan's foreign minister called on Israel
Thursday to stop building housing for Jews in Jerusalem, and said
Iraq should no longer have to suffer under economic sanctions that
have also hurt his country.
	   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Abdul-Illah Khatib
said Jerusalem should ``remain open to all believers in God,'' and
he called on Israel to ``stop and reverse all actions that would
change the status of the holy city.''
	   Israel recently approved construction of 132 housing units for
Jews in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a future state
in east Jerusalem, land Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war and later annexed.
	   Khatib said Israel must live up to its commitments to the Arabs,
and accused it of impeding the peace process.
	   ``Citing security considerations as an excuse for preventing
real progress would lead to more deterioration in the security of
every party in the region,'' Khatib said. He said the Palestinian
people had the right to establish an independent homeland.
	   He also appealed for funds for the cash-strapped United Nations
Relief and Works Agency, which helps Palestinian refugees in the
Middle East.
	   ``The suspension of UNRWA's services to the Palestinian refugees
in the Middle East will, by itself, constitute an additional
obstacle to the peace process,'' Khatib said.
	   He said frustration caused by increasing poverty among the
refugees would be ``a cause of instability in the region.''
	   Khatib called on Iraq to implement all U.N. resolutions to bring
an end to sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   ``We call on the international community to relieve the
suffering of the Iraqi people,'' said Khatib.
	   Jordan, Iraq's neighbor and major trading partner, has been hit
hard by the sanctions.
	   ``Jordan was the first to suffer tremendous damage to its
economy as result of the sanctions imposed on Iraq,'' Khatib said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A former aide to Saddam Hussein's oldest son has
defected to the West, telling tales of murder, torture, smuggling
and corruption in Baghdad's ruling circle.
	   Abbas al-Janabi, formerly the personal secretary to Odai
Hussein, said in an interview Thursday with The Associated Press
that he watched his boss kill four men and torture others.
	   Al-Janabi, who defected last spring and is living in hiding in
Europe, also witnessed the battle in which Saddam's two sons-in-law
were gunned down after they returned to Iraq following their
defection to Jordan in 1995.
	   ``It was a massacre,'' he said of the killing of the brothers
Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel al-Majid and Lt. Col. Saddam Kamel al-Majid,
who had been key figures in Saddam's security team.
	   The two were lured back to Baghdad with promises of clemency.
But Saddam summoned them to one of his palaces and demanded they
sign documents divorcing his daughters. When they refused, one of
the relatives present threatened to shoot the two brothers. Saddam
intervened, and said they should have two days to consider.
	   During the night, however, Odai and other members of the family
surrounded the house were Hussein Kamel was staying and opened
fire, said al-Janabi, providing the most detailed eyewitness
account to date of the incident.
	   Hussein Kamel was wounded during an ensuing 13-hour gunfight and
staggered out of the house, carrying a gun in each hand, he said.
	   As Odai looked on, his gunmen riddled Kamel's body with bullets,
continuing to fire after he fell to the ground dead, al-Janabi
said.
	   ``When he was lying in a lake of blood, they spat on him,''
al-Janabi said.
	   Al-Janabi, 50, worked for the Iraqi national news agency and was
later appointed editor of the daily newspaper Babel. He lives in
hiding, to prevent reprisals from the Hussein family.
	   Saddam, a member of the al-Tikriti clan, has ruled Iraq since
1979 with help from members of his extended family.
	   That rule was dealt a blow this week with news that Saddam's
half-brother, Barzan al-Tikriti, had refused a summons back to
Baghdad from his post as Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations in
Switzerland.
	   ``Barzan has always had differences with Saddam,'' al-Janabi
said. ``Barzan knows his destiny if he goes back to Baghdad.''
	   Odai married Barzan's daughter, Saja ``but neglected her and
kept her for three months in Baghdad,'' al-Janabi said. She then
fled to Geneva, where she remained with her father.
	   Odai, who survived an assassination attempt in 1996, became
``more wicked, more cruel'' after he was wounded, he said.
	   Always promiscuous, he continued after the shooting to engage in
sex with as many as four different women a day, and has been known
to have intercourse with girls as young as 11, al-Janabi said.
	   Al-Janabi said he watched Odai kill four men, and that he
himself was beaten by his bosses' bodyguards, in the first instance
to force him to work for the strongman's son, and later to enforce
loyalty.
	   In one gruesome incident, Odai engineered the death of an
associate, Mohammed Quaragholli, who had criticized him to a
friend, al-Janabi said.
	   ``Odai ordered his bodyguards to force him to drink three
bottles of'' a strong Iraqi liquor, he said. ``Mohammed lost
consciousness,'' and the bodyguards put him on a merry-go-round
horse at a Baghdad amusement park. The victim toppled from the
horse, and died when a steel spike pierced his head, he said.
	   The Hussein family also runs a lucrative smuggling trade,
selling international humanitarian aid sent to Iraq, and illegally
exporting millions of dollars of oil, despite a United Nations
embargo, said al-Janabi, who explained that he was directly
involved in the activities.

Wall Street extends losses as world markets plunge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE Dow, which was briefly down 201,

managing director of IMF on stock markets and report on
manufacturing economy in the United States. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks fell further on Wall Street on Thursday,
extending a global selling spree amid worries of lower corporate
profits and fears of new financial crises.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which tumbled 237.90 points on
Wednesday, fell an additional 201.60 Thursday morning before
recovering a bit of lost ground. The average was down 140.83 at
7,701.79 in active trading by early afternoon.
	   The Dow's 12.4 percent slide in the third quarter, which ended
Wednesday, was its worst quarterly performance in eight years. The
blue-chip average started the day down 65.63 points from where it
began this year and almost 1,500 points, or 16 percent, from its
July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   Broader market indicators also were losing more ground today.
	   Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo shares falling
1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares were falling sharply
in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rates
unchanged.
	   Blue chips in London sank 3.1 percent to close at new lows for
the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed down
5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris was off 5 percent.
	   The selloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into U.S.
Treasury securities, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty.
Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell further below 5 percent
today, reaching levels unseen for long-term government bonds since
1967.
	   Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock
Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on Wednesday, even though the Federal
Reserve had lowered a key interest rate one-quarter percentage
point on Tuesday. Some traders were disappointed that the cut was
not deeper amid fears a go-slow approach would not do enough to
counter the economic crises that have swept through Asia and Russia
and are threatening Latin America.
	   ``The smaller-than-expected lowering of interest rates by the
U.S. Federal Reserve has a chain reaction,'' said Lee Won-ho, an
analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul, South Korea, where the
main stock index fell by 1.5 percent today. ``It is affecting Wall
Street, the Japanese market, ours and others.''
	   The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel
Camdessus, today said the Fed made the right decision in cutting
rates and that global powers now must push for stronger growth to
offset steep recessions in Asia and Russia.
	   Asked why stock markets, particularly in the United States, have
reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut, Camdessus said he
believed confidence will soon be restored, especially if financial
leaders show resolve in their discussions over the next week.
	   There also are worries about where the next financial market
crisis may erupt after last week's dlrs 3.6 billion private bailout
of Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut.
	   In addition, investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall
Street could signal a possible slowdown in economic growth _ a bad
omen for the many foreign companies dependent on exports to the
huge U.S. market.
	   ``There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a
direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high
percentage of their earnings from overseas markets,'' said Pelham
Smithers, a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd.
	   A new survey in Japan said confidence among small- and
medium-sized businesses about the economy plunged to its worst
level since the Bank of Japan began the quarterly samplings in
1967.
	   In addition, a group of U.S. factory executives, in the first
broad reading from September, reported that the manufacturing
sector slowed for a the fourth straight month as global economic
problems continued to hurt U.S. exporters. On a more positive note,
however, the decline last month in the National Association of
Purchasing Managers index was smaller than expected.

Communist leader hints he will vote against budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS throughout to UDPATE with Prodi acknowledging risk of
crisis, saying Italy would lose credibility if government
collapses. CORRECTS ``resolved'' to ``dissolved'' in 9th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By VANIA GRANDI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hard-line Communist leader suggested
Thursday that his party would vote against the 1999 budget, a move
that could bring down Premier Romano Prodi's center-left
government.
	   ``Among Communist Refoundation's members throughout the country,
negative judgments clearly prevail,'' Fausto Bertinotti said at a
gathering of foreign correspondents.
	   Bertinotti renewed his complaint that the budget proposal does
not include strong enough measures to stimulate job creation,
especially in Italy's depressed south, where the unemployment rate
is more than 20 percent.
	   However, he said Refoundation will make a final decision on how
to vote during a national congress over the weekend.
	   Refoundation is not formally part of the government but Prodi
relies on its votes for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies.
Bertinotti's hard-line tactics have twice pushed the government to
the brink of collapse.
	   ``There is a concrete risk of a government crisis,'' said Prodi.
``But I must go to Parliament with this budget and call on my
majority.''
	   A ``no'' vote from Refoundation would cause any number of
shake-ups, including Prodi's resignation, the formation of a new
government or early elections.
	   The premier warned that Italy would lose credibility abroad if
the government falls.
	   ``Italy would be seen as a country that is not solid, whereas I
have based the actions of this government on stability.''
	   Bertinotti said he doubted early elections would be called
because it was too close to the so-called ``white semester,'' the
last six weeks of President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's term, during
which Parliament cannot be dissolved.
	   The leader of a small opposition party, former President
Francesco Cossiga, has said he will bail out Prodi on the budget if
necessary, but said the premier must resign in return.
	   Prodi's coalition, at two years and five months, has outlived
all but two of Italy's other 54 postwar governments.
	   The budget, designed to keep Italy in line with the requirements
for the common European currency, calls for dlrs 8 billion (13.5
trillion lire) in deficit-cutting measures. Italy is a charter
member of the currency club.

Head of Italy's anti-doping lab fired
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The chief of the Italian Olympic Committee's
drug-testing laboratory was fired Thursday over the alleged
cover-up of positive doping tests in soccer.
	   At an emergency session, the Italian Olympic Committee's (CONI)
ruling body dismissed the official, Emilio Gasbarrone, as secretary
general of the medical commission.
	   Gasbarrone had been in charge of the Acqua Acetosa lab, which
carries out tests for banned performance-enhancing drugs, since
1988.
	   Investigators looking into charges of doping in Italian League
soccer have reportedly discovered that some tests were not fully
carried out.
	   In addition, documentation on anti-doping tests was being
discarded after two months, while CONI requires that it be kept at
least two years, five in the case of positive tests, a CONI
spokesman said.
	   The scandal could jeopardize the status of the Acqua Acetosa
lab, which is accredited by the International Olympic Committee.
	   The scandal widened Wednesday when Italy's leading newspaper,
Corriere della Sera, reported that a positive test turned in by a
player after the Udinese-Roma Serie A game played in January 1998
was covered up.
	   According to the report, a chemist from the Acqua Acetosa lab
has told prosecutors that his superior ordered him to alter a test
result. Other media reported that the test was in fact from a game
between those clubs in 1997.
	   Also Thursday, Mario Pescante reiterated his intention to step
down as CONI president, saying the scandal ``will conclude in short
time. There will be people found responsible and someone will pay.
For the good of sport it is good if all this ends in the shortest
time possible.''
	   One possible successor apparently could be world track and field
chief Primo Nebiolo.
	   ``If they ask me to be a candidate, I will not refuse,'' said
the 75-year-old president of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation.
	   ``The situation is very, very sad,'' he said. ``CONI is going
through an ugly period and Italian sport is drowning in certain
problems that it should not have created for itself. ... The system
has become a little old. It could use some renovation.''

Government considers Soviet-style economic plan

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov warned Thursday
that he might have to take ``unpopular measures'' to salvage the
Russian economy if the International Monetary Fund doesn't come
through with more money.
	   Primakov didn't specify what measures he had in mind, but the
warning came as the government was reported to be considering an
economic plan that is heavy with Soviet-style controls on the
economy.
	   The prime minister did take pains to reassure the country that
the government has no intention of taking U.S. dollars out of its
citizens' wallets. A leading regional official had proposed a
crackdown on greenbacks as a way to stabilize the ruble.
	   Such talk ``isn't worth an eggshell,'' Primakov told reporters.
	   But he reserved his sharpest language for the IMF. Russia has
been trying to pressure the lending agency into releasing the
second, dlrs 4.3 billion installment of a loan that was approved in
July, before the country's economy crashed and the government
effectively defaulted on its foreign loans.
	   The IMF credit would allow Russia to come out of the crisis
``with minimum losses,'' he said. Without the loan, he added
ominously, ``We will take measures _ measures that may be quite
unpopular. We will not throw our country to the winds.''
	   IMF officials have said they want the Russian government to come
up with a sound economic program before the loan is given, and have
made it clear that currency controls and boosting money supply are
not acceptable options. Both are reportedly under consideration by
the new government.
	   Primakov said the IMF should ``remember that we have followed
its advice to this day. ... Now our country has found itself in a
difficult position.''
	   The respected business newspaper Kommersant published a proposed
government blueprint for coping with the economic crisis. It calls
for an ambitious spending program, including compensation to the
poor for steep price rises and generous subsidies to stagnant
Russian industries.
	   It gives no clue as to where the money would come from. The
newspaper said the obvious answer would be the generous printing of
new money, which would increase inflation.
	   The plan, drafted by a group of leading Soviet-era economists,
also calls for the nationalization of some Russian commercial
banks, using their assets to provide credits to industries.
	   Primakov said on national television that the plan reported in
Kommersant is purely preliminary. ``It's just one of six versions
under consideration,'' he said, and chastised reporters for
spreading ``speculations.''
	   He said a government delegation would fly to the United States
on Friday for talks with the IMF.
	   The idea of cracking down on American dollars surfaced during a
meeting between President Boris Yeltsin and Gov. Eduard Rossel of
the Urals region of Sverdlovsk. The two men discussed Rossel's plan
for a ruble backed by gold reserves, coupled with a ban on foreign
currency circulation.
	   The Russian government has allowed the U.S. dollar and other
foreign currencies to circulate freely since the 1991 collapse of
the Soviet Union, and Russia now has more dollars in its economy
than any country outside the United States, according to U.S.
officials.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, denied reports that the
president agreed with Rossel, saying he ``did not support the idea
of banning the free use of the dollar on Russian territory,''
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   The ruble remained stable Thursday at about 16 to the dollar.
The Russian stock market plunged again, dropping 6 percent on
minimal volume of dlrs 655,000.

Lawyer seeks probe into alleged Mossad hand in custody death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian lawyer Thursday asked Egypt's
prosecutor general to investigate whether Israel's Mossad
assassinated the imprisoned leader of a group that targeted Israeli
diplomats in the 1980s.
	   The lawyer, Mohammed Shukri Abdel-Fatah, claims that Mahmoud
Noureddin Soleiman's death strongly resembles the botched
assassination attempt on Hamas political leader Khaled Mashaal by
the Mossad in Jordan last year, a police official said.
	   Soleiman, the leader of the defunct Arab nationalist group,
Egypt's Revolution, died two weeks ago in Torah prison of brain
fever caused by severe flu.
	   He was serving a life sentence for leading the group, which
carried out at least four attacks in Egypt between 1984 and 1987
that left two Israelis dead and two Israelis and six Americans
injured.
	   In a complaint to Prosecutor General Ragaa el-Arabi, Abdel-Fatah
says the Mossad may have assassinated Soleiman to avenge the
slayings of the Israelis.
	   In one incident, a diplomat was killed on his way to work in
1985, and in 1986 the wife of an Israeli diplomat was killed when
her car was ambushed outside a trade fair in Cairo.
	   Abdel-Fatah asked el-Arabi to launch a full-scale investigation
into Soleiman's death, using the ``latest equipment and
technology'' to determine Mossad's role, said the police official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The prosecutor general, the government's chief lawyer, must
decide whether the complaint merits an investigation. There is no
indication when he will announce his decision.
	   Abdel-Fatah says the prison doctor's reports indicate that
Soleiman died of fever and brain hemorrhage caused by a virus that
could have been injected into him by a Mossad operative, said the
police official.
	   Abdel-Fatah, a respected attorney, did not say how Mossad agents
could have gained entry into the prison.
	   The official said Andel-Fatah is implying that Mossad used the
same technique that it used on Mashaal, the political leader of the
radical Palestinian group Hamas who was injected with a poison by
two Mossad operatives.
	   The agents were caught by Jordanian police and released only
after Israel provided the antidote and freed Hamas' spiritual
leader, Sheik Yassin.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that Washington will be
wasting money and effort if it tries to topple President Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   The Iraqi Parliament said in a statement that it ``strongly
denounces'' moves by the U.S. Congress to provide nearly dlrs 100
million in military aid to Iraqi opposition groups.
	   On Tuesday, key U.S. Republicans introduced bills that would
authorize President Bill Clinton to give dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
rebels and dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq, set up under earlier
legislation.
	   The aim of the radio station, which is scheduled to go on air
Oct. 15 from Prague, Czech Republic, is to broadcast pro-democracy
programs and objective news about Iraq.
	   The Clinton administration has not responded to the funding
proposal circulated by Republican congressmen that would, in
effect, openly commit the United States to overthrow the regime.
	   ``The representatives of the Iraqi people strongly condemn the
persistence of American Congress to interfere in the domestic
affairs of our land,'' said the 250-member Iraqi Parliament in the
statement which was carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.

Former Swiss banker given 4-year sentence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Zurich court on Thursday sentenced
a former Swiss private banker, deported from Thailand last year, to
four years in prison on charges of embezzlement and other crimes.
	   Juerg Heer was sentenced for the embezzlement of 55 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 40.4 million at current rates) during his time
as credit manager at Bank Rothschild AG Zurich.
	   He was also fined 10,000 francs (dlrs 7,350) for violating bank
secrecy, blackmailing three former bank clients, and using several
forged passports during his five years on the run.
	   Heer, 63, took the money from the bank between 1986 and 1992,
when he was dismissed for suspected irregularities and then
arrested.
	   He allegedly used the money to finance a lavish lifestyle,
accumulating cars, art and furniture worth 20 million francs (dlrs
14 million).
	   Heer fled Switzerland in 1992 after authorities provisionally
released him from jail and was arrested in Thailand in October,
1997.
	   He has been detained in Switzerland since being deported from
Thailand last December.
	   Zurich district court also ordered him to pay 30,000 francs
(dlrs 22,000) in court fees, in addition to paying legal costs.
	   Heer's attorney, Valentin Landmann, said his client accepted the
sentence and wouldn't appeal. The time Heer has already spent in
detention will be counted as part of his jail term.
	   After the Heer fiasco, Bank Rothschild was forced into a
management shakeup and had to arrange for a capital injection. It
alleged that the total damages caused by Heer's transactions
amounted to 271 million francs (dlrs 186 million).

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Arsonists trying to destroy tax documents set fire
to a regional tax center in central Russia, but the flames were
extinguished before the papers burned, a news agency said Thursday
	   The offenders threw a bottle containing a flammable substance
into the building in the Ulyanovsk region, 1,000 kilometers (600
miles) east of Moscow, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The building caught fire, but a night watchman beat down the
flames and saved the documents, it said.
	   No one was injured and the building suffered only minor damage,
it said, quoting the local tax inspectorate.

Politicians struggle with deadlock over IRA weapons

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Arch-rival politicians David
Trimble and Gerry Adams on Thursday failed to resolve their
confrontation over whether IRA disarmament is required now to make
the Belfast peace accord work.
	   Their argument is endangering the formation of a multi-party
administration for Northern Ireland, the intended bedrock of
April's peace agreement.
	   After a sometimes combative 75-minute meeting, Trimble insisted
that the Irish Republican Army must start disarming before Adams'
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party could join any administration, even
though the agreement isn't specific on that point.
	   ``There is no scope for interpretation on this matter,''
asserted Trimble, who as Ulster Unionist Party leader is chief
representative of the north's British Protestant majority.
	   Referring to the pledge of office that Sinn Fein representatives
would have to take, Trimble said: ``A person cannot credibly say
they are `committed to exclusively peaceful means' when they are
maintaining a private army and a hoard of illegal weapons, and
refusing to address the issue.''
	   Adams accused Trimble of allowing his many harder-line
Protestant critics to retard the push for progress.
	   ``No one should give cover to those who are out to wreck this
agreement by putting up obstacles and preconditions,'' said Adams,
who has resisted calls for IRA disarmament for four years.
	   The agreement said the IRA and the province's pro-British
paramilitary groups _ which have insufficient political support to
merit representation in the administration _ should disarm under
international supervision by May 2000. But it set no deadline for
that process to start.
	   In the Irish Republic's capital of Dublin, the moderate Catholic
politician charged with forming the administration alongside
Trimble predicted the Trimble-Adams stalemate would be defused.
	   ``Does anybody imagine that this agreement is going to be
allowed to collapse on this single issue?'' said Seamus Mallon,
whose Social Democratic and Labor Party is Sinn Fein's larger rival
for Catholic votes in Northern Ireland.
	   ``This matter will be resolved. It may not be resolved to the
liking of Mr. Trimble, or to the liking of Mr. Adams. But resolved
it will be,'' Mallon said outside the offices of Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern.
	   SDLP leader John Hume and Mallon, the party's deputy leader, had
discussed with Ahern what kind of compromise would allow Trimble to
endorse Sinn Fein's place in government.
	   All sides are under pressure to meet one of the few symbolically
important deadlines contained in the agreement. It specified that
the new Northern Ireland leadership, whether fully appointed or
not, should hold a summit with the Irish government by Oct. 31.
	   The administration, which could have up to 12 members, is to be
drawn from a 108-member legislative Assembly, which Northern
Ireland voters elected in June.

Latvia's stateless Russians uneasily eye citizenship referendum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL TARM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ For many of Latvia's ethnic Russians, seven
years of independence has been seven years in the wilderness, and
they fear an upcoming national referendum will leave them there.
	   With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, most of Latvia's
ethnic Russians _ about 45 percent of the country's residents _
became stateless: citizens of a vanished country, and facing high
obstacles in becoming citizens of the new land.
	   The Saturday referendum asks Latvian voters if they want to
approve measures that would lower the obstacles for ethnic Russians
seeking citizenship. But with nationalist sentiment high, few
expect the measures to pass.
	   ``We Russians have long understood that we're not really wanted
here,'' said Lena, 70, who sat in the park with her granddaughter
and refused to give her last name. ``But this referendum will drive
that message home.''
	   After the Soviet Union forcibly annexed Latvia in 1940, hundreds
of thousands of ethnic Russians poured in, most of them sent under
Josef Stalin's drive to ``russify'' Soviet lands. Many lived in
communities that were entirely Russian-speaking.
	   The influx was so large that today, only 52 percent of the
people in this country of 2.5 million are ethnic Latvians. The
waves of Russians were deeply resented by Latvians, and critics say
the country's citizenship laws have no rationale but sheer spite.
	   Under the so-called ``windows'' system, the older an ethnic
Russian is, the longer he has to wait to apply for citizenship; the
oldest would have to wait until 2003. Most Russians believe the
provision punishes those in the vast first wave of russification.
	   Children born of stateless parents even after Latvian
independence are not granted citizenship _ even if they've never
set foot outside the country and speak no language but Latvian.
	   The laws have been sharply criticized by the West and have
sparked denunciations and threats of economic retaliation from
Russia. As tensions with Russia escalated this spring, the
parliament eliminated the windows system and granted citizenship to
children born in Latvia since independence. But Latvian
nationalists forced the issue to a referendum.
	   Among the nationalists is Prime Minister Guntars Krasts. He
believes the current laws are reasonable and that granting
citizenship to children don't speak Latvian is going too far.
	   ``With these amendments, our citizenship laws would be some of
the most liberal in the world and certainly the most liberal in
Europe,'' he said in an interview.
	   Many have said that rejecting the citizenship amendments would
torpedo Latvia's cherished goal of joining the European Union, but
Krasts dismisses the argument.
	   Saudina Skaidite, selling flowers in the shadow of Riga's
towering independence monument, sees it the same way.
	   ``If a person wants to be Latvian, then that person should speak
Latvian,'' she said. ``Why should the outside world not see that as
reasonable?''
	   Resentment may be high, but outward signs of it are low. Most
ethnic Russians say their day-to-day contact with Latvians is
friendly. Store clerks may start a transaction in Latvian, but
switch into Russian without raising an eyebrow. Intermarriage is
common.
	   But Russians without citizenship complain bitterly about having
to apply and reapply for resident permits, alien passports, and
other documents. They resent standing in long lines and trying to
reason with stone-faced bureaucrats.
	   ``These offices are the main contacts Russians have with the
Latvian state, and it has created a very negative image among
Russians,'' said 31-year-old Alex Krasnitsky, an ethnic Russian
journalist born in Latvia. ``Russians have been very offended,
humiliated by it all.''
	   But ethnic Russian Konstantin Kazakov, 25, said not having
citizenship doesn't bother him.
	   ``Unfortunately you can't get Latvian citizenship and not serve
in the Latvian army,'' said Kazakov. ``I'll get my Latvian
citizenship in a few years, when I'm too old to be drafted.''
	   Unlike Kazakov, some 60 percent of Russian-speakers in Latvia
speak little or no Latvian, and so aren't in a position to chose to
take citizenship.
	   Out of 200,000 Russian-speakers who have a right to at least
apply for citizenship, fewer than 20,000 have even bothered and
only 10,000 have been naturalized.
	   Despite the problems, many Russians here are grateful to be in
Latvia _ under whatever circumstances _ and avoid Russia's current
economic chaos.
	   ``We see what's happening in Russia, and it's a mess,'' said
20-year-old Alina Zemerova, an economics student. ``I'm very happy
to tie my future to this country.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday that Washington will be
wasting money and effort if it tries to topple President Saddam
Hussein's regime.
	   The Iraqi Parliament said in a statement that it ``strongly
denounces'' moves by the U.S. Congress to provide nearly dlrs 100
million in military aid to Iraqi opposition groups.
	   On Tuesday, key U.S. Republicans introduced bills that would
authorize President Bill Clinton to give dlrs 97 million to Iraqi
rebels and dlrs 2 million to Radio Free Iraq, set up under earlier
legislation.
	   The aim of the radio station, scheduled to go on air Oct. 15 is
to broadcast prodemocracy programs and news about Iraq from its
base in Prague, Czech Republic.
	   The Clinton administration has not responded to the funding
proposal circulated by Republican congressmen that would, in
effect, openly commit the United States to overthrow the regime.
	   ``The representatives of the Iraqi people strongly condemn the
persistence of American Congress to interfere in the domestic
affairs of our land,'' said the 250-member Iraqi Parliament in the
statement which was carried by the official Iraqi News Agency.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Britain's U.N. ambassador said Thursday he
had received clear support from members of the Security Council for
a strong condemnation of a massacre of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
	   The Security Council was holding an emergency meeting Thursday,
beginning at 4:30 p.m. (2030 GMT), and was expected to issue a
press statement condemning the weekend slaughter of civilians in
the forests around Obrija.
	   The statement would also call on Belgrade to identify and punish
those responsible and request the U.N. tribunal for Yugoslavia to
widen its mandate to include these crimes, a diplomatic source
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The council would also demand immediate compliance with its
previous resolution urging a cease-fire and call on the U.N. chief
to issue his report on Kosovo by Monday, several days early.
	   Council president Jeremy Greenstock of Britain said Thursday
morning that he had received ``clear word from council members that
they want a strong condemnation of the recent atrocities on the
ground in Kosovo.''

Japan to be `oldest' country in year 2020, U.N. says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Japan and Italy will lead the world's trend toward
an increasingly older population during the next two decades, the
U.N. health agency predicted Thursday.
	   Life expectancy around the globe has been increasing steadily,
reaching 62 years in developing countries in 1990, said the World
Health Organization.
	   By the year 2020 there will be more than 1 billion people 60
years or older in the world, nearly double the current number, WHO
said.
	   The ``oldest'' countries that year will be Japan and Italy, each
with 31 percent of their populations at least 60, it said. They
will be followed by Greece, Switzerland and Finland at 28 percent.
	   The agency said Greece and Italy are the current leaders, at 23
percent, followed by Germany, Japan and Sweden at 22 percent.
	   Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO director-general, said ``the greatest
challenge of the 21st century will be to improve the quality of
life as well as age.''

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Reports of massacres of ethnic
Albanian civilians in the embattled province of Kosovo have
heightened the likelihood of NATO airstrikes against military
targets in Yugoslavia.
	   Trying to deflect international criticism, the Serb-run Media
Center, which reflects official views, on Thursday announced a
withdrawal of combat forces from areas of conflict in the Serbian
province.
	   ``Only police units needed to preserve public security and order
and guard communications are out in the field,'' it said. There was
no immediate confirmation from international observer forces in the
province. But Serbia had promised a withdrawal of combat units on
Monday.
	   Heavy fighting along the Albanian border, meanwhile, killed six
Serb soldiers and wounded seven on Wednesday, the Yugoslav army
said Thursday _ fueling concern the Kosovo conflict could spill
over into a regional conflict.
	   International efforts to halt the bloodshed took on new urgency
after the reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia where nine out of 10 people are ethnic
Albanians. Hundreds have been killed since Serbs began cracking
down on Albanian separatists in the province in February.
	   In the latest allegation, the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo
Information Center said the bodies of 12 males _ including a
15-year-old boy _ were discovered Thursday in the Suva Reka region,
about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. The report
could not be confirmed, and it was not known whether the victims _
most of them men of fighting age _ were armed.
	   However, it came just days after diplomats, journalists and
human rights workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies, including
those of women and children, killed last weekend in Obrija in the
Drenica region. On Wednesday, residents of nearby Golubovac said at
least 13 men were killed in another alleged massacre.
	   The U.N. Security Council was to hold an emergency meeting
Thursday after British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook called on the
council to condemn the Obrija massacre.
	   ``We don't want to use force,'' said Cook, addressing the annual
conference of the governing Labor Party in Britain. ``But today I
warn (Serb) President Slobodan Milosevic that if it will take
force, Britain is ready to back force.''
	   NATO's top decision-making body also took another step Thursday
to prepare air strikes against Serb forces. NATO diplomats said the
North Atlantic Council approved an ``activation request'' for the
16 allied nations to formally commit war planes and other forces
for an eventual air campaign.
	   However, the council, made up of ambassadors from the allied
nations, came no closer to a political decision to launch air raids
and failed to overcome differences over whether the alliance needs
a clearer mandate from the United Nations before it can attack.

Netanyahu: U.S. has not agreed to release spy Pollard
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES Netanyahu statement, UPDATES with McCurry statement.
Minor edits throughout. No Pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday
he discussed the fate of Jonathan Pollard during his visit this
week to the United States but no decision was made about a possible
release of the American jailed 13 years ago for spying for Israel.
	   Netanyahu, who made the comments in a Cabinet meeting, did not
say in the Thursday statement whether he discussed the Pollard case
with President Bill Clinton or other officials.
	   The daily Yediot Ahronot reported earlier Thursday that during
discussions with Netanyahu, Clinton agreed to free Pollard, who is
serving a life sentence for passing secret U.S. military documents
to Israel.
	   However, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said, ``I
strongly doubt that the issue arose'' in the meeting between
Clinton and Netanyahu.
	   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the president and Netanyahu did not discuss the
issue of Pollard's release. The official said granting early
release to Pollard would be met by strong opposition within the
U.S. government.
	   A statement released after a meeting of Netanyahu's Cabinet said
the prime minister told his ministers that no decision was made
when the Pollard issue was raised during his U.S. visit.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, was arrested
in 1985 outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington. While on the run
from U.S. authorities, Pollard sought refuge at the embassy but was
refused entry.
	   Until recently, Israeli governments disavowed Pollard and called
his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison.

Mudslide kills 12 in central Mexico

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Heavy rains dislodged a hillside in central
Mexico killing 12 people early Thursday, and two others died when a
swollen river swept away their truck, the Mexican Red Cross said.
	   The mudslide occurred in Tenextepango, a town in eastern Morelos
state about 40 miles (60 kilometers) south of Mexico City, Red
Cross radio operator Agustin Pineda said by telephone from the
Morelos capital, Cuernavaca. The victims included six children.
	   Rains forced the Ahuelhueyo River to overflow in the area.
Several homes were reported damaged and 120 people were left
homeless.
	   The Iztamatitlan River in northern Morelos state swelled
Thursday morning, sweeping away a truck carrying three people. One
survived and the other two were killed, Pineda said.
	   A wide swath of Mexico has been inundated this week, with at
least 16 other people dying in mudslides and floods.
	   Eight people were killed Wednesday in the eastern state of
Puebla after heavy rainfall caused more than 50 mudslides, local
media reported Thursday.
	   Police in the western state of Jalisco said the bodies of a
father and son were found Wednesday. The two had been swept away by
currents while trying to cross the Gallinas River, about 45 miles
(70 kilometers) west of the state capital of Guadalajara.
	   At least five people died early Monday when a soaked hillside
gave way at the southern edge of Mexico City. A woman died in
Chiapas state when floodwaters swept away a taxi.
	   Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, killing at least
185 people and breaking apart the state's road and bridge system.
	   Mexico City remained on a state of alert Thursday and officials
were urging families to leave their wood and sheet-metal shacks
built illegally near rivers and on steep hillsides. Most people,
however, have refused to leave for fear that they will not be
allowed to return.
	   Television footage showed the water level at La Herradura dam in
Huixquilucan, just 6 miles (10 kilometers) outside Mexico City,
less than a yard (meter) below the dam's ridge Thursday.

World Bank head expresses concern over Anwar Ibrahim's detention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Malaysia-Politics-Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ World Bank President James Wolfensohn said
Thursday he was troubled by photographs showing Malaysia's ousted
deputy prime minister arriving in court with an apparent black eye.
	   He said the official, Anwar Ibrahim, was to have played an
important role at the annual meetings of the bank and the
International Monetary Fund now underway as chairman of a 24-nation
committee represents the interests of developing nations.
	   Speaking in a personal capacity, Wolfensohn called Anwar ``a
friend who had a real position in our group. I hope the world keeps
an eye on him and he gets a chance to state his case.''
	   Wolfensohn said he was ``deeply concerned and saddened'' by
Anwar's arrest and would monitor developments in his case.
	   The 51-year old politician was held in high regard by his
counterparts, bank and IMF officials as a forward-looking Muslim
intellectual who believed in free markets.
	   Anwar was fired last month by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and charged with five counts of sodomy and five counts of
corruption, mostly related to the sex charges. He has pleaded
innocent and his trial is expected to start soon.
	   Anwar has contended the charges are politically motivated. After
his dismissal Sept. 2, he had led a campaign demanding reforms by
the prime minister who has ruled for 17 years. His arrest Sept. 20
has triggered regular street protests in Kuala Lumpur demanding
Mahathir's resignation.
	   On Tuesday, with a bruised face, Anwar told a court in the
capital
	   he was beaten until he fell unconscious on his first night in
detention. Police said they would investigate, but Mahathir said
Anwar may have inflicted the injury himself to gain public
sympathy.
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said Wednesday, ``We are
deeply concerned as well by reports of police brutality during the
incarceration of Anwar.''

Butler tells ex-inspector he violated contract by speaking to
</HEADLINE>
press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector for Iraq
has chastised a former U.S. arms expert for making public
confidential information about Iraq's weapons capabilities, a
spokesman said Thursday.
	   Richard Butler wrote a letter to the former U.S. Marine, Scott
Ritter, telling him he was in violation of his U.N. contract, the
spokesman said.
	   Spokesman Fred Eckhard said he didn't know what the punishment
for violating the contract was, but he noted jokingly that the
United Nations doesn't have a prison.
	   Since he resigned Aug. 26, Ritter has spoken out publicly
several times on Iraq's weapons programs and on what he said was
the failure of the United States and Britain to back up their
stated claims of wanting to disarm Baghdad.
	   This week, he told the Israeli daily Haaretz that he had sought
and received Israel's help in tracking down Iraq's non-conventional
arms program.
	   The Washington Post, citing unidentified sources, said Israel
described trucks and depots used by Iraq in moving and hiding
forbidden materials. Israel also told the inspector that 40 tons of
a biological growth medium sold to Iraq by a British company were
not accounted for, the Post said.
	   The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in
1990, and has said it will not lift them until Baghdad eliminates
its weapons of mass destruction.

Serbia invites Finnish forensic experts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb-led Yugoslavia invited Thursday
a team of Finnish forensic experts to help investigate alleged
torture and killings of civilians in Kosovo.
	   Belgrade's state-run Tanjug news agency reported that Yugoslav
forensic experts invited ``prominent'' colleagues from Helsinki to
join Yugoslav teams already working in Kosovo.
	   The invitation was sent through the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry,
said Tanjug.
	   International officials often have demanded that Yugoslavia
allow an independent investigation into alleged crimes in Kosovo,
but the request was rejected in the past. The announcement Thursday
could be an attempt to soften rising international pressure.

Report documents illegal sterilization of handicapped men, women
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: raises reference to other countries where forced
sterilizations discovered, CLARIFIES in 5th that not all data made
available by clinics, 22,000 figure in 6th includes procedures
resulting in sterility &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 225 physically or mentally handicapped
patients in state-run care facilities were sterilized without their
consent between 1995 and 1996, according to a government report
released Thursday.
	   The report, commissioned last year by the Social Affairs
ministry, was in response to allegations of widespread and
systematic sterilizations.
	   It was the latest case in Europe of state-sponsored involuntary
sterilizations. In 1997, reports surfaced in Denmark, Finland and
Sweden of similar practices involving tens of thousands of people.
ion over the two-year period, 423 vasectomies were
performed in total, with 15 of them on handicapped men.
	   Some 10,453 sterilizations were performed in total on women _
and 211 of them were handicapped. About 25 percent of the retarded
women were under 25. Not all medical facilities made data
available.
	   About 22,000 sterilizations are performed yearly in France, the
report said. That figure, however, includes surgical procedures for
other purposes which result in sterility.
	   The report said involuntary sterilization represents ``an attack
on the dignity'' of the handicapped and is a way of ``denying them
normal sexual and erotic activity.''
	   For authors Drs. Maire-Laure Lagardere, Helene Strohl and
Bernard Even, such sterilization ``is justifiable only on rare
occasions,'' namely in emergencies or regarding handicapped minors
for whom pregnancy and contraception would be life-threatening.
	   They said better, more affordable contraception must be made
available and suggested the creation of a proper legal framework so
that contraception could become mandatory in such cases.
	   ``Everything takes place as though no progress in contraception
has been made and as if the only substitute for the pill is tying
off the tubes,'' the authors wrote.
	   Last year, Nicole Diederich, a respected French researcher, said
involuntary sterilization programs had been on the rise ever since
hospitals and specialized institutions began allowing sexual
relations among handicapped patients 20 years ago.

Sri Lankan military admits loss of major town to Tamil rebels

Sri Lanka-Missing Plane. &QL; 
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka's military admitted Thursday
for the first time that Tamil Tiger guerrillas captured one of the
country's largest northern towns in a three-day battle that it says
killed about 1,200 people.
	   They also said a naval gunboat recovered the bodies of three of
the 55 people who were on a commercial plane missing since Tuesday.
Small parts of the aircraft were also recovered from the sea,
officials said. No other details were available.
	   The plane disappeared off the coast after leaving the troubled
Jaffna peninsula, on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean island.
	   Officials couldn't say whether the plane had crashed or was
downed by the Tamils, who have been fighting a separatist war in
northern Sri Lanka since 1983.
	   The plane was owned by Lionair, one of two private companies
that had been providing civilian air service between Colombo and
Jaffna. After it disappeared, the government suspended civilian
flights to Jaffna, which is linked to the rest of Sri Lanka only by
air and sea because of fighting along the land route.
	   Rebels attacked the government stronghold at Kilinochchi in a
bid to control a key highway that links the government-held
southern section of the Indian Ocean island with the
military-controlled northern town of Jaffna.
	   Complete control of the highway could be a turning point in the
protracted war. The military had controlled two-thirds of it before
Tuesday, when rebels captured Kilinochchi, a government stronghold
in the area of the route.
	   ``We have pulled back from Kilinochchi,'' said Brigadier Sunil
Tennekoon, the military's spokesman. ``We have vacated the town.''
	   The military's admitted death toll was lower than the figure
that journalists had calculated Wednesday from Red Cross reports,
hospitals accounts and earlier sketchy reports from the defense
ministry.
	   But the final death toll remained uncertain Thursday.
Journalists haven't been allowed near the fighting, and
humanitarian organizations are also staying away.
	   The rebels turned over 600 bodies to the Red Cross on Wednesday,
not including 262 soldiers whose bodies the military recovered
itself and the 477 rebels that the military said it killed. In
Colombo, hospital officials speaking on condition of anonymity said
another 53 soldiers died in hospitals.
	   On Thursday, the military said not all of the bodies turned over
to the Red Cross were soldiers, claiming 535 soldiers died at
Kilinochchi and a nearby battle. It also raised its estimate of the
number of rebel dead to 620.
	   Soldiers have formed a new defensive line near the town of
Paranthan, two miles (three kilometers) north of Kilinochchi,
Tennekoon said. The military also claimed it captured a smaller
town, Mankulam, 18 miles (30 kilometers) to the south.
	   Rebels had dug in behind bunkers and fiercely resisted the
onslaught on Mankulam for more than a year, but finally withdrew
from the battered town 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of Colombo,
the capital, as they became surrounded by government troops.
	   The military has not seen such casualties since 1996, when 1,240
soldiers were killed when rebels overran a garrison at Mullaittivu,
175 miles (280 kilometers) north of Colombo.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese, who control the
government and the military.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed since the fighting
began in 1983.

NATO chief meets Armenian premier, talks about cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
praised the alliance's relations with Armenia on Thursday and
called for further cooperation with the former Soviet republic.
	   ``We're doing a lot now, but we could do even more,'' Solana
said after talks with Prime Minister Armen Darbinian. In
particular, he called for cooperation ``in the sphere of science.''
	   Solana flew to Yerevan, the Armenian capital, one day after
talks with Armenia's neighbor and rival, Azerbaijan. Before that,
he visited a third former Soviet republic, Georgia.
	   Russia has watched warily as NATO has improved relations with
Moscow's former compatriots.
	   Solana said he and Darbinian had discussed ``questions of mutual
interest, including the regional problems.'' Although he did not
elaborate, he presumably was referring to Nagorno-Karabakh, an
ethnic-Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan that has caused friction
and violence between the two neighbors.
	   ``We showed our point of view on regional cooperation, and on
relations between Armenia and NATO,'' Darbinian told reporters
after the meeting. He added that ``further development of relations
between Armenia and NATO will not be aimed against any other
country.''

Turkey recalls ambassador to Italy for consultations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey, angry over a Kurdish meeting held
in the Italian parliament this week, recalled its ambassador to
Rome for consultation Thursday.
	   Turkey had strongly protested the meeting of the Kurdish group,
which calls itself Turkish Kurds' parliament-in-exile. Turkey says
the group is a political front for Kurdish rebels fighting for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini wrote Turkish counterpart
Ismail Cem, reiterating Italy's explanation that the Kurds had been
invited by a group of Italian lawmakers, not the government.
	   Reports Thursday also claimed that two Italian defense companies
have been dropped from dlrs 10 billion in potential contracts. The
Italian Embassy in Ankara and Turkey's Foreign Ministry said they
knew of no such move, however.
	   The 14-year-old war between the rebels and the Turkish army has
killed 37,000 people.

After insurgency, Lesotho says its army must be overhauled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Lesotho's foreign minister said Thursday
that a military insurgency in his poor African country that led to
armed intervention from neighboring South Africa underscored the
need to overhaul Lesotho's armed forces.
	   Tom Thabane said in speech to the U.N. General Assembly that
whenever a political party was in power in his country, it had
filled the army with its own supporters.
	   ``As a consequence, our army has found great difficulty in
submitting to the authority of a different master. Recent events
have underscored the urgent need to overhaul the Lesotho army, as
was done under international supervision in Haiti.''
	   Disputes between the Lesotho government and opposition parties
led to an army mutiny and a bloody intervention by South Africa
last week.
	   Thabane said his country was in ``a state of virtual coup
d'etat'' when the government appealed for help from other African
nations. On Sept. 22, South Africa and nearby Botswana sent about
1,000 troops into Lesotho.
	   The government and the opposition have since agreed to
negotiations.
	   Thabane said the violence had caused more than dlrs 200 million
in damage. He appealed for international help, saying the cost was
a ``heavy burden'' for Lesotho, a landlocked kingdom of 2 million
surrounded by South Africa.

Election supervisors remove two elected Bosnian officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Election supervisors have
removed two elected Bosnian officials, holding their parties
responsible for violating election rules during nationwide
balloting two weeks ago, a statement said Thursday.
	   No other punishments have been meted out since the Sept. 12-13
elections, but in the pre-election period the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe removed more than 30 Bosnian
Serb, Croat and Muslim candidates for violations of election rules.
	   An OSCE panel reviewing the ballot canceled the election of Pero
Kozul, who ran for the ruling Croat Democratic Union for the local
assembly in southwestern Siroki Brijeg.
	   Local election officials _ with the blessing of their chairman _
were found invalidating ballots there that were not marked by
voters for the Croatian party .
	   The panel also withheld payment for the officials involved and
banned them from overseeing elections in future.
	   In the second case, Dragan Jeftic of the Serb Radical Party for
the Bosnian Serb assembly was also denied his seat because the
local leader of his party had physically attacked election
officials from other parties.
	   In the northern city of Tuzla, a Muslim-led coalition was fined
1,000 German marks for violating election rules, including letting
people vote from their homes for the coalition.
	   The OSCE is continuing to investigate the results of the
elections and is expected to certify them as valid in the next week
or so.
	   The ballot last month increased the share of pro-Western parties
in national and local assemblies. But Nikola Poplasen, a Serb
hard-liner, was elected president of the Bosnian Serb republic,
beating incumbent Biljana Plavsic.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Tages Anzeiger, Zurich, Switzerland, on the German election:
	   In Germany on Sunday, an era came to an end. ...
	   The election of the new Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, is more
than just a straight change of power.
	   We still don't know how Kohl's successor plans to govern, but it
is clear: he will be the first chancellor who hasn't had to force a
change of government in quiet back rooms and via party political
cliques.
	   It gives German democracy a new veneer of normality.
	   For the first time, voters have taken the bull firmly by the
horns and opted for what must usually take place in a democracy:
change.
	   A surprisingly large number of Germans have cast aside their
usual caution and opted for the new and unknown. ...
	   For a country that, because of bitter experience, values the
stable continuity of the status quo more than anything else, it's
more than remarkable. It borders on a revolution.
	    &UR; ___
	   De Volkskrant, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on the German election:
	   Under the solid and steady Kohl, the powerful Germany was a
trustworthy partner, but there is no reason for alarm. Schroeder
has stressed the importance of continuity and he has great contacts
with other European government leaders from the social democrat
camp. Kohl was also a novice when he stepped into the international
arena. Sure enough, Europe will also be fine with Chancellor
Schroeder.
	    &UR; ___
	   Aftonbladet, Stockholm, Sweden, on the German election:
	   The epoch of Helmut Kohl is finished and Germany is changing its
face. With the Social Democrat Gerhard Schroeder as head of
government for the EU's weightiest country, Europe also goes into a
new, exciting time.
	   The 27th of September 1998 was a historic day. For the first
time in Germany's post-war history, there will be a power
transition in Bonn by way of a government being changed by the
German voters.
	   After the victory of Gerhard Schroeder and the SDP, now the only
right-of-center large country in the EU is Spain. A chance for a
more social and humane Europe. ... Europe, a little redder, a
little newer, looks to the future with Gerhard Schroeder.
	    &UR; ___
	   Der Tagesspiegel, Berlin, on Russian politics:
	   It is becoming increasingly harder to make the personnel
politics of Russia rhyme. The ever faster succession of naming and
firing does not provide any indication of a direction. But Moscow
is contradictory like that. Even the most important players, the
president and prime minister, are a touch disoriented. ...
	   They want, and must, keep two goals in mind: the requirements to
keep the trust of the West and at the same time quieting the
powerful communist leaders. So they must include radical reformer
Boris Fyodorov, one among other exponents that are clearly being
sacrificed. ...
	   It is much more comfortable for them to keep the questions open
ended. The West should not have the illusion that Russia can return
to stability in the foreseeable future.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Independent, London, on Palestinian-Israeli relations:
	   It is hard to see why headlines on Palestinian-Israeli relations
have suddenly burst into a chorus of hope. All that has been agreed
by Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, and Yasser
Arafat, head of the Palestinian Authority, is that they will meet
again in a couple of weeks. Even according to the most optimistic
observers, any agreement reached in Washington in mid-October will
only cover Israeli withdrawal from a further 13 per cent of
occupied Palestinian territory.
	   If negotiations reach that stage, further obstacles will present
themselves. Israel will have to decide whether it recognizes a
sovereign state called Palestine; the Palestinians will need to
consider whether they insist on East Jerusalem being part of that
state. It is a mark of how long it is since the last progress made
under the Oslo peace accords ... that anyone is becoming excited
over ``agreements'' which do not even approach these problems. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times, London, on Slovakian elections:
	   It was, inevitably, overshadowed by the earthquake next door.
But the general election in Slovakia has yielded a result as
momentous for that country as the eviction from power of Helmut
Kohl. The crushing defeat of Vladimir Meciar's nationalist
Government by the four-party opposition has been a demonstration of
the resilience of the democratic ideal.
	   Euphoria, however, must be tinged with caution. The stake has
not yet been driven through Meciar's political heart. His Movement
for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) remains the largest party, and he
has refused to accept defeat or comment on the nation's repudiation
of his policies. ...
	   Slovakia's neighbors have applauded the courage of the voters in
rejecting the former charismatic but malign leader. But his
opponents will have to move swiftly and together if they are to
keep the lid nailed down on his political coffin.

Leading news magazine says government launching campaign of terror
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo ISL107
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's leading English-language
news magazine accused the government Thursday of launching a
campaign of terror and intimidation against its staff.
	   The reason behind the campaign according to Rehana Hakim, the
editor of Pakistan's respected Newsline magazine, are several
articles alleging corrupt practices by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
his family and his accountability chief Saif-ur Rehman.
	   Rehman has been the man behind government-sponsored
investigations into former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and her
jailed husband Asif Ali Zardari.
	   Newsline has published several reports alleging government tax
cuts and deals for Sharif's friends and family members. It also
published a story that Rehman, a wealthy man, does not pay any
income tax.
	   ``The Pakistan Muslim League government has launched a campaign
to victimize and terrorize Newsline,'' said Hakim. ``Since it
cannot unearth any legal grounds to exert pressure it has resorted
to a variety of intimidatory tactics.''
	   On Thursday plain clothes officers swept through the office of
Newsline badgering employees and demanding the home numbers and
addresses of editors.
	   ``We know they are gunning for us,'' she said.
	   The government denied the charges of harassment.
	   ``There is absolutely no harassment . . . the press is very free
in Pakistan,'' said Rauf Malik, a senior information ministry
official. ``The stories of harassment are concocted.''
	   But Hakim says that the government has ordered tax audits of the
magazine and its staff. Newsline is owned and operated by a
journalists' cooperative established in 1989.
	   ``Newsline . . .has maintained an immaculate tax record,'' said
Hakim. ``While our records speak for themselves, it is common
knowledge that documents can easily be doctored and loopholes found
to accommodate the agenda of the powers-that-be.''
	   But government harassment is not a new phenomena for Newsline.
	   With a reputation in Pakistan for its investigative reporting,
Newsline also came under fire during former prime minister Benazir
Bhutto's government.
	   Then police harassed the magazine's senior editor Razia Bhatti,
the recipient of a U.S.-based award for courage in journalism.
Other recipients of the same award were Christiane Amanpour of the
Cable News Network (CNN) and the Washington Post's Catherine
Graham.
	   ``At that time it was bad, but then they objected to a
particular story. They wanted you to change a story,'' said Hakim.
	   Today she said the government is ``trying to get at us on a
personal and private level.''
	   Also this is not the first complaint against Sharif's government
from the press.
	   In August the chief editor of Pakistan's largest newspaper group
accused the government of trying to muzzle the press by withdrawing
advertising and pressuring him to fire journalists.
	   Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman's Jang Group of Newspapers includes the
country's largest circulation paper the Urdu-language Jang with
about 1 million readers and the respected English daily, The News.
	   The government said the newspaper's reporting of its economic
and political troubles could be seen as treacherously ``playing
into the hands of anti-state elements.''

Taliban warns Tajikistan of ''dire consequences''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army
accused Tajikistan Thursday of financing its opponents and warned
of ``dire consequences'' if it did not stop.
	   A Taliban-run radio Shariat broadcast said the pilot of a
Russian-made cargo aircraft,who defected earlier this week to the
Taliban army, revealed Tajikistan's assistance to the anti-Taliban
opposition.
	   ``The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan condemns the interference
and it has the right to respond to aggressors and we warn of dire
consequences if Tajikistan continues its interference in
Afghanistan,'' the broadcast quoted the Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Rabbani as saying.
	   Rabbani sought the United Nations help to end Tajikistan's
interference, according to the radio broadcast.
	   The Taliban army routinely accuses both Iran and Tajikistan of
aiding the northern-based opposition, which is led by former
military chief Ahmed shah Massood, an ethnic Tajik.
	   The opposition says the Taliban receives its aid from
neighboring Pakistan.
	   The Taliban, which has imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law,
controls roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, while its opponents
rule in the remaining 10 percent.
	   The Taliban are mostly ethnic Pashtuns, Afghanistan's largest
ethnic group, while the opposition is made up of small parties who
represent the country's minority ethnic and religious groups.
	   Iran, a mostly Shiite Muslim country, has amassed about 200,000
soldiers on its western border with Afghanistan, where it is
conducting massive military exercises.
	   Iran is demanding an apology from the Taliban for the killing of
eight Iranian diplomats and an Iranian journalist last month in
northern Afghanistan. So far the Taliban has refused saying the
diplomats were ``conspirators''.
	   Attempts are being made to negotiate a peaceful end to the
standoff between Iran and Afghanistan.

an increasingly older population during the next two decades, the
U.N. health agency predicted Thursday.
	   Life expectancy around the globe has been increasing steadily,
reaching 62 years in developing countries in 1990, said the World
Health Organization.
	   By the year 2020 there will be more than 1 billion people 60
years or older in the world, nearly double the current number, WHO
said.
	   The ``oldest'' countries that year will be Japan and Italy, each
with 31 percent of their populations at least 60, it said. They
will be followed by Greece, Switzerland and Finland at 28 percent.
	   The agency said Greece and Italy are the current leaders, at 23
percent, followed by Germany, Japan and Sweden at 22 percent.
	   Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO director-general, said ``the greatest
challenge of the 21st century will be to improve the quality of
life as well as age.''
	   WHO's projections for the year 2020, with 1998 rankings and
percentages in parentheses:
 &UR; 31 percent of population aged 60 or more
	   1. Japan (3) (22 percent)

	    &UR; ___
	   The Australian, Sydney, Australia, on Malaysia's crackdown:
	   Malaysian authorities closed Kuala Lumpur's main square Sunday,
after the fourth anti-government protest in a week. More
demonstrations are planned against the increasingly autocratic
behavior of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Sunday's rally came
just a week after former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was
detained under Malaysia's Internal Security Act, legislation dating
from colonial times and aimed at halting the spread of communist
terrorism. Anwar is under investigation for alleged sodomy and
treason. He denies the allegations and says he is the victim of a
conspiracy to end his political career. But it appears Mahathir is
happy to use one example of British law while ignoring another _
the concept of innocent until proven guilty. He has launched a
campaign against Anwar, even asserting he had spoken to Anwar's
alleged sexual partners and it is clear he is guilty. ...
	   But the Malaysian leader has made clear his contempt for the
courts and for due process. If the prime minister has proclaimed
Anwar's guilt, Malaysia's judges will have to ensure he gets a fair
trial. And anything less than a fair trial will cause further
internal tension and further besmirch Malaysia's international
reputation.
	    &UR; ___
	   ABC, Madrid, Spain, on the Middle East peace process:
	   It's been the insistent pressure of the White House that appears
to have given the timid push to the stagnant Middle East peace
process. A presidency such as that of Bill Clinton, hounded by the
Republican Party and for that reason in need of political triumphs
... had no choice but to throw himself behind the effort to break
the stalemate between the government of Benjamin Netanyahu and the
Arabs.
	   Clinton's statement that `there has been progress but a lot
remains to be done before a definitive accord is reached' appeared
out of the question just hours beforehand. Hopefully it doesn't end
up being the statement of one badly in need of foreign success to
patch up his battered image at home. The mere fact that the
stalemate situation has snapped is no mean progress.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on Israel's nuclear plant:
	   Different sources from within and outside Israel are sounding
the alarm these days about the state of health of Israel's Dimona
nuclear plant. Over and above the military threat that Dimona poses
to the security and stability of the entire region, having produced
hundreds of nuclear devices, the plant's old age and archaic
systems of control pose a considerable threat to environment and
the region's ecosystem should the facility experience a meltdown.
	   The location of Dimona close to Jordan's border puts the entire
southern part of the country at great risk from any contamination
that may emanate from the plant.
	   In this regard, it is disturbing to see the International Atomic
Energy Agency drop a draft resolution sponsored by a number of Arab
states including Jordan that calls on Israel to accede to the
nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and put its facilities under the
supervision of the IAEA. It is hard to comprehend the reluctance of
the agency to call on Israel to refrain from developing, producing,
testing or possessing nuclear weapons.
	   Only when Israel agrees to make the Middle East free of all
types of weapons of mass destruction, would there be an effective
and permanent solution to the sources of gangers that Israel is
complaining about.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on the German election
	   Craving change after 16 years of staid conservatism, Germany has
for the first time elected a chancellor who does not carry the
baggage of World War II. However, as he steps into the shadows of
retirement, Chancellor Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader and
the first incumbent chancellor of modern Germany to be unseated,
can look back proudly on his 16 years at the helm of Europe's most
powerful nation.
	   .....But it would be a mistake to imagine that Red-Green, Mr.
Kohl's name for the alliance between Mr. Schroeder's Social
Democratic Party and the environmentalist Greens, stands for daring
radicalism. Of course, industry has been talking of the fear of new
taxes. Mr. Schroeder's reference to curbing speculation on capital
markets might add to nervousness in the world of high finance. But
never was it more truly said that the more things change, the more
they stay the same. The discipline of European Union membership and
a common currency will rule out defiantly drastic departures from
the parameters set by his predecessor.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Figaro, Paris, on the German Chancellor-elect's visit to
Paris:
	   There is a European parliament, a commission in Brussels...and
finally a single currency... Then why this agitation? Has (German
Chancellor-elect) Gerhard Schroeder ever tried to prevent the
formation of a new Europe? Of course not. He has even publicly
expressed that he's 95 percent in agreement with Helmut Kohl on
foreign policy....
	   What is the real problem? Great Britain, of course. French
leaders think Schroeder wants to reconstruct the `magic triangle:'
London, Berlin, Paris. That Schroeder wants to accelerate the
coming of London into Europe is probable ... Tony Blair represents
an alternative England, just as Schroeder represents an alternative
Germany. The eternal European equilibrium, that of a balancing act
between the three capitals, flows like a temptation or a fear in
our minds.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The army's bomb-disposal squad
neutralized an unexploded hand grenade found outside the Israeli
embassy Thursday. Police anti-terrorist experts were investigating.
	   The grenade was found on the street, under a parked car, just
before noon (1000 gmt). Police cordoned off the whole neighborhood
around the embassy before the bomb disposal squad arrived.
	   Jos Colpin, spokesman for the Brussels state prosecutor, said
one of the grenade's safety pins had been left in place. He said
lethal potential of the devise was limited.
	   ``It's often used to spread panic because it makes an awful lot
of noise. If you want to kill a lot of people you would use
something different,'' Colpin said.
	   ``The anti-terrorism unit is looking into it but so far we have
no leads,'' he added.

Belarusian president said banks lost millions in Russian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Commercial banks in Belarus lost dlrs 200
million because of the financial crisis in neighboring Russia,
President Alexander Lukashenko said Thursday.
	   ``What were you thinking about?'' Lukashenko asked business
leaders.
	   ``For what purpose did you buy those papers?'' he said,
referring to Russian government treasury bonds that have become
virtually worthless as a result of the crisis.
	   ``The best bank is a stocking in your own country,'' he said.
Many residents of the former Soviet Union remain distrustful of
banks and prefer to keep their savings at home, under their
mattress or in a sock.

	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on a subcritical nuclear test by the
United States:
	   The United States conducted its fourth subcritical nuclear test
at its Nevada Test Site Saturday. How provoking the timing was. We
feel disappointment and anger.
	   The prime ministers of India and Pakistan have expressed their
intention to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at the United
Nations General Assembly, which began last week.
	   The U.S. test might stop the current toward a `nuclear free
world.' The United States plans to carry out the same test two more
times.
	   We should not allow this act of the nuclear power nation that
justifies itself from its own logic.
	   It is natural that the mayor of Hiroshima condemned the U.S.
test. The Japanese government has been taking a position of giving
tacit approval for the subcritical test. It should issue a strong
protest this time ....
	   ``We hope that the Japanese government will take the lead in
raising international opinion by calling on North European nations
and Canada, which are interested in the anti-nuclear movement.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo on the German election:
	   The 16-year history of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is coming
to an end ....
	   Just before the good ship Germany embarks on its uncharted
course, the helm is assumed by Social Democratic Party leader
Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Schroeder committed himself to a healthy economy and social
equality. With globalization, however, the industrial strength of
rich nations faces fierce competition from developing nations with
cheaper labor. How can a robust economy coexist with an equitable
society in such an international climate? We will be watching with
keen interest to see whether the new chancellor will be able to
find the answer to that question _ an answer that eluded his
predecessor, Chancellor Kohl.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Orlando Sentinel, Orlando, Florida, on the Middle East:
	   So much time has elapsed since the last breakthrough in efforts
to bring peace to the Middle East that many Americans may have
wondered if any more progress lay ahead. ...
	   U.S., Israeli and Palestinian officials announced Monday plans
for a Washington, D.C., summit next month. ... That good news
should help relieve tensions in the region that had reached the
boiling point. ...
	   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators had agreed to a promising
plan five years ago. Unfortunately, that plan veered way off track,
so much so that Israel remains in the early stages of withdrawal
from the West Bank rather than at the end. ... Then the Clinton
administration stepped in with a fresh proposal, encouraging Israel
to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank. ...
	   The appealing idea on the negotiating table would preserve the
13 percent goal by turning a portion of the land into a nature
preserve. Also, the Palestinian Authority would work harder to
control terrorism. ... Israelis and Palestinians have everything to
gain by striving to reduce their mutual hostility and getting on
with peace.
	    &UR; ___
	   Valley Morning Star, Harlingen, Texas, on the military and
Kosovo:
	   Members of the United Nations and NATO are edging the world
closer to a military strike of some sort against Serbian forces in
Kosovo and perhaps in Yugoslavia. United States leaders seem eager
to get U.S. warplanes, and perhaps troops, involved.
	   That would be a mistake for many reasons.
	   It's true that the campaign waged by Yugoslav dictator Slobodan
Milosevic against Albanian separatists in Kosovo has been brutal
and bloody. But its unlikely the United States or NATO could
accomplish much constructive in that sad corner of the Balkans by
using military force. If anything, outside intervention would be
more likely to lead to the ``wider war'' Western diplomats claim
they want to prevent. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Telegraph Herald, Dubuque, Iowa, on President Clinton:
	   President Clinton has proven himself to be what Americans would
not like in a president. He is a liar. He is an adulterer. He uses
people. He has diminished the nation's top office.
	   It would be simple to join the chorus of the approximately 150
newspapers that have urged the president to resign. It is more of a
challenge to express this newspaper's view: Clinton should stay in
office, receive professional help for his personal problems and be
prepared to let the legal process _ perhaps including impeachment _
run its course. ...
	   It is interesting that many of the newspapers urging Clinton to
resign just two years ago endorsed his re-election despite ample
evidence of his personal shortcomings. ...
	   If Clinton was the chief executive of a corporation instead of
chief executive of the United States, he would have been fired for
his liaisons with Lewinsky and subsequent efforts to cover his
tracks.
	   And Clinton may be fired yet. It's called impeachment. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Lima News, Lima, Ohio, on President Clinton and polls:
	   One would think that after the Whitewater land deal, illegal
fund-raising, a government shutdown, illegal use of FBI files, the
travel office firings, abuse of the FBI and Internal Revenue
Service, the 1978 commodities coup, Vince Foster, secret meetings
of the Health Care Task Force, and now a sex scandal, there would
be public outrage against President Clinton.
	   The latest public-opinion polls, however, show President
Clinton's approval increasing. Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers are
seeing a decrease in their approval following the release of
Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report and the videotapes of
Clinton's Aug. 17 grand jury testimony.
	   The polls also show, if one wants to believe polls, that only
about one-third of the country is advocating impeachment.
	   Speaker Newt L. Gingrich said the House will not heed the polls
and will be guided solely by what is right. Let's hope so.
	   It's time to punish William Jefferson Clinton for the sake of
the republic. He must be removed from office. The Constitution is
clear on this matter.

Moscow mayor says Russia is ready for Social Democratic party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia is ripe for creation of a center-left
Social Democratic party, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov said Thursday
after returning from a visit with Prime Minister Tony Blair in
Britain.
	   Luzhkov, who is considered a likely presidential candidate in
2000, added that he has ``already started putting the principles of
new laborism into practice'' in Moscow, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   Luzhkov said a Social Democratic _ or ``new labor'' _ party in
Russia would support the efficient management of property
``regardless of whom it belongs to.'' That means private property
that is not working efficiently should be nationalized, he said _
and vice-versa.
	   Luzhkov said he was pleased with the recent victory of Social
Democrats in Germany, and believed that all of Europe was embracing
the idea of ``new socialism.''
	   Russia has no Social Democratic party, although the Yabloko
party is sometimes said to embody many of the same ideas.

Karlsson equals course record on opening day Belgacom Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds : UPDATES with late results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ Sweden's Robert Karlsson, Greg Turner of
New Zealand and England's Van Phillips all equaled the course
record at Royal Zoute Thursday to share the early lead after the
first round of the Belgian Belgacom Open.
	   The leading players took full advantage of the clear, windless
conditions and shot 7-under-par 64s to match the record set by
Spain's Miguel Angel Jiminez in 1992.
	   Nick Faldo shot one of his best rounds this year for a 65, was
tied with Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson in fourth place.
	   At the penultimate European Tour event, Lee Westwood was trying
to make the most of the absence of Scotland's Colin Montgomerie to
maintain a chance to squeeze past the Order of Merit leader during
the season-ending Volvo Masters at the end of the month.
	   Westwood, who needs to win the 400,000-pound (dlrs 680,000)
Belgian Open to keep his challenge going, shot a 4-under-par-67,
three shots off the early pace. The Englishman is currently 112,000
pounds behind Montgomerie's leading 760,077 pounds. A win here will
give Westwood 66,600 pounds (dlrs 113,220).
	   Karlsson, who finished second behind Montgomerie at the German
Masters last week, kept his good form going, shooting seven birdies
during his record-equaling round on the semi-links course.
	   ``It's great to go round on such a good course without a bogey
on your card,'' said the Swede, who is 18th on the European Tour
money list.
	   Montgomerie pulled out of the event at the last moment. Bernhard
Langer withdrew because of an illness in the family.
	   Royal Zoute has been kind to Faldo in the past and he won here
in 1994, the last time the Belgian Open was held. Seeking his form
of old, Faldo has been getting some good rounds together but none
more so than Thursday's.
	   After making eight birdies on the way to a 65, he said. ``I
don't know when I last did that.''
	   ``I sank nearly everything,'' he said of his putting on the
treacherous Zoute greens. The course in the North Sea resort is
tucked just inside the coastline and when the winds get going, it
is a tough challenge to the world's greatest players. On Thursday,
the course was at its kindest, softened up by a summer of heavy
rains.

Archaeologists find frozen mummies atop Peruvian volcano in Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Archaeologists have found six frozen mummies
sacrificed to Inca gods more than 500 years ago on a snow-capped
volcano in Peru's southern Andes.
	   The well-preserved mummies were found in two graves, buried with
ceremonial pots, gold and silver statues, and cloth blankets burned
by volcanic ash, said Peruvian archaeologist Ruth Salas.
	   The mummies were found in mid-September near the crater of the
19,100-foot (5,821-meter) high El Misti volcano, 465 miles (750
kilometers) southeast of Lima.
	   ``This is an important find because it shows that El Misti is
the mountain with the greatest number of human offerings in the
world,'' said Salas, the coordinator of the archaeological team
that made the discovery.
	   The same team of archaeologists, which included U.S.
mummy-hunter Johan Reinhard, in 1995 found a mummy known as ``The
Ice Princess'' atop a nearby mountain.
	   The frozen body of the girl, 12-to-14-years-old, was thought to
be the best preserved mummy from the pre-Columbian era. She had
apparently been killed by a powerful blow to the head.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ In her first match since clinching the
U.S. Open and closing in on the No. 1 ranking, Lindsay Davenport
stumbled Thursday at the Grand Slam Cup, losing in three sets to
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   ``It's a good wake-up call for me,'' Davenport said. ``The first
tournament in Europe, I need to play a lot better the next two
tournaments.''
	   Tauziat, the Wimbledon runner-up, rallied to win 4-6, 6-1, 7-5
despite 12 double-faults and 37 unforced errors.
	   Venus Williams made sure there will be at least one American in
the semifinals of the dlrs 6.7 million tournament when she beat
French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-3, 6-2. She will
next play Tauziat.
	   Since losing to Tauziat in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon,
Davenport had won four tournaments, also beating the Frenchwoman on
the way to her U.S. Open title earlier this month.
	   ``I definitely felt a little bit rusty and definitely a bit
sluggish,'' said Davenport, who took a week off after the U.S.
Open.
	   ``I started hitting last week. I got in Monday, maybe a couple
of days here would have helped,'' she said.
	   ``I think losing here today might even help me because it's
definitely going to make me practice harder the next few days,''
Davenport said.
	   Davenport trails top-ranked Martina Hingis by only 26 points and
she could be the new No. 1 after next week's tournament in
Filderstadt, Germany. She will also play in Zurich, Switzerland.
	   ``I know it's going to be very tough because I know Martina is
going to play very well. I just hope I can play well, too,''
Davenport said.
	   ``But ranking has never been a huge priority of mine, it's never
been a huge, huge obsession of mine. Whatever happens with the
ranking happens. If it happens, I'll be very happy, though.
	   ``The one I wanted to win was the U.S. Open,'' Davenport said.
	   After splitting the first two sets, both Davenport and Tauziat
had trouble holding serve in the third.
	   Serving for the match at 5-4, Tauziat saw Davenport rip a
backhand passing shot that made it 5-5.
	   But Davenport again dropped her serve, allowing Tauziat to serve
for the match for the second time. Davenport saved one match point
with a lob but Tauziat fired her sixth ace to advance.
	   ``I had a chance to close the match earlier. I didn't do it. I
was lucky to finish at the end,'' Tauziat said.
	   Williams, ranked No. 5, has won the last three of her five
matches against Sanchez-Vicario. The American reached the
semifinals of the U.S. Open earlier this month by beating
Sanchez-Vicario and made the quarterfinals in the other three Grand
Slams.
	   Sanchez-Vicario won her fourth Grand Slam career title in Paris
this summer and is ranked No. 4 in the world.
	   But she was unable to match Williams' powerful ground strokes.
	   Williams broke serve for a decisive 3-2 lead in the second set
and gained another break to go up 5-2 after rallying from a 0-40
deficit by winning five straight points. She gained the break by
hitting an overhead smash.
	   The American served out the match in the next game, hitting a
perfect volley on her second match point.
	   ``I played well, but I didn't always capitalize on my
opportunities,'' Williams said.
	   The tournament brings together players with best records in the
four Grand Slam events of the year _ the Australian, French and
U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   Only one of the year's Grand Slam champions among the men is
here _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda.
	   The eight women included all the champions and all the
top-ranked players except Monica Seles.
	   But three Grand Slam champions already have been eliminated _
Davenport, Sanchez-Vicario and Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion
who was ousted Wednesday by Patty Schnyder.
	   Hingis, the Australian Open champion, plays Schnyder, her Swiss
teammate, in the other women's semifinal.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The chief of the Italian Olympic Committee's
drug-testing laboratory was fired Thursday over the alleged
cover-up of positive doping tests in soccer.
	   At an emergency session, the Italian Olympic Committee's (CONI)
ruling body dismissed the official, Emilio Gasbarrone, as secretary
general of the medical commission.
	   Gasbarrone had been in charge of the Acqua Acetosa lab since
1988.
	   Investigators looking into charges of doping in Italian League
soccer have reportedly discovered that some tests were not fully
carried out.
	   In addition, documentation on anti-doping tests was being
discarded after two months, while CONI requires that it be kept at
least two years, five in the case of positive tests, a CONI
spokesman said.
	   The scandal could jeopardize the status of the Acqua Acetosa
lab, which is accredited by the International Olympic Committee.
	   IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, in Rome for the World
Equestrian Games, indicated it might be necessary to open a new
anti-doping lab in Italy.
	   In another development Thursday, analysis of a backup urine
sample confirmed that a player for a second-division club tested
positive for an anbolic steroid.
	   Lecce defender Cristiano Pavone's B test also turned up
positive, the ANSA news agency reported, citing unidentified
sources.
	   Pavone, who was tested last month, has said the results could
have been caused by medication he took after a motorcycle accident.
	   Pavone now faces the possibility of a ban, ranging from a
minimum of six months to maximum of two years.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Amid growing pressure for international
intervention to stop the killing in Kosovo, NATO's decision-making
body took another step Thursday to prepare airstrikes against Serb
forces.
	   NATO diplomats said the North Atlantic Council approved an
``activation request'' for the 16 allied nations to formally commit
warplanes and other forces for an eventual air campaign.
	   However, the council, made up of ambassadors from the allied
nations, come no closer to taking a political decision to launch
air raids and failed to overcome differences over whether the
alliance needs a clearer U.N. mandate before it can attack.
	   NATO's military have been working for months on plans to
intervene in Kosovo where Serbian security forces are trying to
crush ethnic Albanian separatists. Hundreds have been killed and an
estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their homes since
the crackdown began in February.
	   Pressure for international intervention mounted in recent days
after the discovery of massacred ethnic Albanian villagers,
including women and children.
	   The United States says no further U.N. resolution is needed, but
some European allies are concerned about the legality of acting
without explicit authorization from the United Nations.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said in Rome that
intervention without a U.N. mandate was ``inconceivable.''
	   Calling for a fresh Security Council vote would let Russia veto
a resolution authorizing military action. Russian diplomats
restated Moscow's opposition to air strikes in a meeting Wednesday
with the NATO council.
	   NATO officials said the alliance was waiting to see a report on
Kosovo to be presented to the Security Council early next week by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The U.N. chief is expected to indicate whether the Serbs are
complying with last week's Security Council resolution, which urges
a cease-fire and threatens to consider ``further action and
additional measures'' if fighting continues.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook on Wednesday warned
airstrikes could follow Annan's report and diplomats at NATO
headquarters said the decision to launch attacks could be taken by
the middle of next week.
	   NATO military planners say they have identified around 100 Serb
military installations as possible targets for airstrikes both in
Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia, including anti-aircraft missiles,
radar units and command centers. NATO has not yet decided which or
how many targets would be hit in a first wave of raids.
	   Serbia claims its combat forces are pulling back in Kosovo. A
senior NATO diplomat said the alliance has seen reports of a
``tapering off'' of military activity, but was not yet convinced a
significant withdrawal was underway.
	   Over the weekend, NATO approved an ``activation warning'' which
asked member nations to informally indicate which forces they would
make available.
	   Canada, Britain, Norway, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and
Portugal have already announced plans to send warplanes. The United
States has yet to say publicly what it will contribute to the
force, but NATO officials said U.S. cruise missiles were ready for
action in the region.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With international pressure
mounting, Yugoslavia offered Thursday to let foreign experts
investigate massacres in Kosovo and local officials said combat
units had been removed from areas where the killings occurred.
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed
government troops shelled a village Thursday near Djakovica
(JA-kaw-vee-tsah) along the border with Albania, where separatist
guerrillas take sanctuary.
	   There was no confirmation from Serb sources. But the Yugoslav
army said Thursday that six soldiers were killed and seven wounded
in fighting Wednesday with ethnic Albanian rebels about 20
kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Djakovica.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the Kosovo Liberation Army
claimed it killed 25 police and army troops in the attack, which it
said was part of a new operation to strike ``the enemy where he
feels most secure.''
	   International efforts to end the seven-month conflict gained
momentum this week with reports that Serb police massacred dozens
of ethnic Albanian civilians southwest of here. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The U.N. Security Council was meeting Thursday in New York to
condemn the massacres and reinforce demands for an immediate
cease-fire. Serb officials have denied police.
	   In an effort to head off possible NATO action in wake of the
massacres, Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Zivandin Jovanovic,
invited the International Committee of the Red Cross and the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees to send experts to Kosovo to
investigate the killings.
	   Later, the government's Tanjug news agency said an invitation
had already been sent to a team of Finnish forensic experts to join
Yugoslav investigators in a joint probe.
	   Also Thursday, the Serb Media Center here announced that combat
forces had been removed from areas of conflict and that ``only
police units needed to preserve public security and order and guard
communications, are out in the field.''
	   There was no immediate comment from international observers in
Kosovo, although reporters saw troop convoys heading toward
barracks near this provincial capital.
	   Despite those moves, allegations of Serb atrocities continued.
The ethnic Albanian center said bodies of a dozen males, including
a 15-year-old, had been found Thursday in the Suva Reka (SOO-vah
RAY-kah) region about 45 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   The report could not be confirmed. It was also unclear whether
the men _ most of whom were of fighting age _ were KLA rebels.
	   On Wednesday, residents of Golubovac said Serb forces surrounded
a group of refugees last Saturday, separated 13 men and shot them.
Farmer Naim Hodzaj said in addition, Serb police killed several
other men individually, including his 37-year-old brother Ramadan.
	   Hodzaj said his brother was doused with gasoline and set on
fire. A burned body lay on a path on the edge of the woods.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac. The dead included women
and children.
	   In a separate incident, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Serb
police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles Tuesday in Vranic
(VRAW-nitch) in southwestern Kosovo.
	   The New York organization said one of its researchers saw the
bodies of four ethnic Albanian men who had been killed, including
one whose face had been mutilated.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj
charged that bodies seen by reporters were planted by ethnic
Albanians as part of an ``orchestrated propaganda war.''
	   Seselj claimed Western countries staged the massacre ``to push
through ... a NATO attack decision in the U.N. Security Council.''
Seselj threatened to retaliate against NATO soldiers abroad, as
well as foreigners and pro-western Serbs in Yugoslavia, in case of
any such attack.
	   ``We do not underestimate NATO strength, but we have to defend
ourselves,'' he said. ``Maybe we would not be able to bring down
their missiles or planes, but their soldiers all around the world
will be our enemies and subjected to our attacks wherever they are
available.''

Right-wing leader asks that India be called Hindustan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ A Hindu nationalist leader said Thursday
that India should now be known as Hindustan or Land of the Hindus.
	   Bal Thackeray, the powerful head of the right-wing Shiv Sena
party, told supporters who had gathered to celebrate the Hindu
festival of Dassera that ``nobody should say Bharat or India any
more from today. Everyone should say Hindustan.''
	   Bharat is the name Indians in ancient times gave their country.
	   Thackeray holds no official post but wields control over the
state government of Maharashtra, of which Bombay is capital.
	   The Shiv Sena led by Thackeray successfully canvassed to change
the name of India's financial capital from Bombay to Mumbai, when
the party formed a coalition government with the nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party in 1995.
	   The Shiv Sena has been accused of inciting religious riots in
Bombay in 1993 in which hundreds of people were

Financial giant is latest Dutch multinational to issue profit

warning

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch financial services giant ING
Groep NV issued a profit warning Thursday, saying the financial
crisis in Asia will cut more deeply into its profit than first
expected.
	   In a news release issued after Amsterdam Stock Exchange closed,
ING said earnings per share will rise by just 15 percent over the
whole of the year, taking net profit to 5.6 billion guilders (dlrs
3.01 billion), from 4.11 billion guilders (dlrs 2.21 billion) in
1997.
	   ING was the latest in a string of Dutch multinationals to warn
that the global economic turmoil would hit its earnings. KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, oil giant Shell and electronics company Philips
also have warned they have been hit by the financial crisis.
	   Earlier this year, ING increased its profit forecast, saying it
expected earnings per share to rise by between 30 percent and 35
percent from 5.25 guilders (dlrs 2.82) a year earlier.
	   In its news release, ING said that increased problems in
emerging markets will force it to reconsider its strategic
positioning in that field.
	   ``The financial crisis in Asia and other parts of the world has
worsened since the publication of the half-year results in
August,'' ING said. In August, the bank said it would cut 1,200
jobs at ING Barings to slash costs by 25 percent.
	   ING said that based on current knowledge the profit contribution
from corporate and investment banking activities in emerging
markets will be 1.5 billion guilders (dlrs 806.4 million) less than
first expected.
	   The profit reduction is the result of losses on trading
portfolios, greatly diminished volumes in international financial
business and the need to make extra provisions, ING said.
	   The extra provisions are mainly from ``the insolvency of the
Russian banking system,'' ING said.
	   A spokesman at ING said the company will look to see where it
can make further job cuts, but could not indicate how many
positions may go. He said ING Barings' new CFO, David Robins, will
focus on cost reductions.

Brazilian kidnappers release wealthy businessman
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian kidnappers released the owner
of one of Sao Paulo's largest home appliance chains on Thursday,
after receiving 177,000 reals (nearly dlrs 100,000).
	   Girsz Aronson, owner of the chain G.Aronson, was released at
Thursday morning at a gas station 30 kilometers (20 miles) west of
Sao Paulo. At the gas station, the 82-year-old Aronson called his
family, and his son and daughter-in-law picked him up.
	   Aronson was abducted by three men on Sept. 17, just after
opening his flagship store in downtown Sao Paulo.
	   Hours after his release, a visibly shaken Aronson told reporters
that during his captivity he was forced to stay inside a tent in a
small room.
	   Asked about the bandage on his nose, he said he bruised it when
his abductors ``shoved me through a window into the room.''
	   ``Otherwise they treated me well and fed me bread, cheese and
yogurt,'' he added.
	   Aronson said he believed his food was drugged with sedatives,
since he would fall asleep immediately after eating.
	   ``At first they demanded 2 million reals (dlrs 1.7 million), but
eventually settled for 117,000 reals (dlrs 99,000),'' he said. ``I
think they lowered their ransom demand when I told them of the
financial problems I was facing.''
	   A sharp drop in sales caused by high interest rates recently
forced G.Aronson to seek protection from creditors through a
mechanism similar to Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy law.
	   To help pay off a debt of 65 million reals (dlrs 55 million),
Aronson sold eight of his 34 stores. He still owes some 40 million
reals (dlrs 34 million).

Mugging victim says Tom Cruise came to her rescue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Cruise's spokeswoman in grafs 5,6;
edits throughout to tighten &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tom Cruise got a chance to play a real-life hero,
according to a woman who says the actor came to her aid during a
mugging.
	   Rita Simmonds told the Evening Standard in Thursday's editions
that Cruise ran to her rescue Sept. 23 as attackers pulled open the
door of her Porsche and yanked off more than 70,000 pounds (dlrs
119,000) worth of jewelry.
	   ``Tom was brilliant,'' Simmonds, Cruise's neighbor, told the
newspaper.
	   Cruise is renting a house near Regent's Park in London with his
wife, Nicole Kidman, and their children. Ms. Kidman is currently
appearing in a sold-out production of ``The Blue Room'' at a West
End theater.
	   ``He and a friend were taking a stroll and heard the
commotion,'' said Pat Kingsley, Cruise's Los Angeles-based
spokeswoman, adding that the attack had already taken place by the
time Cruise arrived on the scene.
	   ``A couple of people were standing there to help the women. He
tried to console her,'' Kingsley said.
	   Simmonds said the robbers escaped with some of her rings and an
antique Cartier watch worth 15,000 pounds (dlrs 25,500), and that
she was badly bruised during the assault.

Five ethnic Albanians sentenced to 6-8 years in prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Serbian court sentenced Thursday
five ethnic Albanians to 6-8 years in prison for ``preparing
terrorist actions'' in Kosovo.
	   The court in the southern Serbian town of Nis ruled that the
five joined ``terrorist gangs in order to carry our terrorist
actions, received arms and conducted training,'' with the same aim,
said the official Tanjug news agency.
	   Three of the sentenced ethnic Albanians also smuggled arms from
neighboring Albania into Serb-led Yugoslavia, the court said. They
were caught in western Kosovo last May.
	   Serbian officials and media refer to ethnic Albanians fighting
for independence for Kosovo as terrorists.

Palestinians arrest man linked to Hamas bomb factory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with three grafs at end with West Bank settlement
dispute. No Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian intelligence said Thursday
they have arrested a Hamas activist and former chemistry student
who stashed nearly a ton of explosives in his home right next to
Palestinian police headquarters on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin acknowledged that the Islamic
militant group was having problems making good on threats to carry
out attacks against Israelis in retaliation for the killing of two
Hamas fugitives by Israeli soldiers last month.
	   Yassin said Palestinian and Israeli security forces had stepped
up their campaign against Hamas. However, a Hamas ``response will
come at the appropriate time, even if it is delayed,'' Yassin told
a news conference in Gaza City.
	   In Israeli-controlled center of Hebron, several dozen
Palestinian teen-agers hurled stones and firebombs at Israeli
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets and stun grenades. Two
Palestinians were injured.
	   The army had imposed a curfew on the downtown area Wednesday
after an assailant, apparently a Palestinian, threw two hand
grenades at Israeli troops, injuring 11 soldiers and 11 Palestinian
passersby.
	   In response to the grenade attack, Israeli soldiers also sealed
the Palestinian-run parts of town, barring Palestinians from
entering or leaving. Hebron is home to 450 Jewish settlers and
130,000 Palestinians.
	   The assailant had escaped into the Palestinian-controlled
sector, apparently after being shot in the leg by an Israeli
soldier. Israel filed a sharp protest with the Palestinian
Authority, saying it must do more to catch the fugitive.
	   Coming amid U.S. efforts to conclude agreement on an Israeli
troop withdrawal in the West Bank, the attack boosted Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat is not cracking down hard enough on Islamic militants.
	   Netanyahu has said he would not hand over West Bank land until
the Palestinians rein in militants.
	   Arafat said Thursday that this week's top-level talks in
Washington have produced progress on a troop pullback. His positive
assessment appeared to contradict statements by Palestinian
negotiators who said little has been achieved in Washington.
	   Netanyahu briefed his Cabinet on the Washington talks.
	   The Hamas bomb factory was located in a two-story home just
several yards from Palestinian police headquarters, a fortress-like
building on a hill on the outskirts of Hebron.
	   During a raid Monday, some 800 kilos (1,800 pounds) of
explosives were seized and a resident of the building, Hisham
Sharabati, was arrested, a Palestinian intelligence official said
Thursday.
	   Sharabati is a former chemistry student who spent 10 months in
an Israeli jail, said his father Hamdan. The elder Sharabati denied
that his son had hidden explosives in the ground-floor storage
area. Hamdan Sharabati said his son sold cosmetics and stored some
of the materials used in making the merchandise in the house.
	   Sharabati's brother, Adel, was briefly detained for questioning,
but released.
	   Also Thursday, Palestinian officials said that eight new mobile
homes set up in a remote area of the West Bank, half a mile (800
meters) from the nearest community, is a new settlement and
violates peace accords.
	   Israel's military government in the West Bank said the trailers
stood on land belonging to the El David settlement which is located
on a hilltop near the trailer park.
	   Under pressure from the United States and the Palestinians to
halt settlement construction, Israel has said it would not build
new settlements. But the term is loosely defined and the Jewish
settler movement usually plants trailer homes on hilltops near
existing settlements, defines them as neighborhoods, and then
slowly moves in families to the new area.

	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Police charged a 25-year-old man
Thursday with strangling a German visitor on the Caribbean resort
island of Bequia.
	   Sylvester Lewis, 25, faces a possible sentence of death by
hanging in the killing of Neki Ruchl, 37. Ruchl's body was found
Monday in bushes near popular Princess Margaret Beach.
	   Lewis was brought to St. Vincent Thursday morning by ferry from
Bequia. He was charged before senior magistrate Errol Mounsey and
jailed in Her Majesty's Prison in the capital, Kingstown. He did
not enter a plea, and no date was set for his trial.
	   Prosecutors said preliminary inquiry hearings, during which
Mounsey will decide whether the case should go to trial, will
likely not begin until next year.
	   Investigators said Ruchl had been living on Bequia for four
months and was recently engaged to a St. Vincentian man, Jerrit
Antrobus. They did not release her hometown.
	   Lewis was detained by police on Tuesday, but acting prime
minister John Horne said prosecutors had waited for autopsy results
before charging him.
	   ``It is for us to see that justice is done in a normal course of
proceedings,'' Horne said. ``We are talking about a sensitive
matter.''
	   He added Ruchl's killing ``is to be abhorred like all heinous
crimes.''
	   Bequia's 5,000 people live on a 7-square-mile
(18-square-kilometer) island about 10 miles (15 kilometers) south
of St. Vincent in the Grenadines island chain. It is known for its
quiet beaches and forests and is a popular vacation spot for boat
owners.
	   The island attracted international attention when police there
charged a U.S. couple, James and Penny Fletcher, with murdering a
local boat-taxi driver in October 1996. The Fletchers were
acquitted in August 1997.

Bobby Julich pulls out of cycling World Championships

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Top U.S. cyclist Bobby Julich said
Thursday he was pulling out of next week's World Road Cycling
Championships in the Netherlands.
	   Julich, who finished third in this summer's Tour de France, said
he was not fit to race.
	   ``I have just not been feeling so good lately so I have
withdrawn myself from the selection of the team,'' he said in a
conference call.
	   Julich's performance in the Tour de France was the best by an
American since Greg LeMond won his third title in 1990. He finished
behind winner Marco Pantani of Italy and defending champion Jan
Ullrich of Germany.
	   ``It is a long season and it is really hard for me to keep going
and I don't want to go to the World Championships in anything less
than 100 percent form,'' Julich said.
	   Julich, of Glenwood Springs, Colo., said he was just looking
forward to getting home.
	   ``It has been a long season. I'm tired,'' he said.
	   It was not immediately clear who would replace Julich on the
U.S. team, or who would take his place as team leader.
	   Lance Armstrong, who recently finished fourth in the Tour of
Spain, appeared the most likely choice to lead the U.S. team.
Armstrong said Thursday he was feeling fit and confident following
his strong showing in Spain.
	   ``Typically, people who do well in the Tour of Spain can carry
it through to the World Championships and can potentially be
contenders,'' Armstrong said.

with cycling's governing body, the UCI.

IMF warns Russia against further borrowing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Global Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund warned Russia
Thursday that any effort to borrow money in an effort to avoid
painful economic reforms is a recipe for disaster.
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus also urged Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's government to avoid any moves that would spark
inflation, redouble efforts to collect taxes, and exercise better
control over the country's banks.
	   ``Borrowing to fund government reform is a recipe for
disaster,'' Camdessus said. ``What is needed is a government with a
clear strategy for going ahead and we don't see it yet.''
	   He also said that the economic plan that Russia and the IMF
agreed on in July in return for a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package
was a good one but implementation was poor.
	   The IMF made a first installment payment of dlrs 4.8 billion as
part of this bailout but has indefinitely postponed disbursing the
second dlrs 4.3 billion after political turmoil forced a change in
government. installment until it concludes new negotiations with
Russian authorities.
	   Camdessus warned Moscow against printing more rubles in an
effort to restart its economy and impose more direct controls on
the financial system.
	   Camdessus also said Russia needed to take ``every possible step
to establish a good climate of confidence with its creditors.''
Russia suspended payments to these creditors Aug. 17 when it
devalued the ruble.
	   In a related development, Camdessus's deputy defended the IMF's
Russian bailout package, saying the decision to go ahead was
difficult but right.
	   ``I think it would have been inexcusable for the international
community _ the U.S. and the other members of the IMF _ to step
back and say, 'Sort it out; we'll show up when you know what to
do,''' Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the IMF,
said in a keynote speech at the World Economic Development
Congress.
	   ``That's not what we did. I think there are no apologies owed
for what was attempted in Russia,'' he said.
	   Critics of the IMF said the money it provided Russia went to
speculators who used rubles to buy dollars and then took them out
of the country.
	   Russia's former chief negotiator with the IMF, Anatoly Chubais,
also was quoted in a newspaper interview as saying he intentionally
misled the IMF in order to obtain the rescue package.
	   However, Fischer said the IMF sometimes has to take difficult
decisions.
	   The judgment on Russia was ``very, very difficult,'' he said.
But he noted that Russia had been making progress on reform for
seven years, stabilizing inflation and recording economic growth
from 1997.
	   With that in mind, ``the outside world _ through the IMF _
decided to weigh in on one side of that debate, recognizing that it
was not clear what the outcome would be.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With international pressure
mounting, Yugoslavia offered Thursday to let foreign experts
investigate massacres in Kosovo and local officials said combat
units had been removed from areas where the killings occurred.
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed
government troops shelled a village Thursday near Djakovica
(JA-kaw-vee-tsah) along the border with Albania, where separatist
guerrillas take sanctuary.
	   There was no confirmation from Serb sources. But the Yugoslav
army said Thursday that six soldiers were killed and seven wounded
in fighting Wednesday with ethnic Albanian rebels about 20
kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Djakovica.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the Kosovo Liberation Army
claimed it killed 25 police and army troops in the attack, which it
said was part of a new operation to strike ``the enemy where he
feels most secure.''
	   International efforts to end the seven-month conflict gained
momentum this week with reports that Serb police massacred dozens
of ethnic Albanian civilians southwest of here. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The U.N. Security Council was meeting Thursday in New York to
condemn the massacres and reinforce demands for an immediate
cease-fire. Serb officials have denied police were responsible.
	   But Robert Gelbard, the U.S. special envoy to the Balkans, told
the British Broadcasting Corporation that the latest massacre
reports have left the Yugoslav government with ``no credibility at
all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' he said. ``Our
people in Kosovo ... have verified that these atrocities have
occurred, that these latest atrocities that occurred piled on top
of previous ones.''
	   In an effort to head off possible NATO action in wake of the
massacres, Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic,
invited the International Committee of the Red Cross and the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees to send experts to Kosovo to
investigate the killings.

Hurt by Asia, troubled cognac producers take to streets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COGNAC, France (AP) _ Fallout from the Asian financial crisis is
causing a headache in this southwestern French town where cognac
producers, alarmed at dwindling sales, are angrily demanding aid.
	   For four days, cognac producers have manned roadblocks dotted
with smouldering fires to demand that authorities lower taxes and
give financial aid.
	   The roadblocks have caused major disruption: stocks at local
grocery stores are thinning, and gas stations have closed because
gas trucks have been unable to get through.
	   On Thursday, pickets lifted four roadblocks, but they still
protested in the streets.
	   Cognac producers say sales to Asia, a major market, have slumped
in recent months. Talks are currently going on with authorities
about their demands.
	   Hard times are also forcing a re-think: Europe-1 radio reported
Thursday that producers are thinking of diversification, including
a lighter cognac suited for aperitifs or cocktails.

University in Ghana shut after student protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ Ghana's second largest university was shut
down Thursday by administration authorities after student
demonstrators attacked the homes of several faculty members.
	   About 150 students wearing red bands and armed with clubs
marched through the University of Science and Technology campus
Wednesday night, attacking the homes of a senior university
administrator and several professors.
	   The protesters also cut pipes supplying water to staff housing
accommodations.
	   The university's Executive Council ordered the immediate closure
of the school to ``protect life and property,'' its acting
Vice-Chancellor Ambrose Tuah told reporters at a news conference in
Kumasi, where the university is located northwest of the capital,
Accra.
	   All students were expected to vacate the campus before Friday,
Tuah said.
	   The students said they were marching to protest a university
decision requiring them to share rooms, despite being made to pay
new annual dormitory fees introduced at the beginning of the year.
	   ``This is not enough to warrant vandalism,'' Tuah said. ``I'd
want to believe that there is more to it. ''
	   In August, students of the University of Ghana in Accra
demonstrated against the new dlrs 65 fee introduced by the
government to force them to share in campus utility costs and to
help maintain residential facilities.
	   They later agreed to pay after school authorities tied their
admission to its payment.
	   University authorities say they have no resources to expand
accommodations since students refuse to pay supplementary fees that
would be used to build more housing.
	   Overcrowding is a common problem on resident campuses at Ghana's
universities with up to four students sharing rooms intended for
only two.

Davenport loses to Tauziat, Williams advances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philippoussis beating Bjorkman &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ In her first match since clinching the
U.S. Open and closing in on the No. 1 ranking, Lindsay Davenport
stumbled Thursday at the Grand Slam Cup, losing in three sets to
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   ``It's a good wake-up call for me,'' Davenport said. ``The first
tournament in Europe, I need to play a lot better the next two
tournaments.''
	   Tauziat, the Wimbledon runner-up, rallied to win 4-6, 6-1, 7-5
despite 12 double-faults and 37 unforced errors.
	   Venus Williams made sure there will be at least one American in
the semifinals of the dlrs 6.7 million tournament when she beat
French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-3, 6-2. She will
next play Tauziat.
	   In a men's quarterfinal, Mark Philippoussis, one of the biggest
servers in the game, overcame Jonas Bjorkman, one of the best
returners, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1.
	   Philippoussis, the U.S. Open runner-up, served 13 aces and
battled back from a break down in the second set to turn the match
around.
	   Since losing to Tauziat in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon,
Davenport had won four tournaments, also beating the Frenchwoman on
the way to her U.S. Open title earlier this month.
	   ``I definitely felt a little bit rusty and definitely a bit
sluggish,'' said Davenport, who took a week off after the U.S.
Open.
	   ``I started hitting last week. I got in Monday, maybe a couple
of days here would have helped,'' she said.
	   ``I think losing here today might even help me because it's
definitely going to make me practice harder the next few days,''
Davenport said.
	   Davenport trails top-ranked Martina Hingis by only 26 points and
she could be the new No. 1 after next week's tournament in
Filderstadt, Germany. She will also play in Zurich, Switzerland.
	   ``I know it's going to be very tough because I know Martina is
going to play very well. I just hope I can play well, too,''
Davenport said.
	   ``But ranking has never been a huge priority of mine, it's never
been a huge, huge obsession of mine. Whatever happens with the
ranking happens. If it happens, I'll be very happy, though.
	   ``The one I wanted to win was the U.S. Open,'' Davenport said.
	   After splitting the first two sets, both Davenport and Tauziat
had trouble holding serve in the third.
	   Serving for the match at 5-4, Tauziat saw Davenport rip a
backhand passing shot that made it 5-5.
	   But Davenport again dropped her serve, allowing Tauziat to serve
for the match for the second time. Davenport saved one match point
with a lob but Tauziat fired her sixth ace to advance.
	   ``I had a chance to close the match earlier. I didn't do it. I
was lucky to finish at the end,'' Tauziat said.
	   Williams, ranked No. 5, has won the last three of her five
matches against Sanchez-Vicario. The American reached the
semifinals of the U.S. Open earlier this month by beating
Sanchez-Vicario and made the quarterfinals in the other three Grand
Slams.
	   Sanchez-Vicario won her fourth Grand Slam career title in Paris
this summer and is ranked No. 4 in the world.
	   The tournament, which awards no ranking points, nominally brings
together players with best records in the four Grand Slam events of
the year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But while only one of the year's Grand Slam champions among the
men is here _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda _ the eight women
included all the champions and all the top-ranked players except
Monica Seles.
	   Three Grand Slam champions already have been eliminated _
Davenport, Sanchez-Vicario and Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion
who was ousted Wednesday by Patty Schnyder.
	   Hingis, the Australian Open champion, plays Schnyder, her Swiss
teammate, in the other women's semifinal.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders said
Thursday that this week's top-level talks in Washington have moved
them closer to a West Bank troop pullback, but violence loomed
large.
	   In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, dozens of
Palestinian teen-agers took turns lighting firebombs and hurling
them at Israeli soldiers, who used stun grenades and rubber bullets
in response. Two Palestinians were injured. Palestinian policemen
nearby mostly watched and only made half-hearted efforts to stop
the youths.
	   Meanwhile, the leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said his group would make good on threats to
attack Israelis.
	   Palestinian intelligence said Thursday they had arrested a Hamas
activist and former chemistry student who stashed nearly a ton of
explosives in his home next to Palestinian police headquarters on
the outskirts of Hebron. The arrest came three days after a car
rigged with explosives and apparently being prepared for a suicide
attack by Hamas, prematurely blew-up in the Palestinian city of
Ramallah.
	   In Hebron Wednesday, two hand grenades were thrown at an Israeli
army outpost by a Palestinian assailant who fled the
Israeli-controlled sector of the city, back to Palestinian areas
shortly afterwards. Eleven soldiers and 11 Palestinian passersby
were injured in the attack and the Israeli army imposed a curfew
over the 30,000 Palestinians living under their control.
	   Israel filed a sharp protest with the Palestinian Authority,
saying it must do more to catch the fugitive.
	   The incidents have boosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's claims that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is
not doing enough to rein in militants. Netanyahu has said he would
hand over more land to Palestinian control only after receiving
assurance that the areas would not become havens for terrorists.
	   Israeli media reported that the army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Shaul Mofaz told the government Thursday that the army was on
high-alert due to intelligence warnings that Hamas is planning
several attacks.
	   Hamas's Yassin said at a news conference Thursday that his
group, which has carried out suicide bombings and other deadly
attacks against Israelis, was having trouble making good on its
threats to carry out further attacks but that ``a response will
come at the appropriate time, even if it is delayed.''
	   Both Netanyahu and Arafat said that they made progress during
talks in Washington Monday with U.S. President Bill Clinton aimed
at completing a deal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank, as proposed by the United States.
	   Netanyahu, who wants tougher security guarantees from the
Palestinians spelled out in the deal, said that the Palestinians
have agreed to most of the details in the plan. The premier briefed
his Cabinet Thursday on the Washington talks and Israel radio said
Netanyahu assured his hardline coalition partners that any deal
would be brought to Israel's parliament for approval before
signing.
	   Asked whether an agreement for a long overdue Israeli troop
pullout was within reach, Arafat told reporters: ``We have to wait
and see until the next meeting which will take place between myself
and Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.''
	   Albright is scheduled to return to the region next week for
preparatory talks with both leaders, before they return to
Washington in mid-October for another summit.
	   Arafat's aide, Nabil Abourdeneh said bilateral and trilateral
meetings during Albright and her team will be crucial to the
success of the next Washington summit. When they wrap-up ``we'll
have reached a breakthrough or a deadlock,'' he said.

Archaeologists find frozen mummies on volcano in Peru

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Archaeologists found six frozen mummies of
people sacrificed to Inca gods more than 500 years ago on a
snow-capped volcano in Peru's southern Andes.
	   The well-preserved mummies were found in two graves buried with
ceremonial pots, gold and silver statues, along with cloth blankets
burned by volcanic ash, Peruvian archaeologist Ruth Salas said
Thursday.
	   The find was made in mid-September near the crater of the
19,100-foot El Misti volcano, 465 miles southeast of Lima.
	   ``This is an important find because it shows that El Misti is
the mountain with the greatest number of human offerings in the
world,'' said Salas, coordinator of the archaeological team.
	   The same team of archaeologists, which included U.S.
mummy-hunter Johan Reinhard, in 1995 found a mummy known as ``The
Ice Princess'' atop a nearby mountain, thought to be the best
preserved mummy from the pre-Columbian era.
	   The Incas, whose empire covered most of the Andes along South
America's western coast before the Spanish arrived in the 16th
century, practiced human sacrifice to appease their gods.
	   Many mummies from Peru's pre-Columbian Indian cultures have been
found, but few have been frozen. Frozen mummies are better
preserved and can reveal more information, scientists say.

Tension mounts between Turkey and Syria over Kurdish rebels

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey said Thursday its ``patience was
running out'' over what it said was Syria's support to Turkish
Kurdish rebels and newspapers reported Turkey was massing troops
and armored vehicles on the border.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin denied the reports. An
intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the military was sending new armored vehicles
to the border to replace old ones but did not say why the
deployment was coming now.
	   President Suleyman Demirel ratted sabers in an appearance before
Parliament.
	   ``I declare to the world that we retain our right to counter
Syria, which has not given up its hostile attitude despite all our
warnings and peaceful approaches,'' Demirel said. ``Our patience is
running out.''
	   Legislators applauded his harsh words, a repeat of a threat last
month from Army Chief Atilla Ates.
	   One of several newspaper reports on the alleged deployment said
NATO-member Turkey had posted 10,000 soldiers at strategic points
along the border.
	   Witnesses told the mass-circulation Milliyet daily that convoys
of armored units were heading toward the frontier.
	   Turkey's Kurd rebels carry out cross-border attacks from bases
in Syria, Iraq and Iran. Turkey says the rebels' headquarters are
based in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon and that
their leader Abdullah Ocalan, lives in the Syrian capital of
Damascus.
	   Syria has denied sheltering the rebels. The Syrian Embassy in
Ankara did not return calls for comment Thursday.
	   ``We think the terrorist movement receives considerable support
from Syria,'' Foreign Minister Ismail Cem told private NTV
television on Thursday. ``We hope they understand our sensitivity
and this issue can be solved before it gets more tense.''
	   Cem said Syria had not responded to a Turkish offer made more
than two months ago to discuss the matter.
	   Syria is also at odds with Turkey over Ankara's plans to build
dams on the Euphrates River, a key source of water for Syria.
	   Turkey has said it would not negotiate a water-sharing agreement
unless Syria cracks down on the Kurdish rebels.
	   The antagonism has mounted since Turkey developed military ties
with Israel, Syria's biggest foe, in 1996. Turkey also is uneasy
with reported military rapprochement between Syria and Greece,
Turkey's traditional rival.
	   Turkey also accuses Syria of having aspirations over a Turkish
border province, Hatay, which has a sizable Arab population.
	   Hatay, which came under French rule after World War I and was
incorporated into Turkey following a 1939 plebiscite, was the scene
of some of the reported troop deployments.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders said
Thursday that this week's top-level talks in Washington have moved
them closer to a West Bank troop pullback, but violence loomed
large.
	   In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, dozens of
Palestinian teen-agers took turns lighting firebombs and hurling
them at Israeli soldiers, who used stun grenades and rubber bullets
in response. Two Palestinians were injured. Palestinian policemen
nearby mostly watched and only made half-hearted efforts to stop
the youths.
	   Meanwhile, the leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said his group would make good on threats to
attack Israelis.
	   Palestinian intelligence said Thursday that they arrested a
Hamas activist and former chemistry student who stashed nearly a
ton of explosives in his home next to Palestinian police
headquarters on the outskirts of Hebron. The arrest came three days
after a car rigged with explosives and apparently being prepared
for a suicide attack by Hamas, prematurely blew-up in the
Palestinian city of Ramallah.
	   In Hebron on Wednesday, two hand grenades were thrown at an
Israeli army outpost by a Palestinian assailant who fled the
Israeli-controlled sector back to Palestinian areas shortly
afterward. Eleven soldiers and 11 Palestinian passersby were
injured, and the Israeli army imposed a curfew over the 30,000
Palestinians living under their control.
	   Israel filed a sharp protest with the Palestinian Authority,
saying it must do more to catch the fugitive.
	   The incidents have boosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's claims that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is
not doing enough to rein in militants. Netanyahu has said he would
hand over more land to Palestinian control only after receiving
assurance that the areas would not become havens for terrorists.
	   Israeli media reported that the army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Shaul Mofaz, told the government Thursday that the army was on
high-alert due to intelligence warnings that Hamas is planning
several attacks.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Yassin said his group, which has
carried out suicide bombings and other deadly attacks against
Israelis, was having trouble making good on its threats to carry
out further attacks but that ``a response will come at the
appropriate time, even if it is delayed.''
	   Both Netanyahu and Arafat said they made progress during talks
Monday in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton aimed at
completing a deal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent
of the West Bank, as proposed by the United States.
	   Netanyahu, who wants tougher security guarantees from the
Palestinians, said the Palestinians have agreed to most of the
details in the plan. The premier briefed his Cabinet on Thursday on
the Washington talks and Israel radio said Netanyahu assured his
hard-line coalition partners that any deal would be brought to
Israel's parliament for approval before signing.
	   Asked whether an agreement for a long overdue Israeli troop
pullout was within reach, Arafat told reporters: ``We have to wait
and see until the next meeting which will take place between myself
and Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.''
	   Albright is scheduled to return to the region next week for
preparatory talks with both leaders before they return to
Washington in mid-October for another summit.
	   Arafat's aide, Nabil Abourdeneh, said bilateral and trilateral
meetings with Albright and her team will be crucial to the success
of the next Washington summit. When they wrap-up ``we'll have
reached a breakthrough or a deadlock,'' he said.

Turkey recalls ambassador to Italy for consultation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with ambassador to return this week, ADDs quote,
background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey recalled its ambassador to Rome for
consultation Thursday, angry that Italian lawmakers allowed Turkish
Kurd dissidents to meet in Italy's parliament building.
	   Turkey had strongly protested the meeting of the Kurdish group,
which calls itself Turkish Kurds' parliament-in-exile. Turkey says
the group is a political front for rebels fighting for Kurdish
autonomy in Turkey's southeast.
	   Ambassador Inal Batu is expected back in Turkey by the end of
the week, the Anatolia news agency reported.
	   Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini tried to appease Turkish
counterpart Ismail Cem in a letter, repeating Italy's explanation
that the Kurds had been invited by a group of Italian lawmakers and
not the government.
	   Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin told reporters that ``If
Italy does not understand its mistake and does not take the
necessary measures, our human and political relations will be
harmed.'' He did not elaborate.
	   Reports Thursday claimed that two Italian defense companies have
been dropped from dlrs 10 billion in potential contracts. The
Italian Embassy in Ankara and Turkey's Foreign Ministry said they
knew of no such move, however.
	   The first meeting of the parliament-in-exile caused a diplomatic
clash between the Netherlands and Turkey, which recalled its
ambassador for two months and suspended arms purchases from the
Dutch.
	   The Kurdish rebels and Turkey's army have been at war for 14
years. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.

Yugoslavia accepts call for investigation of the massacre claims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The Yugoslav government Thursday accepted
an Austrian call for an international investigation into reported
massacres of Kosovo Albanian civilians, the Austrian foreign
ministry said.
	   Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schluessel, current president of the
EU Council, demanded such an investigation after reports that
dozens of civilians, including children, were massacred by Serb
police.
	   Police have denied the allegations.
	   In a statement, the Austrian ministry said the Yugoslavs advised
that Finnish forensic experts had already been invited to take part
in the investigation.

Karlsson, Turner, Phillips equal course record on opening day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) _ Sweden's Robert Karlsson, Greg Turner of
New Zealand and England's Van Phillips all equaled the Royal Zoute
course record of 7-under-par 64 Thursday and shared the first-round
lead at the Belgian Belgacom Open.
	   The leading players took full advantage of the clear, windless
conditions to match the low round set by Spain's Miguel Angel
Jiminez in 1992.
	   Nick Faldo shot 65 for one of his best rounds this year and was
tied with Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson.
	   With one European Tour event remaining after this weekend, Lee
Westwood was trying to make the most of the absence of Scotland's
Colin Montgomerie and give himself a chance to squeeze past the
Order of Merit leader during the season-ending Volvo Masters at the
end of the month.
	   Westwood, who needs to win the 400,000-pound (dlrs 680,000)
Belgian Open to keep his challenge going, shot a 4-under-par 67.
The Englishman is 112,000 pounds (dlrs 190,400) behind
Montgomerie's leading 760,077 pounds (dlrs 1,292,130). A victory
Sunday will give Westwood 66,600 pounds (dlrs 113,220).
	   Karlsson, who finished second behind Montgomerie at the German
Masters last week, maintained his good form, shooting a bogey-free
round of seven birdies on the semi-links course.
	   ``It's great to go round on such a good course without a bogey
on your card,'' said the Swede, who is 18th on the European Tour
money list.
	   Montgomerie pulled out of the event at the last moment. Bernhard
Langer withdrew because of an illness in the family.
	   Royal Zoute has been kind to Faldo in the past and he won here
in 1994, the last time the Belgian Open was held. Seeking his form
of old, Faldo has been getting some good rounds together but none
better than Thursday, when he had eight birdies.
	   ``I don't know when I last did that,'' Faldo said of his birdie
string. ``I sank nearly everything.''
	   The course in the North Sea resort is tucked just inside the
coastline and when the winds get going, it is a tough challenge to
the world's greatest players. On Thursday, the course was at its
kindest, softened by a summer of heavy rains.

Contact Group nations send strong message to Bosnian leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Representatives of the six so-called Contact Group
nations sent a strong message Thurday to newly elected Bosnian
leaders that any roadblocks to peace will not be tolerated.
	   The group, which includes representatives from the United
States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia, met in London
to review the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation following last month's
elections.
	   Thursday's discussion was a prelude to the Contract Group's
gathering on Friday to address the volatile political situation in
the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians were found
massacred earlier this week.
	   Contact Group members said the Bosnian elections ``represented
modest but useful gains, notably in the development of political
pluralism,'' Britain's Foreign Office said.
	   The region's officeholders will be expected to adhere to the
1995 Dayton peace agreement, ``and to work for a strengthened and
united Bosnia,'' the group said.
	   The Contact Group's strategy for promoting peace in the region
will include supporting central institutions, moving forward with
returning minority refugees, sorting out housing problems and
organizing the media, the Foreign Office said.

Saddam orders armed training of civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein on Thursday
ordered the resumption of military training for civilians, who had
learned to fire light weapons during a crisis with the United
States earlier this year.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency said Saddam also instructed that
Iraqi airports be repaired and their buildings refurbished as soon
as possible. It gave no details.
	   Iraq's airports have been shut since the United Nations imposed
economic sanctions on the country in 1990 to punish it for its
invasion of Kuwait.
	   INA gave no details about Saddam's two directives and their
significance was not immediately clear.
	   ``The training of the people ... should proceed and not be
inflicted with stagnation and monotony,'' INA quoted Saddam as
telling a Cabinet meeting.
	   Iraq trained more than one million people beginning January when
the United States and Britain massed troops in the Gulf to force
Saddam to comply with U.N. resolutions on weapons inspections.
	   The training was not compulsory but many people saw it as
national duty. Volunteers were taught to fire automatic weapons and
rocket propelled grenades.
	   However, the frenzied activity at the parade grounds tapered off
after a war was averted following a Feb. 23 deal brokered by U.N.
chief Kofi Annan under which Saddam allowed inspections to resume.
	   Iraq suspended the inspections again on Aug. 5 and has vowed not
to reverse its stand unless the United Nations lifts the sanctions.
	   The Iraqi News Agency said the Cabinet approved measures to
boost people's training but did not elaborate.
	   It also reported that Saddam ordered funds to be set aside to
refurbish a border post with Saudi Arabia that is used by pilgrims.
	   The facilities at the complex will now be named Umm al-Ma'rik,
or mother of battles, Iraq's appellation for the 1991 Gulf War over
Kuwait.
	   Iraq's Muslim pilgrims to holy sites in Saudi Arabia have used
Arr'ar as a crossing into Saudi Arabia since the stoppage of the
flights.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With international pressure
mounting, Yugoslavia offered Thursday to let foreign experts
investigate massacres in its southern province of Kosovo, and local
officials said combat units had been removed from areas of the
killings.
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed
government troops shelled a village Thursday near Djakovica
(JA-kaw-vee-tsah) along the border with Albania, where separatist
guerrillas take sanctuary.
	   There was no confirmation from Serb sources. But the Yugoslav
army said Thursday that six soldiers were killed and seven wounded
in fighting Wednesday with ethnic Albanian rebels about 20
kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Djakovica.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the Kosovo Liberation Army
claimed it killed 25 police and army troops in the attack, which it
said was part of a new operation to strike ``the enemy where he
feels most secure.''
	   International efforts to end the seven-month conflict gained
momentum this week with reports that Serb police massacred dozens
of ethnic Albanian civilians southwest of here. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   In New York, the U.N. Security Council was meeting Thursday to
condemn the massacres and reinforce demands for an immediate
cease-fire. Serb officials have denied police were responsible.
	   But Robert Gelbard, the U.S. special envoy to the Balkans, told
the British Broadcasting Corporation that the latest massacre
reports have left the Yugoslav government with ``no credibility at
all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' he said. ``Our
people in Kosovo ... have verified that these atrocities have
occurred, that these latest atrocities that occurred piled on top
of previous ones.''
	   In an effort to head off possible NATO action after the
massacres, Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic,
invited the International Committee of the Red Cross and the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees to send experts to investigate the
killings.
	   Later, the government's Tanjug news agency said an invitation
was sent to a team of Finnish forensic experts to join Yugoslav
investigators in a joint probe.
	   Also Thursday, the Serb Media Center here announced that combat
forces had been removed from areas of conflict and that ``only
police units needed to preserve public security and order and guard
communications, are out in the field.''
	   There was no immediate comment from international observers in
Kosovo, although reporters saw troop convoys heading toward
barracks near this provincial capital.
	   Despite those moves, allegations of Serb atrocities continued.
The ethnic Albanian center said bodies of a dozen males, including
a 15-year-old, were found Thursday in the Suva Reka (SOO-vah
RAY-kah) region about 45 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
Pristina.
	   The report could not be confirmed. It was also unclear whether
the men _ mostly of fighting age _ were KLA rebels.
	   On Wednesday, residents of Golubovac said Serb forces surrounded
a group of refugees last Saturday, separated 13 men and shot them.
Farmer Naim Hodzaj said Serb police also killed several other men,
including his 37-year-old brother Ramadan who doused with gasoline
and set on fire. A burned body lay on a path on the edge of the
woods.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in nearby Obrija, eight
kilometers (five miles) north of Golubovac. The dead included women
and children.
	   In a separate incident, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch said Serb
police attacked a convoy of civilian vehicles Tuesday in Vranic
(VRAW-nitch) in southwestern Kosovo.
	   The New York organization said one of its researchers saw the
bodies of four ethnic Albanian men who had been killed, including
one whose face had been mutilated.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, Deputy Premier Vojislav Seselj
said the bodies seen by reporters were planted by ethnic Albanians
as part of an ``orchestrated propaganda war.''
	   Seselj claimed Western countries staged the massacre ``to push
through ... a NATO attack decision in the U.N. Security Council.''
Seselj threatened to retaliate against NATO soldiers abroad, as
well as foreigners and pro-western Serbs in Yugoslavia.
	   ``We do not underestimate NATO strength, but we have to defend
ourselves,'' he said. ``Maybe we would not be able to bring down
their missiles or planes, but their soldiers all around the world
will be our enemies and subjected to our attacks wherever they are
available.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Fourteen ethnic Albanian men were
forced to the ground, hands behind their heads. A Serb policeman
then passed down the line firing short bursts of automatic fire
into each of them, killing them all. All but one.
	   At least that's the testimony Thursday of the man who survived,
according to Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch. Bouckert called
him ``perhaps the most important witness to what appears to be a
summary execution that has emerged in Kosovo up to now.''
	   It is one more grim tale in a human conflict that grows more
tragic every day in this Serbian province. Police deny involvement
in massacres. The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry announced it invited a
team of forensic experts from Finland to help investigate.
	   Bouckaert said the witness, a man in his early 40s whom he
declined to identify further, was in extreme danger, both from
severe gunshot wounds in the leg and upper arm and from police
forces in the area.
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected
and there is no adquate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   The investigator from Human Rights Watch, a private New
York-based organization, said the survivor's story was corroborated
by other witnesses from the village of Golubovac, about five
kilometers (three miles) from Donje Obrinje, site of another
massacre.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor told him this tale:
	   Last Friday the area came under shelling and civilians in the
town, Golubovac, fled into the forest, where they spent the night.
Shooting and shelling continued throughout the night. Saturday
morning, Serb police sent some old men to tell the people to come
out of the woods, that they would be safe.
	   About 30 or 40 policemen gathered the people in a field, where
the men were separated out. The survivor said the men were checked
for weapons or evidence they belonged to the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. Police selected about 20-25 men, but the older
ones were eventually let go.
	   The others, including the survivor and his brother, were
questioned about ties to the KLA, then kicked and struck with
rifles. The men were taken to a road and made to squat for about
two hours.
	   They were moved to a hedgerow near the entrance to a farm
compound where they were forced to lie on their stomachs with their
hands behind their heads. All were beaten and kicked and told if
they would say who in the group was KLA, the rest would be let go.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   ``He heard somebody shout, `Hey, this one's still alive,''' said
Bouckaert. And they shot him. The survivor said he didn't move when
he was kicked. He said he waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled
to his home, where he met his mother and his wife.
	   Bouckaert said all of the bodies had been buried. Though
villagers offered to dig them up as evidence, he declined.
	   ``He appeared credible, he didn't contradict himself and his
story was corroborated by other witnesses,'' said the human rights
worker. ''He didn't seem to be exaggerating.''
	   Did it happen exactly as the survivor said?
	   Bouckaert said a full investigatioan was needed.
	   ''From what we have seen, we are quite convinced executions took
place at this site.''

Belarusian president said banks lost millions in Russian crisis

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Commercial banks in Belarus lost dlrs 200
million because of the financial crisis in neighboring Russia,
President Alexander Lukashenko said Thursday.
	   ``What were you thinking about?'' Lukashenko asked business
leaders attending a conference.
	   ``For what purpose did you buy those papers?'' he said,
referring to Russian government treasury bonds that have become
virtually worthless as a result of the crisis.
	   ``The best bank is a stocking in your own country,'' he said.
Many residents of the former Soviet Union remain distrustful of
banks and prefer to keep their savings at home, under their
mattress or in a sock.
	   Lukashenko also said that Russia appeared to be borrowing some
of Belarus' economic practices to solve its financial crisis.
Belarus has done little to dismantle the Soviet command economy,
and the Russian government is reportedly considering an economic
plan that would restore many Soviet-era economic controls, such as
state ownership and currency controls.
	   ``What we have already done here today coincides with what the
Russian government is going to do in the best sense of this word,''
Lukashenko said at a news conference.
	   ``I was very glad that, in principle, Russia has looked a bit on
her elder brother and has synchronized some processes with those
that are taking place in Belarus.''
	   Lukashenko said Belarus has a large reserve of food for what is
expected to be a colder-than-average winter. He said the reserves
are larger even than they were in Soviet times. Many consumers
complain, however, about empty store shelves.

Financial giant is latest Dutch multinational to issue profit
</HEADLINE>
warning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch financial services giant ING
Groep NV issued a profit warning Thursday, saying the financial
crisis in Asia will cut more deeply into its profit than first
expected.
	   In a news release issued after Amsterdam Stock Exchange closed,
ING said earnings per share will rise by just 15 percent over the
whole of the year, taking net profit to 5.6 billion guilders (dlrs
3.01 billion), from 4.11 billion guilders (dlrs 2.21 billion) in
1997.
	   ING was the latest in a string of Dutch multinationals to warn
that the global economic turmoil would hit its earnings. KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines, oil giant Shell and electronics company Philips
also have warned they have been hit by the financial crisis.
	   Earlier this year, ING increased its profit forecast, saying it
expected earnings per share to rise by between 30 percent and 35
percent from 5.25 guilders (dlrs 2.82) a year earlier.
	   In its news release, ING said that increased problems in
emerging markets will force it to reconsider its strategic
positioning in that field.
	   ``The financial crisis in Asia and other parts of the world has
worsened since the publication of the half-year results in
August,'' ING said. In August, the bank said it would cut 1,200
jobs at ING Barings to slash costs by 25 percent.
	   ING said that based on current knowledge the profit contribution
from corporate and investment banking activities in emerging
markets will be 1.5 billion guilders (dlrs 806.4 million) less than
first expected.
	   The profit reduction is the result of losses on trading
portfolios, greatly diminished volumes in international financial
business and the need to make extra provisions, ING said.
	   The extra provisions are mainly from ``the insolvency of the
Russian banking system,'' ING said.
	   A spokesman at ING said the company will look to see where it
can make further job cuts, but could not indicate how many
positions may go. He said ING Barings' new CFO, David Robins, will
focus on cost reductions.

Mexican government, opposition strike deal on dlrs 55 billion bank

rescue &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican government and opposition
lawmakers have reached a tentative agreement on a dlrs 55 billion
bank rescue fund that had become the most divisive issue in Mexican
politics _ and potentially the most damaging for the ruling party.
	   Under the agreement, which is subject to congressional approval,
audits of private-bank loans bought by the government in 1995 and
1996 would continue, but credits of more than dlrs 500,000 would be
turned back over to banks for collection.
	   Banks then would be in charge ``of the management of such big
corporate loans and assume potential losses,'' according to a draft
of the agreement, announced Wednesday by the government and one of
the country's two main opposition parties.
	   Such credits account for about one-third of the total bank
bailout fund. Small debtors would get discount and aid programs to
help them pay back loans.
	   The remaining two-thirds of the dlrs 55 billion would not be
assumed as government debt, as originally proposed, but would
instead be either collected or sold off by a governmental agency,
reducing the burden on tax payers.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the
pro-business National Action Party have enough votes to get the
deal through Congress, despite the fact that the other main
opposition party, the leftist Democratic Revolution, boycotted
talks on the arrangement.
	   Democratic Revolution lawmakers had led criticism against the
administration of President Ernesto Zedillo over the bank rescue
fund, which bought bad loans from private banks after the 1994 peso
devaluation nearly toppled the country's financial system.
	   The arrangement would continue efforts to disclose fraudulent
multimillion-dollar loans made by banks that since have been taken
over by the government and sold off to private investors.
	   Zedillo's administration also has been stung by revelations that
some of the loans in the bailout fund were channeled to his party
as campaign donations. But the accord pledges ``no impunity'' for
those accused of defrauding banks.
	   In return for accepting the deal, which would probably increase
losses in the already battered banking sector, the five banks still
under original management could turn a similar amount of smaller
non-performing loans to the government fund for collection or sale
at a discount.
	   The tentative accord also calls for legal reforms of the
financial system, such as regulations governing bankruptcies. Many
large corporate debtors reportedly overestimated the value of the
collateral pledges they gave on the loans.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) - Fourteen ethnic Albanian men were
forced to the ground, hands behind their heads. A Serb policeman
then passed down the line firing short bursts of automatic fire
into each of them, killing them all. All but one.
	   At least that's the testimony Thursday of the man who survived,
according to Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch. Bouckert called
him ``perhaps the most important witness to what appears to be a
summary execution that has emerged in Kosovo up to now.''
	   It is one more grim tale in a human conflict that grows more
tragic every day in this Serbian province. Police deny involvement
in massacres. The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry announced it invited a
team of forensic experts from Finland to help investigate.
	   Bouckaert said the witness, a man in his early 40s whom he
declined to identify further, was in extreme danger, both from
severe gunshot wounds in the leg and upper arm and from police
forces in the area.
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected
and there is no adquate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   The investigator from Human Rights Watch, a private New
York-based organization, said the survivor's story was corroborated
by other witnesses from the village of Golubovac, about five
kilometers (three miles) from Donje Obrinje, site of another
massacre.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor told him this tale:
	   Last Friday the area came under shelling and civilians in the
town, Golubovac, fled into the forest, where they spent the night.
Shooting and shelling continued throughout the night. Saturday
morning, Serb police sent some old men to tell the people to come
out of the woods, that they would be safe.
	   About 30 or 40 policemen gathered the people in a field, where
the men were separated out. The survivor said the men were checked
for weapons or evidence they belonged to the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. Police selected about 20-25 men, but the older
ones were eventually let go.
	   The others, including the survivor and his brother, were
questioned about ties to the KLA, then kicked and struck with
rifles. The men were taken to a road and made to squat for about
two hours.
	   They were moved to a hedgerow near the entrance to a farm
compound where they were forced to lie on their stomachs with their
hands behind their heads. All were beaten and kicked and told if
they would say who in the group was KLA, the rest would be let go.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   ``He heard somebody shout, `Hey, this one's still alive,''' said
Bouckaert. And they shot him. The survivor said he didn't move when
he was kicked. He said he waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled
to his home, where he met his mother and his wife.
	   Bouckaert said all of the bodies had been buried. Though
villagers offered to dig them up as evidence, he declined. There
was also no explanation how the man managed to keep silence after
being wounded with automatic fire.

final &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ The Costa Rican federation says
Francisco Maturana is their new coach, but the former Colombian and
Ecuadoran national team manager said Thursday that nothing is
official.
	   Costa Rican federation president Alvaro Pochet made the
announcement of Maturana's hiring Wednesday night.
	   ``It's an ambitious plan. We are talking about something on a
grand scale. The goal is the 2002 World Cup,'' Pochet said.
	   But in Medellin, Colombia, on Thursday, Maturana said while his
agent Jose Castano may have worked out a salary agreement, many
things still had to be worked out between himself and the Costa
Rican federation.
	   ``I understand from the information in the press that an
agreement has been reached by Mr. Castano with the federation,''
Maturana said. ``Now, what follows is that Francisco Maturana will
have to talk sports aspects.
	   ``It is vital that I meet with federation officials to know what
are the objectives, intentions, goals and if they have the means to
achieve them.''
	   As coach of Colombia, Maturana qualified the country for the
1990 and 1994 World Cups. However, he was unable to do the same
with Ecuador in 1998.
	   Costa Rican reports said the deal was approved after Maturana's
agent and the federation agreed to have Luis Fernando Suarez serve
as the team's assistant coach. In turn, Maturana agreed to also
work with Costa Rican assistants.
	   Terms of the four-year contract were not released. Media reports
speculated it was worth about dlrs 420,000 a year.
	   For a country as small as Costa Rica, which has just 3.5 million
people, the contract with Maturana is a giant step. Pochet said the
federation hopes Maturana's reputation will attract private patrons
and greater government support for the team.
	   Costa Rican began an intense search for a new coach after
failing to qualify for the 1994 and 1998 World Cups. The nation's
only success in qualifying came in 1990.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An Austrian Airlines flight bound for
Amsterdam had to return to Vienna Thursday for ``technical
reasons,'' airport authorities reported
	   The plane left at 5:20 p.m. (1520 GMT). It was unclear what
prompted the pilot to turn around and land again on Vienna's
Schwechat airport.
	   The Austria Press Agency quoted airport officials as saying
flight OS 485 was rescheduled with a different plane leaving for
Amsteram-Schiphol airport.
	   The incident kept an Austrian government delegation led by

Swiss teenager Federer shocks Fromberg; Tarango eliminated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ Junior Wimbledon champion Roger Federer
pulled off his second sensational result at the Toulouse Open
tennis tournament Thursday when he beat No. 7 seed Richard Fromberg
in straight sets.
	   Federer, who turned 17 in August, has now beaten two top 50
players in what is his first professional tournament.
	   In the first round, the young Swiss defeated France's Guillaume
Raoux, 6-2, 6-2.
	   Federer, who entered the Toulouse tournament with a world
ranking of 878, began in outstanding form against Australia's
Fromberg, demonstrating speed around the court, powerful serves and
accurate returns to take the opening set 6-1.
	   Fromberg held his own in the second set, but lost the tiebreak
7-5.
	   In the quarterfinal, Federer will face the winner of the second
round contest between No. 2 seed Jan Siemerink and Jerome Golmard.
	   Jeff Tarango crashed out in the second round, losing to
Switzerland's Marc Rosset in straight sets.
	   Tarango, the U.S.'s only entrant here, lost 6-3, 6-4.
	   Martin Sinner, seeded No. 8, was a surprise loser to unseeded
Frenchman Arnaud Clement, collapsing 7-1 in a third-set tiebreaker.
	   Clement's countryman Stephane Huet also caused a shock, beating
Armenia's Sargis Sargsian 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3.
	   No. 3 seed Thomas Johansson qualified for the last eight,
beating Czech Daniel Vacek, 6-4, 6-3.
	   Britain's Greg Rusedski, No. 1 seed, had few problems overcoming
Ukraine's Andrei Medvedev, 6-4, 6-3.

Witness says 13 men executed after hours of questioning

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A human rights investigator said
Thursday that a wounded ethnic Albanian claimed Serb police beat
and shot him and 13 others after questioning them about ties to
Kosovo rebels. The man said he was the only survivor.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch called the man, whom he
did not name, ``perhaps the most important witness to what appears
to be a summary execution that has emerged in Kosovo up to now.''
	   Police have denied massacring civilians in the Serbian-ruled
province. The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry announced it invited a team
of forensic experts from Finland to help investigate reported
massacres.
	   Bouckaert said the witness, a man in his early 40s whom he
declined to identify further, was in extreme danger, both from
severe gunshot wounds in the leg and upper arm and from police
forces in the area.
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected
and there is no adquate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   The investigator from Human Rights Watch, a private New
York-based organization, said the survivor's story was corroborated
by other witnesses from the village of Golubovac, about five
kilometers (three miles) from Donje Obrinje, site of another
massacre.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor told him this tale:

town, Golubovac, fled into the forest, where they spent the night.
Shooting and shelling continued throughout the night. Saturday

	   About 30 or 40 policemen gathered the people in a field, where
the men were separated out. The survivor said the men were checked
for weapons or evidence they belonged to the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army. Police selected about 20-25 men, but the older
ones were eventually let go.
	   The others, including the survivor and his brother, were
questioned about ties to the KLA, then kicked and struck with
rifles. The men were taken to a road and made to squat for about
two hours.
	   They were moved to a hedgerow near the entrance to a farm
compound where they were forced to lie on their stomachs with their
hands behind their heads. All were beaten and kicked and told if
they would say who in the group was KLA, the rest would be let go.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   ``He heard somebody shout, `Hey, this one's still alive,''' said
Bouckaert. And they shot him. The survivor said he didn't move when
he was kicked. He said he waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled
to his home, where he met his mother and his wife.
	   There was no explanation how, after being wounded with bursts of
automatic fire, the man managed to keep silent or how he managed to
make it back to his home.
	   Bouckaert said all of the bodies had been buried. Though
villagers offered to dig them up as evidence, he declined.
	   ``He appeared credible, he didn't contradict himself and his
story was corroborated by other witnesses,'' said the human rights
worker. ''He didn't seem to be exaggerating.''
	   Did it happen exactly as the survivor said?
	   Bouckaert said a full investigatioan was needed.
	   ''From what we have seen, we are quite convinced executions took
place at this site.''

	   KINGSTOWN, St. Vincent (AP) _ Police charged a 25-year-old man
Thursday with strangling a German woman on the Caribbean resort
island of Bequia.
	   Sylvester Lewis, 25, faces a possible death sentence in the
killing of Heike Ruhl, 37, of Cologne. Ruhl's body was found Monday
in bushes near popular Princess Margaret Beach.
	   Lewis, who was brought to St. Vincent on Thursday from Bequia,
was charged and jailed in the capital, Kingstown. He did not enter
a plea, and no date was set for his trial.
	   Prosecutors said preliminary inquiry hearings will likely not
begin until next year.
	   Investigators said Ruhl was living on Bequia for four months and
was engaged to a Bequia resident, Gerrit Antrobus. They had lived
previously in Barbados, according to the Herald, the island's
newspaper.
	   ``Even in the short time that she was here, she had already made
many friends and had quickly been welcomed into our community,''
the Herald said in an obituary to appear in Friday's edition. It
said the island ``has been profoundly shocked by Heike's death.''
	   Lewis was detained Tuesday, but acting Prime Minister John Horne
said prosecutors waited for autopsy results before charging him.
	   ``It is for us to see that justice is done in a normal course of
proceedings,'' Horne said. ``We are talking about a sensitive
matter.''
	   Bequia is a 7-square-mile (18-square-kilometer) island of about
5,000 people 10 miles (15 kilometers) south of St. Vincent in the
Grenadines island chain. It is known for its quiet beaches and
forests and is a popular vacation spot for boat owners.
	   The island attracted international attention when police charged
a U.S. couple, James and Penny Fletcher, with murdering a local
boat-taxi driver in October 1996. The Fletchers were acquitted in
August 1997.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A human rights investigator said
Thursday that a wounded ethnic Albanian claimed Serb police beat

Kosovo rebels. The man said he was the only survivor.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch called the survivor
``perhaps the most important witness to what appears to be a
summary execution that has emerged in Kosovo up to now.''
	   It is one more grim tale in a human conflict that grows more
tragic every day in the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians who comprise 90 percent of the population are fighting
for independence. Police deny involvement in the massacres.
	   Bouckaert declined to identify further the survivor, who is in
his early 40s. He said the man suffered severe gunshot wounds in
the leg and upper arm and was in danger from police forces.
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected,
and there is no adequate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   The survivor's story was corroborated by other witnesses from
the village of Golubovac, which came under shelling last Friday,
forcing civilians to flee into the forest, where they spent the
night. The village is about five kilometers (three miles) from
Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor ``appeared credible, he didn't
contradict himself ... He didn't seem to be exaggerating.''
	   The survivor said that after the shelling, Serb police sent some
old men Saturday to tell the people to come out and that they would
be safe, Bouckaert said. About 30 or 40 policemen gathered the
people in a field, where the men were separated and checked for
weapons or evidence that they belonged to the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Police selected about 20-25 men, but the older ones were
eventually let go. The others, including the survivor and his
brother, were questioned about ties to the KLA, then kicked and
struck with rifles. The men were taken to a road and made to squat
for about two hours.
	   Then they were moved to a hedgerow near the entrance to a farm
compound where they were forced to lie on their stomachs with their
hands behind their heads. All were beaten and kicked and told if
they would say who in the group was KLA, the rest would be let go.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of

he was kicked. He said he waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled
to his home, where he met his mother and his wife.
	   	   There was also no explanation how the man managed to keep
silence after being wounded with automatic fire.
	   Bouckaert said all of the bodies were buried. Though villagers
offered to dig them up as evidence, he declined.
	   ``From what we have seen, we are quite convinced executions took
place at this site.''

Slovak opposition says Meciar's departure can't come too soon

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new grafs 6-8 with National Bank removing

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition leaders on Thursday
hailed Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's announcement that he will
resign in a month and said his departure can't come soon enough.
	   ``He should not prolong his time in office,'' said Jozef
Moravcik, who was prime minister for six months in 1994 and now is
a top representative of the opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   Meciar, Slovakia's authoritarian ruler for virtually its entire
six years of independence, said in an emotional TV appearance
Wednesday night that he would quit when the new Parliament convenes
Oct. 29.
	   In his first public comments since parliamentary elections last
Friday and Saturday, he said on a talk show on state TV that he
would not serve in the new legislature or seek any government
office. But he left open whether he would step down as chairman of
the ruling Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.
	   He also sang an impromptu farewell song to Slovaks with tears in
his eyes: ``God be with you, I did not hurt any of you.''
	   In a move expected to result in a devaluation of the national
currency, koruna, the Slovak National Bank on Thursday removed its
fluctuation band used to guide the currency and allowed the koruna
to float freely, according to a central bank statement.
	   ``The National Bank is not going to guarantee a fixed exchange
rate of the koruna any more,'' the statement said. ``The koruna
exchange rate will be set by the foreign exchange market.''
	   It said devaluation expectations among people were increased by
``the combination of the current account deficit, created mostly by
the foreign trade deficit and a deficit in the public sector,
combined with the parliamentary elections.''
	   Meciar's ouster as premier was forced by last week's national
elections, in which his governing party was outpolled by opposition
parties. But the opposition and some analysts had expected that the
56-year-old Meciar, who has been widely criticized for
anti-democratic practices, might fight to cling to power.

Davenport loses to Tauziat, Williams advances
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rios beating Mantilla &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ In her first match since clinching the
U.S. Open and closing in on the No. 1 ranking, Lindsay Davenport
stumbled Thursday at the Grand Slam Cup, losing in three sets to
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   ``It's a good wake-up call for me,'' Davenport said. ``The first
tournament in Europe, I need to play a lot better the next two
tournaments.''
	   Tauziat, the Wimbledon runner-up, rallied to win 4-6, 6-1, 7-5
despite 12 double-faults and 37 unforced errors.
	   Venus Williams made sure there will be at least one American in
the semifinals of the dlrs 6.7 million tournament when she beat
French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario 6-3, 6-2. She will
next play Tauziat.
	   In men's quarterfinals, Mark Philippoussis, one of the biggest
servers in the game, beat Jonas Bjorkman, one of the best
returners, 4-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, while Marcelo Rios defeated Felix
Mantilla 7-6 (7-2), 7-5.
	   Philippoussis, the U.S. Open runner-up, served 13 aces and
battled back from a break down in the second.
	   Rios, at No. 3 the highest ranked men's player in the field,
wasted two match points on Mantilla's serve at 5-4. But he got the
next, also on Mantilla's serve, with a backhand volley.
	   Since losing to Tauziat in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon,
Davenport had won four tournaments, also beating the Frenchwoman on
the way to her U.S. Open title earlier this month.
	   ``I definitely felt a little bit rusty and definitely a bit
sluggish,'' said Davenport, who took a week off after the U.S.
Open.
	   ``I started hitting last week. I got in Monday, maybe a couple
of days here would have helped,'' she said.
	   ``I think losing here today might even help me because it's
definitely going to make me practice harder the next few days,''
Davenport said.
	   Davenport trails top-ranked Martina Hingis by only 26 points and
she could be the new No. 1 after next week's tournament in
Filderstadt, Germany. She will also play in Zurich, Switzerland.
	   ``I know it's going to be very tough because I know Martina is
going to play very well. I just hope I can play well, too,''
Davenport said.
	   ``But ranking has never been a huge priority of mine, it's never
been a huge, huge obsession of mine. Whatever happens with the
ranking happens. If it happens, I'll be very happy, though.
	   ``The one I wanted to win was the U.S. Open,'' Davenport said.
	   After splitting the first two sets, both Davenport and Tauziat
had trouble holding serve in the third.
	   Serving for the match at 5-4, Tauziat saw Davenport rip a
backhand passing shot that made it 5-5.
	   But Davenport again dropped her serve, allowing Tauziat to serve
for the match for the second time. Davenport saved one match point
with a lob but Tauziat fired her sixth ace to advance.
	   ``I had a chance to close the match earlier. I didn't do it. I
was lucky to finish at the end,'' Tauziat said.
	   Williams, ranked No. 5, has won the last three of her five
matches against Sanchez-Vicario. The American reached the
semifinals of the U.S. Open earlier this month by beating
Sanchez-Vicario and made the quarterfinals in the other three Grand
Slams.
	   Sanchez-Vicario won her fourth Grand Slam career title in Paris
this summer and is ranked No. 4 in the world.
	   The tournament, which awards no ranking points, nominally brings
together players with best records in the four Grand Slam events of
the year _ the Australian, French and U.S. Open and Wimbledon.
	   But while only one of the year's Grand Slam champions among the
men is here _ Australian Open champion Petr Korda _ the eight women
included all the champions and all the top-ranked players except
Monica Seles.
	   Three Grand Slam champions already have been eliminated _
Davenport, Sanchez-Vicario and Jana Novotna, the Wimbledon champion
who was ousted Wednesday by Patty Schnyder.
	   Hingis, the Australian Open champion, plays Schnyder, her Swiss
teammate, in the other women's semifinal.

Moroccan leader urges France to reschedule its debt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with new Youssoufi quotes

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi said
Thursday he hoped France would allow the North African country to
reschedule its debt payments to allow it to better use the
financial means at its disposal.
	   ``Morocco has a difficult task ahead ... one that has raised
hopes not just in Morocco but in the region,'' Youssoufi said in an
interview with television channel France 2.
	   ``But we need to be able to use the means at our disposal, and a
large amount of that is taken away by our creditors,'' he added.
	   Morocco's debt is estimated at dlrs 19 billion, equivalent to
almost 60 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Moroccan
Finance Minister Fathallah Oalalou has estimated that 17 percent of
the debt is with France.
	   The subject of debt repayment has topped the agenda during the
two-day visit which ends Friday.
	   Youssoufi, who took office earlier this year, met President
Jacques Chirac Thursday, but did not say whether there were any
indications France would accept his appeal.
	   ``We're only at half time,'' he said. ``We've still got a day of
work ahead of us, a day of negotiations and exchanges _ we'll
see.''
	   Earlier Thursday he spoke of ``the high hopes'' of the Moroccan
people that France would agree to reschedule repayments.
	   Before lunching at the Elysee Palace, Youssoufi visited the tomb
of French resistant leader Jean Moulin in the Pantheon.
	   During his visit, Youssoufi also will meet with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and other officials.

WWF: one-third of earth's natural wealth lost in 25 years
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: World Wide Fund for Nature is known as World Wildlife Fund in
North America. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GLAND, Switzerland (AP) _ The planet lost almost a third of its
natural resources and animals between 1970 and 1995, the World Wide
Fund for Nature said in a study released Thursday.
	   Worst hit were freshwater environments such as rivers and lakes
with species declining at a rate of some 6 percent annually between
1990 and 1995, according to the 36-page Living Planet Report.
	   ``These figures are a stark indication of the deteriorating
health of natural ecosystems,'' said Jonathan Loh, one of the
report's authors.
	   ``Most concerning of all is the decline of freshwater lakes,
rivers and wetlands'' which, the study said, may contain as little
as half the number of creatures in 1995 they possessed in 1970.
	   The populations of more than half of 227 species of freshwater
birds, fish and mammals tracked had shrunk. Less than 10 percent
had increased in number.
	   The report estimated human pressure on natural resources is
growing at a rate of around 5 percent per year. The figure is based
on consumption of grain, sea fish, wood, fresh water and cement,
and emissions of carbon dioxide.
	   Most of the world's fish stocks are either fully exploited or in
decline because of overfishing, the report said.
	   It put the average annual catch of sea fish for the early 1990s
at 84 million tons, double the catch in 1960. On top of that, some
27 million tons of fish annually are caught and then discarded, it
said.
	   The number of creatures in the seas and oceans over the 25-year
period studied dropped by an estimated 30 percent, while some 10
percent of the world's natural forest cover was lost.
	   The study recommends further controls on fishing and the removal
of government fishing subsidies, more efficient water use by
farmers, pollution controls and limits on the expansion of cities
into the countryside.
	   The report, based on information from national statistics and
international studies, was produced in association with the World
Conservation Monitoring Center and the New Economics Foundation, a
British-based research and campaigning group.

Italy's leader urges Milosevic to act to avoid `international

repercussions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's premier called Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Thursday to urge him to do whatever it takes to calm
the crisis in Kosovo and avoid international intervention.
	   Reports of massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in the
separatist province have heightened the likelihood of NATO
airstrikes against military targets in Yugoslavia.
	   In his telephone call, Prodi appealed to Milosevic to ``take all
necessary measures to restore a climate of trust so as to avoid a
further worsening of the situation in Kosovo and possible
international repercussions.''
	   Prodi urged Milosevic to invite the United Nations to send a
team to investigate the facts of the conflict and the humanitarian
needs of the province's people.
	   He also asked Milosevic to start negotiations with leaders of
the province's ethnic Albanian majority.

Bird to be inducted into Hall of Fame
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JEFF DONN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Massachusetts (AP) _ While Michael Jordan and Magic
Johnson have engaged the public in ways other than basketball,
Larry Bird has done it in just one way: with his game.
	   It was enough to elevate him above others, for both the public
and the Basketball Hall of Fame.
	   ``He let his game speak for him,'' said Lenny Wilkens, coach of
the Atlanta Hawks. ``There were a lot of guys like that when I was
coming up. That was the tenor of the times. He's a throwback.''
	   Bird will be inducted Friday night into the Hall of Fame, along
with players Marques Haynes of the Harlem Globetrotters and Arnie
Risen, a member of the Boston Celtics like Bird.
	   Other inductees are coaches Alex Hannum of the 1967 NBA champion
Philadelphia 76ers, Jody Conradt of the University of Texas, and
Aleksandar Nikolic of the former Yugoslavia.
	   Wilkens, who was inducted as a player in 1989, will be honored
again, this time as the winningest coach in NBA history.
	   Asked Thursday how he wanted to be remembered, Bird said simply:
``The way I played the game.''
	   ``I always thought I played the game at a level that I was
pleased with,'' he said. ``I always tried to play as hard as I
possibly could and I always prepared myself to play.''
	   With his magical knack for winning, his untiring hustle and
consistency even through injury, Bird very much fanned the fiery,
television-driven growth of the modern NBA. Yet he often seemed to
hail from an earlier generation than other superstars of his time.
	   The product of small-town life from Indiana, Bird, 41, has kept
a strong sense of privacy throughout his spectacular career. Not
flashy or telegenic, Bird has endorsed fewer products than Jordan.
	   He let his basketball do his entertaining. He won three NBA
championships and had career averages of 24.3 points, 10 rebounds
and 6.3 assists.
	   K.C. Jones, who coached Bird at Boston, said he simply didn't
want to be a public personality. ``Bird is a Marine: get down in
the trenches and go from there _ without all the French pastry,''
he said.
	   Growing up in West Baden, just outside French Lick, Larry Joe
Bird fell in love with basketball at age 13. At first, he was told
he was too small, weak and slow _ and a bad jumper. He grew to a
sturdy 6-foot-9, but the slights about his speed and jumping nagged
him through his days as an NBA forward. Yet his powerful drive to
win was rarely denied after 1974, when he dropped out of Indiana as
a freshman.
	   He eventually played so well for Indiana State that the Celtics
drafted him as a junior. But he went back for his senior year, and
his team lost only one game that season: the NCAA championship to
Michigan State and its star, Johnson.
	   Beginning with the Celtics in 1979 until his retirement in 1992,
he led Boston to NBA championships against Houston in 1981 and 1986
and Los Angeles in 1984. Despite being hobbled by back and foot
injuries, he played on the 1992 U.S. Olympic gold medal team. He
was a three-time NBA most valuable player and twice an NBA Finals
MVP.
	   After five years as a special assistant to the Celtics, he took
over last season as coach of the Indiana Pacers. He led them to a
58-24 record, their best since joining the NBA in 1976. Bird was
chosen Coach of the Year.

Council planning to condemn massacre, but military option not on

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council was poised Thursday
to condemn the massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo and
reinforce demands for a cease-fire.
	   But the next step _ authorizing military action _ wasn't even
being formally contemplated at the United Nations despite NATO
preparations.
	   Russia and China have flatly rejected the use of force to end
the conflict between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of the southern Serb province and are fighting for
independence.
	   As permanent council members, Russia and China could veto any
new resolution authorizing military action. Russia has religious
and cultural ties to the Serbs. China is traditionally opposed to
any military intervention into what it considers an internal
matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with
Taiwan and Tibet.
	   France, another permanent member, has indicated the council
needed to pass another resolution to give NATO the specific
political backing for any offensive.
	   The United States has repeatedly said it believes that prior
U.N. resolutions authorize NATO action, and no new resolution is
needed. The British haven't stated a position, but called
Thursday's emergency meeting the day they took over the Security
Council's rotating presidency.
	   With no sign that Russia, China or France had changed their
positions, however, Britain and the United States were hoping
merely to produce a press statement endorsed by the council that
condemns the massacres.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in the forests around
Obrija. As well, residents in the nearby town of Golubovac reported
Serb forces surrounded a group of refugees on Saturday, separated
13 men and shot them.
	   The Serbs have denied involvement in the massacres. Serb Deputy
Premier Vojislav Seselj on Thursday claimed Western countries
staged the massacre ``to push through ... a NATO attack decision in
the U.N. Security Council.''
	   In addition to condemning the massacre, Britain wanted the
council to demand an end to the hostilities, call on Belgrade to
identify and punish those responsible for the massacre and request
the U.N. tribunal for Yugoslavia to widen its mandate to include
these types of crimes, a diplomatic source said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``I have had very clear representation from most members of the
council that they want a strong condemnation of the recent
atrocities on the ground in Kosovo,'' Britain's U.N. ambassador,
Jeremy Greenstock, said Thursday as he headed into meetings with
council members ahead of consultations.
	   Britain wanted the council to also demand immediate compliance
with its previous resolution on Sept. 23 urging a cease-fire and
demanding a negotiated settlement, and call on the U.N. chief to
issue a report on Kosovo by Monday, several days early.
	   Both the council and NATO were looking to the report to identify
Serb compliance with the Sept. 23 resolution. Though militarily
enforceable, that resolution didn't explicitly authorize NATO
action.
	   NATO's decision-making body, however, took another step Thursday
to prepare airstrikes against Serb forces.
	   The North Atlantic Council approved an ``activation request''
for the 16-member alliance to formally commit warplanes and other
forces for an eventual air campaign, diplomats said.
	   The council, made up of ambassadors from the allied nations,
came no closer to taking a political decision to launch air raids
and failed to overcome differences over whether NATO needs a
clearer U.N. mandate before it can attack.
	   NATO's military have been working for months on plans to
intervene in Kosovo where Serbian security forces are trying to
crush ethnic Albanian separatists. Hundreds have been killed and an
estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their homes since
the crackdown began in February.

U.S. rejects Netanyahu's bid to release spy Pollard
</HEADLINE>

issue arose in meeting, fresh McCurry comment; ADDS byline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton rejected a bid by
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised during their meeting this
week to free Jonathan Pollard, in jail for spying for Israel, a
U.S. official said Thursday.
	   Rumors that Clinton had agreed to free Pollard had circulated
since the Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot reported earlier Thursday
that during a meeting with Netanyahu, Clinton agreed in principle
to free Pollard who is serving a life term for passing secret U.S.
military documents to Israel.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he discussed Pollard's fate during his
visit to the United States this week, but that no decision was made
about a possible release of the Israeli spy.
	   In Washington later Thursday, White House Press Secretary Mike
McCurry said that while Netanyahu raised the issue in his meeting
with Clinton Monday, the president rejected the request.
	   ``The president ... accepted the expression of concern made by
the prime minister but indicated that there was no change in our
views on the matter and certainly no agreement,'' McCurry said.
	   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said granting early release to Pollard would be met by
strong opposition within the U.S. government.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, was arrested
outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985.
	   It emerged later that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a
shadowy Israeli intelligence-gathering body in the United States.
Until recently, Israeli governments disavowed Pollard, and called
his espionage a ``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison.

	   HELSINGBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Chelsea, returning to the country
where the London side captured the Cup Winners' Cup final in May,
was held to a 0-0 draw by Helsingborg in the second leg Wednesday
and it was enough to gain the second round.
	   Frank Leboeuf scored the only goal at Stamford Bridge two weeks
ago when Helsingborg, currently fifth in the Swedish first division
standings, packed their defense in search of a draw.
	   But on its own Olympia Stadium, the Swedes played an attacking
game from the start and dominated throughout. It took Chelsea 25
minutes to get its first shot on goal, but goalie Sven Andersson
had no problems with Roberto Di Matteo's drive.
	   Helsingborg, which eliminated Aston Villa in the UEFA Cup two
years ago, had the best chance of the match when Zoran Jovanovski's
header hit goalie Ed De Goey's post. That opportunity came after 30
minutes and the sixth corner by Helsingborg.
	   Midfielder Magnus Powell came close twice, first with a header
that narrowly missed the target and then with a powerful shot that
went just wide of De Goey.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia invited foreign experts Thursday to investigate
massacres in Kosovo, as new harrowing allegations emerged of police
atrocities against ethnic Albanian civilians.
	   The Serbian Media Center announced Thursday that government
troops had been removed from battlefronts, meeting one of the
conditions set down by the U.N. Security Council. The center said
that a few police units had been left behind ``to preserve public
security and order and guard communications.''
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed
government troops shelled a village Thursday near Djakovica
(JA-kaw-vee-tsah) along the border with Albania, where separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas maintain sanctuaries.
	   There was no confirmation from Serb sources.
	   But the Yugoslav army announced Thursday that six soldiers were
killed and seven wounded in fighting Wednesday with ethnic Albanian
rebels about 20 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of Djakovica.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the KLA claimed it killed 25
Serb police and troops in the attack, which it said was part of a
new operation to strike ``the enemy where he feels most secure.''
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Most ethnic
Albanians support independence.
	   International efforts to halt the conflict accelerated after
reports that Serb police massacred dozens of civilians, including
women and children, during operations last weekend southwest of
Pristina (PRISH-tee-na).
	   In the latest allegation, Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch
said a wounded Albanian claimed Serb police beat and shot him and
13 others after questioning them about ties to the rebels. The man
said he was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the man, whom he did not name for security
reasons, was ``perhaps the most important witness to what appears
to be a summary execution that has emerged in Kosovo up to now.''
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected
and there is no adequate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   Police have denied massacring civilians.
	   But reports of the massacres have accelerated international
efforts to end the seven-month conflict. NATO is preparing plans to
attack Serbia unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepts
U.N. demands to stop the crackdown.
	   ``We don't want to use force,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told his governing Labor Party on Thursday. ``But today I warn
President Slobodan Milosevic that if it will take force, Britain is
ready to back force.''
	   In an apparent bid to buy time, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
accepted a demand by the European Union for an impartial
investigation of the massacres. The ministry said Thursday it has
invited a team of forensic experts from Finland to take part in the
investigation.
	   It appeared the offer was made to enable Yugoslavia's supporters
in the Security Council, notably Russia and China, to argue that
military intervention is unnecessary.
	   But Robert Gelbard, the U.S. special envoy to the Balkans, said
the massacres have left the Yugoslav government with ``no
credibility at all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' he told the
British Broadcasting Corporation. ``Our people in Kosovo ... have
verified that these atrocities have occurred, that these latest
atrocities that occurred piled on top of previous ones.''
	   In Pristina, Bouckaert said the survivor's story was
corroborated by other witnesses from a village about five
kilometers (three miles) the site of another massacre.
	   Relating the man's account, Bouckaert said Serb police last
Saturday sent old men into nearby woods to tell refugees it was
safe to come out of their forest hiding place.
	   Police selected about 20-25 of the men. They were forced to lie
on their stomachs with their hands behind their heads. All were
beaten and kicked and told if they would identify the guerrillas,
the rest could go free.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   The survivor said he didn't move when he was kicked. He said he
waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled to his home, where he met
his mother and his wife.
	   There was no explanation how, after being wounded with bursts of
automatic fire, the man managed to keep silent or how he managed to
make it back to his home.
	   ``From what we have seen, we are quite convinced executions took
place at this site,'' Bouckaert said.

Sierra Leone calls for aid to help rebuild
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - The foreign minister of Sierra Leone
appealed for international aid Thursday to help his country rebuild
following the overthrow of a military junta that took over in 1997.
	   ``The resettlement, rehabilitation and the reconstruction
process require much resources,'' Sama Banya said in a speech to
the U.N. General Assembly.
	   He called on the international community ``to do all they can to
help us.''
	   A military junta seized power in 1997 but was ousted 10 months
later by a Nigerian-led West African intervention force, known as
ECOMOG.
	   From their mountain hideouts, remnants of the junta and its
ally, the Revolutionary United Front, continue to wage war against
the government by brutally attacking civilians.
	   Banya said that foreign peacekeeping forces, including ECOMOG,
should stay in Sierra Leone until the country can rebuild its own
army.
	   He said his government was working toward consolidating
democratic rule, but knew it still had some way to go.
	   Sixteen civilians, including five journalists, were sentenced to
death in August on charges of collaborating with the junta. Banya
said the sentence against the journalists had nothing do to do with
their work.
	   ``Despite propaganda to the contrary, no journalists have been
prosecuted, let alone convicted, for the practice of their
profession.''

Wall Street extends losses as world markets plunge

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street extended a global stock selloff
Thursday with the Dow industrials tumbling more than 200 points for
a second straight day.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which plunged 237.90 points on
Wednesday, fell an additional 210.09, or by 2.7 percent, to close
at 7,632.53.
	   Broader market indicators also sank sharply in heavy trading.
Bank and technology stocks were particularly hard hit.
	   The selling spree, amid worries about shrinking corporate
profits and fears of new financial crises, left the Dow 18.3
percent, or more than 1,700 points, below the all-time high of
9,337.97 reached on July 17. It was getting closer to the low of
7,400 that was reached during trading Sept. 1, before Wall Street's
best-known indicator began a comeback bid that brought it above
8,100 as recently as Monday.
	   The Dow's 12.4 percent slide in the third quarter, which ended
Wednesday, was its worst quarterly performance in eight years. It
now is 3.5 percent below where it began this year.
	   Stock prices earlier plunged in Asia, with Tokyo shares falling
1.6 percent to a new 12-year low, and shares were falling sharply
in Europe, where Germany's central bank left interest rates
unchanged.
	   Blue chips in London sank 3.1 percent to close at new lows for
the year, while the key index in Frankfurt, Germany, closed down
5.5 percent and the main indicator in Paris was off 5 percent.
	   The selloff in stocks has sent a flood of money into U.S.
Treasury securities, a traditional haven in times of uncertainty.
Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell further below 5 percent
Thursday, reaching levels unseen for long-term government bonds
since 1967.
	   Traders were alarmed to see prices on the New York Stock
Exchange nosedive 2.9 percent on Wednesday, even though the Federal
Reserve had lowered a key interest rate one-quarter percentage
point on Tuesday. Some traders were disappointed that the cut was
not deeper amid fears a go-slow approach would not do enough to
counter the economic crises that have swept through Asia and Russia
and are threatening Latin America.
	   ``The smaller-than-expected lowering of interest rates by the
U.S. Federal Reserve has a chain reaction,'' said Lee Won-ho, an
analyst at Samsung Securities Co. in Seoul, South Korea, where the
main stock index fell by 1.5 percent. ``It is affecting Wall
Street, the Japanese market, ours and others.''
	   The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel
Camdessus, on Thursday said the Fed made the right decision in
cutting rates and that global powers now must push for stronger
growth to offset steep recessions in Asia and Russia.
	   Asked why stock markets, particularly in the United States, have
reacted so negatively to the Fed rate cut, Camdessus said he
believed confidence will soon be restored, especially if financial
leaders show resolve in their discussions over the next week.
	   There also are worries about where the next financial market
crisis may erupt after last week's dlrs 3.6 billion private bailout
of Long-Term Capital Management LP of Greenwich, Connecticut.
	   In addition, investors worldwide worry that the downturn on Wall
Street could signal a possible slowdown in economic growth _ a bad
omen for the many foreign companies dependent on exports to the
huge U.S. market.
	   ``There's a psychological impact overall, but there's also a
direct impact on companies like Sony and TDK which derive a high
percentage of their earnings from overseas markets,'' said Pelham
Smithers, a stock strategist in Tokyo at ING Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd.
	   A new survey in Japan said confidence among small- and
medium-sized businesses about the economy plunged to its worst
level since the Bank of Japan began the quarterly samplings in
1967.

U.S. rejects Netanyahu's bid to release spy Pollard
</HEADLINE>

issue arose in meeting, fresh McCurry comment; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ During their meeting this week, U.S. President
Bill Clinton rejected a bid by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
free Israeli spy Jonathan Pollard, a U.S. official said Thursday.
	   ``The president ... accepted the expression of concern made by
the prime minister but indicated that there was no change in our
views on the matter and certainly no agreement,'' White House Press
Secretary Mike McCurry said.
	   Rumors that Clinton agreed to free Pollard circulated since the
Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot reported earlier Thursday that during
a meeting with Netanyahu, Clinton agreed in principle to free
Pollard who is serving a life term for passing secret U.S. military
documents to Israel.
	   Netanyahu said Thursday he discussed Pollard's fate during his
visit to the United States this week, but that no decision was made
about a possible release.
	   Another administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said granting early release to Pollard would be met by
strong opposition within the U.S. government.
	   Pollard, a former U.S. naval intelligence analyst, was arrested
outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington in 1985. It emerged later
that he was recruited to spy for Israel by a shadowy Israeli
intelligence-gathering body in the United States. Until recently,
Israeli governments disavowed Pollard, and called his espionage a
``rogue operation.''
	   However, the Netanyahu government granted Pollard Israeli
citizenship and acknowledged him as an Israeli agent. Many Israeli
officials, including Cabinet ministers, have visited him in prison.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia invited foreign experts Thursday to investigate
massacres in its southern province of Kosovo, where new reports of
police atrocities against ethnic Albanian civilians have emerged.
	   The Serbian Media Center announced Thursday that government
troops had been removed from battlefronts, meeting one of the
conditions set down by the U.N. Security Council. The center said a
few police units were left behind ``to preserve public security and
order and guard communications.''
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed
government troops shelled a village Thursday near Djakovica
(JA-kaw-vee-tsah) along the border with Albania, where separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas maintain sanctuaries.
	   There was no confirmation from Serb sources. However, the
Yugoslav army announced Thursday that six soldiers were killed and
seven wounded in fighting Wednesday about 20 kilometers (12 miles)
northwest of Djakovica.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the KLA claimed it killed 25
Serb police and troops in the attack, which it said was part of a
new operation to strike ``the enemy where he feels most secure.''
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Most ethnic
Albanians support independence.
	   International efforts to halt the conflict accelerated after
reports that Serb police massacred dozens of civilians, including
women and children, during operations last weekend southwest of
Pristina (PRISH-tee-na).
	   In the latest allegation, investigator Peter Bouckaert of Human
Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian claimed Serb police beat and
shot him and 13 others after questioning them about ties to the
rebels. The man said he was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the man, whom he did not name for security
reasons, was ``perhaps the most important witness to what appears
to be a summary execution that has emerged in Kosovo up to now.''
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected
and there is no adequate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   Police have denied massacring civilians.
	   But reports of the massacres have accelerated international
efforts to end the seven-month conflict. NATO is preparing plans to
attack Serbia unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepts
U.N. demands to stop the crackdown.
	   ``We don't want to use force,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told his governing Labor Party on Thursday. ``But today I warn
President Slobodan Milosevic that if it will take force, Britain is
ready to back force.''
	   In an apparent bid to buy time, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
accepted a demand by the European Union for an impartial
investigation of the massacres. The ministry said Thursday it has
invited a team of forensic experts from Finland to take part.
	   It appeared the offer was made to enable Yugoslavia's supporters
in the Security Council, notably Russia and China, to argue that
military intervention is unnecessary.
	   But Robert Gelbard, the U.S. special envoy to the Balkans, said
the massacres have left the Yugoslav government with ``no
credibility at all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' he told the
British Broadcasting Corporation. ``Our people in Kosovo ... have
verified that these atrocities have occurred, that these latest
atrocities that occurred piled on top of previous ones.''
	   In the provincial capital, Pristina, Bouckaert said the lone
survivor's story was corroborated by other witnesses from a village
about five kilometers (three miles) from the site of another
massacre.
	   Relating the man's account, Bouckaert said Serb police last
Saturday sent old men into nearby woods to tell refugees it was
safe to come out of their forest hiding place.
	   Police selected about 20-25 of the men and forced them to lie on
their stomachs with their hands behind their heads. All were beaten
and kicked and told if they would identify the guerrillas, the rest
could go free.
	   Finally, ``one policeman executed them all with short bursts of
automatic fire,'' Bouckaert said the survivor told him. After two
trips up and down the line, the policemen kicked each victim.
	   The survivor said he didn't move when he was kicked. He said he
waited about 10 or 15 minutes, then fled to his home, where he met
his mother and his wife.
	   There was no explanation how, after being wounded with bursts of
automatic fire, the man managed to keep silent or how he managed to
make it back to his home.
	   ``From what we have seen, we are quite convinced executions took
place at this site,'' Bouckaert said.

Partizan wins 1-0; advances 2-2 on away-goal rule
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Vuk Rasovic took Partizan Belgrade
into the second round of the Cup Winners Cup with a second-half
penalty kick Thursday in a first-round, second-leg 1-0 win over
Newcastle.
	   Partizan took the 1-0 lead on the 53rd minute penalty _
delighting 26,000 fans _ and advanced on the away-goal rule with
the two teams tying 2-2 on aggregate. Newcastle won the first leg
at home 2-1.
	   Rasovic connected on the penalty after Newcastle midfielder
David Batty was called for pulling down Vladimir Ivic in the area.
	   In an evenly played first half, Partizan had the best chance to
score when Nenad Bjekovic's close-in header in the 38th went off
the crossbar.
	   Newcastle, under new coach Ruud Gullit, had won four straight
matches. Batty, the offender, was featured in almost every British
newspaper Thursday _ dressed in high heels _ in an advertisement
for a local television station promoting the game under the
headline of ``Sexy Footall.''

Lazio ties Lausanne 2-2, advances on away goals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Midfielder Stefan Rehn's
84th-minute equalizer set up a tense finish for Lazio Thursday, but
the Italian side advanced to the second round of the Cup Winners
Cup on the away-goals rule.
	   Rehn's strike tied the aggregate score at 3-3 after Lazio had
twice taken the lead in the tie.
	   Chilean striker Marcelo Salas put the Italian side ahead in the
7th minute, beating 'keeper Martin Brunner with a powerful header
from Roberto Mancini's cross.
	   But Lausanne was level three minutes later. Midfielder Philippe
Douglas, who scored in the sides' 1-1 tie in Rome, met a cross from
Leonard Thurre to shoot past Luca Marchegiani in the Lazio goal.
	   Encouraged by the equalizer, Lausanne kept up the pressure in a
fast-paced match. Douglas hit the post in the 17th minute.
	   Lazio regained the lead in the 26th with another counter-attack,
midfielder Sergio Conceicao converting a cross from the right by
Mancini.
	   Lazio looked more comfortable in the second half, watched by
12,500 spectators in the rain-drenched Pontaise stadium.
	   But in the last 20 minutes, Lausanne pressed forward in numbers.
Rehn scored from close range after a Marchegiani save, but Lazio's
two away goals put last season's UEFA Cup finalist through.

 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in an
Amsterdam residential area in 1992 was carrying a chemical that can
be used in making the nerve gas sarin, the Israeli government
acknowledged for the first time Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a press
statement that Israel's Biological Institute had ordered 190 liters
(50 gallons) of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a key component
of sarin.
	   Reports have said Israel was making chemical and biological
weapons at its top secret biological institute in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Nes Ziona. The government has made almost no comment on
the reports except to call them ``inaccurate.'' In it's statement
Thursday, the government said that DMMP is not poisonous and has a
variety of industrial uses.
	   El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman told The Associated Press that
the Dutch government has known this for six years because the name
of the chemical was listed on the cargo manifest handed over by
Israel shortly after the crash.
	   The plane crashed into an apartment building, killing 43 people.
Reports about weapons and dangerous chemicals aboard the plane
surfaced shortly afterwards.
	   This week, the NRC Handelsblad reported that the El Al plane was
carrying 50 gallons (190 liters) of the chemical. It can also be
used as a flame retardant, and in the manufacture of plastic.
	   A Dutch report presented in Amsterdam Thursday found that
hundreds of residents in the neighborhood surrounding the crash
site are suffering health problems including psychiatric disorders
and unspecified physical complaints that they link to the disaster.
	   Klieman said El Al transports all materials in accordance with
international regulations. He said the chemical dimethyl
methylphosphonate is approved for transport on both passenger and
cargo planes.

Lazio ties Lausanne 2-2, advances on away goals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Midfielder Stefan Rehn's
84th-minute equalizer set up a tense finish for Lazio Thursday, but
the Italian side advanced to the second round of the Cup Winners
Cup on the away-goals rule.
	   Rehn's strike tied the aggregate score at 3-3 after Lazio had
twice taken the lead in the tie.
	   Chilean striker Marcelo Salas put the Italian side ahead in the
7th minute, beating 'keeper Martin Brunner with a powerful header
from Roberto Mancini's cross.
	   But Lausanne was level three minutes later. Midfielder Philippe
Douglas, who scored in the sides' 1-1 tie in Rome, met a cross from
Leonard Thurre to shoot past Luca Marchegiani in the Lazio goal.
	   Encouraged by the equalizer, Lausanne kept up the pressure in a
fast-paced match. Douglas hit the post in the 17th minute.
	   Lazio regained the lead in the 26th with another counter-attack,
midfielder Sergio Conceicao converting a cross from the right by
Mancini.
	   Lazio looked more comfortable in the second half, watched by
12,500 spectators in the rain-drenched Pontaise stadium.
	   But in the last 20 minutes, Lausanne pressed forward in numbers.
Rehn scored from close range after a Marchegiani save, but Lazio's
two away goals put last season's UEFA Cup finalist through.

Chelsea, Lazio advance; Paris St. Germain, Newcastle out

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Holders Chelsea squeezed through Thursday with a
1-0 win at Helsingborg to the second round of the Cup Winners Cup,
but Paris St. Germain _ winners of this cup two years ago _ was
knocked out in a major shock by Israel's Maccabi Haifa.
	   England's Newcastle, another of the favorites, was also
eliminated by Partizan Belgrade as Vuc Rasovic's penalty gave the
Yugoslavs a 1-0 win, advancing 2-2 on the away goal rule.
	   Lazio, finalists last season in the UEFA Cup, also just got by
with a 2-2 draw in Lausanne, moving through 3-3 on away goals.
	   In Helsingborg, Sweden, the Swedes attacked from the start and
dominated. It took Chelsea 25 minutes to get its first shot on
goal. Helsingborg, which eliminated Aston Villa in the UEFA Cup two
years ago, had the best chance of the match when Zoran Jovanovski's
header in the 30th hit goalie Ed De Goey's post.
	   Midfielder Magnus Powell came close twice, first with a header
that narrowly missed the target and then with a powerful shot that
went just wide.
	   In Belgrade, Rasovic scored on the penalty in the 53rd after
Newcastle midfielder David Batty was called for pulling down
Vladimir Ivic in the area.
	   The Yugoslavs were the more aggressive side and at one point
held a 10-0 advantage in corners. The loss was the first after four
straight wins for Ruud Gullit's side.
	   In Lausanne, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas put the Italian side
ahead in the 7th, but Lausanne was level three minutes later when
midfielder Philippe Douglas scored.
	   Lazio regained the lead in the 26th with another counterattack
as midfielder Sergio Conceicao connected. Lausanne midfielder
Stefan Rehn made it 2-2 with an 84th-minute equalizer to put the
Italians on edge to the finish.
	   In Haifa, Israel, Maccabi Haifa beat Paris St. Germain 3-2 (4-3
on aggregate) to qualify for the next round as Paris St. Germain's
season continues to crash.
	   In other Cup Winners matches.
	   In Varazdin, Croatia, Varteks Varazdin won 1-0 on a goal by
Fahid Kamberovic to advance on a 2-0 aggregate over Rudar Velenje
of Slovenia.
	   In Moscow, Lokomotiv defeated CSKA Kiev 3-1 to advance 5-1.
Dmitry Bulykin scored in the 19th and 51st and Zara Dzhanashia
added another in the 69th. Serhiy Bezhenar scored for CSKA.
	   In Jablonec, Czech Republic, Apollon Limassol of Cyprus fell to
Czech side Jablonec 2-1 but still advanced 4-3 on penalty kicks
after a 3-3 aggregate. Martin Prochazka scored twice for the Czechs
and Marios Themistocleous scored for Apollon.
	   In Valkeakoski, Finland, Greek side Pathionios moved on with a
3-1 victory over Finland's Haka Valkeakoski. The Greeks advanced
5-1 on aggregate. Panayotis Fyssas, Vasilis Kouvalis and Antonis
Sapountzis scored for the winners with Haka's goal from Valery
Popovich.
	   In Budapest, Austrian team SV Ried won 1-0 and advanced 3-0
against MTK Hungaria. Gerald Strafner scored for the Austrians.
	   In Trnava, Slovakia, Spartak Trnava defeated Turkey's Besiktas
2-1, but the Turkish side still advanced 4-2 after a 3-0 win in the
first leg. Robert Formanko and Jaroslav Timko scored for the
Spartak.
	   In Oslo, Norway, Valerenga and Rapid Bucharest played a 0-0 draw
with Valerenga going through on the away goals rules. The first leg
was a 2-2 draw in Bucharest.
	   In Brussels, Racing Genk won 5-0 and advanced 6-1 over Germany's
Duisberg. Souleymane Oulare and Thordur Gudjohnsson scored twice
and Branko Strupar got the other.
	   In Wronki, Poland, Heerenveen defeated Amica Wronki 1-0 and
advanced on a 4-1 aggregate. Denis de Nooger scored for Heerenveen.
	   In Copenhagen, Denmark, FC Copenhagen advanced 6-1 after a 4-1
win over Levski Sofia. Thomas Thorninger scored twice with others
from Martin Nielsen and Lars Hoejer.
	   In Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca and Hearts drew 1-1 with the
Spanish side moving on 2-1. James Hamilton scored for Hearts and
Ariel Lopez for Mallorca.
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, Rangers won 4-2 and advanced 5-3 to the
second round of the UEFA Cup. The other 31 UEFA Cup matches were
played Tuesday.

Indians celebrate festival with idols of goddess slaying Ronaldo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ The city of Calcutta in eastern India is
still mourning Brazil's defeat in the World Cup earlier this year
in France.
	   As part of their biggest religious festival being celebrated
Thursday, Calcutta's residents have installed statues of their
fallen hero, Ronaldo, along with those of Goddess Durga, the
principal deity honored during Dussehra.
	   To vent their disappointment over Ronaldo's performance,
traditional idol makers have shown Goddess Durga slaying the
Brazilian striker in place of the traditional demon.
	   Durga is worshipped because she is believed to have descended to
earth to kill a hideous monster.
	   Most soccer fans hold Ronaldo responsible for his country's
defeat and it is this sentiment which is reflected in this year's
Dussehra carnival.
	   ``When the World Cup was held this year, Ronaldo was everyone's
hero. Everybody was hoping that he would play superbly. But when
the World Cup was over, we saw Ronaldo turning into a villain...It
is in this light that we have depicted him as a demon here,'' said
Lakshman Pal, an artist.
	   In some parts of Calcutta, Goddess Durga's is shown riding
Godzilla, the Hollywood monster made famous by a movie of the same
name, on her way to kill Ronaldo.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATION (AP) _ A Nobel Peace Prize winner, a queen, a
billionaire financier, a foreign minister and the U.N. deputy
secretary-general joined forces Thursday to fight the next battles
in the campaign to ban anti-personnel land mines.
	   With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every
nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to
kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.
	   And they launched a new fund, which already has contributions
and pledges of over dlrs 1.3 million.
	   ``We have never thought that the treaty itself was victory,''
said Jody Williams, co-winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her six
year crusade with the International Campaign to Ban Landmines that
resulted in 122 countries signing the treaty in Ottawa in December.
	   The land mine campaign brought together governments, grassroots
organizations, the United Nations, big business, the late Princess
Diana, and ordinary citizens in a unique partnership which Canadian
Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said is becoming a new model for
action on a range of international humanitarian issues including
curbing small arms.
	   The news conference in the U.N. Trusteeship Chamber launching
the land mine campaign's next battlegrounds reflected the new
alliance: Williams was flanked by Axworthy, Queen Noor of Jordan,
billionaire financier George Soros, U.N. Deputy Secretary-General
Louise Frechette and Norway's U.N. Ambassador Ole Peter Kolby.
	   The queen recalled that she and her husband, King Hussein, were
driving in Minnesota, where he is receiving cancer treatment, when
they received a call on Sept. 16 that Burkina Faso had become the
40th nation to ratify the land mine treaty _ which meant it would
go into effect in March 1999.
	   ``There was a huge `whoopie' that emanated from this car ...
throughout the Minnesota countryside that I know was just a faint
echo of jubilation that would have been spreading around the world
at that time,'' she said.
	   Since mid-September, five more nations have ratified the treaty,
most recently Japan. Axworthy said Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was
``so enthusiastic'' that he woke him at 6 a.m. to tell him about
the ratification.
	   ``It just continues to demonstrate the momentum in the world to
make this thing real,'' Williams said.
	   Noor said it was encouraging that major producers and exporters
including France, Germany, Britain and Hungary had already ratified
the treaty.
	   But the United States has refused to sign the convention,
maintaining that land mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to
deter North Korea from invading South Korea. Russia and China are
also holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
	   While the United States has pledged money for demining efforts
and assisting victims, Soros said to enthusiastic applause: ``I
think the greatest contribution they could make actually is signing
the treaty.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton wants the United States to approve
the treaty by 2006, but only if the armed forces are able to come
up with an alternative weapon by then.
	   Williams, an American, urged governments and private
institutions to contribute to a fund set up with the dlrs 500,000
which the International Campaign received as co-winner of the Nobel
prize to continue the campaign's activities ``until we truly
eradicate this weapon and aid all the victims.''
	   Soros pledged dlrs 300,000 and urged the private sector to
contribute.
	   ``I think that there is plenty of money out there and I hope
that it will rise to the occasion,'' he said. ``This has to be a
long-range commitment. ... While we are celebrating, land mines are
being used in Kosovo, for instance.''
	   Axworthy announced a 300,000 Canadian dollar contribution (U.S.
dlrs 196,000). Kolby announced a Norwegian contribution of dlrs
200,000. And Williams said Ireland last week donated dlrs 150,000.

Arbitrator hears Lemieux demand dlrs 33 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Mario Lemieux asked an arbitrator Thursday to
order the Pittsburgh Penguins to pay him dlrs 33 million.
	   Lemieux, the former All-Star center who also sued the Penguins
for the money, is contending that he should be paid immediately
because co-owner Roger Marino has taken over control of the
National Hockey League club.
	   Lemieux filed a grievance last spring through the union. One of
Lemieux's attorneys said his contract contains a clause that calls
for immediate payment if someone other than Howard Baldwin takes
over the Penguins.
	   ``We're entitled to (the money) because the team is managed by
someone other than Howard Baldwin. Someone has assumed operating
control of the team,'' lawyer Douglas Campbell said.
	   Neither Lemieux nor agent Tom Reich would comment before the
arbitration hearing began before John Sands of Pittsburgh. Reich
said he did not expect a quick decision. The hearing may continue
on Friday.
	   ``These things take quite a while,'' Reich said.
	   On paper, Baldwin and Marino are equal partners and Marino said
Wednesday that there has been no change in the relationship.
	   Still, the two have offered to buy each other out and Marino has
taken on more day-to-day decision-making since he paid dlrs 40
million to buy into the team 16 months ago. The team has lost dlrs
37.5 million during the last two years.
	   NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has attempted to mediate the
ownership dispute, so far unsuccessfully.
	   In Allegheny County Commons Pleas Court, Lemieux has also
demanded dlrs 33 million. Lemieux said he should be paid
immediately because Marino has refused to make deferred payments
due under the dlrs 42 million contract the hockey star signed with
Baldwin in 1992.

	   TENEXTEPANGO, Mexico (AP) _ Heavy rains sent a 5-foot
(1.5-meter) wall of water tumbling down an irrigation canal
Thursday in the hills of central Mexico, killing 12 people when it
washed away tin and cardboard homes along the banks.
	   Half of 14-year-old Miguel Angel Solano Pineda's family of six
was drowned when floodwaters collapsed a brick wall, sending it
crashing it down on their two-room home. Nine other people _
including five children, three under the age of 2 _ were killed in
this village about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Mexico City.
	   A wide swath of Mexico has been inundated this week, with at
least 16 other people dying in mudslides and floods. More rain is
predicted for the region over the next 24 hours, the National
Meteorological Service reported.
	   Solana said his family made a desperate attempt to keep the
water out of their house by shoving clothing under doors and into
cracks minutes before the wall collapsed and his father, mother and
a 12-year-old sister drowned.
	   ``My mother was saying `We should go. We should go. We should
get out of here,' but my father said `No, it will calm down,''' he
said.
	   Solano, who doesn't know how to swim, survived by letting the
current carry him until he managed to grab the top of a neighbor's
door. ``I just kept telling myself `You'll live. You'll live.
Nothing bad will happen,''' he said.
	   Also Thursday, two other people died a few miles (kilometers)
away when a swollen river carried off their truck, the Mexican Red
Cross said.
	   Rains forced the Ahuelhueyo River to overflow in the area.
Several homes were reported damaged and 120 people were left
homeless.
	   The Iztamatitlan River in northern Morelos state swelled
Thursday morning, sweeping away a truck carrying three people. One
survived and the other two were killed, the Mexican Red Cross said.
	   Eight people were killed Wednesday in the eastern state of
Puebla after heavy rainfall caused more than 50 mudslides, local
media reported Thursday.
	   Police in the western state of Jalisco said the bodies of a
father and son were found Wednesday after they were swept away by
currents while trying to cross the Gallinas River, about 45 miles
(72 kilometers) west of the state capital of Guadalajara.
	   At least five people died early Monday when a soaked hillside
gave way at the southern edge of Mexico City. A woman died in
Chiapas state when floodwaters swept away a taxi.
	   Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, killing at least
185 people and breaking apart the state's road and bridge system.
	   Mexico City remained on a state of alert Thursday and officials
were urging families to leave their wood and sheet-metal shacks
built illegally near rivers and on steep hillsides. Most people,
however, have refused to leave for fear that they will not be
allowed to return.
	   Television footage showed the water level at La Herradura dam in
Huixquilucan, just 6 miles (9 kilometers) outside Mexico City, less
than a yard (meter) below the dam's ridge Thursday.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders said
Thursday that this week's top-level talks in Washington have moved
them closer to a West Bank troop pullback, but violence loomed
large.
	   In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, dozens of
Palestinian teen-agers took turns lighting firebombs and hurling
them at Israeli soldiers, who used stun grenades and rubber bullets
in response. Two Palestinians were injured. Palestinian policemen
nearby mostly watched and only made half-hearted efforts to stop
the youths.
	   Meanwhile, the leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas,
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said his group would make good on threats to
attack Israelis.
	   Palestinian intelligence said Thursday they had arrested a Hamas
activist and former chemistry student who stashed nearly a ton of
explosives in his home next to Palestinian police headquarters on
the outskirts of Hebron. The arrest came three days after a car
rigged with explosives and apparently being prepared for a suicide
attack by Hamas, prematurely blew-up in the Palestinian city of
Ramallah.
	   In Hebron Wednesday, two hand grenades were thrown at an Israeli
army outpost by a Palestinian assailant who fled the
Israeli-controlled sector of the city, back to Palestinian areas
shortly afterwards. Eleven soldiers and 11 Palestinian passersby
were injured in the attack and the Israeli army imposed a curfew
over the 30,000 Palestinians living under their control.
	   Israel filed a sharp protest with the Palestinian Authority,
saying it must do more to catch the fugitive.
	   The incidents have boosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's claims that Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is
not doing enough to rein in militants. Netanyahu has said he would
hand over more land to Palestinian control only after receiving
assurance that the areas would not become havens for terrorists.
	   Israeli media reported that the army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
Shaul Mofaz told the government Thursday that the army was on
high-alert due to intelligence warnings that Hamas is planning
several attacks.
	   ``There have been very serious warning about major plans for
major terrorist attacks,'' said Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan.
	   Hamas's Yassin said at a news conference Thursday that his
group, which has carried out suicide bombings and other deadly
attacks against Israelis, was having trouble making good on its
threats to carry out further attacks but that ``a response will
come at the appropriate time, even if it is delayed.''
	   Both Netanyahu and Arafat said that they made progress during
talks in Washington Monday with U.S. President Bill Clinton aimed
at completing a deal for an Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank, as proposed by the United States.
	   Netanyahu, who wants tougher security guarantees from the
Palestinians spelled out in the deal, said that the Palestinians
have agreed to most of the details in the plan. The premier briefed
his Cabinet Thursday on the Washington talks and Israel radio said
Netanyahu assured his hardline coalition partners that any deal
would be brought to Israel's parliament for approval before
signing.
	   Jewish settler leaders, who oppose any plan to cede West Bank
land, and whose votes helped narrowly elect Netanyahu in 1996, said
Thursday they would lobby the U.S. Congress to oppose a U.S.-backed
plan.
	   ``We will create a committee in Washington to speak to
Republicans,'' said settler leader Ahron Dombe. He said he was
working on setting-up appointments with leader Republican
congressmen who are generally more sympathetic to hardline Israeli
policy.
	   Asked whether an agreement for a long overdue Israeli troop
pullout was within reach, Arafat told reporters: ``We have to wait
and see until the next meeting which will take place between myself
and Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.''
	   Albright is scheduled to return to the region next week for
preparatory talks with both leaders, before they return to
Washington in mid-October for another summit.
	   Arafat's aide, Nabil Abourdeneh said bilateral and trilateral
meetings with Albright and her team will be crucial to the success
of the next Washington summit. When they wrap-up ``we'll have
reached a breakthrough or a deadlock,'' he said.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in an
Amsterdam residential area in 1992 was carrying a chemical that can
be used in making the nerve gas sarin, the Israeli government
acknowledged for the first time Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a press
statement that Israel's Biological Institute ordered 190 liters (50
gallons) of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a key component of
sarin.
	   Reports have said Israel was making chemical and biological
weapons at its top secret biological institute in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Nes Ziona. The government has made almost no comment on
the reports except to call them ``inaccurate.'' In its statement
Thursday, the government said the chemical is not poisonous and has
a variety of industrial uses.
	   El Al spokesman Nachman Klieman told The Associated Press that
the Dutch government has known this for six years because the name
of the chemical was listed on the cargo manifest handed over by
Israel shortly after the crash.
	   The plane crashed into an apartment building, killing 43 people.
Reports about weapons and dangerous chemicals aboard the plane
surfaced shortly afterward.
	   This week, the NRC Handelsblad reported that the El Al plane was
carrying 50 gallons (190 liters) of the chemical, which can also be
used as a flame retardant, and in the manufacture of plastic.
	   A Dutch report presented Thursday in Amsterdam found that
hundreds of residents in the neighborhood surrounding the crash
site are suffering health problems including psychiatric disorders
and unspecified physical complaints that they link to the disaster.
	   Klieman said El Al transports all materials in accordance with
international regulations. He said the chemical is approved for
transport on both passenger and cargo planes.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council was poised Thursday
to condemn the massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo and
reinforce demands for a cease-fire.
	   But the next step _ authorizing military action _ wasn't even
being formally contemplated here in spite of NATO preparations.
	   In discussions with council members Thursday, Russia indicated
it wanted more information on the massacres before assigning blame
on the Serbs, diplomats said as the council convened for
consultations. That position, expected to be supported by China,
could thwart British efforts to condemn the Serbs directly for the
atrocities.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Rather than take a safer route to
re-election Saturday _ touting Australia's economic growth while
Asia is in recession _ Prime Minister John Howard has handed his
opponent a powerful weapon.
	   Howard is asking voters to embrace a 10 percent tax increase on
all goods and services.
	   The tax increase, not surprisingly deemed unpopular in voter
surveys, is part of Howard's plan to overhaul the nation's
antiquated and complex tax system. And opposition leader Kim
Beazley and the Labor Party are pounding him on it in the final
days of the campaign.
	   To sweeten the new tax, Howard linked it to promised income tax
cuts worth dlrs 7.6 billion a year, and said he would abolish
various other wholesale taxes.
	   ``I know it's risky, I know it's against the conventional
wisdom,'' Howard said Thursday. ``But whatever the result is ... I
will believe that I called it right for the long-term interests of
this country.''
	   Throughout a five-week campaign dominated by the fairly sterile
issues of tax reform and the economy, opinion polls have shown the
two main opponents are neck-and-neck.
	   Beazley has engineered an amazing Labor comeback considering
that the party was humiliated in 1996, when Howard amassed a 93-49
majority in the House of Representatives, where government is
formed. Still, winning the 27 House seats needed to take over
government would be difficult.
	   ``All the mathematics of history in Australian politics has been
against me in this campaign,'' Beazley said Thursday. ``The only
thing I've had on my side are the right policy arguments.''
	   Labor has promised to create 500,000 jobs in the next three
years, and Beazley has called for income tax cuts targeting
low-income earners. ``But I sure would have liked another couple of
weeks to argue those issues,'' he said.
	   Aboriginal health and welfare issues have been almost absent
from the campaign. Conservatives are wary of them because their own
views are not too far from far-right politician Pauline Hanson.
	   Hanson's One Nation party, with its anti-Asian, anti-Aboriginal
views, became a national political force in June when it won 11 of
the 89 seats in Queensland's state Parliament.
	   Support for One Nation, however, has sunk in recent months, and
Hanson may lose her own parliamentary seat. Still, it could
influence which party wins in closely contested districts.
	   Howard's governing Liberal Party and rural National coalition
holds 90 seats in the current House of Representatives. The Labor
Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.
	   Even if Howard retains control of the more powerful lower house,
the balance of power in the upper house still could rest with minor
parties or independents, meaning the government will need
cooperation to get its bills passed.

Official: World Bank wary to pump billions into crisis-hit
</HEADLINE>
countries &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank is reluctant to pump billions
of dollars in short-term loans into crisis-hit countries because
this diverts resources from its main job, bank president James
Wolfensohn says.
	   The role of the 181-nation organization, he feels, is to provide
funds for projects that help the poor, preserve the environment and
enable governments in emerging countries to reform their
institutions.
	   Wolfensohn said Thursday he has been trying recently to convince
the bank's shareholders ``that they should not think of us as a
second level'' International Monetary Fund. ``We are not that. We
are not a lender of last resort or a liquidity funder.''
	   He said the bank traditionally has made long-term loans to help
governments change how they operate or for projects such as road
building and education.
	   For the past 14 months as financial crises erupted in Asia and
then spread to Russia and Latin America, the United States and
other major industrialized countries have been urging the bank to
supplement IMF emergency rescue packages destined for countries
facing financial turbulence.
	   The two organizations are nicknamed the Bretton Woods twins
after the New Hampshire resort where they were founded 54 years
ago. The fund's role is international economic surveillance,
exchange rate policies, balance of payment problems while the bank
tries to reduce global poverty and promote economic development.
	   Wolfensohn said the bank had provided dlrs 17 billion for
IMF-led programs in Asia and dlrs 6 billion for Russia. He said
there had been discussions on how Brazil might be helped but he has
seen no suggested sum.
	   ``We help when we can in the crisis financing, which we have
attempted to do to the limits of our capacity,'' Wolfensohn said,
stressing it was necessary to first get countries back on the road
to recovery.
	   He said he no worries about such loans reducing the bank's
resources for traditional programs, ``but I did want to sound the
alarm very early to make sure I don't get pressed.''
	   Wolfensohn said the bank had about dlrs 105 billion in
outstanding loans and dlrs 200 billion on hand for future
operations ``so we are very safe in relation to what we call a
trigger point when we should start looking at capital when it is at
dlrs 160 billion.''
	   He said because the bank borrows on international markets it was
important to protect is triple A credit standing.
	   An environmental activist group challenged Wolfensohn's
characterization of the of the bank as a vehicle for softening the
impact of the global financial crisis on the world's poor.
	   ``The World Bank is trying to portray itself as a kinder gentler
institution than its sister, the International Monetary Fund,''
said Brent Blackwelder, president of Friends of the Earth.
	   ``In fact the two are becoming more and more alike. In 1998,
almost 40 percent of World Bank loans in East Asia went to
IMF-style structural adjustment loans, nearly twice the amount in
1966, '' Blackwelder said.

	   After a scoreless first half, Maccabi took a 1-0 lead in the
69th on fullback Adoram Keisi's shot from five meters (yards).
	   Nicola Ouedec equalized for Paris St. Germain in the 72nd, but
five minutes later Mizrahi scored to give Maccabi a 2-1 lead.
	   J.J. Okacho evened again for the French in the 85th to make it
2-2 and set stage for the dramatic finish.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's new prime minister failed
Thursday for a second day to reach agreement with his coalition
partners on a new government after a minority party demanded the
deputy prime ministership.
	   Pandeli Majko, a Socialist, had hoped to win agreement from his
four coalition partners on a new Cabinet to submit to Parliament in
hopes of restoring political stability to this impoverished Balkan
nation after months of unrest.
	   But the Social Democrats demanded they be given a deputy prime
minister portfolio, in addition to the foreign ministry which they
held under the previous government of former Prime Minister Fatos
Nano.
	   The Socialists, who held the deputy prime ministership under the
Nano government, refused to give up the post. The Social Democrats
proposed that a second prime minister be designated.
	   But the Socialists said if they agreed to the addition, they
would demand the post for themselves. More talks were expected.
	   Majko was named prime minister to replace Nano, who resigned
Monday after failing to win approval for Cabinet changes following
riots two weeks ago that were caused by the assassination of a
popular opposition leader.
	   Former President Sali Berisha, who heads the opposition
Democratic Party, blamed Nano for the assassination and led a
series of protests which threatened to plunge the country into
chaos.
	   Berisha has proposed the new government have a broader base,
with the participation of more parties outside the government
coalition. However, the idea was rejected by all parties in the
governing coalition.
	   Albania is still trying to recover from nationwide riots which
exploded in 1997 after pyramid investment schemes collapsed,
depriving many Albanians of their life-savings.
	   Berisha, who was president at the time, resigned after
internationally sponsored elections brought Nano and his Socialists
to power.
	   The United States and the European Union fear that instability
here could trigger another wave of refugees and also undermine
international efforts to negotiate a political settlement in
neighboring Kosovo province.
	   Ethic Albanian rebels who are fighting for Kosovo's independence
maintain sanctuaries in northern Albania, a Berisha stronghold.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Paris St. Germain won the Cup Winners Cup two
years ago. Thursday night the one-time French power was knocked out
in the first-round, second-leg by Israel's modest Maccabi Haifi.
	   In the 16-game Cup Winner schedule Thursday, holders Chelsea
squeezed through with a 1-0 win at Sweden's Helsingborgs. But
another English club, Newcastle, was eliminated by Partizan
Belgrade as Vuc Rasovic's penalty gave the Yugoslavs a 1-0 win,
advancing 2-2 on the away goal rule.
	   Lazio, finalists last season in the UEFA Cup, also just got by
with a 2-2 draw in Lausanne, moving through 3-3 on away goals.
	   In Haifa, Israel, Maccabi won 3-2 and advanced 4-3 when Alon
Mizrahi's shot in second-half injury time deflected in off Paris
St. Germain player Alain Goma for the deciding goal.
	   After a scoreless first half, Maccabi took a 1-0 lead in the
69th on fullback Adoram Keisi's shot from five meters (yards).
Nicola Ouedec equalized in the 72nd, but five minutes later Mizrahi
scored to give Maccabi a 2-1 lead. J.J. Okacho evened again for the
French in the 85th to make it 2-2 and set stage for the dramatic
finish.
	   In Helsingborg, Sweden, the Swedes attacked from the start and
dominated. It took Chelsea 25 minutes to get its first shot on
goal. Helsingborg, which eliminated Aston Villa in the UEFA Cup two
years ago, had the best chance of the match when Zoran Jovanovski's
header in the 30th hit goalie Ed De Goey's post.
	   Midfielder Magnus Powell came close twice, first with a header
that narrowly missed the target and then with a powerful shot that
went just wide.
	   In Lausanne, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas put the Italian side
ahead in the 7th, but Lausanne was level three minutes later when
midfielder Philippe Douglas scored.
	   Lazio regained the lead in the 26th with another counterattack
as midfielder Sergio Conceicao connected. Lausanne midfielder
Stefan Rehn made it 2-2 with an 84th-minute equalizer to put the
Italians on edge to the finish.
	   In Belgrade, Vuc Rasovic scored on the penalty in the 53rd after
Newcastle midfielder David Batty was called for pulling down
Vladimir Ivic in the area.
	   The Yugoslavs were the more aggressive side and at one point
held a 10-0 advantage in corners. The loss was the first after four
straight wins for Ruud Gullit's side.
	   In other Cup Winners matches.
	   In Varazdin, Croatia, Varteks Varazdin won 1-0 on a goal by
Fahid Kamberovic to advance on a 2-0 aggregate over Rudar Velenje
of Slovenia.
	   In Moscow, Lokomotiv defeated CSKA Kiev 3-1 to advance 5-1.
Dmitry Bulykin scored in the 19th and 51st and Zara Dzhanashia
added another in the 69th. Serhiy Bezhenar scored for CSKA.
	   In Jablonec, Czech Republic, Apollon Limassol of Cyprus fell to
Czech side Jablonec 2-1 but still advanced 4-3 on penalty kicks
after a 3-3 aggregate. Martin Prochazka scored twice for the Czechs
and Marios Themistocleous scored for Apollon.
	   In Valkeakoski, Finland, Greek side Pathionios moved on with a
3-1 victory over Finland's Haka Valkeakoski. The Greeks advanced
5-1 on aggregate. Panayotis Fyssas, Vasilis Kouvalis and Antonis
Sapountzis scored for the winners with Haka's goal from Valery
Popovich.
	   In Budapest, Austrian team SV Ried won 1-0 and advanced 3-0
against MTK Hungaria. Gerald Strafner scored for the Austrians.
	   In Trnava, Slovakia, Spartak Trnava defeated Turkey's Besiktas
2-1, but the Turkish side still advanced 4-2 after a 3-0 win in the
first leg. Robert Formanko and Jaroslav Timko scored for the
Spartak.
	   In Oslo, Norway, Valerenga and Rapid Bucharest played a 0-0 draw
with Valerenga going through on the away goals rules. The first leg
was a 2-2 draw in Bucharest.
	   In Brussels, Racing Genk won 5-0 and advanced 6-1 over Germany's
Duisberg. Souleymane Oulare and Thordur Gudjohnsson scored twice
and Branko Strupar got the other.
	   In Wronki, Poland, Heerenveen defeated Amica Wronki 1-0 and
advanced on a 4-1 aggregate. Denis de Nooger scored for Heerenveen.
	   In Copenhagen, Denmark, FC Copenhagen advanced 6-1 after a 4-1
win over Levski Sofia. Thomas Thorninger scored twice with others
from Martin Nielsen and Lars Hoejer.
	   In Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca and Hearts drew 1-1 with the
Spanish side moving on 2-1. James Hamilton scored for Hearts and
Ariel Lopez for Mallorca.
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, Rangers won 4-2 and advanced 5-3 to the
second round of the UEFA Cup. The other 31 UEFA Cup matches were
played Tuesday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An El Al cargo plane that crashed in an
Amsterdam residential area in 1992 was carrying a chemical that can
be used in making the nerve gas sarin, the Israeli government
acknowledged for the first time Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a press
statement that Israel's Biological Institute had ordered 190 liters
(50 gallons) of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a key component
of sarin. The statement said the order had been made ``with the
approval of the U.S. Department of Commerce for the testing of
filters.''
	   Reports have said Israel was making chemical and biological
weapons at its top secret biological institute in the Tel Aviv
suburb of Nes Ziona. The government has made almost no comment on
the reports except to call them ``inaccurate.'' In it's statement
Thursday, the government said that DMMP is not poisonous and has a
variety of industrial uses.
	   Netanyahu's office said the DMMP shipment was lost in the crash,
and a new shipment was delivered in it's place.

	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _Heavy rains and dense tropical foliage
interfered with the search Thursday for a single-engine plane that
disappeared four days earlier in the Bolivian tropical rain forests
carrying a missionary family from the United States.
	   Aboard were U.S. missionary and pilot John Henry Trosen of
Wadena, Minnesota; his wife Masako Ari Trosen, of Kyoto, Japan, but
now a U.S. citizen; and their childen Isaiah Tsubasa Trose, 3, and
Sophia Hikari Trosen, 9 months; Bolivian pastor Juan Carlos Suazo,
31; and seminary student Jhonny Mamani and his wife Silveria Lucia
Pinto.
	   They all worked for the Marion, Indiana-based World Gospel
Mission.
	   The Cessna CP-1528 disappeared en route from the village of
Yucuma on the eastern slopes of the Andes to the city of Santa
Cruz.
	   Several Bolivian air force planes and missionary groups are
taking part in the search, said Ron Gouge, a member of the World
Gospel Mission, coordinating search efforts out of the city of
Santa Cruz, 450 miles (725 kilometers) east of La Paz.
	   Helicopters used in anti-drug operations were also on hand with
emergency medical teams, he said.

Guiness releases 45th edition of book of records
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ What do President Bill Clinton and buxom starlet
Pamela Anderson have in common?
	   They are the most mentioned man and woman on the Internet,
according to the 45th edition of the Guiness Book of Records, which
is published Friday. Its 336 pages catalogue natural wonders as
well as stories which celebrate human endurance, foolhardy feats
and obsessive behavior.
	   Originally designed for British pub owners who wished to ``turn
the heat of argument into the light of knowledge,'' the book first
appeared in 1955 and has since sold more than 80 million copies.
	   Among the weird and wacky items in the latest edition:
	   - Ten-thousand mourners turned out for the funeral of a canary
named Jimmy, who was laid to rest in a tiny white coffin. That
happened in New Jersey in 1920.
	   - A Thai man spent 24,000 pounds (dlrs 40,800) on a wedding for
his cats. The ``bride'' and ``groom'' arrived for the ceremony in a
Rolls-Royce car and a helicopter, both animals dressed in pink
satin.
	   - The world's longest kiss _ 29 hours.
	   - The world's longest lawnmower ride _ 3,366 miles (5,400 kms)
across 19 American states last summer by 12-year-old Ryan Tripp.
	   _ The most likely place to be killed by a snake _ Sri Lanka,
with an average of 800 people dying each year.
	   The Guinness Book of Records claims to be a record-breaker
itself _ the best-selling copyrighted book in the world.

	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) _ The Edmonton Oilers traded goalkeeper
Eric Fichaud plus defensemen Drake Berehowsky and Greg De Vries to
the Nashville Predators on Thursday for forward Jim Dowd and
goalkeeper Mikhail Shtalenkov.
	   The trade was completed just prior to the roster freeze in
advance of Monday's waiver draft.
	   Bob Sauve, Fichaud's agent, said the young goalie was happy at
the move.
	   ``We knew Nashville was interested in him,'' Sauve said. ``They
had tried to make a deal for him at the expansion draft.''
	   De Vries had seven goals, four assists and 80 penalty minutes in
65 games last season, while Berehowsky had one goal, six assists
and 169 penalty minutes in 67 games.
	   Dowd spent last season with Calgary and the Flames' AHL farm
team in Saint John. He had six goals and eight assists in 48 games
with Calgary.
	   Shtalenkov had a 3.22 goals-against average last season at
Anaheim when he had a 13-18-5 record.
	   In a separate move, the Oilers signed free agent defenseman
Marty McSorley, who played in Edmonton from 1985-88, to a one-year
contract. McSorley was part of the trade which sent Wayne Gretzky
from Edmonton to the Los Angeles Kings on Aug. 9, 1988.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ First it was David Leadbetter. Now it's Brenna
Cepelak. Nick Faldo has been busy with breakups the past two weeks.
	   The three-time Masters and British Open champion disclosed
Thursday that he and Cepelak have agreed to end their three-year
relationship.
	   ``It is always sad, but these things happen,'' Faldo said in a
statement from the Belgacom Open in Belgium, where he opened with a
6-under 65 and was one stroke off the lead.
	   The split comes 11 days after Faldo abruptly ended his 13-year
relationship with Leadbetter, which was much more bitter.
Leadbetter accused Faldo earlier Thursday of copying his teaching
methods at the Faldo Golf Institute.
	   Cepelak was on a golf scholarship at Arizona when she met Faldo
in 1995 at a tournament. Faldo was separated from his second wife,
Gill, at the time. Their divorce is expected to become final this
month.
	   ``There are always regrets and heartaches when two people end
the kind of relationship which Nick and I have experienced,'' said
the 23-year-old Cepelak.

Maradona could return to play in Spanish soccer league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Diego Maradona could return soon
to professional play in Spanish league second division team
Badajoz, the former soccer star's manager said Thursday.
	   Manager Guillermo Coppola told reporters he will meet on Friday
with Marcelo Tinelli, a popular Argentine television variety show
host who recently bought a majority stake in Badajoz.
	   Maradona played professionally for Argentine league team Boca
Juniors until August 1997, when he tested positive for a controlled
substance for the third time in his career.
	   This would be his third return to Spain after playing from 1982
to 1984 for Barcelona and in 1992 for Sevilla.

U.S. cities seeking 2012 Games submit reports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Nine cities hoping to be the American bidder for
the 2012 Olympics submitted proposals to the U.S. Olympic
Committee, but the panel on Thursday said it wanted to review the
plans before deciding if all met minimum requirements.
	   USOC president Bill Hybl said a report on the bids would be made
to the panel's executive committee in Phoenix next Friday. Any
action would be announced at that time, he said.
	   While the deadline at the end of business Wednesday for filing
the reports had long been set and the week-long review was not
included in the USOC's schedule for the bidders, Hybl said the
delay was needed ``to assure fairness to all the cities.''
	   There has been concern that some of the cities would be unable
to meet a new International Olympic Committee requirement that
governments promise to underwrite the cost of the games if the
private organizing committee encounters financial problems.
	   Hybl declined to say if that was part of the reason for the
unscheduled review, but said that ``not all nine agreements are
identical.''
	   ``We're going to take the next week to see what they contain,''
Hybl said.
	   Groups hoping to win the U.S. bid are from Baltimore-Washington,
Cincinnati, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando-Tampa,
San Francisco and Seattle.
	   Government action on the Olympic bids is pending in
Baltimore-Washington, New York, San Francisco and Seattle, where a
city council vote is set for next Monday, USOC spokesman Mike Moran
said.
	   The U.S. bidder will be chosen by the USOC in the fall of 2002,
with the IOC picking the host city in 2005. The USOC decided
against bidding for the Summer Games in 2008, where Toronto is the
front-runner barring a late bid by a Chinese city.
	   The IOC rules, announced 1 1/2 years ago, don't require a cent
of taxpayers' money to be spent on the Olympics, but they do order
a city bidding for the games to have government pledges to make up
any gaps in the organizing committee's budget.
	   The mandate came in the wake of the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, where
organizers spent more than a quarter of their privately raised dlrs
1.8 billion budget on stadiums and arenas.
	   While the Atlanta Games were a sports success and broke even,
they were plagued by logistical problems and an aura of tackiness.
The IOC took steps to ensure that future organizers would not have
to spend so much time raising money that they would neglect how it
was managed.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Paris St. Germain won the Cup Winners Cup two
years ago. Thursday night the one-time French power was knocked out
in the first-round, second-leg by Israel's modest Maccabi Haifi on
a goal in second-half injury time.
	   In the 16-game Cup Winnr schedule Thursday, holders Chelsea
squeezed through with a 1-0 win at Sweden's Helsingborgs. But
another English club, Newcastle, was eliminated by Partizan
Belgrade as Vuc Rasovic's penalty gave the Yugoslavs a 1-0 win,
advancing 2-2 on the away goal rule.
	   Lazio, finalists last season in the UEFA Cup, also just got by
with a 2-2 draw in Lausanne, moving through 3-3 on away goals.
	   In Haifa, Israel, Maccabi won 3-2 and advanced 4-3 when Alon
Mizrahi's shot in second-half injury time deflected in off Paris
St. Germain player Alain Goma for the deciding goal.
	   After a scoreless first half, Maccabi took a 1-0 lead in the
69th on fullback Adoram Keisi's shot from five meters (yards).
Nicola Ouedec equalized in the 72nd, but five minutes later Mizrahi
scored to give Maccabi a 2-1 lead. J.J. Okacho evened again for the
French in the 85th to make it 2-2 and set stage for the dramatic
finish.
	   In Helsingborg, Sweden, the Swedes attacked from the start and
dominated. It took Chelsea 25 minutes to get its first shot on
goal. Helsingborg, which eliminated Aston Villa in the UEFA Cup two
years ago, had the best chance of the match when Zoran Jovanovski's
header in the 30th hit goalie Ed De Goey's post.
	   Midfielder Magnus Powell came close twice, first with a header
that narrowly missed the target and then with a powerful shot that
went just wide.
	   In Lausanne, Chilean striker Marcelo Salas put the Italian side
ahead in the 7th, but Lausanne was level three minutes later when
midfielder Philippe Douglas scored.
	   Lazio regained the lead in the 26th with another counterattack
as midfielder Sergio Conceicao connected. Lausanne midfielder
Stefan Rehn made it 2-2 with an 84th-minute equalizer to put the
Italians on edge to the finish.
	   In Belgrade, Vuc Rasovic scored on the penalty in the 53rd after
Newcastle midfielder David Batty was called for pulling down
Vladimir Ivic in the area.
	   The Yugoslavs were the more aggressive side and at one point
held a 10-0 advantage in corners. The loss was the first after four
straight wins for Ruud Gullit's side.
	   In other Cup Winners matches.
	   In Varazdin, Croatia, Varteks Varazdin won 1-0 on a goal by
Fahid Kamberovic to advance on a 2-0 aggregate over Rudar Velenje
of Slovenia.
	   In Moscow, Lokomotiv defeated CSKA Kiev 3-1 to advance 5-1.
Dmitry Bulykin scored in the 19th and 51st and Zara Dzhanashia
added another in the 69th. Serhiy Bezhenar scored for CSKA.
	   In Jablonec, Czech Republic, Apollon Limassol of Cyprus fell to
Czech side Jablonec 2-1 but still advanced 4-3 on penalty kicks
after a 3-3 aggregate. Martin Prochazka scored twice for the Czechs
and Marios Themistocleous scored for Apollon.
	   In Valkeakoski, Finland, Greek side Pathionios moved on with a
3-1 victory over Finland's Haka Valkeakoski. The Greeks advanced
5-1 on aggregate. Panayotis Fyssas, Vasilis Kouvalis and Antonis
Sapountzis scored for the winners with Haka's goal from Valery
Popovich.
	   In Budapest, Austrian team SV Ried won 1-0 and advanced 3-0
against MTK Hungaria. Gerald Strafner scored for the Austrians.
	   In Trnava, Slovakia, Spartak Trnava defeated Turkey's Besiktas
2-1, but the Turkish side still advanced 4-2 after a 3-0 win in the
first leg. Robert Formanko and Jaroslav Timko scored for the
Spartak.
	   In Oslo, Norway, Valerenga and Rapid Bucharest played a 0-0 draw
with Valerenga going through on the away goals rules. The first leg
was a 2-2 draw in Bucharest.
	   In Brussels, Racing Genk won 5-0 and advanced 6-1 over Germany's
Duisberg. Souleymane Oulare and Thordur Gudjohnsson scored twice
and Branko Strupar got the other.
	   In Wronki, Poland, Heerenveen defeated Amica Wronki 1-0 and
advanced on a 4-1 aggregate. Denis de Nooger scored for Heerenveen.
	   In Copenhagen, Denmark, FC Copenhagen advanced 6-1 after a 4-1
win over Levski Sofia. Thomas Thorninger scored twice with others
from Martin Nielsen and Lars Hoejer.
	   In Palma de Mallorca, Mallorca and Hearts drew 1-1 with the
Spanish side moving on 2-1. James Hamilton scored for Hearts and
Ariel Lopez for Mallorca.
	   In Braga, Portugal, Braga advanced 4-0 after beating Metalurgs
Liepaja of Latvia by the same score. Bruno Ferreira scored twice
and Karoglan Mladen and Elpidio Silva got the others.
	   In Glasgow, Scotland, Rangers won 4-2 and advanced 5-3 to the
second round of the UEFA Cup. The other 31 UEFA Cup matches were
played Tuesday.

	   TENEXTEPANGO, Mexico (AP) _ Heavy rains sent a 5-foot
(1.5-meter) wall of water tumbling down an irrigation canal
Thursday in the hills of central Mexico, killing 12 people when it
washed away tin and cardboard homes along the banks.
	   Half of 14-year-old Miguel Angel Solano Pineda's family of six
was drowned when floodwaters collapsed a brick wall, sending it
crashing it down on their two-room home. Nine other people _
including five children, three under the age of 2 _ were killed in
this village about 40 miles (65 kilometers) south of Mexico City.
	   A wide swath of Mexico has been inundated this week, with at
least 16 other people dying in mudslides and floods. More rain is
predicted for the region over the next 24 hours, the National
Meteorological Service reported.
	   Solana said his family made a desperate attempt to keep the
water out of their house by shoving clothing under doors and into
cracks minutes before the wall collapsed and his father, mother and
a 12-year-old sister drowned.
	   ``My mother was saying `We should go. We should go. We should
get out of here,' but my father said `No, it will calm down,''' he
said.
	   Solano, who doesn't know how to swim, survived by letting the
current carry him until he managed to grab the top of a neighbor's
door. ``I just kept telling myself `You'll live. You'll live.
Nothing bad will happen,''' he said.
	   Also Thursday, the Iztamatitlan River in northern Morelos state
swelled, sweeping away a truck carrying three people. One survived
and the other two were killed, the Mexican Red Cross said.
	   Rains forced the Ahuelhueyo River to overflow in the area.
Several homes were reported damaged and 120 people were left
homeless.
	   Eight people were killed Wednesday in the eastern state of
Puebla after heavy rainfall caused more than 50 mudslides, local
media reported Thursday.
	   Police in the western state of Jalisco said the bodies of a
father and son were found Wednesday after they were swept away by
currents while trying to cross the Gallinas River, about 45 miles
(72 kilometers) west of the state capital of Guadalajara.
	   At least five people died early Monday when a soaked hillside
gave way at the southern edge of Mexico City. A woman died in
Chiapas state when floodwaters swept away a taxi.
	   Chiapas suffered severe flooding in September, killing at least
185 people and breaking apart the state's road and bridge system.
	   Mexico City remained on a state of alert Thursday and officials

	   LONDON (AP) _ Representatives of the six so-called Contact Group
nations sent a strong message Thursday to newly elected Bosnian
leaders that any roadblocks to peace will not be tolerated.
	   The group, which includes representatives from the United
States, Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Russia, met in London
to review the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation following last month's
elections.
	   Thursday's discussion was a prelude to the Contract Group's
gathering on Friday to address the volatile political situation in
the Serbian province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians were found
massacred earlier this week.
	   Contact Group members said the Bosnian elections ``represented
modest but useful gains, notably in the development of political
pluralism,'' Britain's Foreign Office said.
	   The region's officeholders will be expected to adhere to the
1995 Dayton peace agreement, ``and to work for a strengthened and
united Bosnia,'' the group said.
	   The Contact Group's strategy for promoting peace in the region
will include supporting central institutions, moving forward with
returning minority refugees, sorting out housing problems and
organizing the media, the Foreign Office said.

Moroccan leader urges France to reschedule its debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Moroccan Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi said
Thursday he hoped France would allow the North African country to
reschedule its debt payments to allow it to better use the
financial means at its disposal.
	   ``Morocco has a difficult task ahead ... one that has raised
hopes not just in Morocco but in the region,'' Youssoufi said in an
interview with television channel France 2.
	   ``But we need to be able to use the means at our disposal, and a
large amount of that is taken away by our creditors,'' he added.
	   Morocco's debt is estimated at dlrs 19 billion, equivalent to
almost 60 percent of the country's gross domestic product. Moroccan
Finance Minister Fathallah Oalalou has estimated that 17 percent of
the debt is with France.
	   The subject of debt repayment has topped the agenda during the
two-day visit which ends Friday.
	   Youssoufi, who took office earlier this year, met President
Jacques Chirac Thursday, but did not say whether there were any
indications France would accept his appeal.
	   ``We're only at half time,'' he said. ``We've still got a day of
work ahead of us, a day of negotiations and exchanges _ we'll
see.''
	   Earlier Thursday, he spoke of ``the high hopes'' of the Moroccan
people that France would agree to reschedule repayments.
	   Before lunching at the Elysee Palace, Youssoufi visited the tomb
of French resistant leader Jean Moulin in the Pantheon.
	   During his visit, Youssoufi also will meet with French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and other officials.

Strawberry has colon tumor

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry learned Thursday he
has cancerous tumor in his colon and he will undergo surgery this
weekend.
	   The 36-year-old outfielder, whose career has been beset by
personal problems and injuries, did not travel with the Yankees,
staying in New York for tests at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical
Center. He will have surgery as early as Saturday.
	   ``Because of the location and his good health, prognosis for a
full recovery is excellent,'' Yankees spokesman Rick Cerrone said.
	   Yankees manager Joe Torre closed the clubhouse before practice
for an impromptu team meeting, then delayed his scheduled news
conference.
	   Players went through pre-workout stretching in virtual silence.
Torre joined them late, walking onto the field slowly and quietly.
	   David Cone, already saddened by Wednesday's death of former
Kansas City teammate Dan Quisenberry, said the team was ``extremely
worried'' about Strawberry.
	   ``It supersedes baseball,'' said Cone, who will start Game 3
against Texas on Friday night.
	   ``It shakes you up. He's of our leaders, a well-respected
veteran who is part of the personality of our team,'' said Cone, a
teammate of Strawberry on the New York Mets in the 1980s. ``He
symbolizes the resilience of our team, all that he's been through
in his career and his life.''
	   Tino Martinez said the Strawberry situation is ``a little
nerve-wracking.''
	   ``He's a big part of our team, a great guy and great friends
with everyone here,'' Martinez said. ``He didn't let anybody in on
anything. He didn't say anything about it until the last couple of
days.''
	   Strawberry, who has had stomach pain, spoke with his boyhood
friend, Orioles outfielder Eric Davis, when the Yankees were in
Baltimore last month.
	   Dao has overcome a cocaine addiction, was one of the
Yankees' top power hitters this season, batting .247 with 24 homers
and 57 RBIs in 295 at-bats, primarily as a designated hitter
against right-handed pitchers. The homers tied Paul O'Neill for the
third most on the team behind Tino Martinez (28) and Bernie
Williams (26).

Pope's beatification of WW II cardinal delights Croats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo ZAG-101
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ When Pope John Paul II beatifies
Croatia's wartime Cardinal this weekend, he will be honoring one of
the Balkans' most controversial figures -- denounced as a Nazi
collaborator but hailed by many Croats as a national martyr.
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who will be beatified Saturday, was
tried by the Communists in 1946 and sentenced to 16 years
imprisonment for collaborating with the pro-Nazi Croatian puppet
state, established by the Germans during World War II.
	   For decades, Serbs and many Jews saw Stepinac as a symbol of the
fascist state that tried to exterminate them. His critics said he
blessed fascist Croat soldiers, maintained contacts with pro-Nazi
leader Ante Pavelic and carried out the regime's order to convert
Serbs, who are Orthodox Christians, to Catholicism.
	   After Croatia broke from Communist Yugoslavia in 1991, the new,
nationalist government rehabiliated Stepinac, who died in 1960, and
hailed him as a national hero.
	   For Croats, Catholicism is one of the foundations of their
national identity. The Catholic faith separates Croats from the
Orthodox Serbs who dominated the former Yugoslavia.
	   Stepinac was protrayed as a martyr -- the victim of Communist
attempts to suppress the Roman Catholic Church and stifle the
national aspirations of the Croat people. Some Croatian media
speculate that Stepinac was poisoned in prison.
	   The editor of Croatian television's religious program section.
Tonci Trstenjak, said he hoped the beatification ``will clear the
slandered face of Croatia.''
	   But the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked the Vatican to postpone
the ceremony, a step on the possible road to sainthood, until
independent researchers review Stepinac's role.
	   The widely differing views of Stepinac's life illustrate the
problems facing this newly independent nation struggling with its
wartime past and defining its own place in modern Europe.
	   As the nation prepares to honor Stepinac, another figure from
the Nazi-era past -- Dinko Sakic -- is in jail pending trial for
war crimes committed while serving as the commander of the
notorious fascist concentration camp of Jasenovac, where thousands
of Serbs, Jews and anti-fascist Croats died.
	   Sakic escaped to Argentina after the war and remained free until
June when he was extradited to Croatia to stand trial.
	   Stepinac's comments about the camp which Sakic ran are often
cited by Croats to defend the Cardinal as a religious leader who
was struggling to make the best of a bad situation during the war.
	   In public statements, Stepinac called the Jasenovac camp a
``shame.'' When greeting Pavelic at the entrance to the Zagreb
Cathedral, Stepinac looked at him and quoted the 7th Commandment:
``Thou shalt not kill.''
	   Stepinac's speeches show that as early as 1942, he was speaking
out, albeit carefully, against the excesses of the regime.''
	   ``All nations and races are from the God and they all have a
right to live,'' Stepinac said at a Mass in 1942 when killings in
Jasenovac and other camps were in full swing. ``That is why
Croatian church has always condemned injustice and violence
committed in the name of class, racist or ethnic theories.''
	   Stepinac's admirers also argue that ``allowing'' Stepinac
allowed Serbs and Jews to convert to Catholicism offered a chance
to escape persecution.
	   Croatia's Jewish community, whose 30,000 members perished during
the said the they were ``grateful'' to Stepinac for saving lives of
many Jews.
	   In a statement released Wednesday, they nevertheless say that
``the time will judge'' him.

Brazilian share prices tumble ahead of Sunday's presidential
</HEADLINE>
election

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian share prices tumbled
Thursday, undermined by falling world markets and lack of investor
interest before Sunday's presidential elections, traders said.
	   ``We are hoping (President) Fernando Henrique Cardoso will win
in the first round, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will
confirm there is money for a credit line for Brazil,'' said one
trader. ``Then the market can recover next week.''
	   The Sao Paulo stock exchange index dropped by 9.6 percent, while
Rio de Janeiro's smaller one fell by 9.1 percent.
	   Cardoso is expected to be re-elected after the first ballot,
leaving him in a strong position to tackle Brazil's shaky economy,
and boost investor confidence. He has already hiked interest rates
to 50 percent but has hinted he may cut the country's debt by
raising taxes.
	   Investors are also waiting to see whether the IMF, meeting this
week in Washington D.C., will hand financial aid to Brazil.
	   Finance Minister Pedro Malan, who is attending the meeting,
confirmed two weeks ago that he had opened negotiations with the
IMF for support.

Butler warns against premature claims on VX, hints at possible
</HEADLINE>
positives &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with Butler warning against premature
conclusions in VX reports. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector warned
Thursday against making ``premature claims'' about results of
European laboratory tests looking for traces of the deadly nerve
agent VX in Iraqi missile warheads.
	   Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
earlier this week that the completed Swiss tests had turned up
negative. French tests were incomplete and inconclusive, they said.
	   Richard Butler said much of the speculation this week about the
results was untrue.
	   French confirmation that Iraq had successfully loaded VX into
missile warheads would seriously jeopardize Iraq's efforts to have
sanctions lifted.
	   Butler's statement came as a high-level Iraqi delegation led by
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was in New York for talks on
resolving the latest standoff caused by Iraq's decision Aug. 5 to
halt cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   In June, Butler confirmed that a U.S. Army laboratory at the
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland detected the presence of
degraded VX on fragments of missile warheads destroyed after the
Gulf War. A few drops of the colorless, odorless gas can kill in
minutes.
	   The results contradicted Iraq's claim that it never succeeded in
producing VX in a form that could be loaded into missile warheads.
	   Butler agreed to send new samples to French and Swiss labs after
Iraq challenged the U.S. findings. The European labs collected some
40 sample swipes from missile fragments in storage near a site
outside of Baghdad.
	   Butler has said that even if the European results turn up
negative, Iraq still has to answer for the U.S. findings.
	   Butler urged Iraq to simply come ahead with information about
its banned weapons so that the inspections can end.
	   ``Rather than propagandize this issue as some have done by
making premature claims about what those lab results are,'' Butler
said, the focus should be on Iraq's failure to be truthful with
inspectors.
	   ``We need the truth from Iraq, we need full disclosure from
Iraq,'' he said.
	   Butler's Special Commission must certify that Iraq has destroyed
its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and the long-range
missiles to deliver them, before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the
Gulf war.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia invited foreign experts Thursday to investigate
massacres in its southern province of Kosovo, where new reports of
police atrocities against ethnic Albanian civilians have emerged.
	   The Serbian Media Center announced Thursday that government
troops had been removed from battlefronts, meeting one of the
conditions set down by the U.N. Security Council. The center said a
few police units were left behind ``to preserve public security and
order and guard communications.''
	   But the ethnic Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center claimed
government troops shelled a village Thursday near Djakovica
(JA-kaw-vee-tsah) along the border with Albania, where separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas maintain sanctuaries.
	   There was no confirmation from Serb sources. However, the
Yugoslav army announced Thursday that six soldiers were killed and
seven wounded in fighting Wednesday about 20 kilometers (12 miles)
northwest of Djakovica.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, the KLA claimed it killed 25
Serb police and troops in the attack, which it said was part of a
new operation to strike ``the enemy where he feels most secure.''
	   Ethnic Albanians form 90 percent of the population of Kosovo, a
province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia. Most ethnic
Albanians support independence.
	   International efforts to halt the conflict accelerated after
reports that Serb police massacred dozens of civilians, including
women and children, during operations last weekend southwest of
Pristina (PRISH-tee-na).
	   In the latest allegation, investigator Peter Bouckaert of Human
Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian claimed Serb police beat and
shot him and 13 others after questioning them about ties to the
rebels. The man said he was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the man, whom he did not name for security
reasons, was ``perhaps the most important witness to what appears
to be a summary execution that has emerged in Kosovo up to now.''
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected
and there is no adequate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   Police have denied massacring civilians.
	   But reports of the massacres have accelerated international
efforts to end the seven-month conflict. NATO is preparing plans to
attack Serbia unless Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accepts
U.N. demands to stop the crackdown.
	   ``We don't want to use force,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook told his governing Labor Party on Thursday. ``But today I warn
President Slobodan Milosevic that if it will take force, Britain is
ready to back force.''
	   In an apparent bid to buy time, the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
accepted a demand by the European Union for an impartial
investigation of the massacres. The ministry said Thursday it has
invited a team of forensic experts from Finland to take part.
	   It appeared the offer was made to enable Yugoslavia's supporters
in the U.N. Security Council, notably Russia and China, to argue
that military intervention is unnecessary. The panel on Thursday
strongly condemned the recent atrocities and called on Milosevic to
investigate, identify and punish those responsible.
	   Robert Gelbard, the U.S. special envoy to the Balkans, said the
massacres have left the Yugoslav government with ``no credibility
at all.''

	   In discussions with council members Thursday, Russia indicated
it wanted more information on the massacres before assigning blame
on the Serbs, diplomats said as the council convened for
consultations. That position, expected to be supported by China,
thwarted British efforts to condemn the Serbs directly for the
atrocities.
	   In its statement, the council didn't address the next step _

airstrikes.
	   Russia and China have flatly rejected the use of force to end
the conflict between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of the southern Serb province and are fighting for
independence.
	   As permanent council members, Russia and China could veto any
new resolution authorizing military action. Russia has religious
and cultural ties to the Serbs. China is traditionally opposed to
any military intervention into what it considers an internal
matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with
Taiwan and Tibet.
	   France, another permanent member, has indicated the council
needed to pass another resolution to give NATO the specific
political backing for any offensive.
	   The United States has repeatedly said it believes that prior
U.N. resolutions authorize NATO action, and no new resolution is
needed. The British haven't stated a position, but called
Thursday's emergency meeting the day they took over the Security
Council's rotating presidency.
	   With no sign that Russia, China or France had changed their
positions, however, Britain and the United States were hoping
merely to produce a press statement endorsed by the council that
condemns the massacres.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in the forests around
Obrija. As well, residents in the nearby town of Golubovac reported
Serb forces surrounded a group of refugees on Saturday, separated
13 men and shot them.
	   The Serbs have denied involvement in the massacres. Serb Deputy
Premier Vojislav Seselj on Thursday claimed Western countries
staged the massacre ``to push through ... a NATO attack decision in
the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Both the council and NATO were looking to a report by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, due Monday, to identify Serb
compliance with the Sept. 23 resolution that demanded a cease-fire
and a political settlement between the two sides. Though militarily
enforceable, that resolution didn't explicitly authorize NATO
action.
	   NATO's decision-making body, however, took another step Thursday
to prepare airstrikes against Serb forces.
	   The North Atlantic Council approved an ``activation request''
for the 16-member alliance to formally commit warplanes and other
forces for an eventual air campaign, diplomats said.
	   The council, made up of ambassadors from the allied nations,
came no closer to taking a political decision to launch air raids
and failed to overcome differences over whether NATO needs a
clearer U.N. mandate before it can attack.
	   NATO's military have been working for months on plans to
intervene in Kosovo where Serbian security forces are trying to
crush ethnic Albanian separatists. Hundreds have been killed and an
estimated 275,000 people have been driven from their homes since
the crackdown began in February.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with opposition party comments on the agreement.
INSERTS byline &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Mexican government and opposition
lawmakers have reached a tentative agreement on a dlrs 55 billion
bank rescue fund that had become the most divisive issue in Mexican
politics _ and potentially the most damaging for the ruling party.
	   Under the agreement, which is subject to congressional approval,
audits of private-bank loans bought by the government in 1995 and
1996 would continue, but credits of more than dlrs 500,000 would be
turned back over to banks for collection.
	   Banks then would be in charge ``of the management of such big
corporate loans and assume potential losses,'' according to a draft
of the agreement, announced Wednesday by the government and one of
the country's two main opposition parties.
	   Such credits account for about one-third of the total bank
bailout fund. Small debtors would get discount and aid programs to
help them pay back loans.
	   The remaining two-thirds of the dlrs 55 billion would not be
assumed as government debt, as originally proposed, but would
instead be either collected or sold off by a governmental agency,
reducing the burden on tax payers.
	   The ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and the
pro-business National Action Party have enough votes to get the
deal through Congress, despite the fact that the other main
opposition party, the leftist Democratic Revolution, boycotted
talks on the arrangement.
	   ``The taxpayers' money should go mainly to help small debtors
and not the big companies or consortiums that would have eventually
benefited'' from the bank rescue, Felipe Calderon, president of the
conservative National Action Party, said Thursday.
	   Porfirio Munoz Ledo of the Democratic Revolution said Thursday
that the agreement ``was a tactical move by the government to
improve its image ... to give security to financial markets.''
	   ``What is the cost to taxpayers? Has it been reduced ... or
hasn't it been reduced at all?'' Munoz Ledo asked. He called the
agreement is ``lacking in substance'' because it did not resolve
who would pay for the bad loans, or how much it would cost.
	   Democratic Revolution lawmakers had led criticism against the
administration of President Ernesto Zedillo over the bank rescue
fund, which bought bad loans from private banks after the 1994 peso
devaluation nearly toppled the country's financial system.
	   The arrangement would continue efforts to disclose fraudulent
multimillion-dollar loans made by banks that since have been taken
over by the government and sold off to private investors.
	   Zedillo's administration also has been stung by revelations that
some of the loans in the bailout fund were channeled to his party
as campaign donations. But the accord pledges ``no impunity'' for
those accused of defrauding banks.
	   In return for accepting the deal, which would probably increase
losses in the already battered banking sector, the five banks still
under original management could turn a similar amount of smaller
non-performing loans to the government fund for collection or sale
at a discount.
	   The tentative accord also calls for legal reforms of the
financial system, such as regulations governing bankruptcies. Many
large corporate debtors reportedly overestimated the value of the
collateral pledges they gave on the loans.

Astros top Padres 5-4 to even series
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ First, Houston blew the lead in the ninth. Then,
Bill Spiers saved the Astros.
	   Spiers' third hit of the game, an RBI single with one out in the
ninth, lifed Houston to a wild 5-4 win over the San Diego Padres on
Thursday and tied their first-round series 1-1.
	   The Astros had taken a 4-2 lead into the ninth, but Billy Wagner
allowed a two-out, two-run homer to pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz.
	   Then in the bottom half, Dan Miceli allowed Ricky Gutierrez's
infield single to shortstop leading off. Brad Ausmus sacrificed,
Trevor Hofffman relieved, and Gutierrez stole third base
uncontested. Spiers then lifted a single to right on a 1-2 count.
	   Wagner, who got the win, was shaky down the stretch, blowing
consecutive save chances against the Mets last month by allowing
homers to Brian McRae and Mike Piazza.
	   It was Houston's 49th come-from-behind win this year, and the
28th in its last at-bat. It was also the seventh one-run game the
teams have played this year, including San Diego's 2-1 victory in
the series opener Tuesday.
	   Game 3 is Saturday night in San Diego.
	   The Padres almost maintained the momentum from Tuesday, when
Kevin Brown struck out 16, the second-most ever in the postseason,
to beat Randy Johnson.
	   Wagner, who converted 30 of 35 save opportunities in the regular
season, allowed Ken Caminiti's single with one out in the ninth.
Leyritz pinch-hit for Wally Joyner wit two out, and hit another
dramatic postseason homer.
	   While with the New York Yankees in 1996, Leyritz hit a dramatic
three-run, eighth-inning homer off Atlanta's Mark Wohlers to tie
Game 4 of the World Series at 6. The Yankees went on to win the
game in 10 innings and the Series in six games.

Court dismisses theft charges against Guyanese army official
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ A magistrate has dismissed charges
against a Guyanese army officer accused in 1996 of stealing 15
windows worth dlrs 2,000.
	   Magistrate Iqbal Ali said on Wednesday there was not enough
evidence against Col. Godwyn McPherson, a deputy commander in the
Guyana Defense Force.
	   McPherson had been free on bail. He said Thursday he planned to
show up for work, but said he had not decided when.
	   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they appeal the case, but I am
going to report for duty and see what happens,'' McPherson said.
	   In an unrelated case, McPherson was recently barred from
entering the United States on suspicion of involvement in smuggling
of illegal aliens.
	   The U.S. embassy claimed McPherson, who is is also president of
the local amateur basketball federation, tried to obtain U.S. visas
for a group of businessmen who were unrelated to the game.
McPherson has denied any wrongdoing.

Funk decides against withdrawing, shoots 9-under 63 to tie for
</HEADLINE>
lead &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM SALADINO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PINE MOUNTAIN, Georgia (AP) _ Fred Funk changed his mind just in
time.
	   About an hour before he was to tee off, a sore back had Funk
thinking seriously about withdrawing from the Buick Challenge.
	   Instead, after about a half-hour of therapy, he went out and
shot a 9-under-par 63 Thursday for a share of the first-round lead
with Jim Carter in the dlrs 1.5 million tournament.
	   Carter, 37, a non-winner during his eight full years on the PGA
Tour, shot his best round of the year with nine birdies and no
bogeys.
	   Russ Cochran was a stroke back after a 64, and Tom Byrum shot a
65.
	   Steve Elkington and Tim Herron, who played in the same threesome
with Funk _ the group was 22 under _ were three strokes back off
the pace at 66 in the tournament worth dlrs 270,000 to the winner.
Also at that figure were leading money-winner David Duval, Franklin
Langham, J.L. Lewis and Frank Lickliter.
	   The field has 20 of the top 30 money-winners, including Vijay
Singh, the PGA champion and second on the money list, defending
champion Davis Love III and Hal Sutton, who won the Texas Open last
week.
	   Singh and Love each had 69s. Sutton shot a 72.
	   ``Two days ago my back went into spasms. I couldn't hit balls
yesterday and considered withdrawing on the range this morning,''
said Funk, who had 10 birdies and a lone bogey on No. 17 over the
Mountain View Course at the Callaway Gardens resort 75 miles (120
kilometers) southwest of Atlanta.
	   But physical therapist Tom Boers of Columbus, who works with
several other pros, including Fred Couples, Love and Ernie Els,
came to the rescue.
	   ``He worked on me beginning at 6:15 a.m. for a half-hour,'' said
the 42-year-old Funk, who then went out to the practice range where
he still was unable to make a full swing without pain.
	   That's when the former University of Maryland coach, who came on
the tour full-time in 1989, thought about withdrawing.
	   ``But, Tom said it would loosen up as I went along,'' said Funk,
30th on the money list with dlrs 825,458, including a victory at
the Deposit Guaranty Classic in July, his fifth career win.
	   Boers turned out to be right as Funk quickly birdied Nos. 2 and
3 and went out in 31 on the front nine, 5 under and had it at 10
under with five more birdies on the back before his bogey on the
par-4 17th when he hit his second shot into a bunker and
three-putted.
	   ``I had 62 in mind when I made the turn, but I made that one
mistake on 17. That frosts me a little bit, but you can't moan
about a 63,'' said Funk, who won here in 1995 and finished second
in 1996 when he lost in a five-man playoff to Michael Bradley.
	   Carter, who has four third place career finishes, including one
this year, made six birdies on his last nine holes, including a
40-footer (12 meters).
	   ``I'm fine. I've got no complaints,'' said Carter when told
about Funk's back problem. ``I'm in tip-top shape.''

 &UR; Strawberry diagnosed with colon tumor &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from Cone, Torre &QL; 
 &UR; By JAIME ARON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) _ Darryl Strawberry was diagnosed Thursday
with colon cancer and will undergo surgery to have a tumor removed.
	   The 36-year-old Yankees outfielder, whose career has been beset
by personal problems and injuries, had been experiencing stomach
pain and underwent tests at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in
New York while his team traveled to Texas for its first-round
playoff series.
	   He will have surgery as early as Saturday.
	   ``Because of the location (of the tumor) and his good health,
prognosis for a full recovery is excellent,'' Yankees spokesman
Rick Cerrone said.
	   Manager Joe Torre broke the news to the team at a clubhouse
meeting before practice.
	   ``There was complete silence, some sobbing, very sad people,''
he said.
	   Torre spoke with Strawberry by telephone after doctors diagnosed
the cancer and said his outfielder encouraged the team to continue
to win in this historic Yankees season suddenly clouded by tragedy.
	   ``The thing he told me was, `Go out and get the job done,' ''
Torre said. ``Hopefully he'll able to celebrate with us if we go on
and do what we hope to do.''
	   Players went through pre-workout stretching in virtual silence.
Torre joined them late, walking onto the field slowly and quietly.
	   David Cone, already saddened by Wednesday's death of former
Kansas City teammate Dan Quisenberry, said he'll probably put
Strawberry's number (39) on the back on his hat before starting
Game 3 of the playoffs against Texas on Friday night.
	   ``We're all very worried, very concerned, but we're also all
optimistic that he can beat this,'' said Cone, speaking with
reddened eyes.
	   Tino Martinez called the Strawberry situation
``nerve-wracking.''
	   ``He's a big part of our team, a great guy and great friends
with everyone here,'' Martinez said. ``He didn't let anybody in on
anything. He didn't say anything about it until the last couple of
days.''
	   Strawberry spoke with his boyhood friend, Orioles outfielder
Eric Davis, when the Yankees were in Baltimore last month.
	   Davis, who returned from colon cancer surgery in 1997 to lead
Baltimore to the AL playoffs, said the first symptom of his illness
was severe stomach pain, and that prompted Strawberry to seek
medical attention.
	   ``He has the strength to deal with this,'' said Cone, who played
with Strawberry on the New York Mets in the 1980s. ``We're all
confident that there was early detection and he has the strength to
beat it. Eric Davis beat it.''
	   Strawberry, who has overcome a cocaine addiction and a tax
conviction, was one of the Yankees' top power hitters this season
as the team won an American League record 114 games. He batted .247
with 24 homers and 57 RBIs in 295 at-bats, primarily as a
designated hitter against right-handed pitchers.

France elects new Senate head
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Christian Poncelet of President Jacques Chirac's
conservative Rally for the Republic Party was voted the new head of
the French Senate early Friday.
	   Poncelet, 69, replaces Rene Monory of the centrist Union for
French Democracy. Monory, who has headed the Senate since 1992, was
seeking re-election, but pulled out of the race after trailing
behind Poncelet after the first round of voting.
	   Poncelet, 69, won 189 votes in a third and final round of
voting, beating his main rival, Claude Estier of the Socialist
Party, who mustered 93 votes. He is senator for the Vosges region
in eastern France.
	   He was elected after nine hours of debate and voting by the
country's senators.
	   Under the French Constitution, the head of the Senate is the
second most senior official. In case of emergency, the Senate
leader replaces the president.
	   Chirac's party enjoys a clear majority in the Senate, holding
220 of the 331 seats.
	   But Poncelet's election marked the first time the upper chamber
of parliament has not been run by a centrist politician in 30
years.
	   Althouth the Senate has far less power than the National
Assembly, it can amend legislation and occasionally has thwarted
government projects.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia has invited foreign experts to investigate
massacres in its southern province of Kosovo, where new reports of
police atrocities against ethnic Albanian civilians have emerged.
The Serbian Media Center announced Thursday that government troops
had been removed from battlefronts, meeting one of the conditions
set down by the U.N. Security Council. But the ethnic Albanian-run
Kosovo Information Center claimed government troops shelled a
village Thursday near Djakovica along the border with Albania,
where separatist Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas maintain
sanctuaries. Also Thursday, the U.N. Security Council strongly
condemned the recent massacres and called on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to punish those responsible for carrying them
out. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders said
this week's top-level talks in Washington have moved them closer to
a West Bank troop pullback. Still, the threat of violence loomed
large. In the tensely divided West Bank city of Hebron, dozens of
Palestinian teen-agers took turns lighting firebombs and hurling
them Thursday at Israeli soldiers, who fired stun grenades and
rubber bullets in response. Two Palestinians were injured.
Palestinian policemen patrolling nearby mostly watched, making only
halfhearted efforts to stop the youths. Meanwhile, the leader of
the militant Palestinian group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, warned
his group would make good on threats to attack Israelis in
retaliation for the killing of two Hamas fugitives by Israeli
soldiers last month. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has warned that he
might have to take ``unpopular measures'' to salvage the Russian
economy if the International Monetary Fund doesn't come through
with more money. Primakov didn't specify what measures he had in
mind, but Thursday's warning came as the government was reported to
be considering an economic plan that would re-impose Soviet-style
controls on the economy. The prime minister did reassure the
country that the government has no intention of taking U.S. dollars
out of its citizens' wallets. A leading regional official had
proposed banning greenbacks as a way to stabilize the ruble. Such
talk ``isn't worth an eggshell,'' Primakov told reporters.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder was
upbeat after a friendly round of talks with the leaders of his
future partners in Germany's Parliament. But more difficult
dialogues lie ahead. Formal talks that were to begin Friday could
prove more contentious as Schroeder and Greens party leaders hammer
out ideological differences on defense, energy, transportation and
other central issues. Schroeder, a Social Democrat, has invited the
ecology-minded Greens to be his junior partner after he defeated
Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections Sunday and returned the left to
power in Germany after 16 years. Both sides talked optimistically
Thursday after party leaders sounded each other out for three
hours. (GERMANY-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The United States warned North Korea of ``very
negative consequences'' if that country further tests or exports
long-range missiles. The warning was issued Thursday by State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin as U.S. and North Korean
officials opened two days of missile talks in New York. Rubin said
North Korea's Aug. 31 launch of a missile to orbit a small
satellite was another step forward in North Korea's missile
development program and it is a matter of ``deep concern'' to the
United States. U.S. and North Korean officials met Thursday in New
York. Previous rounds of missile talks were held in April 1996 and
July 1997. (US-NORTH KOREA)

	   LONDON (AP) _ An obscenity-laden poem written by John Lennon
will be put up for auction by the fan who received it almost 30
years ago.
	   The typed work is made up of a four-letter expletive repeated
104 times around the single word ``you.'' It was sent to poet Susan
Baker in 1969 after she wrote to the Beatle requesting a poem.
	   It is signed by Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono.
	   Robert Finan of the auction house Finan and Co. said the poem is
too unusual to estimate how much it might bring. The auction will
be held Oct. 10 in Wiltshire.
	   ``Cataloguing the item was something of a problem, as quite
obviously it could offend,'' Finan said. ``I am making sure that
the photocopies of the documents are not on show at the viewing
days.''

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Claire Danes' apology for her
disparaging remarks about Manila wasn't big enough for the
Philippines' president, a former movie star himself.
	   ``She should not be allowed to come here. She should not even be
allowed to set foot here,'' President Joseph Estrada said.
	   On Tuesday, the City Council declared the 19-year-old actress
persona non grata and banned all her movies because she called
Manila smelly, rat-infested and weird. Miss Danes, who appeared in
``The Rainmaker,'' was in Manila for several months this year to
shoot ``Brokedown Palace.''
	   Last week, she said in a statement that she meant no disrespect.
	   ``Because of the subject matter of our film `Brokedown Palace,'
the cast was exposed to the darker and more impoverished places of
Manila,'' she said. ``My comments in Premiere magazine only reflect
those locations, not my attitude toward the Filipino people. They
were nothing but warm, friendly and supportive.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Akira Kurosawa, Japan's legendary film director,
posthumously received a prestigious award from the government
Thursday.
	   The People's Honor Award was presented by Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi to Kurosawa's eldest son, Hisao. The award is given to
people in Japan who contribute to the arts, entertainment or
sports.
	   Only 14 people have received the award since it was established
21 years ago. Kurosawa, who died Sept. 6 at age 88, is the first
film director to receive the honor.
	   Among Kurosawa's movies are ``Rashomon'' and ``The Seven
Samurai.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tom Cruise got a chance to play a real-life hero,
according to a woman who says the actor came to her aid during a
mugging.
	   Rita Simmonds told the Evening Standard in Thursday's editions
that Cruise ran to her rescue Sept. 23 as attackers pulled open the
door of her Porsche and yanked off more than 70,000 pounds (dlrs
119,000) worth of jewelry.
	   ``Tom was brilliant,'' Simmonds, Cruise's neighbor, told the
newspaper.
	   Cruise is renting a house near Regent's Park in London with his
wife, Nicole Kidman, and their children. Ms. Kidman is currently
appearing in a sold-out production of ``The Blue Room'' at a West
End theater.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ After suffering a bout of
exhaustion, President Nelson Mandela canceled his appointments for
10 days and went on vacation, his office said Thursday.
	   The 80-year-old president was on holiday in Maputo, Mozambique,
his office said. Mandela's wife, Graca Machel, is from the
neighboring country.
	   He was expected back in Cape Town Oct. 11.
	   Fatigue caused Mandela to curtail activities while on a trip to
Canada last weekend. Doctors gave him a clean bill of health.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ The soccer-crazy city of Calcutta in
eastern India is still mourning Brazil's defeat in the World Cup
football held earlier this year in France.
	   As part of their biggest religious festival being celebrated
Thursday, Calcutta's residents have installed statues of their
fallen hero, Ronaldo, along with those of Goddess Durga, the
principal deity honored during Dussehra.
	   To vent their disappointment over Ronaldo's performance,
traditional idol makers have shown Goddess Durga slaying the
Brazilian striker in place of the traditional demon.
	   Durga is worshipped because she is believed to have descended to
earth to kill a hideous monster.
	   Most football fans hold Ronaldo responsible for his country's
defeat.

Schroeder starts early talks on new German government

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Intent on forming a new German government,
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder and his party, the Social
Democrats, are to start formal negotiations Friday with the
environmentalists Greens.
	   Schroeder invited the Greens to be his junior coalition partner
after he defeated Chancellor Helmut Kohl in elections Sunday and
returned the left to power after 16 years.
	   Upbeat after preliminary talks Thursday with Greens leaders,
Schroeder said he expects to form a coalition within three weeks.
The two sides agreed the new parliament should hold its first
session on Oct. 26 and confirm Schroeder as chancellor the next
day.
	   ``We have agreed that we will negotiate speedily,'' Schroeder
said Thursday after the three-hour talks. ``First we have to agree
on a solid program that is properly financed.''
	   Formal negotiations were expected to be difficult as the future
coalition partners hammer out ideological differences on such
central policy questions as defense, energy and transportation.
	   Joschka Fischer, the most prominent Greens moderate, stressed
that his party's leadership was committed to following through on
its first chance to govern Germany at the national level.
	   ``We want to make this work together,'' he said, standing next
to Schroeder outside the offices of Saarland state in Bonn, where
the two sides met over lunch.
	   The mainstream Social Democrats and the sometimes radical Greens
share a range of goals, such as fighting unemployment, cutting
taxes and granting dual citizenship to long-time foreign residents.
	   But Greens positions on foreign and defense policy _ disbanding
NATO, limiting foreign missions of German soldiers and cutting
troop strength _ promise tough negotiations.

Cuba's drought over, but hunger remains in the island's east
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANITA SNOW &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO DEL VALLE, Cuba (AP) _ Leaves on withering banana
plants finally are green after Hurricane Georges' rains ended
months of drought in Cuba. But now the ripening fruit lies rotting
in the mud.
	   Cuba's worst drought since Fidel Castro seized power almost 40
years ago is over. Its food supply problem, however, is not.
	   ``The primary problem remains: food,'' said Mayor Migdalia Leon,
surveying the damage wrought when Hurricane Georges whipped through
the eastern banana-producing community of San Antonio del Valle
last week. She sighed, tugging on her orange hair net.
	   Nearby, several hundred workers organized by the local Communist
Party gathered bunches of bananas torn loose by Georges. They saved
the best for human consumption; the rest were for the farm animals.
	   While Georges' rains ended the months-long drought, ``the
emergency probably won't be over until January or February,'' said
Rolando Rodriguez, vice president of Guantanamo province. ``We'll
have to concentrate on crops with shorter cycles and see how the
harvests go.''
	   San Antonio del Valle and other agricultural towns in
Guantanamo, a province of 500,000 people, were among the hardest
hit by Hurricane Georges. They also were the worst affected by the
drought, blamed on the weather phenomenon El Nino.
	   Hurricane Georges killed five people, damaged a few bridges,
destroyed half a dozen homes and flooded thousands more in Cuba.
Crops suffered the worst damage, although the government has yet to
release official figures.
	   Before the hurricane, drought had destroyed 42 percent of crops
in five of Cuba's 14 provinces, bringing with it the danger of
hunger. After the storm, Castro announced an increase in government
food rations to 1.6 million people in eastern Cuba.
	   ``There's no regular milk for my daughter,'' said Irene, a young
mother of a 3-year-old who said the government began providing
powdered milk instead of cow's milk to the region's children last
week.
	   It was a setback for Castro's government, which long has strived
to provide a half-gallon of milk a day to every child under 7 years
old.
	   Before Cuba lost most of its aid and trade with the demise of
the Soviet Union, it provided its citizens virtually all the food
they needed to survive _ free.
	   Those rations have since grown slim _ usually just rice, beans
and sometimes a few eggs. Cubans must now supplement the free
rations with other food sold at heavily subsidized prices _ when
it's available.
	   Drought had forced Cuba to ask the United Nations for help in
late August. The U.N. World Food Program appealed for dlrs 20.5
million to buy rice, beans and canned fish for an estimated 615,000
people in five eastern provinces _ Holguin, Las Tunas, Granma,
Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo _ until the next harvest in May.
	   Cuba normally receives dlrs 2 million to dlrs 3 million in food
aid from the U.N. World Food Program every year. It still has to
import more grain _ it won't say how much _ to make ends meet.
	   Castro announced this week that all residents in eastern Cuba
will receive an extra 2.2 pounds (1 kilo) of grains _ usually beans
or peas _ per month. That's in addition to the extra rice, peas,
bread and cooking oil the government was already providing citizens
in drought regions.
	   He also said all Cuban children under 14 and adults over 60
would get extra rations through December.
	   With the exception of sugar, most crops in Cuba's east are grown
purely for domestic consumption. Along with bananas, other staple
crops such as yucca, manioc and yams were hard hit.
	   People here know that Granma province provides a good part of
the bananas, a staple crop, consumed throughout this nation of 11
million residents.
	   ``We lost 95 percent of our banana crop,'' Migdalia Leon said.
``We are now going to have to dedicate ourselves to crops with
shorter growth cycles to be able to survive: squash, cucumbers,
salad greens.''
	   But she remained optimistic. ``The drought was harder to deal
with than this,'' she said. ``Before we had water distribution
problems as well. Now all the reservoirs are full.''

Yugoslavia offers new coperation in effort to stave off NATO attack

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Seeking to head off threatened NATO
attacks, Yugoslavia's Serb leadership has offered to let foreign
experts investigate massacres of ethnic Albanian civilians in
Kosovo.
	   Also Thursday, Britain and the United States failed to convince
the Russians and Chinese to specifically blame the Serbs for the
killings as the U.N. Security Council strongly condemned the
massacres and called on President Slobodan Milosevic to punish
those responsible.
	   In another sign of the complexity facing those searching for an
end to the crisis, ethnic Albanian guerrillas said they did not
intend to abandon their battle for independence in the southern
Serb province, where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of the
population.
	   Attacks by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against police and
soldiers led Milosevic to launch the crackdown Feb. 28.
	   In the nearby Albanian capital Tirana, rebels claimed they
killed 25 police and soldiers Wednesday near the border village of
Junik as the first step in a campaign to ``strike the enemy where
he feels most secure.''
	   The Yugoslav army Thursday confirmed the rebel attack but put
its losses at six dead and seven wounded.
	   In Washington, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic said
his government was willing to have international experts take part
in a investigation into the massacres to ``establish and prove the
facts.'' The Foreign Ministry in the capital Belgrade said
invitations went out to forensic experts from Finland. Serb police
have denied responsibility for murdering civilians.
	   The Serbs also announced the withdrawal of combat forces from
battlefields in Kosovo. But ethnic Albanian sources claimed
fighting continued Thursday along the border with Albania, where
separatist guerrillas take sanctuary.
	   Despite the Yugoslav offer, Robert Gelbard, the U.S. envoy to
the Balkans, said the massacres have left the Belgrade government
with ``no credibility at all.''
	   ``We have seen atrocities piled on atrocities,'' Gelbard told
the British Broadcasting Corporation. ``Our people in Kosovo ...
have verified that these atrocities have occurred, that these
latest atrocities that occurred piled on top of previous ones.''
	   Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, told his governing
Labor Party that ``we don't want to use force'' but warned
Milosevic ``that if it will take force, Britain is ready to back
force.''
	   In the latest allegation, Human Rights Watch said a
self-described survivor of one massacre supplied chilling new
details of alleged atrocities.
	   Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch said a wounded Albanian
reported that he and 13 other men were beaten and shot by Serb
police Saturday. He was the only survivor.
	   Bouckaert said the survivor's story was corroborated by other
witnesses from Golubovac, a village five kilometers (three miles)
from Donje Obrinje, site of another massacre.
	   ``We do not believe his safety can be guaranteed in his present
location,'' Bouckaert said. ``One wound is very large and infected
and there is no adequate medical care in the area he is located
in.''
	   Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo support independence, although
many Western nations do not, fearing that could further destabilize
the Balkans.
	   In Washington, the State Department urged Americans in
Yugoslavia to consider leaving. Spokesman James Rubin said military
action is closer to a reality ``because of Belgrade's failure to
comply with the requirements of the international community.''
	   Meanwhile, the Clinton administration began laying the
groundwork in Congress for possible new NATO air strikes against
Serb military positions. Clinton dispatched his national security
team Thursday to Capitol Hill to brief lawmakers. Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle suggested military action ``may be required.''
	   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the senior Democrat on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States and its NATO
allies should prepare to launch an air campaign.
	   ``With the onset of winter only weeks away, a humanitarian
catastrophe looms,'' Biden said in a speech to a foreign-policy
group. ``The stability of the entire southern Balkans hangs in the
balance.''

Croatia's wartime cardinal this weekend, he will be honoring one of
the Balkans' most controversial figures _ denounced as a Nazi
collaborator but hailed by many Croats as a national martyr.
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who will be beatified Saturday, was
tried by the Communists in 1946 and sentenced to 16 years
imprisonment for collaborating with the pro-Nazi Croatian puppet
state, established by the Germans during World War II. He died in
1960. In 1991, when Croatia broke from Communist Yugoslavia, the
new nationalist government rehabiliated Stepinac and hailed him as
a national hero.
	   The widely differing views of Stepinac's life illustrate the
problems facing this newly independent nation struggling with its
wartime past and defining its own place in modern Europe.
	   For decades, Serbs and many Jews saw Stepinac as a symbol of the
fascist state that tried to exterminate them. His critics said he
blessed fascist Croat soldiers, maintained contacts with pro-Nazi
leader Ante Pavelic and carried out the regime's order to convert
Serbs, who are Orthodox Christians, to Catholicism.
	   For Croats, Catholicism is one of the foundations of their
national identity. The Catholic faith separates Croats from the
Orthodox Serbs who dominated the former Yugoslavia.
	   Stepinac was protrayed as a martyr _ the victim of Communist
attempts to suppress the Roman Catholic Church and stifle the
national aspirations of the Croat people. Some Croatian media
speculate Stepinac was poisoned in prison.
	   The editor of Croatian television's religious program section,
Tonci Trstenjak, said he hoped the beatification ``will clear the
slandered face of Croatia.''
	   But the Simon Wiesenthal Center asked the Vatican to postpone
the ceremony, a step on the possible road to sainthood, until
independent researchers review Stepinac's role.
	   Meantime, another figure from the Nazi-era past _ Dinko Sakic _
is in jail pending trial for war crimes committed while serving as
the commander of the notorious fascist concentration camp of
Jasenovac, where thousands of Serbs, Jews and anti-fascist Croats
died.
	   Sakic escaped to Argentina after the war and remained free until
June when he was extradited to Croatia to stand trial.
	   Stepinac's comments about the camp which Sakic ran are often
cited by Croats to defend the cardinal as a religious leader who
was struggling to make the best of a bad situation during the war.
	   In public statements, Stepinac called the Jasenovac camp a
``shame.'' When greeting Pavelic at the entrance to the Zagreb
Cathedral, Stepinac looked at him and quoted the Seventh
Commandment: ``Thou shalt not kill.''
	   Stepinac's speeches show that as early as 1942, he was speaking
out, albeit carefully, against the excesses of the regime.''
	   ``All nations and races are from the God and they all have a
right to live,'' Stepinac said at a Mass in 1942 when killings in
Jasenovac and other camps were in full swing. ``That is why
Croatian church has always condemned injustice and violence
committed in the name of class, racist or ethnic theories.''
	   Stepinac's admirers also argue that ``allowing'' Stepinac to
convert Serbs and Jews to Catholicism offered a chance to escape
persecution.
	   Croatia's Jewish community, whose 30,000 members perished during
the Holocaust, said they were ``grateful'' to Stepinac for saving
lives of many Jews. However, in a statement released Wednesday,
they say that ``the time will judge'' him.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Police battled hundreds of protesting
workers and students in cities across Ecuador on Thursday during a
one-day national strike against austerity measures imposed by new
President Jamil Mahuad.
	   Two men in the port cities of Guayaquil and Esmeraldas were
killed by stray bullets, and a police officer was killed by a bomb
in the city of Portoviejo, 150 (240 kilometers) southwest of the
capital Quito, police said.
	   Buses and taxis were scarce in major cities as many drivers
respected the strike call by Ecuador's largest labor federation,
the leftist-led United Workers Front. The strike is the first major
challenge to the centrist Mahuad, who took office on Aug. 10,
promising to rescue the impoverished South American nation from
bankruptcy.
	   Ecuador's powerful unions have toppled governments in the past.
Former President Abdala Bucaram was removed from power in 1997 by
Congress after leftist-led unions led a wave of strikes and
protests against a similar economic austerity package.
	   Strikers have vowed to force Mahuad to back down from austerity
measures he announced on Sep. 14, which devalued Ecuador's national
currency and ended subsidies on cooking gas, electricity and diesel
oil. Prices of the fuels have increased by up to 400 percent,
causing the cost of many basic food products and public
transportation to soar.
	   Mahuad has said the tough measures were necessary to end 40
percent inflation and trim a ballooning budget deficit that had the
impoverished Andean nation on the verge of financial collapse.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A former coup leader who is the
front-runner for the December presidential race repeated
accusations Thursday that his political enemies may try to kill
him.
	   ``They are planning the assassination of Hugo Chavez. I don't
have the slightest doubt,'' the former paratrooper told reporters.
	   Chavez, 44, declined to offer details on the alleged plot. But
he said he was turning over the information to authorities.
	   He has also alleged that some military officials are planning a
coup attempt to prevent him from winning the election or taking

million barbiturate pills from two homes in northern Mexico.
	   The drugs, expired packages of Mandrax, were recovered Wednesday
in and near the Nayarit state capital, Tepic, 390 miles (627
kilometers) northwest of Mexico City.
	   Agents of the federal Attorney General's Office found many of
the pills buried under a patio behind one of the houses, according
to a press statement. Police detained one person for questioning.
	   Mandrax, which suppresses the central nervous system, can be

store for dlrs 4,200 (5,000 reals), alleging her pooch got pregnant
there, the O Globo newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Ana Beatriz Barbosa da Silva, a doctor, was ``shocked'' to find
her 3-year-old Snowy giving birth to four puppies, said the daily.
	   She is convinced they were conceived in an upmarket pet store,
where Snowy was left her to be groomed along with a group of male
dogs, said O Globo.
	   Store owner, Eduardo Jabor Antonini, denies responsibility,
saying dogs in his care are separated, reported O Globo. He is
taking out a separate legal action against Silva.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilians expect tougher times
will hit soon _ though even austerity measures don't appear to be
turning many against their president ahead of Sunday's election.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, well out front of his 11
rivals in the presidential race, said this week that an austerity
package to ease Brazil's economic crisis isn't coming _ at least
not before Tuesday.
	   But while Cardoso campaigned, his economic team met in
Washington with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
negotiating an emergency loan package reportedly worth dlrs 30
billion or more.
	   Despite leading a government with a ballooning budget deficit
and battered credibility, voters seem to consider the 67-year-old
sociologist who took office in 1995 the best prepared to overcome
50 percent annual interest rates and unemployment that is at its
highest in a decade.
	   ``There's a tremendous distrust of the future,'' said Alexandre
Barros, head of Early Warning consultants in Brasilia, the capital.
``Voters are saying, `He's not what I want, but there's no
alternative.'''
	   The latest survey by Ibope, one of Brazil's most respected
polling institutes, showed Cardoso holding steady with 47 percent
of the vote, compared to 24 percent for his only real challenger,
former labor leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist
Workers Party.
	   Ibope's Sept. 24-27 survey of 3,000 people nationwide had a
margin of error of 3 percentage points. Recent surveys by other
pollsters have produced similar figures.
	   Brazil is paying the price for not reducing its budget deficit
when foreign financing was abundant. The deficit today is nearly
dlrs 60 billion, more than 7 percent of the gross domestic product,
and unemployment is 8 percent.
	   Much of the drain was from generous social security and civil
service benefits. Proposals to reform them are stuck in Congress,
and the government hasn't even drafted a new tax law.
	   Cardoso says Congress will vote on the reform proposals soon
after the election. And a first-ballot win, along with the expected
renewal of his centrist coalition, would strengthen his hand.
	   But no one expects those reforms to be enough.
	   Cardoso last week promised to slash spending in 1999 and hinted
that more taxes may be on the way.
	   In Washington, the IMF urged fiscal responsibility. Officials
there, along with public and private lenders, were working on an
emergency loan to bolster Brazil's reserves, which have shrunk by
dlrs 25 billion since July.
	   Isael Ferreira de Souza, a Rio gas station attendant, has lost
his faith in the government's economic plan _ and its leaders.
	   ``The plan brought stability but also unemployment,'' he said.
``I don't know who to vote for. Maybe nobody.''

Mexican debtors pressure Supreme Court for relief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Bank-Bailout &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Scores of bankrupt debtors staged a rally
outside the Supreme Court to ask for a ``just solution'' in their
case against the nation's bankers.
	   The court's 11 justices have been under intense pressure from
both sides as they discuss the legality of charging compound
interest on past-due loans, a practice subject to conflicting laws
in Mexico.
	   The double interest charges along with high interest rates have
made it virtually impossible for small and medium debtors to pay
what they owe.
	   Around 120 people took part in Thursday's protest organized by a
nationwide group known as El Barzon _ Spanish for ``The Yoke'' _
following newspaper reports based on leaked documents that suggest
the court's ruling will favor banks.
	   Financial analysts believe a ruling in favor of the many
millions of small and medium debtors is unlikely.
	   The Supreme Court's decision ``could have a major effect if it
decides against the banks, but I don't think that can happen,''
analyst Jonathan Heath said.
	   Heath said the debtors' problems were not caused by banks
charging compound interest, but by the economic turmoil that
followed the 1994 peso crash and sent interest rates soaring.
	   ``Interest rates got too high after the devaluation and banks in
Mexico faced very hard times. When people stopped paying, that
drove up interest rates because of increased risk. It became a
vicious circle,'' he said.
	   El Barzon attracted thousands of middle-class debtors who
defaulted on their loans when interest rates hit nearly 110 percent
in March 1995.
	   ``People who defaulted in 1995 owe six to eight times the amount
they borrowed,'' said Jose Maria Imaz, a businessman who joined El
Barzon after the crisis.
	   Outside the Supreme Court, debtors who lost their jobs following
the crisis and saw their debts multiply vented their anger against
the government over its handling of the economy.
	   ``The president has never listened to us. All we have is El
Barzon,'' said Maria Luisa Freymann, who is dlrs 70,000 in debt
even after she managed to pay three-fourths of a dlrs 40,000
mortgage.
	   Another debtor seethed as she remembered her mother's death from
a stroke after months of harassment by bank officials. ``It's not
that we don't want to pay, we just can't'' she said.
	   ``We are now poorer than the poor,'' Freymann said.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ His shoulders are stooped and his speech is
slurred, but the iron will that helped Pope John Paul II stare down
communism still serves to lead his church into its third
millennium.
	   Despite signs of growing isolation and dependence on a small
group of advisers, John Paul refuses to allow his infirmities to
get the better of him as he marks the 20th anniversary of his
papacy.
	   Already the longest-serving pope this century, John Paul has
made his mark as the most traveled pope in history, a charismatic
Pole who took totalitarian regimes to task and helped bring down
communism in Europe.
	   His message of morality and his demand for an unswerving
commitment to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church have not
changed since the day of his installation when his voice boomed
out, ``Open the doors to Christ.''
	   Physically, there is no comparison to the robust Archbishop
Karol Wojtyla of Krakow who was elected to the papacy by his fellow
cardinals on Oct. 16, 1978. He was the first Pole ever chosen as
pope and the first non-Italian pontiff in 455 years.
	   To advancing age _ he's 78 _ and the burdens of office must be
added a long list of ailments. He was shot in the abdomen by a
would-be assassin in 1981. In later years he has been in surgery
for removal of what the Vatican said was a benign bowel tumor, for
removal of an inflamed appendix and for treatment of a broken leg.
	   At the Vatican, prelates openly attribute his slurred speech,
trembling left hand and sometimes absent expression to Parkinson's
disease, a progressive neurological disorder.
	   The Vatican, however, has never stated exactly what ails the
pope.
	   ``It is up to the pope's doctor to report on his health,'' the
papal spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said.
	   Navarro-Valls, a Spanish layman, was rumored to have nearly lost
his job when he told reporters two years ago that John Paul
suffered from an ``extrapyramidal syndrome,'' a motor system
problem that could include Parkinson's.
	   Vatican insiders dismiss any idea of the pope resigning if his
health deteriorates, certainly not before the church completes its
millennium celebrations in 2000, when millions of pilgrims are
expected in Rome. The Vatican plans for John Paul to make nearly
daily public appearances that year, and his 80th birthday on May
18, 2000, is marked on the Holy Year calendar.
	   ``This pope has constantly surprised us. I expect him to
continue to do so into the next millennium,'' said the Rev. Thomas
Reese, editor of the Jesuit weekly America and an expert on the
Vatican.
	   Some changes in the papacy have been visible, however.
	   During his vacation this summer in the Italian Alps, journalists
were kept far away from the pope, who was driven on excursions in a
car with darkened windows. Unlike past years, he didn't stop to
bless children and wave to well-wishers.
	   Some bishops visiting Rome on church business say they no longer
press the pope with their problems, to keep from disturbing him.
	   In the meantime, John Paul seems to be leaning more heavily on a
few close aides, giving them their say on such things as planning
the 2000 celebrations, writing diplomatic statements and organizing
his daily schedule.
	   They include two Italians, the Vatican's secretary of state,
Cardinal Angelo Sodano, and the undersecretary, Archbishop Giovanni
Battista Re. Another is John Paul's Polish secretary, Monsignor
Stanislaw Dziwisz, who was recently promoted to bishop as a reward
for faithful service, which began in Krakow 32 years ago.
	   When John Paul elevated new cardinals earlier this year and kept
one name secret, speculation fell on Re as the mystery ``prince''
of the church. The pope showed his esteem when he took the entire
papal entourage and security apparatus on a day trip to Re's
hometown near Lake Garda in northern Italy in July during John
Paul's mountain vacation.
	   Those who deal with the pope assure skeptics that he has lost
none of his acumen and that his memory is sharp. During a trip to
Nigeria in March, the pope recognized a reporter from Rome amid a
crowd of Nigerian and Vatican security men and waved a greeting.
	   While such high-profile trips as the visit to Cuba last January
are not in the works, John Paul plans to keep up his travels next
year. Destinations include Mexico and St. Louis in January, Poland
in June and possibly Romania.
	   Frictions with the Orthodox church are holding up a visit to
Moscow, while the pope's much hoped-for trip to the Holy Land seems
as stalled as the Middle East peace process.
	   The pope has written a new encyclical, or major statement on
church policy, which will be released around his 20th anniversary.
It is titled ``Reason and Faith'' and examines the role of religion
in the modern world, a prime theme of his papacy.
	   In recent months, the Vatican has further cracked down on
dissenting Catholic theologians, with the pope making clear he sees
no room for debate on such issues as the ban on the ordination of
women, the requirement that priests be celibate and the prohibition
on contraception.
	   John Paul has always held his ground on those issues, as well as
pushing worldwide campaigns against abortion.
	   Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the watchdog for doctrinal
deviations, said recently that no one should be surprised at the
Vatican actions. ``Where have they been for the past 10 years?'' he
asked.
	   The pope raises sexual and family issues frequently during his
travels.
	   Navarro-Valls, the papal spokesman, said he doesn't believe John
Paul will be remembered as ``the pope who said `no' to condoms but
as the defender of human dignity.''
	   In late August, as a frail-looking John Paul greeted pilgrims at
his Castel Gandolfo vacation palace, one man yelled from the crowd,
``There has never been such a likable and capable pope.''
	   John Paul responded: ``Some like me, others don't. That's the
way it is.''

John Paul says consistent `no' to `culture of death'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Pope's 20th &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   John Paul II has been firm on maintaining traditional Roman
Catholic teachings, showing little patience for those who choose
selectively what precepts to follow. Some of his positions:
	   ___
	   ABORTION: Calls it ``abominable crime'' and ``shame of
humanity.'' Says stopping abortion, and euthanasia, is nothing less
than ``the salvation of man and of civilization.''
	   ___
	   CONTRACEPTION: Maintains church's ban, putting contraception in
category of ``disparagement of human life.'' Says birth control
created false freedom, decline of values, erosion of conscience.
	   ___
	   HOMOSEXUALITY: Says homosexuals should be treated with
compassion. but rules out sex between gays, along with any sex
outside marriage.
	   ___
	   DIVORCE: Continues stricture on divorced and remarried Catholics
receiving communion, but they may attend Mass.
	   ___
	   CAPITAL PUNISHMENT: Says it should be ``very rare, if
practically non-existent.''
	   ___
	   PRIESTS: Says they are male because Christ was male and chose
male apostles. Retains celibacy rule as Jesus' ideal and in keeping
with priests' duties.
	   ___
	   ALTAR GIRLS: Vatican endorsed girls serving at altar in 1994,
but practice was already widespread.
	   ___
	   LIBERATION THEOLOGY: Criticizes this movement, which sees
church's mission as lifting people out of oppression and poverty,
when it includes Marxist doctrines like class struggle and violence
for social and political change.
	   ___
	   ECONOMICS: Preaches against rampant capitalism, unrestrained
quest for profit and unbridled materialism.

	   Bolivians in bowler hats bowed before him. New Guinea tribesmen
in dugout canoes strained for a glimpse. Doomed AIDS patients in
Cuba asked his blessing.
	   Pope John Paul II has traveled as no pope before him, and
despite infirmity and advancing years shows no intention of slowing
down. A three-day trip to Croatia in October is scheduled as the
84th foreign tour of his papacy.
	   John Paul has visited more than 100 countries as part of his
mission to get as close as he can to the estimated 1 billion Roman
Catholics in the world.
	   ``Many say the pope travels too much,'' he once acknowledged in
a talk to Vatican cardinals, then defended his trips as ``authentic
pilgrimages to the sanctuary of living people of God.''
	   By the church's count, he has spent about 10 percent of his time
outside the Vatican.
	   Pope Paul VI was the first pope in modern times to travel
outside Italy, making nine foreign tours between 1964 and 1970,
starting with the Holy Land. He didn't travel in the last eight
years of his papacy.
	   Ahead of the 78-year-old John Paul is a trip to Mexico and St.
Louis in January, a return home to Poland in June and a possible
pilgrimage to Romania later in 1999.
	   John Paul has often expressed a desire to visit the Holy Land by
2000, when the Vatican will mark the beginning of Christianity's
third millennium, but the trip is up in the air because of
political difficulties.

Europeans dominate list of potential successors to John Paul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With FEA-Pope's 20th &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Europeans in general _ and Italians in
particular _ dominate any list of names mentioned as possible
successors to Pope John Paul II.
	   But the man emerging as pope from a conclave is often a
surprise, with obvious candidates passed over to meet the
particular wishes of the voting cardinals.
	   They could be looking for a short, transitional papacy, a man
who could please crowds and feel comfortable with them, or prefer
an intellectual or deeply spiritual figure.
	   John Paul was a surprise choice, the first non-Italian in 455
years.
	   With the Italians an ever-smaller numerical bloc among the
cardinal-electors, the question is whether the non-Italians are
willing to give the papacy back.
	   Cardinals considered ``papabile,'' Italian meaning particularly
eligible for the papacy, include:
	   _Carlo Maria Martini, 71, archbishop of Milan, Italy's most
sophisticated city. He is a Jesuit and there has never been a
Jesuit pope.
	   _Dionigi Tettamanzi, 64, archbishop of Genoa, Italy. Considered
a moderate and a rising figure in the Italian church.
	   _Angelo Sodano, 70, the Vatican's secretary of state, or second
man in the church hierarchy after the pope. An Italian, he speaks
several languages.
	   _Christoph Schoenborn, archbishop of Vienna, Austria. Vatican
observers often say he has the abilities, but at 53 is still
relatively young.
	   _Jan Schotte, 70, a Vatican-based Belgian. Considered a
conservative, he has kept up close contacts with bishops and

Specter of Ebola haunts village survivors in Gabon

<TEXT>
	   MAKOKOU, Gabon (AP) _ The evil began when a distant relative
paid an unexpected visit from the rain forest. One by one, Bernard
Massika's loved ones began to fall ill.
	   Massika watched the younger of his two wives lapse into a
feverish coma as her skin turned a deathly blue-black. His
8-year-old daughter began vomiting and coughing up blood.
	   By the time the scourge lifted a month later, 10 members of his
family _ including all nine children _ were dead.
	   Doctors identified the assailant as Ebola, the dreaded virus
that periodically emerges from the forests of Africa, killing up to
80 percent of its victims. The virus, which rarely spreads far
because it kills so fast, is named for a river in a Congo region
where the disease was first noticed by health experts in 1976.
	   The cold, hard facts of modern science did not convince Massika,
who gave another name to his woes _ vampires.
	   ``This was not a disease,'' Massika says, recalling the Ebola
outbreak that killed his family and at least 11 others in early
1996. ``We were attacked by powerful spirits of darkness.''
	   More than two decades after the first documented outbreak and
three years after a deadly resurgence in nearby Congo, Ebola
remains a disease shrouded in mystery.
	   Gabon is the only country known to have suffered three sizable
Ebola epidemics, which killed at least 100 people since 1994.
Still, many people in the West African nation deny its existence.
	   The disease has not been seen anywhere since Gabon's third and
latest outbreak ended in February 1997, said Dr. Ray Arthur, a
virologist with the World Health Organization.
	   Like Massika, some Gabonese blame Ebola's ghastly symptoms _
massive internal bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea _ on witches,
ghouls and vampires.
	   Although it is responsible for only a fraction of the deaths
caused by Africa's more common ailments like malaria, dysentery and
sleeping sickness, Ebola has a terrifying mystique.
	   Some survivors never recover from the trauma of falling prey to
what they believe is black magic. Others live in fear of the next
outbreak.
	   After watching his family decimated, Massika and some other
relatives were forced to flee from their village of Epassendje in
northeastern Gabon. They ended up here in Makokou, a sleepy jungle
town about 200 miles (320 kilometers) from Gabon's capital,
Libreville.
	   Massika suffered the further indignity of being ousted as
chieftain of Epassendje by villagers who believed his immediate
family was cursed. He was replaced by his younger brother, whose
household was spared the plague.
	   Massika's wife Pauline, who nearly died, has not spoken with her
maternal family since the ordeal. Although her husband claims it
was his traditional medicine that cured her, Pauline refuses to
talk about it and will not shake hands with strangers.
	   ``How can I believe all of this was just an accident?'' Massika
asks. ``My enemies are working against me.''
	   Dr. Bertin Pambou, a Gabonese physician who conducts Ebola
research for Yale University, believes the intersection of
traditional and modern cultures in the rain forests has provided a
fertile breeding ground for the disease.
	   The virus may have always existed in the jungle, but mass
outbreaks apparently are a recent occurrence. Traditional forest
people probably died alone before infecting others.
	   These days, commercial hunters and loggers traipse through
remote areas and return to villages that are unprepared to handle
an epidemic.
	   One of the most common ways of contracting Ebola is from
touching an infected corpse. Traditional culture in many parts of
Africa dictate that family members wash the cadaver of the
deceased.
	   More contagious than AIDS but much less so than the common cold,
Ebola spreads quickly through contact with body fluids and kills
most victims within a week. Outbreaks have a short life span
because people who are infected die quickly _ often before passing
it on.
	   Experts around the world are looking for a vaccine or a cure,
but both appear to be years away.
	   Nobody has yet been able to pinpoint Ebola's source, although
some experts believe it may be carried by wild animals _ possibly
insects, rodents, bats. Like humans, monkeys catch and are often
killed by the disease.
	   Pambou and other researchers trap animals and take blood and
tissue samples in a quest to discover Ebola's secrets.
	   Massika believes the only reason he was spared is that he is a
practitioner of traditional medicine and arcane lore. He says he
fought magic with magic, using wild herbs to stave off the Ebola
attack.
	   ``Nobody and nothing can kill me until I am prepared to die,''
he boasts.
	   Pambou, who was once forced into a month-long quarantine after
an Ebola patient vomited on his arm, believes some people may have
developed an immunity against the virus or discovered natural
medicines to fight it.
	   ``It is possible that there are traditional solutions ... They
may even work in some cases. We don't know for sure,'' he says.

Security Council condemns massacre in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Hoping to increase pressure on
Yugoslavia's Serb leadership, the Security Council strongly
condemned the recent massacres in Kosovo and called on President
Slobodan Milosevic to investigate and punish those responsible for
the bloodshed.
	   Without singling out the Serbs, the council on Thursday
expressed ``considerable alarm'' that fighting in the southern Serb
province between Serbs and ethnic Albanian separatists was
continuing despite the U.N. demand last week for a cease-fire.
	   The statement is not binding and adds no new legal backing for
any NATO strikes, plans for which are being finalized in Brussels.
The statement represented the minimum action the council could have
taken, far short of issuing a resolution denouncing the massacres.
	   Russia and China have balked at any stronger action,
particularly a resolution, which carries the weight of
international law.
	   The United States praised the council's declaration.
	   ``I think its a very clear, direct message to the government in
Belgrade that they have to be accountable and responsible for their
activities,'' said deputy U.S. ambassador Peter Burleigh.
	   Earlier this week, diplomats, journalists and human rights
workers saw as many as 18 mutilated bodies in the forests around
the Kosovo town of Obrija. Residents also in the nearby town of
Golubovac reported Serb forces surrounded a group of refugees on
Saturday, separated 13 men and shot them.
	   The Serbs have denied involvement in the massacres. Serb Deputy
Premier Vojislav Seselj claimed Thursday that Western countries
staged the massacre ``to push through ... a NATO attack decision in
the U.N. Security Council.''
	   Serbian security forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo. Hundreds have been killed and an estimated
275,000 people have been driven from their homes since the
crackdown began in February.
	   In the statement, the council didn't single out the Serbs
directly for the massacres.
	   Council members ``strongly condemned those responsible for the
atrocities and called upon President Milosevic and the government
in Belgrade immediately to investigate and identify and punish
those responsible,'' council president Jeremy Greenstock of Britain
said.
	   In discussions Thursday among council members, Russia and China
indicated they wanted more information on the massacres before
pinning blame on the Serbs, diplomats said.
	   The council demanded immediate compliance with previous
resolutions and ``made clear their intent to prevent a major
humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo and to promote peaceful
negotiations,'' Greenstock said.
	   He urged the U.N. chief report to the council by Monday on
whether the Serbs were complying with last week's resolution
demanding a cease-fire and a political settlement to the conflict.
That resolution didn't explicitly authorize NATO action, but does
permit the use of military force.
	   NATO's decision-making body, however, took another step Thursday
to prepare airstrikes against Serb forces.
	   The North Atlantic Council approved an ``activation request''
for the 16-member alliance to formally commit warplanes and other
forces for an eventual air campaign, diplomats said.
	   In its statement, the council also didn't address NATO
preparations.
	   Russia and China have flatly rejected the use of force to end
the conflict between Serb forces and ethnic Albanians, who make up
90 percent of the southern Serb province and are fighting for
independence.
	   As permanent council members, Russia and China could veto any
new resolution authorizing military action. Russia has religious
and cultural ties to the Serbs. China is traditionally opposed to
any military intervention into what it considers an internal
matter, fearing a precedent could be set for its own disputes with
Taiwan and Tibet.
	   France, another permanent member, has indicated the council
needed to pass another resolution to give NATO the specific
political backing for any offensive.
	   The United States has repeatedly said it believes that prior
U.N. resolutions authorize NATO action, and no new resolution is
needed. The British haven't stated a position, but called
Thursday's emergency meeting the day they took over the Security
Council's rotating presidency.
	   NATO's military have been working for months on plans to
intervene in Kosovo, where Serbian security forces are trying to
crush ethnic Albanian separatists. Potential targets include police
camps in Pristina, Pec, Kosovska Mitrovica, Djakovica, Prizren and
Urosevac.
	   Hundreds have been killed and an estimated 275,000 people have
been driven from their homes in Kosovo since Serb police and the
Yugoslav army began their crackdown in February.

Tyson psychiatric reports to be made public
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ A psychiatrist's evaluation of Mike Tyson's
mental state could be made public as early as Friday, despite
efforts by attorneys for the former heavyweight champion to keep
them confidential.
	   A judge reluctantly ruled late Thursday that the reports from a
five-day series of psychological reports done on Tyson must be made
public if Tyson wants to pursue his return to the ring in Nevada.
	   ``I'd like to help you,'' District Judge Gene Porter told
Tyson's attorney, Jim Jimmerson. ``I feel sorry for the man, but I
can't help you.''
	   Porter ruled at a hastily called hearing that there was no state
statute that would force the Nevada Athletic Commission to keep
private the reports done last week by a team of psychiatrists at
Massachusetts General Hospital.
	   The reports were done at the request of the commission, which
said it had to know more about Tyson's state of mind before
deciding whether to license him at a hearing tentatively set for
Oct. 19.
	   ``What good is it to embarrass Mr. Tyson?'' Jimmerson asked in
arguing that the reports be kept confidential.
	   Jimmerson said later he expected to get the reports from the
doctors Thursday night or Friday morning and would forward them to
the commission. At that point, the commission would make them
available to the media under the state's open records law.
	   Much of the contents of the reports probably would have come out
into the open when Dr. Ronald Schouten appears at the commission
hearing to answer questions about the tests he and other
psychiatrists performed on Tyson in Boston.
	   But now they will be released in advance of the hearing and
possibly provide more detail into the state of the 32-year-old
Tyson's mind.
	   ``I think it taints the opportunity for a fair hearing on
this,'' Jimmerson said.
	   Jimmerson said none of the members of Tyson's advisory team have
seen the report, but that he expected it to be a mixed view of the
former champion.
	   ``I have no reason to believe the reports will be adverse,'' he
said. ``But I'm sure there will be some unflattering things that
come out. We hope it is looked on upon balance by the commission.''
	   Jimmerson filed a lawsuit Thursday morning seeking the records
be kept confidential, and a hearing was quickly scheduled before
Porter.
	   ``No person wants their medical or psychological records entered
as public exhibits,'' Jimmerson said. ``Records that speak to a
person's mental fitness are inherently confidential. They wouldn't
normally ever be disseminated to the public.''
	   Deputy Attorney General Donald Haight, representing the
commission, said it planned to release the documents because it
didn't want to expose members of the commission to possible
criminal charges for violating state record laws. Haight, though,
said he was also sympathetic to Tyson's plight.
	   ``The commission is on the horns of a dilemma,'' Haight said.
	   The suit was the latest twist in Tyson's increasingly complex
battle to regain the boxing license stripped from him for biting
Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   It came even as Tyson's doctors still haven't complied with a
directive from the Nevada Athletic Commission to deliver results
from the test to the commission. The records were to have been
given to the commission Monday, but Tyson's doctors have expressed
reservations about making them public.
	   Tyson is tentatively scheduled to go back before the commission
Oct. 19 in yet another bid to be allowed to return to the sport he
once dominated. That date could be changed, though, if the
commission doesn't get the reports soon.
	   ``I can't set a date until I have the records,'' said Marc
Ratner, executive director of the commission.
	   The former heavyweight champion was ordered by the commission
following a marathon hearing Sept. 19 to undergo psychological
testing before they would decide whether to license him.
	   At that hearing, Tyson appeared to agree to allow the results of
the exams to be made public, and Nevada authorities said they
planned to release them to the media at the same time they are
given to the commission.
	   In addition to the tests, Tyson is expected to be grilled over
an Aug. 31 traffic accident in Maryland in which two men claim he
assaulted him.
	   Tyson's attorneys have been negotiating with attorneys for the
two men in hopes of reaching a settlement before the commission
hearing.

Japan's unemployment back to record high 4.3 percent in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate bounced back to a record
high 4.3 percent in August, boosted by an increase in corporate
restructurings and bankruptcies, the government agency said Friday.
	   The number of jobless people set a new record high of 2.97
million, the statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination
Agency said.
	   The nation's work force shrank by 440,000 people to 65.46
million, contracting seven months in a row compared with
year-earlier levels, the agency said.
	   The labor figures were the latest in the series of data that
showed further deterioration of the Japanese economy.
	   The return to a record high jobless rate could exacerbate
consumer concerns about job security, damping domestic demand
further, analysts warned.
	   The jobless rate first touched 4.3 percent in June, then
improved to 4.1 percent in July, temporarily bucking a trend that
has seen the rate rise steadily from 3.4 percent a year ago.
	   A bureau official told reporters that the labor market
conditions are unlikely to improve any time soon.
	   In a separate announcement Friday, the Labor Ministry said that
the August ratio of job offers to job seekers, an indicator of
demand for labor, was 0.50, unchanged from July.
	   This means only 50 jobs were being offered for every 100 workers
seeking employment in August.
	   The figure is at its lowest level since the agency first began
compiling such data in 1963.

Howard urges voters to make a clear choice at Saturday's poll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ With the outcome of this weekend's
national election still too close to call, Prime Minister John
Howard on Friday urged voters to make a clear choice and give the
victor a firm majority in Parliament.
	   On the eve of the Saturday vote, Howard's coalition and the main
opposition Labor Party are neck and neck in opinion polls, with
government members warning that Labor may end up with a slim lead.
	   Labor leader Kim Beazley has engineered a strong comeback since
his party's humiliating defeat in 1996, when Howard amassed a 93-49
majority in the lower house of Australia's bicameral Parliament,
where the new government will be chosen.
	   Labor must beat Howard by a margin of 4 percentage points to win
the 27 lower house seats it would need to reclaim the Cabinet.
	   If Labor succeeds, Howard's would become the first one-term
government since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
	   Labor's campaign has been helped by the unpopularity of Howard's
plan to introduce a 10 percent tax increase on all goods and
services. Howard says tax reform is crucial to Australia's economic
future and has staked the government's reelection hopes on the
package.
	   Despite being sweetened with promises of big income tax cuts,
polls show the new tax is unpopular with voters.
	   On Friday, Howard warned voters that to give their support to
candidates from small parties or independents as a protest against
the new tax may lead to a Labor government.
	   ``If people don't want a Labor government they should be very
careful to direct their preferences back to (the coalition),''
Howard told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Beazley said Howard was likely to win because his government had
misled people about the tax.
	   ``I think the prime minister has skated in with a very big tax
change without any real scrutiny by the Australian people,'' he
told the ABC.
	   Aboriginal health and welfare issues have been almost absent
from the campaign. Conservatives are wary of them because their own
views are not too far from far-right politician Pauline Hanson.
	   Hanson's One Nation party, with its anti-Asian, anti-Aboriginal
views, became a national political force in June when it won 11 of
the 89 seats in Queensland's state Parliament.
	   Support for One Nation, however, has sunk in recent months, and
Hanson may lose her own parliamentary seat. Still, it could
influence which party wins in closely contested districts.
	   Howard's governing Liberal Party and rural National coalition
holds 90 seats in the current House of Representatives. The Labor
Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party 1.
	   Even if Howard retains control of the more powerful lower house,
the balance of power in the upper house still could rest with minor
parties or independents, meaning the government will need
cooperation to get its bills passed.

Dinosaurs ruled every continent, looked more bizarre than popular
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SNOWBIRD, Utah (AP) _ Dinosaurs ruled the Earth from Alaska to
Antarctica and may have looked even more bizarre than their
Hollywood images, according to new studies.
	   Nearly all of the more than 600 dinosaur species identified in
the past century have been found in the rocky deserts of western
North America and northeast Asia, especially Mongolia.
	   But studies announced late Thursday extend the footprints of
several dinosaurs around the planet, including discoveries in
Africa, South America and even in gravel slopes peeking above the
glaciers of Antarctica just 300 miles (480 kilometers) from the
South Pole. At least 17 significant dinosaur discoveries were made
on seven continents during the past year.
	   None of the finds were of a creature so radical as to spawn
another sequel to ``Jurassic Park,'' said scientists at the annual
meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.
	   Together, the discoveries point to a period 65 million to 230
million years ago when the continents were breaking apart and
slowly shifting towards their current positions. The upheaval
literally scattered and split dinosaur populations.
	   As continents moved and climates and habitats changed, dinosaurs
migrated and new groups replaced old ones.
	   But scientists caution that much of the story is based on a few
fossils, some as large as an 18-wheeler and others limited to a few
teeth.
	   ``We're getting a much better global view of the dinosaurs,''
said Catherine Forster, a paleoanatomy expert at the State
University of New York _ Stony Brook. ``But are they spreading
everywhere at once, or are they ending on one continent and
beginning on another?
	   ``The answer is in the details of how they are related to each
other,'' she said. ``When we figure that out, we'll figure out the
migrations.''
	   Among the finds: A meat-eater, Carcharodontosaurus, in
Argentina. Previously, the 100-million-year old remains of this
beast were found only in North Africa and its remains were
destroyed in World War II.
	   A few teeth of a duck-billed hadrosaur were found on Vega Island
on the Antarctic Peninsula, extending its range south for thousands
of miles (kilometers).
	   Researchers are reconsidering dinosaurs' appearances as well.
	   Philip Currie of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta, Canada
revealed more details of a pair of feathered, turkey-sized
meat-eaters discovered in China. Currie said the theropods are
transition creatures in the link between dinosaurs and birds, with
serrated teeth, short arms and long legs and tails and sporting
thick plumage for insulation.
	   Others seek to redraw dinosaurs' images into even more striking
appearances.
	   Lawrence Witmer of Ohio University said that examinations of
hundreds of dinosaur fossils failed to show the structural features
necessary to make lips, cheeks and other facial features work.
	   Witmer said he would strip the muscular cheeks off of
triceratops and its cousins, and replace them with a large horny
beak similar to turtles _ an arrangement more conducive to munching
on trees and large plants.
	   He also would peel the lips off the Tyrannosaurus rex, exposing
all of its dagger-sized teeth along its four-foot jaws.
	   ``People want dinosaurs to sneer and snarl, but I can find no
justifiable scientific reason to put lips on a dinosaur,'' Witmer
said. ``Lips or no lips, T-Rex was ferocious. Without lips, he
looks even more terrifying.''

	   SNOWBIRD, Utah (AP) _ Dinosaurs ruled the Earth from Alaska to
Antarctica and may have looked even more bizarre than their
Hollywood images, according to new studies.
	   Nearly all of the more than 600 dinosaur species identified in
the past century have been found in the rocky deserts of western
North America and northeast Asia, especially Mongolia.
	   But studies announced late Thursday extend the footprints of
several dinosaurs around the planet, including discoveries in
Africa, South America and even in gravel slopes peeking above the
glaciers of Antarctica just 300 miles (480 kilometers) from the
South Pole. At least 17 significant dinosaur discoveries were made
on seven continents during the past year.
	   None of the finds were of a creature so radical as to spawn
another sequel to ``Jurassic Park,'' said scientists at the annual
meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology.
	   Together, the discoveries point to a period 65 million to 230
million years ago when the continents were breaking apart and
slowly shifting towards their current positions. The upheaval
literally scattered and split dinosaur populations.
	   As continents moved and climates and habitats changed, dinosaurs
migrated and new groups replaced old ones.
	   But scientists caution that much of the story is based on a few
fossils, some as large as an 18-wheeler and others limited to a few
teeth.
	   ``We're getting a much better global view of the dinosaurs,''
said Catherine Forster, a paleoanatomy expert at the State
University of New York _ Stony Brook. ``But are they spreading
everywhere at once, or are they ending on one continent and
beginning on another?
	   ``The answer is in the details of how they are related to each
other,'' she said. ``When we figure that out, we'll figure out the
migrations.''
	   Among the finds: A meat-eater, Carcharodontosaurus, in
Argentina. Previously, the 100-million-year old remains of this
beast were found only in North Africa and its remains were
destroyed in World War II.
	   A few teeth of a duck-billed hadrosaur were found on Vega Island
on the Antarctic Peninsula, extending its range south for thousands
of miles (kilometers).
	   Researchers are reconsidering dinosaurs' appearances as well.
	   Philip Currie of the Royal Tyrrell Museum in Alberta, Canada
revealed more details of a pair of feathered, turkey-sized
meat-eaters discovered in China. Currie said the theropods are
transition creatures in the link between dinosaurs and birds, with
serrated teeth, short arms and long legs and tails and sporting
thick plumage for insulation.
	   Others seek to redraw dinosaurs' images into even more striking
appearances.
	   Lawrence Witmer of Ohio University said that examinations of
hundreds of dinosaur fossils failed to show the structural features
necessary to make lips, cheeks and other facial features work.
	   Witmer said he would strip the muscular cheeks off of
triceratops and its cousins, and replace them with a large horny
beak similar to turtles _ an arrangement more conducive to munching
on trees and large plants.
	   He also would peel the lips off the Tyrannosaurus rex, exposing
all of its dagger-sized teeth along its four-foot jaws.
	   ``People want dinosaurs to sneer and snarl, but I can find no
justifiable scientific reason to put lips on a dinosaur,'' Witmer
said. ``Lips or no lips, T-Rex was ferocious. Without lips, he
looks even more terrifying.''

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ On the eve of a close election,
Prime Minister John Howard on Friday announced a 100 million
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 58 million) relief fund to help those
worst hit by a natural gas shortage caused by a refinery explosion.
	   Howard said the fund would be used for immediate social security
payments to workers laid off as a result of the gas shutdown, to
organizations helping the elderly and sick, and to offset the cost
to business of converting to non-gas energy in Victoria state.
	   A fire at Esso's Longford gas refinery Sept. 25 killed two men
and injured eight.
	   The plant supplied more than 80 percent of the natural gas for
Australia's second-most populous state, and some 1.4 million
households and 100,000 businesses may be without it for at least
two weeks.
	   Industry will get priority over households once Victoria's gas
supply resumes flowing to enable people to get back to work, state
Premier Jeff Kennett said Thursday.
	   ``If it's going to take a few days to get it back on totally
when it starts flowing, is it better to have people employed or is
it better for domestic users to have access to the gas?'' he said.
	   ``I think the reality is that it is better to give people the
opportunity to be re-employed,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold showers
and looking for electric griddles and frying pans to cook their
food. Many industries have had to suspend operations; funeral homes
have turned to bottled gas in order to keep crematoriums operating.
	   Those people lucky enough to have electric hot water heaters are
finding out just how many friends they have, as people arrive with
towels and soap to impose on them.
	   The state has opened sports stadiums and other public facilities
so people can shower there -- a relief as sweaty Victorians swelter
in a heat wave that hit 89 degrees (32 Celsius) Thursday.
	   Locked in a neck-and-neck electoral race with the Labor
opposition for Saturday's national election, the conservative prime
minister announced funding for the crisis Friday.
	   ``I had discussions this morning with the Victorian premier and
I'll be announcing the details of a 100 million-dollar Victorian
relief fund which will be specifically designed to help in three
areas,'' Howard said.
	   ``There will also be assistance, particularly in relation to
conversion costs, to small business from gas to other forms of
fuel.
	   ``As I indicated at the beginning of the crisis, I was
particularly concerned at the impact on the elderly frail and sick
people, and all the organizations and groups whose resources are in
greater demand in relation to helping those people because of the
crisis, will have an entitlement to draw on that fund.''
	   State ambulance service spokesman John Fasham said some children
have been scalded seriously when parents accidentally poured
boiling water over them in the bath.
	   Esso has so far been unable to determine the cause of the blaze
and explosions, which took two days to extinguish.
	   At least 100,000 workers in Victoria have been laid off as the
Ford and Toyota auto factories, glass and brick-making plants,
bakeries, dairies and many other industries shut down.
	   On Tuesday, a restaurant exploded as the manager was trying to
convert it to bottled gas, injuring two people, one seriously.
	   The state on Wednesday raised the fine for turning on gas
without authorization from 500 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290)
to 10,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 5,800).
	   Some people have tried to prevent gas workers from cutting off
their service by chaining vicious dogs to their gas meters, but
they have been thwarted by being shut off from the street main
pipes.
	   Victoria state is south of New South Wales, and Melbourne is
about 450 miles (720 km) southwest of Sydney.

Return of refugees will be key test for Bosnian Serb nationalist
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The key test for the new hard-line
president of the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia will be his
willingness to allow Muslim and Croat refugees to return to their
prewar homes, Bosnia's foreign minister said Thursday.
	   The return of thousands of refugees who fled Bosnia during the 3
1/2-year war is a key provision of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement
_ and will be a crucial indicator of newly elected president Nikola
Poplasen's support for the peace process, said Jadran Prlic.
	   ``This is the most challenging issue,'' he told a news
conference before addressing the U.N. General Assembly.
	   Prlic, a Croat, was joined at the news conference by his deputy
minister, Dragan Bozanic, a Serb, and Bosnia's U.N. Ambassador
Muhamed Sacirbey, a Muslim. The topic was Bosnia's elections last
month, where Poplasen scored a surprising victory over the U.S.
favorite, the moderate Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic.
	   Prlic said he believes Poplasen will act in accordance with the
Dayton agreement, which carved up Bosnia into a Serb entity and a
Croat-Muslim federation.
	   The country is governed by a three-person presidency
representing the three ethnic groups. Each half has a separate
government, and Poplasen was elected last month to lead the Serb
entity.
	   Asked whether he ``believed'' or ``hoped'' Poplasen would comply
with the accord, the foreign minister laughed and replied: ``I hope
_ and I hope that very soon I will start to believe.''
	   He said Poplasen's ``most important'' test will be his behavior
toward the return of refugees. But he said the newly elected
president must also appoint a prime minister which will be another
important indicator.
	   In his speech to the General Assembly, Prlic said the return of
refugees and displaced persons to their homes, the protection of
human rights, the proper functioning of state institutions and an
independent judicial system were ``the major problems'' facing
Bosnia.
	   Bozanic, the Serb, called the ballot ``a really good election''
and said he believes Poplasen is going to accept the Dayton
accords.
	   He said the rights of minorities must be protected in both the
Serb and Bosnian-Croat parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   Affirming that the government has to work with those who have
been democratically elected, Sacirbey said: ``We are all hopeful
that the elections will bring about a new willingness to work
together on the Dayton agreement.''
	   He opposed any cutoff of aid to the Bosnian Serb entity, but
urged donors to ensure that the Bosnian Serbs kept their promises
on the return of refugees and other critical issues.
	   While the three were generally hopeful about the election
outcome, they conceded that it wasn't easy to come up with an
agreed statement to present to the General Assembly.
	   Sacirbey said that although Bosnia's Muslims, Croats and Serbs
couldn't fully agree on the text, there was a general agreement
``so it shows how things do function, and do move ahead.''
	   The longest debate was over what to say about Kosovo, where
Serbian security forces are trying to crush ethnic Albanian
separatists. The international community has been seeking a
diplomatic solution but NATO is finalizing preparations for
military strikes.
	   ``The international community can give the way how to go in,''
said Bozanic, ``but what is the exit of that possible action?''
	   Sacirbey said he personally believes ``NATO will lose
credibility if it doesn't act very soon.''
	   Neither of these views were expressed by Prlic in his speech.
	   Noting that the events in Kosovo are having ``a contaminating
effect in Bosnia and Herzegovina, at least psychologically,'' he
said ``the human, national and democratic rights of all the parties
must be taken into consideration as well as the territorial
integrity of all states in the region.''
	   ``No matter how we get there, all lasting solutions end with a
political settlement and one with which all the parties need to
abide by if not always enthusiastically support,'' Prlic said.

Doohan fastest in early practice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHILLIP ISLAND, Australia (AP) _ World motorcycle champion Mick
Doohan stamped his authority on the Australian Grand Prix with a
blistering opening practice time Friday for Sunday's race.
	   Doohan flung his 500 c.c. Honda around the sweeping circuit in 1
minute, 33.725 seconds _ four-tenths of a second under the lap
record he set last year.
	   By contrast, his closest rival in the world championship race,
Italian Max Biaggi, struggled throughout the early session. Biaggi
could manage no better than 12th-fastest in a time of 1:36.384.
	   Doohan leads the title by 21 points from Biaggi with only the
Australian and Argentinian races remaining following the
cancellation of the Brazilian Grand Prix this past week.
	   The Australian can wrap up a fifth consecutive world
championship on Sunday if he finishes four points ahead of Biaggi.

Two Australians receive drug suspensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An Australian weightlifter and a
wrestler have both tested positive to using illegal drugs and have
been banned for selection to Australian Olympic teams for two
years.
	   The National Sports Dispute Center said Friday that weightlifter
Gavin Kulper had breached the anti-doping policy of the Australain
Olympic Committee by admitting using stanozolol, an anabolic agent.
	   Phillip Fox, a wrestler, has also been suspended for two years
after returning a sample containing prolintane, a stimulant.
	   The pair have also been banned from receiving Australian Olympic
Committee funding and holding any position on the AOC.
	   Kulper's suspension runs from Sept. 13, 1997, the date he
provided the urine sample containing stanozolol.
	   Fox's ban is from June 7, 1997, the date he returned a positive
urine sample at the national wrestling championships.
	   Kulpers's ban comes only weeks after another weightlifter,
Duncan Van Rooyen, a reserve for the Commonwealth Games team,
revealed that he had tested positive to taking a banned substance,
Clenbuterol.

Chelsea struggles in 0-0 draw, but advances on 1-0 aggregate

<TEXT>
	   HELSINGBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Chelsea, returning to the country
where the London side captured the Cup Winners' Cup final in May,
was held to a 0-0 draw by Helsingborg in the second leg Wednesday
and it was enough to gain the second round.
	   Frank Leboeuf scored the only goal at Stamford Bridge two weeks
ago when Helsingborg, currently fifth in the Swedish first division
standings, packed their defense in search of a draw.
	   But on its own Olympia Stadium, the Swedes played an attacking
game from the start and dominated throughout. It took Chelsea 25
minutes to get its first shot on goal, but goalie Sven Andersson
had no problems with Roberto Di Matteo's drive.
	   Helsingborg, which eliminated Aston Villa in the UEFA Cup two
years ago, had the best chance of the match when Zoran Jovanovski's
header hit goalie Ed De Goey's post. That opportunity came after 30
minutes and the sixth corner by Helsingborg.
	   Midfielder Magnus Powell came close twice, first with a header
that narrowly missed the target and then with a powerful shot that
went just wide of De Goey.

Give us a clear majority or throw us out, Howard urges voters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comment by Howard in 1st-2nd grafs
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ With the outcome of this weekend's
national election still too close to call, Prime Minister John
Howard on Friday urged voters to hand him a solid majority in
Parliament _ or throw him out of office.
	   ``Give us a clear majority or get rid of us, I ask them to do
that,'' Howard said in a radio interview Friday.
	   On the eve of the Saturday vote, Howard's coalition and the main
opposition Labor Party are neck and neck in opinion polls, with
government members warning that Labor may end up with a slim lead.
	   Labor leader Kim Beazley has engineered a strong comeback since
the party's humiliating defeat in 1996, when Howard amassed a 93-49
majority in the lower house of Australia's bicameral Parliament,
where the new government will be chosen.
	   Labor must beat Howard by a margin of 4 percentage points to win
the 27 lower house seats it would need to reclaim the Cabinet. The
coalition is currently ahead in the polls, but only by the margin
of error.
	   If Labor succeeds, Howard's would become the first one-term
government since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
	   Labor's campaign has been helped by the unpopularity of Howard's
plan to introduce a 10 percent tax increase on all goods and
services. Howard says tax reform is crucial to Australia's economic
future and has staked the government's reelection hopes on the
package.
	   Despite being sweetened with promises of big income tax cuts,
polls show the new tax is unpopular with voters.
	   On Friday, Howard warned voters that to give their support to
candidates from small parties or independents as a protest against
the new tax may lead to a Labor government.
	   Beazley said Howard was likely to win because his government had
misled people about the tax.
	   ``I think the prime minister has skated in with a very big tax
change without any real scrutiny by the Australian people,'' he
told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
	   Editorial writers across Australia were almost unanimous Friday
in supporting Howard's tax reform plan and in saying Labor was not
ready to govern again after one term in opposition.
	   ``On balance, the coalition, which is putting forward a tax
package that has the potential to strengthen the economy, deserves
another term,'' Melbourne's The Age newspaper wrote.
	   Aboriginal health and welfare issues have been almost absent
from the campaign. Conservatives are wary of them because their own
views are not too far from far-right politician Pauline Hanson.
	   Hanson's One Nation party, with its anti-Asian, anti-Aboriginal
views, became a national political force in June when it won 11 of
the 89 seats in Queensland's state Parliament.
	   Support for One Nation, however, has sunk in recent months, and
Hanson may lose her own parliamentary seat. Still, it could
influence which party wins in closely contested districts.
	   Even if Howard retains control of the more powerful lower house,
the balance of power in the upper house still could rest with minor
parties or independents, meaning the government will need
cooperation to get its bills passed.

Japanese stocks decline slightly, dollar drops in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday stock, late morning bond and
currency prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell slightly early Friday on worry
about sales by blue chip exporters in the U.S. market after share
prices on Wall Street posted a second day of big losses. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues
declined 36.80 points, or 0.28 percent, to 13,197.12 as of midday
after having dipped below 13,000 and briefly bouncing into positive
territory.
	   On Thursday, the index had lost 209.27 points, or 1.56 percent,
to close at a new 12-year low.
	   Shares of brand name electronics exporters such as Sony Corp.
and TDK Corp. pulled down the broader market as investors
registered their concern over prospects for continued strong sales
in the United States, traders said.
	   Pessimism about corporate earnings and global economic growth
pushed down stock prices in New York, where the Dow Jones
industrial average fell 210.09, or 2.7 percent, on Thursday to
close at 7,632.53. Wall Street had suffered a similar setback the
previous day.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was down 7.43 points, or
0.73 percent, to 1,008.29. The TOPIX fell 27.85 points, or 2.61
percent, the previous day.
	   Losses were stemmed, however, by apparent buying from public
funds targeting the stock futures market, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 135.13 yen in late morning trading, down 1.15 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 135.63
yen overnight.
	   Many currency dealers were reluctant to trade before a meeting
of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven
industrialized countries in Washington over the weekend, traders
said.
	   Market players were waiting to see if any warning against the
yen's excessive weakness will be issued at the meeting, they said.
They are also interested any steps the G-7 members agree to do for
ending a global credit crunch and deflationary spiral, traders
said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.715 percent from Thursday's finish of 0.720 percent,
driving its price up to 109.84 yen from 109.79 yen.

Beazley part of Labor's political dynasty; has his time to rule
</HEADLINE>
come? &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Kim Beazley was born into the Labor
Party but was thrust into its leadership.
	   In the wake of the disastrous 1996 election, which routed Labor
under despised Prime Minister Paul Keating, the party turned to
Beazley to help it rebuild and reclaim support from traditional
supporters who threw their support behind John Howard's bid for
government.
	   Despite being Keating's deputy in the year before the last
election, Beazley was considered a uniting force and a man who
could calm the often bitter factional rivalries within the Labor
Party.
	   He was elected unopposed as Labor leader when Keating stood down
and immediately set about the task of rebuilding a party shattered
by the size of its electoral defeat.
	   Kim Christian Beazley, 49, has an impeccable Labor pedigree and
has been through a comprehensive political apprenticeship.
	   His father, Kim Beazley Sr., was a longstanding member of
Parliament from Western Australia who achieved his highest position
as a Cabinet minister in Gough Whitlam's 1972-75 Labor government.
	   The young Kim had early experience of the rigors of politics,
especially for a politician from Western Australia.
	   He made his first long-haul plane trip to Canberra with his
father when he was only a year old and has repeated the arduous
journey ever since.
	   He cut his teeth in student politics and through a range of
positions within the Western Australian state Labor Party.
	   After receiving a masters degree at the University of Western
Australia, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oxford,
as had Bob Hawke, who became a Labor prime minister in the 1980s.
	   Beazley entered Parliament in 1980 after a brief career as a
university lecturer.
	   He was promoted to the ministry after Labor's 1983 election
victory, taking on the relatively minor portfolios of special
minister of State, Aviation, and minister assisting the minister
for Defense.
	   He was promoted to Cabinet the following year as Defense
minister -- a job he relished and which partly fulfilled his
youthful dream of joining the Navy. He acquired the nickname,
``Bomber Beazley.''
	   Beazley became government leader in the House of Representatives
in 1988, a job he held until Labor lost in 1996.
	   His ability to appeal to all sides of the Labor factional divide
was evident at the launch of his biography last July when Whitlam
and bitter rivals Hawke and Keating all turned up to be
photographed with Beazley.
	   After stints in Transport and Communications and Employment and
Education, Beazley moved into the key economic ministry of Finance
and was elevated to the deputy leadership under Keating in June
1995.
	   In 1989, Beazley and his first wife Mary divorced.
	   The following year he married television producer Susie Annus.
	   After a lifetime of traveling to and from Perth, Beazley is
acutely aware of the price his family and three daughters will pay
if he wins the election.
	   Unlike Howard, Beazley has promised to move his family into The
Lodge in Canberra to try and ensure he has some time for family
life.

Will Pauline Hanson's departure be as meteoric as her arrival?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The One Nation party's right-wing
populist leader Pauline Hanson boasts she is no politician, but she
has dominated Australian politics since her inaugural speech in
Parliament in 1996.
	   Three years ago, she was a fish-and-chips shop owner educated at
Brisbane's working-class Cooparoo High School who had cut her
political teeth with an inconspicuous two-year stint as an Ipswich
city councillor.
	   In the last year, the 44-year-old divorced mother-of-two emerged
as a plausible challenge to the Australian Democrats' hold on the
balance of power in the Senate and a threat to the rural
conservative National Party's survival.
	   But during this campaign, her party's poll ratings have stayed
stuck at about 7 percent in most parts of the nation, or even
declined, and Hanson is in a too-close-to-call race to keep her own
Parliamentary seat of Blair.
	   During her meteoric rise, she has been written off as a spent
political force and held up by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer as
a menacing prospect as a prime minister.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad described her as ``a
little bit moronic'' and Education Minister Amanda Vanstone called
her a boring woman who hates the world and has an ego bigger than
Texas.
	   But her extraordinary capacity to attract hate and derision has
enhanced her role as a non-politician in charge of a political
party.
	   A pivotal point in her unprecedented rise from obscurity had
been expected to be her political demise.
	   When race became an issue in the 1996 federal election, Prime
Minister John Howard's Liberal Party jettisoned Hanson, the party's
endorsed candidate in the apparently unwinnable Queensland seat of
Oxley.
	   Three weeks after she was dumped, Hanson was elected as an
independent in the biggest upset of the 1996 poll.
	   Hanson branded herself on the public consciousness with her
strident maiden speech to Parliament on Sept. 10, 1996.
	   She said Australia was in danger of being swamped by Asians,
called for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission
(ATSIC) and all Aboriginal welfare programs to be scrapped and for
Asian immigration to be halted.
	   Howard in October 1996 declared her a comet that would burn out
within three months -- but she didn't.
	   Last year, when a videotape which Hanson said was made for
broadcast to her fellow Australians in the event of her murder
became public, it was widely dismissed as a bizarre political stunt
of a spent political force.
	   She broke down during a television interview, saying she and her
two daughters had moved to a secret address following death
threats.
	   However, One Nation was resurrected as a serious political
player last June when the party attracted a quarter of the
Queensland election votes and bagged 11 seats of 89 seats in the
state Parliament.

Braves edge Cubs; Astros stop Padres
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ It was a magical regular season for the Chicago
Cubs. The postseason is the same, old thing.
	   Two outs from evening their first-round playoffs series, the
Cubs lost a ninth-inning lead on Javy Lopez's homer, squandered a
great scoring chance in the 10th, then had a defensive mixup in the
bottom half and lost to the Atlanta Braves 2-1 on Chipper Jones'
single Thursday night.
	   The Braves have a 2-0 lead in the best-of-5 series, which moves
to Wrigley Field for Game 3 on Saturday night.
	   The Cubs, seeking their first World Series title since 1908,
turned sloppy after Kevin Tapani's brilliant performance. He took a
four-hit shutout into the ninth before giving up Lopez's homer into
the left-field stands.
	   In the top of the 10th, Glenallen Hill led off with walk, was
bunted to second by Gary Gaetti and stole third after an
intentional walk to Mickey Morandini.
	   But former Atlanta shortstop Jeff Blauser struck out against
rookie Odalis Perez and Lopez threw out Morandani, who was trying
to steal second on the 3-2 pitch.
	   In the bottom of the inning, the Braves struck quickly against
loser Terry Mulholland, who took over for Tapani. Walt Weiss walked
with one out and Tony Graffanino bunted down the first-base line to
four-time Gold Glove Mark Grace.
	   Grace was late making the throw to Mulholland covering the bag,
and the pitcher missed the bag for an error. Jones' followed with a
line drive just inside the left-field line while Weiss trotted home
with the winning run.
	   Chicago scored only two runs in two games at Turner Field, but
nearly left Atlanta with the series tied because of Tapani's
unlikely performance. He gave up five hits and struck out six in
nine innings.
	   Perez got the win in the first postseason appearance of his
career.
 &UR; Astros 5, Padres 4
	   In Houston, Bill Spiers' third hit of the game, an RBI single
with one out in the ninth, lifed Houston to a wild 5-4 win over the
San Diego Padres on Thursday and tied their first-round series 1-1.
	   The Astros had taken a 4-2 lead into the ninth, but Billy Wagner
allowed a two-out, two-run homer to pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz.
	   Then in the bottom half, Dan Miceli allowed Ricky Gutierrez's
infield single to shortstop leading off. Brad Ausmus sacrificed,
Trevor Hofffman relieved, and Gutierrez stole third base
uncontested. Spiers then lifted a single to right on a 1-2 count.
	   Wagner, who got the win, was shaky down the stretch, blowing
consecutive save chances against the Mets last month by allowing
homers to Brian McRae and Mike Piazza.
	   It was Houston's 49th come-from-behind win this year, and the
28th in its last at-bat. It was also the seventh one-run game the
teams have played this year, including San Diego's 2-1 victory in
the series opener Tuesday.
	   Game 3 is Saturday night in San Diego.
	   The Padres almost maintained the momentum from Tuesday, when
Kevin Brown struck out 16, the second-most ever in the postseason,
to beat Randy Johnson.
	   Wagner, who converted 30 of 35 save opportunities in the regular
season, allowed Ken Caminiti's single with one out in the ninth.
Leyritz pinch-hit for Wally Joyner with two out, and hit another
dramatic postseason homer.

Japan's unemployment back to record high 4.3 percent in August

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's jobless rate rose back to a record high of
4.3 percent in August, underscoring the depth of this country's
recession and the increasing severity of employment conditions,
officials said Friday.
	   The number of jobless people reached 2.97 million and the
workforce shrank by 440,000 people to 65.46 million, the statistics
bureau of the Management and Coordination Agency said.
	   It was the seventh-straight month of contraction for the number
of employed compared with year-earlier levels, the agency said.
	   Shortly after the figures were released, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi's administration held its first meeting of a special labor
committee to seek ways to improve the nation's labor contraction
and pull the nation out of its recession.
	   But the head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi
Sakaiya, said the rebound of the jobless rate to tie the record
marked in June shows that the nation's employment conditions are
extremely severe and improvement soon is unlikely.
	   Sakaiya said the rising unemployment rate is poses a serious
problem for consumption _ which officials are hoping to boost in
order to spur the overall economy out of its recession _ and could
exacerbate consumer concerns about job security.
	   The jobless rate first touched 4.3 percent in June, then
improved to 4.1 percent in July, temporarily bucking a trend that
has seen the rate rise steadily from 3.4 percent a year ago.
	   ``A number of factors suggest that the economy will remain
severe through this year,'' he said.
	   Sakaiya was also to submit a downward revision of the EPA
forecast for Japanese gross domestic product growth this fiscal
year to a Cabinet meeting next Tuesday.
	   The GDP forecast will be for negative growth, instead of the
previous forecast of 1.9 percent growth, ``because economic
conditions have drastically changed,'' Sakaiya said.
	   In a separate announcement Friday, the Labor Ministry said that
the August ratio of job offers to job seekers, an indicator of
demand for labor, was 0.50, unchanged from July.
	   This means only 50 jobs were being offered for every 100 workers
seeking employment in August.
	   The figure is at its lowest level since the agency first began
compiling such data in 1963.

As concern builds over former deputy's injuries, police begin probe

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Amid mounting concern over the the
treatment of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's former
protege, police Friday began a probe into allegations the fired
deputy premier was beaten after his recent arrest.
	   A team led by a police officer from Malaysia's southern state of
Malacca, who was not previously involved in the case, will question
other officers who were assigned to interrogate Anwar Ibrahim, the
51-year-old dissident and former No. 2 leader.
	   Anwar, with a black welt around his left eye, displayed bruises
in court at an arraignment Tuesday and Wednesday, saying he was
beaten by police on Sept. 20, the night of his arrest at his Kuala
Lumpur home.
	   He has pleaded innocent to five charges of sodomy and five
others alleging corruption. Anwar is being held under the Southeast
Asian country's Internal Security Act, which allows for indefinite
imprisonment without trial.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar on Sept. 2 from his posts as deputy prime
minister and finance minister, saying he was morally unfit for
office. The two had differed over economic policy as the country
veered into recession and Anwar has said the 72-year-old Mahathir
feared him as an alternative leader.
	   Mahathir, 72, initially suggested that Anwar's facial, neck and
arm wounds were self-inflicted in an act to gain public sympathy.
	   The Malaysian leader ordered the probe, however, after recent
pictures showing Anwar with numerous welts and bruises raised
questions at home and abroad about his treatment while in custody.
	   But the New Straits Times daily reported it was not known
whether or not any timetable for the investigation.
	   On Thursday, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said in
a message to Mahathir that Anwar's case should be handled in
accordance with the rule of law.
	   Annan also said he was heartened by Mahathir's pledge to
investigate allegations of physical abuse against Anwar.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn, meanwhile, said he was
troubled by the recent photographs of Anwar, adding that the former
deputy leader was to have played a key role at upcoming
international economic meetings.
	   Speaking in a personal capacity, Wolfensohn called Anwar ``a
friend who had a real position in our group. I hope the world keeps
an eye on him and he gets a chance to state his case.''
	   Anwar conducted nationwide rallies calling for Mahathir's
resignation and thousands of Malaysians have continued the protests
in Kuala Lumpur since his arrest.
	   More street rallies and protests were anticipated after Friday
prayers at mosques in the capital of Muslim-dominated Malaysia.
	   Meanwhile Malaysia's Bar Council, apparently angered by police
questioning of a defense attorney who accompanied Anwar's wife to a
police station Thursday, called for a meeting of lawyers.
	   The Oct. 10 meeting will discuss the detentions under the ISA,
an British colonial law that it described as an ``an obnoxious
piece of legislation undermining fundamental human rights, basic
democratic principles and the rule of law.''
	   The council demanded that ``members of the bar who are acting in
the defense of their clients be allowed to carry out their duties
freely without any harassment, hindrance or restrain by the
authorities.''
	   Anwar's wife was summoned to police headquarters Thursday for
the third time to answer questions about a television interview
expressing fears for her husband's health. Police also interrogated
her lawyer, and traveled to Singapore to question the CNBC Asia
journalists who interviewed her.
