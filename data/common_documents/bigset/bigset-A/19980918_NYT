   WASHINGTON _ Abandoning any pretense of bipartisanship, the
House Judiciary Committee spent the day Thursday wrangling over
whether to make public a videotape of President Clinton's grand
jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case and discussing how to
edit reams of pages delivered by the Whitewater independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of 11 votes, Democrats on the panel pushed
unsuccessfully for a delay in releasing both the videotape and the
2,000-page appendix of supporting material attached to the report
by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. They argued that they
should take the time to review all the materials before releasing
any portion, noting that they still have until Sept. 28 to meet the
deadline set by the House to make this decision. In some cases,
they argued that deletions should be made so that graphic material
would never be released. The Democrats expressed grave concern at
the gathering about making the information public piecemeal and
without deletions, calling the strategy politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the panel is expected to approve release of the
videotape of the president's grand jury session without any
editing. The tape could be made public as early as Saturday. A
videotape of the president's deposition in the Paula Jones case in
January, in which his testimony about Ms. Lewinsky has become the
foundation for Starr's central charges of perjury, may also be
released.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the Jones case granted an unusual request made this
week by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., to release that videotape.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, issued a statement
Thursday in which he said he had demanded that Starr destroy the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony. Its continued
existence, he said, ``was to insure its public release and
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In a seething response Thursday night, Starr said the
independent counsel's office considered the videotaped testimony to
be ``evidence of a crime.'' The prosecutor is contending that
Clinton lied to the grand jury as well as in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape does not cast Clinton in a flattering light,
depicting him as occasionally impatient, and quibbling in his
discussion of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Democrats said an
edited transcript of the testimony would have sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the material and the proceedings said
the videotape showed Clinton repeatedly relying on legalisms and a
narrow definition of sexual relations. He also refused to answer a
series of more prying questions about the sexual nature of the
affair, the official said. Surprisingly, many of the toughest
questions were asked by grand jurors and not prosecutors, the
person added.
</P>
<P>
   While much attention has focused on disputes over the
president's videotaped testimony, the panel spent much of the day
arguing about the supporting documents that Starr sent to Congress
to bolster his case that the president's actions may be cause for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel agreed on more than 100 separate edits of the report's
2,000- page appendix, which includes background information, maps
of the West Wing, a table of Ms. Lewinsky's White House visits and
a table of the contacts between the two of them. It also contains
lengthy footnotes and legal references.
</P>
<P>
   The protracted debates mainly involved squabbles over eight
passages containing the most sexually explosive material, officials
familiar with the proceedings said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting since Starr delivered his report to
Congress on Sept. 9, the panel's Republicans and Democrats bickered
about the merits of releasing the videotape and zeroed in on the
most sensitive sexual material. They debated, among other things,
the relevance of mentioning sexual props. Both sides said they took
decency into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee aides have spent days poring over documents
in boxes delivered by Starr but Thursday's debate centered only on
the contents of one box, indicating that the process will be long
and slow. They have yet to take up the issue of whether to release
the transcripts of testimony given by Ms. Lewinsky and other
central figures, including Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, his
friend Vernon Jordan Jr. and Secret Service officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate that boomeranged between civility and partisanship,
members accused each other of political motives and questioned each
other's sincerity in pursuing the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let the public join in the decision making
process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a committee member,
who argued that the committee is searching for a balance between
privacy and decency concerns and the public's right to know. ``The
very fact today is balance. It must be presented in a balanced
fashion so the American people can make their own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's argument was echoed throughout the day by other
Republicans on the panel, who argued that the public should make
its own determination based on the same evidence handed to
Congress. And they accused Democrats of putting Clinton's concerns
ahead of the country's. The president's testimony, they said, is
vital to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted, as they have all week, that hasty disclosure
of the materials is a strategy that will humiliate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans are trying to do is get the bad stuff out
about the president, as much as they can, as fast as they can,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a panel member. Frank added,
``They're frustrated that the president's official standing is as
high as it is, and they're trying to tear it down.''
</P>
<P>
   But some members said the party-line friction in the panel was
predictable. Last week, 11 of the Democrats on the panel voted
against a House-passed resolution to release Starr's report and
many of its accompanying documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe some Democrats would like to thwart the procedures
established under the resolution,'' said Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla., a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the partisan battle threatened to intensify, the
panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, filed
a letter of protest Thursday with Hyde, over the chairman's request
for the Jones tape without consulting Democrats. ``I have serious
concerns regarding the propriety of your seeking the release of a
videotaped deposition in a private civil case that has now been
dismissed,'' Conyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's meeting also came at a time of ill will between the
parties over an online magazine's disclosure that Hyde had
conducted an extramarital affair 30 years ago. Calling this
disclosure and a few others a smear campaign of intimidation,
Republican leaders blamed the president's allies and asked that the
FBI to look into it. The White House has denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans and Democrats continued to face divisions
within their own ranks about release of the material.
</P>
<P>
   An opening salvo in the Judiciary Committee meeting came when
Democrats asked that the gathering be held in public and not under
the cloak of secrecy. The motion was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have decided that the appropriate way to fight for
openness is in total secrecy,'' Frank said during one of the
committee's sporadic breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats complained that they had not had enough time to
sift through the material and the proposed redactions.
</P>
<P>
   But in an attempt to deflect charges of partisanship, Hyde
allowed members to speak on and on at the debate. After the
meeting, the chairman said: ``There's been lot's of debate. It's
been productive debate, not frivolous debate.'' He added, ``It gets
passionate at times, interesting at times.''

   3 EX-ARCHER EXECUTIVES CONVICTED OF FIXING PRICES
</P>
<P>
   Three former executives of Archer Daniels Midland _ including
the son of its powerful chairman, Dwayne Andreas _ were found
guilty of engaging in an international conspiracy to fix the prices
of a widely used additive for animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict by a federal jury in Chicago marked an important
victory for prosecutors and capped a six-year effort by the
government to crack an illegal cartel and to bring participants in
the conspiracy to trial. The investigation and trial have been
declared hallmarks by the government, which said it upended a
conspiracy that controlled the prices of $1 billion in commerce.
</P>
<P>
   $3.4 BILLION APPROVED FOR IMF
</P>
<P>
   The House approved only $3.4 billion of the $18 billion that
President Clinton is seeking for the International Monetary Fund.
The action left the agency in limbo as its reserves dwindle and
economic crises mount around the world. The Senate has approved the
full amount, and there is still a chance that when both houses meet
over the next few weeks to iron out their differences they will
agree to provide the full request.
</P>
<P>
   BOND YIELDS CONTINUE THEIR SLIDE
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bond prices rallied as investors sold stocks and sought
the safety of government securities. The yield on the 30-year bond
dropped to 5.18 percent, from 5.22 percent on Wednesday, its lowest
level in 30 years. In the last three months the 30-year bond's
yield has fallen more than half a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   BAYER TO ACQUIRE UNIT OF CHIRON
</P>
<P>
   Bayer, the German drug and chemical giant, will buy the American
diagnostics business of Chiron for $1.1 billion and 50 percent of
the farm seed subsidiary of Crompton &AMP; Knowles. Bayer also said it
would raise money for reorganization by selling to the public up to
75 percent of its Agfa-Gevaert unit.
</P>
<P>
   AMENDMENT SLOWS SPENDING BILL
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to make it easier for farmers to hire foreigners,
most from Mexico, at harvest time is clouding prospects for
congressional approval of a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice
and State Departments.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE PANEL PASSES TAX CUT BILL
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee passed an $80 billion
Republican tax cut, setting up a confrontation with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   BANKS MORE EXPOSED TO LOAN RISK
</P>
<P>
   Banks are exposing themselves to increased levels of financial
risk as 1998 loan underwriting standards declined for the fourth
consecutive year, according to an annual survey by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE DEFICIT GREW 2% IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   The trade deficit widened 2 percent in July as exports fell for
the fourth consecutive month, while consumer prices changed little
in August, Government figures showed. Those findings, together with
two other reports that showed a decline in jobless claims and a
rise in workers' incomes, suggested that the economy was holding up
well in its eighth year of expansion, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   NIKE PROFIT DROPS 35% IN QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   Nike, the world's top seller of athletic footwear, said its
profit dropped 35 percent in the first quarter because of sluggish
sales in Asia.

IN SELF-EVALUATION, GIULIANI FINDS PLENTY TO CROW ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Continuing one of his favorite traditions, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani produced a stack of charts Thursday that suggested
the city is ever safer, its streets ever cleaner and its citizens
ever healthier under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In a self-evaluation known as the Mayor's Management Report,
which the City Charter requires to be published every six months,
Giuliani and his administration found that almost every city agency
improved its delivery of services in the last fiscal year, which
ended June 30. In particular, 85 percent of streets were rated as
clean, the number of people who died in fires had dropped
significantly and the infant mortality rate was the lowest since
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find bad news in the report, which is prepared by
Giuliani's staff and has become more upbeat every year since he
took office in 1994. But there was some: police response time to
crimes in progress increased to an average of 9.8 minutes from 9.2,
and the number of children on waiting lists for day care programs
increased to 14,145, from 11,674.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that reported incidents of child abuse and
complaints against police officers had increased, and that the city
had not repaired potholes promptly. But Giuliani did not dwell on
such problems, focusing instead on the drops in crime, traffic
fatalities and the number of people receiving welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this all adds up to is a massive change in the way people
feel about New York City,'' he said, speaking to reporters and
dozens of city employees who came to City Hall for the
presentation. ``All of these things show what most New Yorkers
believe when you poll them, but that people who want to be
consistent critics refuse to accept. Which is that the city of New
York has improved.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked to point out areas of concern in his report,
the mayor declined to mention anything specific. ``There are always
situations in which we could respond better, respond more
quickly,'' Giuliani said. ``The purpose of statistical analysis is
to motivate people to improve as much as possible. But there's not
an area of city government that should feel satisfied that we're
doing the best we can.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The twice-yearly report has traditionally focused on both the
city's accomplishments and problem areas where agencies need to
improve. But under Giuliani, the reports have been increasingly
glowing, with problem areas mentioned only in a separate volume.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the only problems that Giuliani mentioned during
Thursday's presentation was something over which he has minimal
control: the rising cost of auto insurance premiums for city
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics noted that the report did not include the total number
of traffic accidents last year, the number of lead poisoning cases
or plans for improving problem areas, like police response time to
crimes in progress. The report would be more balanced if it were
written by an independent agency, said Ludovic Blain, the city
legislative advocate for the New York Public Interest Research
Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``These reports are more and more effective campaign commercials
and ineffective management tools,'' Blain said. ``The mayor uses
them as cheerleading pompoms for his brand of public policy. It
makes people wonder what is being left out.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council, which has been critical of Giuliani's
management reports in the past, sent out a news release mentioning
several areas of concern, like the day care waiting list and a drop
in the number of window guard inspections. But the tone of the
release was generally positive. Speaker Peter Vallone, a Democrat
who is running for governor, made a point of saying that the
Council was partly responsible for the many improvements listed in
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the city is steadily growing safer and that
city government is becoming more fiscally responsible with each
passing year,'' he said in a statement. ``We should all be proud of
what we have accomplished in New York City thus far in securing a
bright and stable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was jubilant in his presentation of statistics on
crime, welfare benefits and city responses to medical emergencies,
calling the improvements ``astounding,'' ``tremendous'' and
``remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   But his most chest-pounding moment came with the unveiling of a
new set of statistics: the number of wins by the Yankees and the
Mets, both of which have increased since the baseball-fixated mayor
took office. ``This comes from having the most dedicated and
knowledgeable baseball fan as mayor,'' he said.

TOBACCO COMPANIES SUBPOENA SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN LIABILITY LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's top tobacco companies have subpoenaed Arizona's
largest school districts, demanding a broad range of materials used
since 1950 to educate students about the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's largest district, Mesa Unified, is fighting the
subpoena as ``unduly burdensome'' and potentially costly. Three
others, Paradise Valley, Peoria and Phoenix Elementary, also have
filed objections.
</P>
<P>
   And the director of a national anti-smoking group accused the
tobacco companies of using the subpoenas as a harassment technique
to fight Arizona's $500 million tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't say, `Hell no,' '' to a subpoena,'' said John
Banzhaf, executive director of Action on Smoking and Health and a
professor of law of George Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Eckstein, an attorney for Brown &AMP; Williamson, denied he was
trying to harass the schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have subpoenaed 287 school districts. We're not going
to do that,'' he said, noting that only the largest school
districts were targeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to see every last piece of curriculum and every
last book, but I think we've got a pretty good idea of what several
school districts taught 30 to 40 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Eckstein said, the state Department of Education
``gave us the bum's rush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they didn't have any information at all. We had no
choice but to go to the school districts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson Unified, the state's second largest district, and
Scottsdale Unified, also were hit late last month by the tobacco
industry's demands.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas ask for ``any and all instructional materials . .
. used since 1950 to teach students about the effects of tobacco
use.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco attorneys are seeking the materials as they assemble a
legal defense against the state's tobacco lawsuit. The suit, filed
by Attorney General Grant Woods in 1996, claims that
cigarettemakers misled the public about the hazards of smoking for
decades and hooked thousands of youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein said the tobacco companies are seeking to prove that,
30 or 40 years ago, even before the 1964 surgeon general's report
on smoking, ``kids as young as 10 years old and maybe younger were
educated on the evils of smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Textbooks, other curriculum materials and teacher lesson plans
may show ``there was a high degree of awareness of the health risks
associated with smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of reasons young people smoke . . . even
though they've been warned,'' Eckstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Prose, an assistant Arizona attorney general, said he could
not comment on the subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for several of the school districts have filed
objections, saying the tobacco companies' demands are ridiculous,
particularly coming at the beginning of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compliance with your broad demand for nearly 50 years of
documentation would require an inordinate amount of district time,
resources and funds,'' Mesa schools attorney Tamra Sieckmann said
in an Aug. 28 letter to Eckstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a district of approximately 70,000 students, 48
elementary schools, 12 junior high schools, five high schools and
11 alternative schools and programs,'' Sieckmann wrote. ``I cannot
comprehend how the district could adequately satisfy this subpoena
without assigning several employees to work on the request.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the district will ignore the subpoena until a judge
rules it must comply.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise Valley Unified, Peoria Unified and Phoenix Elementary
also filed objections.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies ``asked for everything in the world,''
said Gary Lassen, an attorney for the districts.
</P>
<P>
   Lassen said the districts have no system in place for keeping
outdated textbooks and other curriculum material. ``It's not like
financial records, personnel records or student records they keep
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The three districts, though, are trying to work out a compromise
with the tobacco attorneys to supply easily accessible documents.
</P>
<P>
   Scottsdale already has turned up four boxes of materials dating
to the early 1970s, said Jane McGlothlin, assistant superintendent
for curriculum and instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got stuff out of their garages and brought it in and
said, `Here's something we used years ago,' '' she said. ``It was a
fairly motley-looking collection of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Targeting school districts may be a new legal technique used by
the tobacco industry in its battles against state lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Banzhaf said he had not seen school districts subpoenaed in
other states, although the defense ``that everybody knew about the
dangers of tobacco smoking . . . is rather false and fraudulent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, up until the surgeon general's report, there
was no medical consensus'' on the hazards of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see how a school district in 1955 could have been
presenting anything like a consensus on the issue,'' he said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: TOO LONG TO WAIT AT THE U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, 18 September:
</P>
<P>
   Charges of mixing official and private business have held up
President Clinton's nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be the chief
U.S. representative at the United Nations. That would be a serious
offense, but the merit of the charges has yet to be established.
Formal State and Justice department investigations are now under
way.
</P>
<P>
   These inquiries guarantee a delay of at least four months in
filling the U.N. post. That is too long to leave issues like Iraq,
Libya and the Balkans in the hands of a deputy without cabinet
weight. The administration must quickly name a senior diplomatic or
political figure to fill the job temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are that in 1996 Holbrooke, then an investment
banker working simultaneously as an executive of the Swiss banking
concern Credit Suisse and as Clinton's envoy on Bosnia and Cyprus,
improperly used his contacts with U.S. diplomatic officials to do
work for the bank. Under federal conflict-of-interest laws,
Holbrooke, as a recent State Department employee, would have been
legally barred from any business contacts with his former
diplomatic associates.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has also raised questions by failing to disclose until
now a gift of free lodging in Washington from M. Larry Lawrence,
the former U.S Ambassador to Switzerland, who was later buried in
Arlington National Cemetery and then exhumed when his right to be
interred there was challenged. Holbrooke supported the waiver that
allowed Lawrence, a non-veteran, to be buried at Arlington.
Holbrooke's defenders say that he kept his Credit Suisse business
and his diplomatic work strictly separate and that his dealings
with Lawrence were entirely correct.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton peace agreements on Bosnia,
is experienced and sophisticated enough to know that any blurring
of lines between public and private business is unacceptable. This
page applauded his selection for the U.N. job and we hope it turns
out that his conduct was as careful as he says it was.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the acting representative, has been doing a
decent job since Bill Richardson left for the Energy Department.
But the U.N. post is America's second most important diplomatic
position after the secretary of state. It should be filled by a
weightier figure.

 &HT;    Lang's mix of `beautiful,' `interesting' a winner
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that Helmut Lang's proved he can make the whole
world of high fashion bow to his demands, it's only fitting that
he's designed a collection for spring/summer '99 that's ideally
suited for his supplicant subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, silk and leather jeans with ridged knee padding made the
most declarative statement in the edgy, innovative assortment of
clothes for men and women that Lang presented Thursday in a
stiflingly hot downtown warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The jeans _ reminiscent of the racing pants high-speed
motorcyclists wear to protect their knees while making hairpin
turns _ were a stark departure from all the frilly, feminine styles
shown repeatedly this week by other designers. And the collection _
which also featured knee-length blazers, tightly tailored slacks
and fuzzy cotton suit separates _ solidifies his reputation as a
designer blessed with enough new ideas of his own to never feel
compelled to mimic others.
</P>
<P>
   Lang, a reclusive man of few words who commonly turns down
requests for his own photograph, has said this collection was
``about being beautiful and interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Any discernible flaws in the clothes he showed derived from the
fact that some of his pieces could be described only as
``beautiful'' or ``interesting'' but not both.
</P>
<P>
   The jeans _ in white, black or a tarnished shade of silver
leather _ were an intriguing alternative to all the Capri pants
derivations his counterparts have shown. But they didn't look
particularly comfortable or attractive on his models.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of his navy and black tailored jackets lay in their
utter lack of detail; their extended length looked rather novel,
but Lang's ``less is better'' attitude toward padding and
embellishment is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   The shimmering, shaggy texture of some of Lang's trim-fitting
skirts, camisoles and jackets was a sight to behold, but these
pieces aren't of the type one gets much wear out of ... and where's
the beauty in that?
</P>
<P>
   To further distinguish himself from all the designers who will
ring in next spring with a flourish of colors and an abundance of
vivid floral prints, Lang stuck to the usual neutrals (white,
black, tan, cream and gray), used hot pink as his only accent shade
and cloaked his muted floral skirts and dresses under layers of
panel-sewn sheers.
</P>
<P>
   And as if that weren't enough, Lang bucked the trend toward
designing ``must have'' handbags by accessorizing his outfits with
side holsters, zip-pocketed elbow pads, shoulder strap packs and
money belts.
</P>
<P>
   The applause for Lang's show was so fervent that he reluctantly
stepped out from his position backstage to give a quick nod of
acknowledgement to the adoring crowd. He's expected to show his
collection for fall/winter '99 around Feb. 14. If so, he'll no
doubt cause a rash of dinner date cancellations.

REPORT FAULTS CONNECTICUT CHILD AGENCY IN DEATH OF 6-YEAR-OLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ A state panel investigating the death of a
6-year-old New Haven boy in August harshly criticized Connecticut's
child welfare department Thursday, saying in a report that the
agency failed to protect the abused child and repeated mistakes it
had made in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   As in other recent cases in which children died while being
supervised by the state Department of Children and Families, the
department failed to look at previous abuse reports, ignored
statements by the child and did not visit the home frequently
enough, according to Thursday's report by the state's Child
Fatality Review Panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the fact that we have found similar child welfare
practices in all of the three cases reviewed in the past five
months, we believe that we may be seeing just the tip of the
iceberg,'' Linda Pearce Prestley, the state's advocate for children
and chairwoman of the review panel, said at a news conference
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many children do we need to have this happen to before we
say, the old way of doing things, the laissez-faire attitude, is
not going to fly anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, David Ryan Keeley, was found dead from blunt trauma to
the head in the apartment of his aunt and uncle on Aug. 12. His
body was bruised and dressed only in a diaper.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, known as Ryan, died less than a year after he told
police, ``Sometimes when I'm bad, Auntie throws me to the ground
and they hit me hard,'' according to a separate report on the case
that the department issued last month.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Lynne Friend, the aunt and uncle and the boy's legal
guardians, were arrested in August and accused of risk of injury to
a minor. More serious charges will probably be filed against them
by Tuesday, when they are scheduled to appear in court, said
Michael Dearington, the state's attorney in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's report by the Child Fatality Review Panel found that
the state had received five reports that Ryan was being abused by
his aunt and uncle. One report was ignored, the panel said, and
although three reports of abuse were substantiated by the
department, no steps were taken to remove Ryan from the home.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About a week after Ryan's death, Gov. John G. Rowland fired the
manager in charge of the Bridgeport child welfare office, which
handled Ryan's case. The governor also transferred five supervisors
in Bridgeport to other offices and announced a serious of changes
intended to improve the state's supervision of child abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the review panel suggested that those actions were too
little, too late. In addition, the report says that the problems
leading to Ryan's death are not confined to one region and that
many recommendations that the panel has made since 1995 to try to
solve these problems have not been followed.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the report lists eight recommendations it had
made, including performing comprehensive family assessments, not
putting troubled children under the care of relatives before
assessing if they would be appropriate guardians, and filing
reports about cases into the department's computer system, which
all the department's offices have access to, within three days.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Children and Families Commissioner Kristine Ragaglia
said the department had already adopted the report's
recommendations, or was working on adopting them. In some cases,
she admitted, workers simply did not follow the department's new
rules. ``The real question was, how do we know those are being done
out on the front line?'' Mrs. Ragaglia said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped to address that question by instituting a set
of checks and balances to make sure cases were being handled
correctly. Specifically, each case will be reviewed every six
months by a child welfare worker not involved in that case. This
review policy was started in March in the Hartford office. The
department plans to use these reviews statewide by March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The caseworker in charge of Ryan had about 40 cases, many more
than the maximum of 23 that the state agreed to in a consent
decree. The review panel called for the state to hire more social
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ragaglia said 21 positions were budgeted but were not
filled in the Bridgeport office. If those had been filled, they
would have lightened the worker's load, she said.

EDITORIAL: TIME FOR CENTRAL BANK ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 18:
</P>
<P>
   With the world economy growing at the slowest pace in decades _
and many countries in recession _ only the nations that are growing
the fastest are in a good position to help the world economy before
the problems engulf us all. But there is a great reluctance to act.
</P>
<P>
   This week there was brave talk of coordinated action among the
G-7 countries to stimulate world growth, and it appears that
finance ministers in many of those countries are persuaded that
action is needed. But the two most important central banks in the
world _ the U.S. Federal Reserve and Germany's Bundesbank _ do not
appear ready to take coordinated action to reduce interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That hesitation is understandable considering that each central
bank's legal duty is to help its own national economy, and neither
Germany nor the United States appears to be in imminent danger of
recession _ at least based on their own domestic economies.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest problems are in countries whose central banks
cannot cut interest rates to stimulate growth, simply because to do
so would be to invite the collapse of their own currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Were there a world central bank, there is little doubt that it
would be leaping to action in an effort to spur growth. Bridgewater
Associates, a Connecticut-based economic consulting firm, reports
that world growth is now at a 30-year low, despite the fact the
U.S. economy has grown 3.6 percent over the past year. The figure
for the rest of the world was a scant 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that are doing well are likely to see a flood of cheap
imports from those economies that are in trouble, raising the
threat that developed countries will retreat toward protectionism.
Already, with the trade deficit growing, the American steel
industry is demanding that duties by placed on low-cost steel
arriving from Asian and Russian producers who have seen their
former Asian markets dry up. The state of South Dakota, reacting to
the complaints of farmers, is trying to hamper the importation of
Canadian grain and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   In an atmosphere of low commodity prices around the globe,
inflation is not the threat it was even a few years ago. Fears of
inflation should not now prevent interest rate cuts by central
banks. Such moves could help to offset the decline in global
economic growth.

EDITORIAL: SUSTAIN THE `PARTIAL BIRTH' VETO 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Sept. 18:
</P>
<P>
   A woman's right to abortion faces a critical test Friday in the
Senate. The House has already voted to override President Clinton's
principled veto last year of the latest congressional attempt to
ban so-called partial birth abortions. A Senate vote scheduled for
Friday morning will determine whether this professedly narrow but
actually far-reaching assault on abortion rights becomes the law of
the land.
</P>
<P>
   The latest head counts suggest that Clinton's veto will stand.
But for Americans concerned about government intrusion into women's
private medical decisions, this is a moment for nervousness. Two
years ago, an effort to rally the required two-thirds of the
chamber to override Clinton's veto of a similar bill fell short by
just three votes _ and that was before Clinton's Monica Lewinsky
troubles and the Christian right's expensive lobbying campaign
aimed at senators deemed susceptible to pre-election pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership, content to let the Christian
Coalition's political strategy drive the Senate's schedule, has
timed Friday's vote to coincide with the group's ``Road to
Victory'' conference in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Though promoted by its supporters as an attempt to outlaw a
single controversial third-trimester procedure, known as intact
dilation and extraction, the bill's reach actually is far broader.
Its vague terms could be interpreted to prohibit the safest and
most common abortion procedures used throughout a pregnancy, not
just in the final three months, thus interfering with a woman's
right to a first- or second-trimester abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, six of seven court rulings on state measures that were
modeled on the congressional version have found significant
constitutional defects, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Roe
vs. Wade. ``The law is unconstitutionally vague and unduly
burdensome on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion,''
explained U.S. District Judge Robert Pratt when he enjoined an
identically worded Iowa statute from going into effect two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was right to veto this crude attempt to narrow every
woman's access to safe and legal abortions. Senators who care about
preserving that access will vote to sustain the veto.

RANGERS WIN HARD WAY AFTER hELLING DIGS HOLE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Winning the ``hard'' way has become a way of
survival for the Rangers. As defined back in July by Johnny Oates,
that means overcoming poor work from a starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, it wasn't just any starting pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   After having spent most of this season in a witness protection
program, it had finally become safe for the Rangers' rotation to
mingle once again in public. Even the use of real names was
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Although other malfunctions kept the team in a frustrating flux
over the last month, it was the rotation that allowed a divisional
race to continue. Well, that and the fact the Anaheim Angels had
problems of their own.
</P>
<P>
   A ``quality start'' in baseball is defined as at least six
innings while giving up three earned runs or fewer. The rotation
had reached that level in 13 of the past 17 games going into, yes,
the season's most critical encounter to date last night.
</P>
<P>
   Needed this win badly. Needed Rick Helling to be better than
even ever, which was asking a lot, considering how consistently
good Helling has been. From his April role as fifth man in the
rotation, the right-hander had earned his way to ace status. And
this was a battlefield promotion, too.
</P>
<P>
   With first place at stake, Helling was the logical choice to
nail down the American League West lead. After all, he was most
responsible for preventing the Rangers' staff from falling off
baseball's planet.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, it was Helling who took that tumble last
night. A 19-game winner looking for No. 20, his outing resembled a
pitcher who had never won more than five games in a season. Which
until this year, was Helling's story.
</P>
<P>
   The plate must have looked as far away as Fargo, Helling's North
Dakota hometown. The bases looked as busy as midtown Manhattan
streets. Of the 12 batters Helling faced, nine reached and six
scored. Oates usually can't get enough of Helling. By the second
inning, he couldn't stomach any more.
</P>
<P>
   What's that Oates has repeatedly said for weeks, going on
months? Something about, ``if we can just hold 'em to four, maybe
five runs, we'll probably score six.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, six wouldn't win it, not after Helling's
rare poor outing.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with no other option, Oates had to begin an early bullpen
parade while also depending upon the Rangers' No. 1 ally _
ballistic bats. But here's a manager who has had plenty of practice
at trying to survive rotation failure. It has been a major part of
Oates' 1998 life.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked again, with plenty of help from the dark side of
the Rangers' bullpen, meaning long and middle men.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goodwin's eighth-inning run-scoring single capped a
remarkable evening for the Rangers, who won, 7-6, and rolled back
into first place for the first time since Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Ten games to go in the season, and the lead is one over the
Angels with three meetings still to go in Anaheim. But a two-game
swing in the division in two Arlington nights put the Rangers at
the wheel for the flag lap.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, of course, wanted no part of an offensive shootout.
Against the Rangers, no one does. But since there was no knuckle to
Angels starter Steve Sparks, Anaheim's quick 4-0 lead was gone by
the bottom of the first. And then a 6-4 lead also disappeared on
solo homers by Todd Zeile and Juan Gonzalez, the latter tying the
score in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until Goodwin's hero hit in the eighth. But
also give credit here to Oates. For a man with possible job
security problems if the Rangers don't finish first, Oates went
with percentages instead of panic in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After a leadoff single by Lee Stevens, Zeile came to the plate.
The temptation was to have him swinging for the big inning, except
Oates stuck to basic baseball. The bunt sign was flashed, and Zeile
laid down a beautiful sacrifice, moving pinch runner Milt Cuyler to
second. That meant, however, Oates had put the game in the hands of
either Royce Clayton or Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton was drilled by a pitch, leaving it up to Goodwin. He
delivered, and Oates looked smart.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for the manager using the quick hook on
Helling in the second inning. It was questionable to turn a game
over to his bullpen that early, down 6-4. But 21/3 shutout innings
from Al Levine, then a masterful four shutout innings by Tim
Crabtree put the Rangers in a position to eventually win.
</P>
<P>
   Right moves by the manager, and baseball's best offense rescued
another ``hard way'' win. And this time with first place at stake.

plainly, is to spur growth.'' The markets soared, figuring that a
statement issued the same day by the seven largest industrial
economies meant that coordinated action was on the way. By
Wednesday afternoon, that hope was dashed. First Germany, then the

   GERSHWIN-BIRTHDAY (New York) _ Was George Gershwin America's
greatest composer? In the arts, such questions are futile and
ultimately unimportant. What can be said, perhaps, is that Gershwin
was the most American composer, in the democracy and eclecticism of
his idiom, and in the brash energy and earthy imagination that
boiled from his musical melting pot of pop, blues, jazz and
classics. He has been gone so long, dead at 38 in 1937, that it is
hard to believe he would only now be turning 100. Next Friday is
the big day, although many revelers have jumped the gun. Everyone,
it seems, is eager to celebrate, and few, so far, are inclined to
complain. To show the remarkable range, music critics of The Times
_ pop, jazz and classical _ have compiled a list of their favorite
recordings of Gershwiniana.

FREEMEN FOLLOWER SUES GOVERNMENT FOR $300 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN MAESHIRO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER, Calif. -- The self-described disciple of an
anti-government group is now turning to the government to seek $300
million in damages for what she claims was her wrongful conviction
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil rights lawsuit filed in Lancaster, Margaret Elizabeth
Broderick and her husband say a search of their home in nearby
Palmdale was improper, that the FBI and other federal agencies have
no authority there, and that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department and county officials should have protected them from
federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court, where she was sentenced in March 1997
to 16 years in prison for convictions on 26 counts including
conspiracy, fraud and money laundering had no right to try her,
according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to, during and subsequent to this `trial,' (she)
maintained the position that the United States District Court did
not and does not have jurisdiction over the offenses allegedly
committed by her,'' the suit stated.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick was accused of creating bogus checks and staging
seminars to tell people how they could use the forgeries to pay off
debts.
</P>
<P>
   She described herself as a follower of LeRoy Schweitzer, a
leader of the anti-government Freemen group jailed last year in
Montana. The self-styled Freemen say they reject almost all
government authority and insist they have their own laws and
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed Sept. 10 by Broderick's husband, Richard,
in Lancaster Superior Court. He is now serving time in a Texas
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Attorney General Janet Reno, U.S. Attorney
Nora Manella, the Internal Revenue Service, Los Angeles County
District Attorney Gil Garcetti, former Lancaster Deputy District
Attorney John Spillane, Sheriff Sherman Block, county supervisors
and various members of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to respond directly to a lawsuit we have not
seen yet. It is my understanding she has filed several other civil
rights lawsuits in federal court, all of which were summarily
dismissed,'' said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Since her incarceration in April 1996, Broderick's health has
been jeopardized because of ``horrendous, subhuman medical
facilities and treatment,'' the lawsuit stated.
</P>
<P>
   The filing said she has been denied access to proper and
necessary medication and was ``forced to consume unnecessary and
mind-numbing/duping medication such as Prozac.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said federal agents ``stormed'' the couple's
Palmdale home March 25, 1996, to conduct a search.
</P>
<P>
   The agents entered the house with weapons, including firearms
and axes, drawn. They then ``began to indiscriminately and
aimlessly search and ransack'' the home, holding Richard Broderick
at gunpoint during the search, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Because the federal court has no jurisdiction over her,
Broderick's conviction should be overturned and the ``sentence
extinguished,'' the suit stated.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is about 55 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities charged on Thursday that the
bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya last month was orchestrated by
an Islamic extremist from the island nation of Comoros who reported
directly to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile who is now the focus
of the world-wide inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Broadening the case against bin Laden's organization, the
government offered a $2 million reward for information leading to
the arrest of Haroun Fazil, who has been eluding authorities since
a warrant was issued for his arrest late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil has been accused of 12 counts of murder, one for each
American who died in the Kenyan embassy; murder conspiracy, and the
use of weapons of mass destruction. He could face life imprisonment
or the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials also said they had arrested a man whom they
described as the former personal secretary to bin Laden when both
men lived in the Sudan in 1994. The defendant, Wadih el Hage, of
Arlington, Texas, is the first American citizen known to have been
charged in the investigation of bin Laden and the embassy attacks.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan
late on Thursday and was charged with three counts of making false
statements to investigators. A federal prosecutor, Patrick
Fitzgerald, told the magistrate that the government would indict el
Hage on new charges by Monday, and he was ordered held without
bond. His lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The charges disclosed on Thursday by Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, and Lewis Schiliro, assistant director of
the FBI in New York, show now more clearly how investigators are
methodically building the case against bin Laden, his operatives
and lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was charged in a sealed indictment earlier this year
that accused him of various acts of terrorism. The government has
not said when or whether it plans an indictment in the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White said that Fazil was ``a very active member of the
Kenyan cell'' of bin Laden's terrorist group. ``He's an allegedly
major player in the organization,'' Ms. White said.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said that the new charges ``will get us closer to a
resolution of this case, but it is by no means ended.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcements on Thursday also shed light on the
investigation of bin Laden that dates back to before the nearly
simultaneous attacks in Kenya and Tanzania. In those attacks, on
Aug. 7, more than 250 people died, 12 of them Americans, and
thousands of people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   A federal complaint unsealed on Thursday shows that el Hage was
interviewed by the authorities in New York as early as September
1997, and questioned about bin Laden's activities and his
associates.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the complaint says, el Hage admitted to having
worked as bin Laden's personal secretary, and also to knowing two
of his top military commanders, identified as Abu Ubaidah al
Banshiri and Abu Hafs el Masry.
</P>
<P>
   Al Banshiri drowned in a ferry accident in East Africa in 1996,
the court papers said, but they offered few other details about
either men.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro would not say where the authorities believe Fazil has
fled, or how he may have left the Comoros islands, which are in the
Indian Ocean southeast of Tanzania and Kenya. Earlier this month,
the FBI and the Comoros police raided two homes on the island of
Moroni, looking for Fazil, and also questioned his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities described Fazil as an explosives expert in his
mid-20s who speaks fluent French, Swahili, Arabic, and English, and
is adept with computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the federal complaint did not describe precisely
Fazil's rank in Bin Laden's organization, it suggested that his
role in the Nairobi attack was more significant than any of the
three other defendants who have been arrested and are being held in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The federal complaint said that Fazil's duties in al Qaeda
included the preparation of various reports for bin Laden and his
top lieutenants. In the Kenyan bombing, Fazil was accused of
renting the room in the Hilltop Hotel in Nairobi where
investigators believe that the bomb was constructed, and of hiring
two people to clean the room after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, the day of the attack, the government said, Fazil
drove a white pick-up truck which led another vehicle, which was
carrying the bomb, to the embassy site in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not directly accuse el Hage of a role in the
embassy bombings. But the documents say that Fazil and el Hage, the
Texan, were close, and that the two shared a house last year in
Nairobi. El Hage moved to Kenya from the Sudan in 1994, the
government said, before returning to the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage did not speak in court on Thursday, but his supervisor
at the Fort Worth, company where he works, Lone Star Wheels and
Tires, said that el Hage told him on Monday that he had to take
care of personal business in New York, and would return in two
days.
</P>
<P>
   He left that afternoon on a 4:30 plane and the supervisor,
Mahmoud Mazouni, said that el Hage did not appear nervous or
troubled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He described el Hage as a quiet and conscientious employee who
prayed several times a day in a back room, and avoided discussions
of politics or his feelings about the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mostly talked about his kids,'' Mazouni said. ``If he had
any secrets, he didn't let anyone here know.''
</P>
<P>
   In a court disclosure form, el Hage wrote that he was married
and had seven children, whose ages ranged from 12 years to several
months.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, April Ray, said in an interview on Thursday night at
the family's apartment in a modest, two-story building near the
University of Texas at Arlington that she had just learned of her
husband's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much shellshocked,'' she said through tears. ``I
just barely heard what's going on, and I'm having a hard time
dealing with it.'' She declined to answer questions about her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that el Hage is an American citizen. They said
in court papers that el Hage had told investigators that he once
worked in Kuwait, and studied city planning in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that after the August attacks, the Kenyan
authorities, in the presence of FBI agents, searched a home in
Nairobi, and seized files that included phone bills belonging to el
Hage. They said they also found a receipt for an item which
appeared to have been shipped to another defendant in the bombing
case, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, who was arrested last month in Nairobi
and flown to Manhattan to face charges.
</P>
<P>
   El Hage is the fourth suspect known to be held in Manhattan in
connection with the investigation. Late last month, Odeh and
Mohamed Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali were charged with direct roles in
the attack on the embassy in Nairobi. Last Friday, another suspect
was charged in a sealed proceeding in Federal District Court, but
his identity and nationality have not been disclosed.

SPENDING BILL HURT BY BID ON FOREIGN FARM HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (editors: This story, filed Sept. 16 and then held, is now
released, with minor editing changes)  
 (ATTN: Ore., Calif., Mexico)   (lb)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A proposal to ease the hiring of foreigners at
harvest time is clouding prospects for congressional approval of a
spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and State departments.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment to the $27.4 billion spending bill is being pushed
by farm-state senators who say the process for hiring foreign farm
workers, most from Mexico, is slow and burdened by red tape. As a
result, some lawmakers say, farmers face the dilemma of seeing
their crops go unharvested or hiring foreigners who lack permission
to work.
</P>
<P>
   One expected result of the amendment would be more foreign
workers, and therefore pressure to keep wages low. While the
amendment would require growers to pay American farm workers the
prevailing wage in a given area, critics contend that those wages
could drop if the legislation is approved.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would also require American farm workers to list
themselves in a central job registry and get their jobs through a
referral from that registry. And it would eliminate the requirement
that growers provide housing for guest workers, although farmers
would have to give these workers a housing allowance. This would
mean that rural communities would have to build housing for
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure, including labor unions, Hispanic civil
rights groups and the Labor Department, say it is an effort to hold
down wages of migrant workers by bringing in low-income Mexican
field hands. The opponents also argue that the measure weakens
guarantees that American farm workers would still be provided jobs,
good housing and a decent wage.
</P>
<P>
   And opponents point to studies by the General Accounting Office
and private economists indicating that there is no agricultural
labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the measure have urged the White House to threaten a
veto of the spending bill if the amendment is enacted. They hope
the threat would persuade House-Senate conferees to drop the
amendment to help gain support for the spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's chief sponsor, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., he was
willing to modify his bill to address some of the opponents'
concerns, and Clinton administration officials met with him Tuesday
in an effort to work out their differences. But a White House
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that
``people are still far apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the bill is already jeopardized because of
controversy over preparations for the 2000 census.

JUNIUS KELLOGG, 71, BASKETBALL PLAYER WHO REFUSED BRIBE IN
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Junius Kellogg, the Manhattan College basketball
player whose refusal to accept a bribe to fix the score of a 1951
game touched off the widest betting scandal in basketball history,
died Sept. 16 in the Kingsbridge Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
the Bronx. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg, who was paralyzed in a 1954 automobile accident, had
been hospitalized since December and underwent heart surgery at
Mount Sinai Hospital in December and February. Bob Otten, his
college roommate and teammate and a close friend since, said the
cause of death was respiratory failure.
</P>
<P>
   In the betting scandal, 32 players from seven colleges admitted
taking bribes to fix 86 games in 17 states between 1947 and 1950.
The players included seven from the City College team that in 1950
won the National Invitation Tournament and the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament, the only such double in history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951, the 6-foot-8-inch Kellogg, a sophomore from a poor
family in Portsmouth, Va., was Manhattan's first black scholarship
athlete. In those days, college basketball doubleheaders
consistently sold out Madison Square Garden while the Knicks played
their games before small crowds in an armory. The Garden crowds
included many bettors who cheered not necessarily for a team to
win, but also to win or lose by a certain number of points.
</P>
<P>
   After a Manhattan practice one day, Henry Poppe, the co-captain
the previous season, visited Kellogg's dormitory room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard from other players that he had a problem with me being
black,'' Kellogg once recalled. ``This guy would pass me in the
street and not even say so much as good morning. And all of a
sudden he was acting like my best friend, and he had a deal for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   De Paul University was coming to the Garden as a 3-point
favorite over Manhattan. Poppe wanted Kellogg, Manhattan's leading
scorer, to be sure his team lost by at least 5 or 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He offered me $1,000,'' Kellogg said. ``I told him to get the
hell out of my room.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg said he did not sleep well that night. The next day, he
told the story to Manhattan coach Kenny Norton, who sent him to the
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to hurt the guy,'' Kellogg said of Poppe, ``but
I had to do it. If at any time in the future that guy decided to
tell someone he came to see me, my scholarship was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamblers approached Kellogg again, and the district
attorney's staff wired him for a listening device to wear when he
met the gamblers at a neighborhood bar.
</P>
<P>
   The gamblers told him to ``throw hook shots over the basket''
and ``miss rebounds occasionally.'' Kellogg declined, and Manhattan
won the game, 62-59. Hours later, the police made the first
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize the enormity of the situation,'' Kellogg
said. ``I was just this naive kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in with the messages of praise for Kellogg were a few
threatening letters. A guard was stationed around the clock at his
dormitory room. He and Otten were told not to use the bed by the
window.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg left college for the Army, returned, took a double class
load and graduated in 1953 with his original class. Then he was
hired by the Harlem Globetrotters for their second barnstorming
basketball unit.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1954, he and four Globetrotter teammates were driving
through Pine Bluff, Ark., to an exhibition game, when the right
rear tire blew. The car flipped five times, throwing all of the
players out of open windows. All escaped serious injury except for
Kellogg, whose spinal cord was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   When he revived, Kellogg recalled, he heard a voice saying: ``Is
he alive? Does he have any chance at all?'' He remembered a doctor
coming into his room every so often and saying, ``Is he gone yet?''
</P>
<P>
   For six weeks, Kellogg drifted in and out of a coma. Later, he
was sent to the Bronx hospital, where he would die 44 years later.
He spent four years there, finally regaining the use of his hands
and arms. He spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair and learned
to drive a specially fitted car.
</P>
<P>
   From 1957 to 1966, Kellogg coached the Pan Am Jets to four
international championships in wheelchair basketball. He taught,
gave speeches and counseled inner-city children. From 1966 until
his death, he worked for New York City, becoming the first deputy
commissioner and director of strategic planning for the Community
Development Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in a high-rise apartment in Riverdale, the Bronx,
overlooking the Manhattan College campus. The college awarded him
an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and helped run testimonial
dinners for him last year in Albany and on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg was the oldest of 11 children. He is survived by three
brothers, Theodore of Suitland, Md.; James of Fairbanks, Alaska,
and John of Chicago; three sisters, Elvin Edwards of Baltimore and
Rosa Gibbs and Evangeline Pope of Portsmouth, Va., and 20 nephews
and nieces.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Otten, his college roommate, said, ``I never _ and I
mean never _ heard him complain once.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Kellogg responded: ``Complain about what? I can't
complain about my life. Too many good things have already
happened.'' &QL;

BACK SPASMS FORCE RANGERS' RODRIGUEZ OUT OF GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez had to leave
last night's game in the fifth inning with muscle spasms in his
lower back.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez felt the spasms on one particular pitch, an inside
fastball from Tim Crabtree that he had to reach for while Anaheim
Angels hitter Phil Nevin danced out of the way. Rodriguez
immediately left the field and was replaced by reserve catcher Bill
Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's status is listed as day-to-day, but the Rangers are
hopeful he'll be in the lineup tonight against the Oakland
Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he'll be ready to play tomorrow,'' manager Johnny
Oates said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are also concerned about shortstop Royce Clayton,
who was hit in the shoulder in the eighth inning on a pitch from
Angels reliever Rich Delucia.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton stayed in the game for the ninth inning but was feeling
sore afterward. He has started 43 of 44 games since being acquired
from the St. Louis Cardinals on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more worried about Clayton than I am about Pudge,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has started a league-leading 129 games at catcher, and
the Rangers are 11-12 this year in games started by Haselman.
Haselman is hitting .301 but has thrown out just five of 29 base
runners trying to steal off him, including one of the past 18.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a six-time Gold Glove winner, threw out Jim Edmonds
trying to steal in the first inning and has thrown out 40 of 74
attempting to steal this year. The 54 percent success rate is the
best in the majors.

   Rodriguez and Haselman are the only full-time catchers with the
Rangers even though the rosters have been expanded to a maximum of
40 players. The Rangers thought about putting Triple-A catcher Rick
Wrona on the roster for September but instead gave that spot to
pinch-running specialist Milt Cuyler.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers plan to have Triple-A catcher Chris Tremie at the
ballpark tonight. If Rodriguez can't play, Tremie will be placed on
the roster as a backup for Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile was once a catcher but hasn't gone
behind the plate since 1990. Reserve infielder Scott Sheldon could
catch in an emergency.

IT'S ANYBODY'S RACE AS METS AND CUBS BATTLE DOWN THE HOMESTRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Bochy had to contend with Sammy Sosa the past four days,
but the San Diego Padres manager had to admit that the New York
Mets had his attention, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Mets are doing has to create a lot of interest
there,'' Bochy said Thursday before the Chicago Cubs and Sosa could
plague his National League West champion team one last time.
``We're checking for the scores. The comebacks and the extra
innings _ that was one heck of a series with the Astros. I'm sure
it doesn't get any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Bochy had something in common this week but no
longer. Bochy doesn't have to deal with Sosa anymore; the Mets have
Sosa to contend with for perhaps the next eight games.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many games both teams have in their duel-to-the-death
race for the National League wild-card spot. Sosa has carried the
Cubs in their quest, epitomizing his role by driving in all six
runs, the last four with his 63d home run, in a 6-3 victory over
the Padres on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, for once, did not power the Cubs on Thursday, but they
nevertheless edged the Padres, 4-3, and increased their lead over
the Mets, who were idle, to one game.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mark McGwire's, the Mets' fortunes could fall or rise with
each Sosa swing. But they have not let themselves be intimidated by
his most valuable player performance. They have staged their own
spine-tingling, heart-stopping style of play, spreading around
their game-winning heroics among players like Mike Piazza, John
Olerud, Brian McRae, Edgardo Alfonzo, Tony Phillips and Todd
Hundley. In their modest way, the Mets have matched Sosa as their
teams have been no further than a game apart since Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have remained in contention to join the Yankees in the
post-season for the first time, a fact that only heightens the
drama surrounding the next 10 days. The Mets have eclipsed the
Yankees in interest, though perhaps only temporarily, because the
Yankees have had a losing record the past month while the Mets have
played exciting baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Mets can join the Yankees in the post-season, they
have to shed Sosa and his supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredible what he's doing,'' Bochy said by telephone
from San Diego. ``Just like the Mets. This is quite a race here.
Two teams playing great ball, playing with a lot of heart.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has had this kind of effect on the Mets. After they pulled
out yet another come-from-behind victory in Houston on Wednesday
night, John Franco was in the shower when noise from the locker
area of the clubhouse caught his attention. Rushing out of the
shower, the pitcher yelled, ``Who hit that? Who hit that?'' Told
that Sosa had hit a grand slam, Franco hung his head, turned around
and retreated to the shower.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have surely had a similar effect on the Cubs with their
late-inning dramatics. In nine of their last 20 games, dating from
Aug. 28, the Mets have hit home runs in the seventh, eighth or
ninth innings that either won or tied the game or put them ahead.
Four of the games were against the Astros, and two of the home runs
were hit against Billy Wagner, the Astros' closer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Cubs, the Mets have put themselves in position to
reach the playoffs with a versatility that has served them well.
The series in Houston that enthralled Bochy was a microcosm of the
Mets' season.
</P>
<P>
   The first game belonged to McRae. First, he hit a two-run home
run against Wagner in the ninth inning that tied the game, then
drilled a two-run, tie-breaking double in the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga tied the second game with a two-run home run in the
eighth inning, then combined with Rey Ordonez for consecutive
doubles in the 11th, putting the Mets ahead, albeit temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud socked a three-run home run in the eighth inning of the
third game that gave the Mets a lead they did not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for the piece de resistance, Piazza cracked a three-run
home run in the ninth inning of the fourth game against Wagner,
putting the Mets in the lead. The Astros tied the game with a home
run of their own, but Hundley won it with a pinch-hit home run in
the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier late-inning comebacks, Alfonzo, Piazza and
Phillips hit pivotal home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets clearly have not warranted inclusion with the division
champions, Atlanta, Houston and San Diego. They do not have the
overall talent those teams have. But they have held firm in the
wild-card race by playing relentlessly, never conceding anything to
the better teams.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this month, the Mets faced a pair of games in San
Diego, four at home and three on the road against Atlanta and four
in Houston. Those were 13 of their final 24 games. With the
season-ending series in Atlanta left, the Mets have a 7-3 record in
those games, splitting two games with the Padres and snatching
three one-run victories from the Braves before outlasting the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have not played as intensely and as dramatically
against weaker teams, evenly dividing six games with Philadelphia
and Montreal. They play the league's weakest team, the Florida
Marlins, three times this weekend and then have two games against
Montreal at Shea Stadium before finishing the season in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While the hitters have dominated the recent stretch with their
breathtaking hits, one unheralded member of the pitching staff has
begun to exemplify the excitement the Mets have brought to Shea
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell, a 31-year-old right-hander, had been an
underachieving relief pitcher throughout his career, but he has
recently evoked memories of a more successful reliever in Mets
history, Tug McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrative Wendell was effective and indefatigable in
Houston, pitching two shutout innings in the first game, one and
two-thirds shutout innings in the second, two shutout innings in
the third for a save and one shutout inning in the fourth for
another save. He threw 97 pitches, a remarkable number for a relief
pitcher over four consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   When McGraw completed a victory, he hopped off the mound yelling
and slapping his glove against his thigh. When Wendell completed
the last two victories in Houston, he leaped off the mound
screaming and thrusting his arms in the air. He brought back scenes
that the Mets would like to see continued next month. &QL;

MAN CHARGED WITH KILLING GUINEA PIG IN FRONT OF BOY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. -- A 37-year-old man faces felony charges of
animal cruelty and child abuse after killing a pet guinea pig in
front of his girlfriend's 7-year-old son, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, Jesus Antonio Cruz of Palmdale grabbed
the furry rodent from the boy's arms and threw it against a wall --
twice -- during an argument with the child's mother in the
apartment they shared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant picked up the pig in the child's arms and threw
it against a bedroom wall,'' Deputy District Attorney Kelly Cromer
said. ``The pig fell to the ground motionless, and the defendant
picked up the pig and threw it against the wall again.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz had grabbed the animal after the woman told her son to get
help during the argument, Cromer said. Cromer said Cruz told the
boy, ``If you go, I will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz and the woman had been living together for more than two
years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred about 1:30 a.m. Aug. 30, officials said.
Cruz was arrested after the apartment manager called sheriff's
deputies.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz is now in custody in neighboring Riverside County, where he
was wanted on suspicion of running an illegal ``chop shop''
operation -- a place where stolen vehicles were dismantled for
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Charges were filed this week in Antelope Valley Municipal Court
accusing him of child abuse, animal cruelty and terrorist threats.
Prosecutors said Cruz faces up to six years in prison if convicted
on those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale is about 50 miles north of downtown Los Angeles.

CLINTON'S OHIO VISIT IS NORMAL--ON THE SURFACE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ On the surface, it was a perfectly normal
presidential visit, with all the symbols of power on display.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton landed at lunchtime at the Greater Cincinnati
Airport, across the Ohio River in Kentucky, in his imposing
blue-and-white jet, Air Force One, with the big presidential seal
on its side. A pair of Air Force enlisted men snapped to attention
as a ramp rolled into place. A long black limousine with flags
flying from its fenders stood ready, along with a queue of local
politicians and officials, some of them carrying umbrellas in a
light rain.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a dark gray double-breasted suit, Clinton chatted with
each person in the group, smiling warmly if less broadly than
usual. As usual, he was late _25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, in fact, a most abnormal visit. Back in Washington,
the House Judiciary Committee was meeting to decide whether to
release the videotape of the president giving testimony about
Monica Lewinsky to a grand jury. Rep. Steve Chabot of Cincinnati, a
Republican, sits on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   After a long debate within her campaign organization about
whether being seen with Clinton Thursday would help her or hurt
her, Mayor Roxanne Qualls of Cincinnati, Chabot's Democratic
opponent this fall, turned up at the airport. Clinton asked her to
ride into the city with him, and she did.
</P>
<P>
   But she had told a reporter pointedly earlier this week, ``I am
not a close personal friend of the president in any sense of the
phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic politicians in the region who might have found
a way to be there, had the president not been in such deep
political trouble, stayed away Thursday, for whatever reason. Gov.
Paul Patton of Kentucky sent the lieutenant governor, Steven Henry.
Neither Mary Boyle, the former county commissioner from Cleveland
who is running for the Senate in Ohio this fall, nor Rep. Ted
Strickland, a centrist Democrat whose district runs eastward across
southern Ohio from the Cincinnati exurbs, found their way to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of circumstances, this would be a tough year for
Ohio Democrats. Gov. George Voinovich, a popular Republican, is
strongly favored over Ms. Boyle in the Senate race, and the Ohio
secretary of state, Bob Taft, the possessor of a magic Republican
name, is running well ahead in the contest for Voinovich's job. But
Democratic candidates are getting jumpier by the day.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton wondered why, he could have scanned the front page of
Thursday's Cincinnati Enquirer. There were photographs of six area
residents, together with comments they sent in response to the
paper's invitation. Two were more or less supportive of the
president, but the rest were highly critical. Two called on him to
resign and another, Jennifer Weber of Oxford, Ohio, wrote: ``How
can you stand for a moral and ethical country and help people live
the American dream when you are the epitome of America's
problems?''
</P>
<P>
   The paper received 1,464 messages and printed three full pages
of them. It said three of four people who sent faxes and letters
wanted Clinton to go; those who sent e-mail messages, mostly
younger, were more forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial last Sunday, the paper itself was harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Bill Clinton has lied his way out of the most
powerful office in the world,'' The Enquirer declared. ``To endure
such a dishonest man as our national leader is more shame and
humiliation than our nation can tolerate. He needs our prayers. But
he cannot remain in the White House. If he lacks the basic decency,
honor and sense of duty to resign, he should be impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite national, regional and local polls showing that a
majority of respondents want neither a resignation nor an
impeachment, those calling the Washington offices of Ohio lawmakers
obviously feel otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A ``large volume of calls'' to Sen. John Glenn, a Democrat who
said this week that it would be ``reckless and injudicious'' for
him to join ``the rush to judgment'' in the Lewinsky matter, have
run 2-1 in favor of resignation or impeachment. Chabot's office
said the tally there was 425-15 against Clinton since Kenneth Starr
issued his report a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the president lacks vocal supporters in this state. The
Ohio Democratic chairman, David Leland, said, ``The vast majority
of Ohio Democrats want to see this president continue in office,
because they know a political lynching when they see one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even conclusive proof that Clinton lied to the grand jury in the
Lewinsky case ``wouldn't change anyone's minds here,'' Leland said
in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got an equally fervent vote of confidence Thursday
afternoon from Stanley Chesley, the host of a fund-raising luncheon
at his house in the city's northern suburbs. Chesley praised the
president for ``monumental'' courage in the face of repeated
attacks and added: ``We need you. I need you.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the nation's leading trial lawyers, who has made a
fortune from contingency fees in cases like the Bhopal chemical
disaster and the Dow Corning implants failure, Chesley has raised
millions of dollars for Democratic candidates in recent years.
Thursday's goal was $500,000 for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee. Considerably more than that was raised last
March at a similar event for the Democratic National Committee at
Chesley's house.
</P>
<P>
   The president contrasted his stands on Social Security, the
world economy, public education and health care with those of the
Republicans on Capitol Hill. He urged his listeners to ``look your
friends dead in the eye'' and tell them: ``It's not about
Washington. It's about America and these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington, he said, is ``obsessed with itself instead of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the luncheon, Clinton passed a small group of
supporters and a larger group of opponents calling for him to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   But he talked to no ordinary voters. Qualls invited him to visit
one of the Cincinnati neighborhoods that have applied for a federal
``empowerment zone'' grant. But the mayor said White House
officials had rejected the idea on the ground that a visit to one
applicant would be unfair to others.

RANGERS MOVE INTO FIRST IN AL WEST WITH 7-6 VICTORY AGAINST ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ten days separate the Rangers from an
American League West title.
</P>
<P>
   It became theirs to lose on an evening in which their players
refused to lose. The Rangers regained possession of first place for
the first time since Aug. 13 with their exhilarating, 7-6 victory
against the Anaheim Angels last night at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Tom Goodwin supplied the Rangers their first and
only lead with his one-out, eighth-inning double off right-hander
Rich DeLucia.
</P>
<P>
   That scored Milt Cuyler from second base with what proved to be
the game-winning run, but the Rangers' bullpen made this victory
possible with 72/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Tim Crabtree, who threw 46 pitches, surrendered
only one walk during his career-high, four-inning appearance, and
closer John Wetteland recorded his 41st save by retiring the side
in order during the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some high moments, but this was awesome,'' said
Crabtree, who urged those in attendance to their feet after
recording the final outs of the seventh and eighth innings. ``It
was a great night all the way around. We were down four runs and
battled back. The crowd was in the game. It was outstanding. You
can't ask for more from a major-league game than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Lee Stevens opened the bottom of the eighth
inning with a leadoff single off right-hander Pep Harris (3-1), and
manager Johnny Oates summoned Cuyler from the bench as a pinch
runner.
</P>
<P>
   Cuyler advanced to second on the ensuing sacrifice bunt by third
baseman Todd Zeile, and Angels manager Terry Collins went to the
bullpen for right-hander Rich DeLucia.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton reached first after being hit by a
pitch, and that brought Goodwin to the plate for the decisive
at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was big, but we still have to come out and focus on
Oakland,'' Goodwin said. ``Obviously, it's good to come in here and
win two games and get into first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers overcame:
</P>
<P>
   Six runs surrendered by right-hander Rick Helling during a
11/3-inning catastrophe that represented the shortest start of his
career since a one-inning appearance May 11, 1994, against the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   A gaffe on the bases by Goodwin that cost the Rangers one run
and perhaps more by robbing catcher Ivan Rodriguez of a
second-inning at-bat with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Angels center fielder Jim Edmonds, who cannot be described as
Helling-friendly, concluded the pitcher's brief evening and bid to
become the major leagues' first 20-game winner with his two-run,
second-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, whose eight hits in 17 at-bats against Helling include
four home runs, also delivered home the first of the Angels' four
first-inning runs with a run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, responded with a four-run first inning of
their own on the strength of a two-run double by left fielder Rusty
Greer and run-scoring singles by first baseman Will Clark and
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Angels right-hander Steve Sparks, who relies on a knuckleball,
did not fare significantly better than Helling and found himself
replaced by right-hander Shigetoshi Hasegawa after recording only
five outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers eventually tied the score with third- and
fourth-inning solo home runs by third baseman Todd Zeile and right
fielder Juan Gonzalez, respectively, and the contest became a
battle between the bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Al Levine pitched 21/3 scoreless innings, and
left-hander Greg Cadaret also retired one batter during a
near-perfect evening for the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two nights are big wins playing the team we really
need to play well against,'' Clark said. ``Those are two big wins
this time of the year, but we can't let down.''

LEWINSKY HOME TARGET OF FIRECRACKER VANDALISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN and BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Police stepped up patrols of Monica Lewinsky's
family home in Brentwood after someone pushed a firecracker through
the mail slot, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said there have been mailbox attacks elsewhere in
that neighborhood recently, but neighbors believe Thursday's act
was fallout from the Lewinsky-Clinton affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of crazy people out here. It's very sad that
people do those kinds of things. I think they should be left
alone,'' said Terry Klein, who lives a few doors away from the home
of Beverly Hills oncologist Bernard Lewinsky and Barbara Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was injured by the firecracker, which was discovered
Thursday on the wood floor of the living room after the Lewinskys
returned home. Police said it was placed Wednesday in a mail slot
on the front of the home in the 12200 block of Darlington Avenue,
said LAPD Sgt. Willie Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   The firecracker slightly damaged the living-room floor and left
debris. Barbara Lewinsky made the discovery about 9:30 a.m.
Thursday and called police.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD's bomb squad and detectives from the Criminal
Conspiracy Section responded to the home but determined the
incident appeared to be ``a random act of vandalism,'' Guerrero
said. The incident remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinskys immediately altered the metal box so it could only
be opened with a key.
</P>
<P>
   The attack focused unwanted attention from police, TV
helicopters and more than a dozen reporters on the otherwise quiet
street, as nannies strolled babies and homeowners walked their
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents decried the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think that it's unfortunate for them to go targeting
the family. It's her father's house,'' said Flora Tangen, 23, of
Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including neighbors, said they understand the public's
display of anger over the fallout from Lewinsky's affair with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I often wonder how my teen-age children will look back on
their youth, with the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the Simpson
murder case,'' said Sylvia Godwin, noting that Nicole Brown Simpson
and Ronald Goldman were slain just blocks from the Lewinsky home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the whereabouts of Lewinsky, a former White House
intern, was uncertain Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Told about the firecracker incident, David Wolpe, the rabbi at
Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, which the Lewinsky family attends,
said the topic raises powerful passions in people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex, power, the desire to know the secrets of the rich and
powerful'' are all a part of the equation, Wolpe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all would be a great morality drama, a great lesson for the
nation's soul, if it wasn't so tragic,'' he added. ``But it's
heartbreaking, it's too sad -- there is an overwhelming weight of
real grief about it.''

   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Sonny Hine got the word Thursday that his Skip
Away had been made the favorite to win the Woodward Stakes at
Belmont Park on Saturday and repeated his old theme with new
emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finally coming to understand that Skip Away is one
of the greatest horses of all time,'' said Hine, who trains the
5-year-old. ``All I tell people to do is to look at Skip Away's
record. He's never had a break. He's raced in every important race
there is, and he has always run his heart out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like him to win back-to-back Breeders' Cups, go to the
farm as the top money-earner and go with everybody knowing that he
is one of the greatest horses of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away was made the favorite in ``the race of the year'' when
only five horses were entered in the Woodward _ four superstars and
one invader from Europe. That horse is Running Stag, who drew the
rail and was absolutely the long shot at 30-1 odds. But the mighty
four, starting from the No. 2 post position, were Skip Away at 6-5,
Gentlemen at 7-2, Free House at 9-5 and Coronado's Quest at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away has won eight races in a row, won the Breeders' Cup
Classic last year when Hine risked the supplemental fee of $480,000
to enter him, now has earned a career total of $9.2 million and
needs to win just $793,456 more to pass the record total banked by
Cigar.
</P>
<P>
   On the down side: this will be Skip Away's seventh stakes race
of the year; he was forced to make a last-ditch rally to win the
Iselin Handicap by a nose at Monmouth Park last month and he has
been treated lately for sore feet and he must outrun three of the
best horses in America to keep his streak alive.
</P>
<P>
   The horse with the strongest chance of unseating Skip Away is
Free House, one of the heroes of last year's grinding Triple Crown
series and the freshest competitor in the Woodward. He is a tall,
gray powerhouse from California who built a remarkable record at 3
and has started and won twice at 4. His last race was on Aug. 15,
when he won the Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Free House made his bones as a fighter last year when he won the
Santa Anita Derby over Silver Charm, ran third in the Kentucky
Derby behind Silver Charm and Captain Bodgit, ran second in the
Preakness to Silver Charm and ran third in the Belmont behind Touch
Gold and Silver Charm. Then he won the Swaps Stakes, ran third in
the Haskell and sixth in the Super Derby _ and was finished for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   It took nine months to mend Free House's campaign wounds, which
included bleeding and the early signs of a stress fracture in a
foreleg. But he spent much of that time at the California farm of
his breeders and owners, Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan, and in
the watchful care of his trainer, Paco Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in this race because we want to see where we are with
this horse,'' Gonzalez said. ``He has had two good races, but now
he is going to face the very best.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, McCaffery and Toffan would face the same decision that
Sonny Hine faced last year: It would cost them $800,000 to run Free
House in the Breeders' Cup because neither he nor his sire was
registered when he was foaled. ``The Woodward,'' Paco Gonzalez
said, ``is our Breeders' Cup.''

REYNOLD JOHNSON, 92, PIONEER IN COMPUTER HARD DISK DRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn.)   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reynold B. Johnson, a prolific inventor best known for creating
the world's first commercial computer disk drive, died Sept. 15 in
Palo Alto, Calif. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a metastatic melanoma, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first notable invention is familiar to anyone who has
taken a standardized multiple-choice test. In 1932, when he was a
high school science teacher in Michigan, Johnson devised and built
an electromechanical device for automatically checking and grading
pencil-marked multiple-choice tests. He attempted to interest the
IBM in his invention, but with no initial success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, however, IBM reassessed Johnson's invention and hired
him as an engineer to work in its Columbia University and Endicott,
N.Y., laboratories. There, over the years, he produced hundreds of
inventions, many relating to the handling, punching and reading of
key-punch cards, then the primary means of storing computer data.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, IBM sent him to San Jose, Calif., then a small town, to
found the company's West Coast Laboratory. His charter was to
recruit a research staff and pursue advanced projects on more
efficient ways of storing and retrieving data.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Johnson and his staff of 15 focused on a rotating drum
_ a hollow cylinder with a rapidly traversing magnetic head inside
that could quickly read data from, or write data to, any track on
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   But he soon shifted to experimenting with multiple magnetic
disks, which he thought in time could be made smaller and more
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   IBM shipped Johnson's first disk drive, which was purchased by
Crown Zellerbach, in 1956. That drive, the Ramac, had 50 24-inch-
diameter double-sided aluminum magnetic disks; it weighed a ton and
stored 5 megabytes of data. Earlier this month, IBM introduced a
new drive with a one-inch diameter disk that weighs but a few
ounces and stores 340 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson retired from IBM in 1971, he had at least 90
patents to his name, but he had not finished inventing. At his own
Education Engineering Associates consulting company in Palo Alto,
he developed a microphonograph that allows children to point a
hand-held device at a picture or word in a book and hear it tell
them what it was.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher-Price's ``Talk to Me Books,'' which incorporated this
device, won a Toy of the Year award. In later years, Johnson worked
on a system for codifying Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded the National Medal of Technology in 1986 by
President Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   A Minnesota native, Johnson attended the University of
Minnesota, receiving a degree in education. He is survived by his
wife, Beatrice, of Palo Alto, and two sons, Philip and David, both
of Washington. A daughter, Karen, died in 1991. Johnson is also
survived by a sister, Signe Broberg of Minneapolis; two brothers,
Leroy, of Dassel, Minn., and Donovan, of Edina, Minn., and four
grandchildren.

SPORTS BUSINESS COLUMN: WHAT IS YANKS' VALUE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Alfred Lerner bought the Cleveland Browns for
$530 million last week, it was a record price for a sports team. A
day later, Rupert Murdoch trumped Lerner by agreeing to pay $1
billion for the Manchester United soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is renewed speculation that Cablevision Systems wants
to acquire the New York Yankees, resurrecting talks that faded
early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Yankees worth more than the Browns or Manchester United
_ even if Hideki Irabu and Andy Pettitte are in pitching slumps?
</P>
<P>
   ``The likely price is close to, at or beyond $1 billion,'' said
Neal Pilson, a sports industry consultant, citing the likelihood
that Cablevision might as well pay $1 billion to buy the team if it
has to spend the same amount to keep the Yankees' television rights
on the MSG Network after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between $500 million and $600 million,'' said Marc Ganis, a
sports finance expert with SportsCorp, who tempered his price tag
because major league baseball lacks a cap on player salaries and
because the Yankees have uncertainty about a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees lack two things the Browns, a National Football
League expansion team, have: the guarantee of $70 million a year in
national television money, about five times what baseball teams
reap, and a new stadium with 116 luxury suites that will be a
money-printing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the likelihood that the state and city will finance the
bulk of the cost of a new stadium or a fixed-up Yankee Stadium,
filled with scrumptious, revenue-enhancing features, must play into
the team's future value.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision's continued interest amply displays the intense
focus by media and entertainment companies on sports. Media outfits
such as Time Warner, News Corp., Walt Disney Co. and Comcast are
ravenous for sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of the Yankees to a buyer with media synergy, like
Cablevision, is greater than one without,'' said Paul Much, a
managing director of the Chicago investment banking firm Houlihan
Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin.
</P>
<P>
   And while there have been past offers to buy the Yankees, the
most serious have come from two media companies, Cablevision and
Paramount Communications, which owned Madison Square Garden, now
owned by Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning bid for Manchester United by Murdoch's B Sky B
satellite network may look as outlandish as the $1.58 billion he
paid for National Football League television rights for the Fox
Network in 1993. But that investment proved crucial to Fox's
viability. Murdoch owns the satellite television rights to Premier
League soccer games in England. By owning the league's most
profitable team, he has a seat at the table to renegotiate with
himself on future television deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paid a 50 percent premium on the Manchester United stock
price,'' Much said, ``but he does that to fulfill his master
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   That plan is to use sports to drive his television empire.
Murdoch did not pay $311 million for the Los Angeles Dodgers last
March because he loves the hit-and-run or W.P. Kinsella novels. He
acquired the team to secure the perpetual cable rights on Fox
Sports West, his regional sports channel in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the value of sports as an infinitely renewable resource,
with a new script every day,'' Pilson said. `` `Seinfeld' and `ER'
will wear out. The Yankees never will. In 50 years, it will still
be a storied franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   How much leverage Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan can exert
on George Steinbrenner to sell is questionable. Steinbrenner has
repeatedly said he has no desire to sell. He has loved owning the
Yankees in good times and bad times; he undoubtedly loves it even
more with a first-place, playoff-bound team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision may appear to be the only bidder for the Yankees'
cable rights because it owns the two local regional sports
channels, Fox Sports New York and MSG, which vied for the deal that
MSG won in 1988. Then Cablevision bought the Garden and competition
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dolan can't push George too far,'' Pilson said. ``It wouldn't
take much for George to to go Time Warner or Disney to launch a
regional sports channel with the Yankees. That's the tightrope
Chuck Dolan has to navigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although an extraordinary bid by Cablevision could tempt
Steinbrenner to sell, why shouldn't he play to Cablevision's
buyer's ardor by selling the company a minority stake that could
painlessly help finance a new stadium?
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium would push the Yankees' value higher, perhaps by
as much as the size of Cablevision's investment. Then, who knows?
Sell the public stock in the team. What fan wouldn't want a piece
of the Yankees? That's the philosophy behind teams like the Boston
Celtics and Cleveland Indians going public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they sold shares to the public, then you might see a
billion-dollar value of the team,'' Ganis said. ``The Yankees have
a lot of vanity value.''

YANKEES SHUT OUT DEVIL RAYS, 4-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ A handful of players checked on Joe Torre
in his office on Thursday afternoon, under supposedly innocent
pretenses. Tino Martinez dropped off some cigars, Derek Jeter
grinned his funny grin and called his manager Mr. Torre, and Paul
O'Neill stopped to say hi.
</P>
<P>
   Torre presumed they all made conversation to gauge his mood the
day after he blistered the Yankees in a team meeting for their
recent effort. If any feelings of disgust lingered in the manager,
however, they were chased away by a sharp, 4-0 shutout of Tampa
Bay. Hideki Irabu had to pitch well to keep alive his chances of
being part of the playoff roster, and he did so, allowing two
infield hits in eight innings. The Yankees are 105-46.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played tonight like we're used to playing,''Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   All the regulars were back in the lineup, and the Yankees had
runners on base in every inning, collecting 16 hits. Jorge Posada
slugged a two-run home run in the sixth inning, his 17th homer of
the year, and Bernie Williams banged his 26th home run in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But Irabu set the tone _ or, if you will, he reset the tone _
for a team that had lost 16 of its last 28 games coming into
Thursday night's game. Irabu had lost his last four decisions,
allowing 30 runs in 201/3 innings dating to Aug. 15; another poor
outing would have probably meant he would be watching the playoffs
from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, however, Irabu was able to use mechanical adjustments
that he had successfully implemented in the bullpen. He wanted more
leg drive, to pitch on an aggressive downward plane, and he had
that. He wanted a better breaking ball, and he had that. He wanted
to throw with confidence, and he attacked the Tampa Bay hitters all
evening with fastballs, inside and outside, 90 to 93 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   When Irabu was at his worst earlier this month, Posada said, he
pitched at the same elevation, his fastball, split-fingered
fastball and curveball all crossing the plate thigh high, making it
easy for hitters to look for pitches in one area. On Thursday
night, he went up and down in the strike zone, like an elevator
operator. ``I knew I was doing badly,'' Irabu said, through
interpreter George Rose, ``and I wanted to get better as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's only two hits were flukes. Aaron Ledesma hit a slow
roller to the left side of the infield in the second inning; third
baseman Scott Brosius charged and tried bare-handing the ball and
throwing in one motion, but he couldn't get a grip. The next
inning, Randy Winn bunted to the third-base side, and Brosius
charged again; his former manager, Art Howe, says Brosius makes
this play better than anyone in baseball. But the ball bounced out
of Brosius's hand. Two do-or-die plays, two infield hits. ``We
didn't hit many balls hard,'' said Larry Rothschild, the Tampa Bay
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``He maintained his velocity the whole game and he
got his curveball over. He had the best command he's had all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu struck out five and walked two, his confidence growing
from inning to inning, in the mind of pitching coach Mel
Stottlemyre. When Irabu struggles, he can be restless on the bench
in between innings, his dissatisfaction apparent in his body
language. But on Thursday night, Stottlemyre said, Irabu rested
quietly between innings; only once did Stottlemyre need to call
Rose to discuss a pitching adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel I needed to be confident,'' Irabu said. ``If I
don't have confidence, I'm not going to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won't make up their playoff roster until next week,
and if the votes were tabulated today, Irabu would probably still
not be in the rotation and might not even be part of the 25-man
roster. But he will pitch at least once more during the regular
season and, with another strong outing, could create a dilemma for
Torre and Stottlemyre. If Irabu is pitching well, he can dominate
anybody, and right now, Andy Pettitte is having trouble against
everybody; on the other hand, Irabu has no playoff experience, and
Torre will always remember Pettitte's 1-0 victory in the 1996 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which ever we use him,'' Torre said, referring to Irabu, ``an
outing like tonight's will only help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stottlemyre: ``We want them to make it tough for us to
decide. We want to see it again in his next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada has been a direct and honest pundit on the subject of
Irabu the whole year, praising him when he was throwing well early,
criticizing him when he floundered. Posada began to get a good
feeling about Irabu last Friday, after Toronto's Roger Clemens
drilled Scott Brosius with a fastball. Irabu immediately answered,
beanball for beanball, bouncing a fastball off the first batter he
faced the next inning. ``He showed me a lot there,'' Posada said.
``He showed me a lot of heart and poise.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu has got to show it again, if he wants to wear pinstripes
in October.

EUROPEANS TURN UP HEAT IN QUEST FOR SOLHEIM CUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Talking about the pressure of the Solheim Cup,
which begins Friday morning, Laura Davies admitted she was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it fun,'' said Davies, the long hitter from
England who will be a key member of the European team. ``You're
scared of losing the point for your team and scared of messing up.
That's the thing that gets you going. That fear inspires you to
play better.''
</P>
<P>
   The nerves, the anticipation and the heated competition are part
of what has made the Solheim Cup one of the most anticipated events
in women's golf. It takes place every two years, and this year's
match between the United States and Europe has all the ingredients
to be memorable.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has won three of the four Solheim Cups,
including a 17-11 victory in 1996, this weekend's match is
difficult to call. Pia Nilsson, Europe's captain, said this is the
best European team ever assembled, featuring Annika Sorenstam,
perhaps the world's top female player, and with strong support from
Liselotte Neumann and Davies.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe posing a serious threat, the intensity between the
two teams has grown, just as the men's Ryder Cup became more
intense during the 1980s, when Europe began to field teams that
were capable of beating the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rivalry is getting worse and worse each and every
event,'' Catrin Nilsmark of Sweden said. ``It's fantastic. I want
this to be a good cup, to raise women's golf to higher levels.''
</P>
<P>
   But it will be hard for Europe to win unless Sorenstam plays
well. Look for Nilsson to rely heavily on Sorenstam, Davies and
Neumann, who all played the maximum five matches in 1996. By
contrast, Kelly Robbins was the only United States team member who
played five matches in '96. With more depth on her team, the
American captain, Judy Rankin, may have the luxury of keeping her
players fresher for Sunday's singles matches, where the outcome
will be decided.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam sounded ready for the challenge of playing five
matches in three days at the Muirfield Village course. The first
two days consist of four alternate-shot matches in the morning and
four best-ball matches in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give this team as many points as I can,'' said
Sorenstam, who has a 4-1-2 Solheim Cup record. ``I know I'm
probably going to play all five matches, which gives me an
opportunity to collect a lot of points.''
</P>
<P>
   Other subplots will make this competition interesting. Charlotta
Sorenstam, Annika's sister, qualified for Europe's team for the
first time this year, but the Sorenstams have a frigid relationship
and Nilsson is expected to avoid pairing them.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson left herself open to criticism by selecting Swedes with
four of her five captain's picks. Six of Europe's 12 players are
from Sweden, but Europe's players said the team was not divided
between Swedish and non-Swedish factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has got the same shirt that says Europe on it,''
Charlotta Sorenstam said. ``We're a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rankin has her concerns as well. Tammie Green, a key player for
the United States, is expecting a baby Dec. 23. Rankin has said
that Green will not play two matches in the same day, but after
Thursday's practice round, Green said she felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a physical golf course and I do notice my feet hurting
a little bit at the end of 18,'' said Green, whose doctor will be
in the gallery. ``Other than that, I'm striking the ball well and
everything seems like it's all natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's morning matches may set the tone for the weekend. If
either team loses three or four matches in the morning, the
pressure will build immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson made a potentially risky decision, pairing Davies with
Trish Johnson on Friday morning, because Johnson has been bothered
by a neck injury. But after watching her Thursday, Nilsson decided
Johnson was ready.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 players sense that their sport is on an upswing, and a
close match with a dramatic finish would only add to that momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're on that peak,'' Rosie Jones of the United
States said. ``It just feels like there is a lot more energy. I was
at the first Solheim in '90, and there has already been more people
than there were at that one. So we've come a long way baby.'' &QL;

TYSON PESSIMISTIC AS LICENSE HEARING LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Like a politician who is trailing in a campaign a
few days before an election, Mike Tyson made a public appearance at
a luncheon to honor Nevada Gov. Robert Miller and Dr. Elias Ghanem,
the chairman of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, at Caesars
Palace on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson will appear before the commission Saturday in a public
hearing on his application for the reinstatement of his boxing
license. All the members except Luther Mack were present at the
luncheon. But while Tyson shook hands with the commissioners and
took pictures and signed autographs for fans, he was not optimistic
about his chances to regain his license.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very encouraged,'' Tyson said when asked whether he
thought he would be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson refused to discuss the matter in depth. Two commissioners,
Dr. James Nave and Glen Carano, also refused to discuss it. Nave
said he ``never gave it a thought'' that Tyson appeared at the
luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Nave also said he would question Tyson extensively about an Aug.
31 incident in Gaithersburg, Md., in which two men said Tyson
assaulted them after a minor traffic accident. Tyson has been
charged with two counts of misdemeanor assault, and Nave said the
commission hearing will be very lengthy.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's license was revoked on July 9, 1997, after he bit
Evander Holyfield on both ears during a heavyweight championship
fight in Las Vegas on June 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, said Tyson did not assault the
two men, aged 50 and 62, after the accident. And the misdemeanor
charges, Finkel said, should have no bearing on the ex-heavyweight
champion's chances of getting his license back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, it's my understanding that you're innocent until
you're proven guilty,'' Finkel said. ``If that was a factor for

   Finkel said Tyson will be represented at the hearing by his two
California lawyers _ John Branca and Dale Kisella _ who are
handling his lawsuits against the promoter Don King and his
co-managers, Rory Holloway and John Horne. Finkel also said Tyson
will not use as many character witnesses as he did in New Jersey,
where he first sought reinstatement before withdrawing his
application. Finkel said Tyson was having financial difficulties,
because he has not been able to fight in a year. Finkel estimated
that Tyson has lost between $25 million and $50 million since the
revocation.

   In August the Internal Revenue Service placed a $6.3 million
lien against Tyson's 61-room mansion in Farmington, Conn. The
mansion has been for sale for $22 million for more than a year.
Tyson bought it for $2.7 million in 1996. Local realtors estimate
it is worth $4.3 million.  &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abandoning any pretense of bipartisanship, the
House Judiciary Committee spent Thursday wrangling over whether to
release immediately a videotape of President Clinton's grand jury
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky case and discussing how to edit
reams of pages delivered by the Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The panel adjourned late Thursday without taking a vote on
releasing the tape, which put off the anticipated disclosure of the
president's testimony on Friday. Now, on Friday, the panel is
expected to approve making the videotape public. The tape could be
released as early as Saturday, once aides copy and prepare
documents for distribution.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape of the president's deposition in the Paula Jones
case in January, in which his testimony about Ms. Lewinsky has
become the foundation for Starr's central charges of perjury, may
also be released. The judge in the Jones case granted an unusual
request made this week by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to release that videotape.
</P>
<P>
   The daylong committee meeting was mired in feuding, as
Republicans aggressively pursued procedures that would unseal
mounds of documents that support the impeachment report by the
independent counsel. In a series of 11 votes, Democrats on the
panel pushed unsuccessfully for a delay in releasing both the
videotape and the 2,000-page appendix of information attached to
Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that they should take the time to review all the
materials before releasing any portion, noting that they still have
until Sept. 28 to meet the deadline set by the House to complete a
review of the material. In some cases, they argued that deletions
should be made so that graphic material would never be released.
The Democrats expressed grave concern at the meeting about making
the information public piecemeal and without deletions, calling the
strategy politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, issued a statement
Thursday in which he said he had demanded that Starr destroy the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony. Its continued
existence, he said, ``was to insure its public release and
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   In a seething response Thursday night, Starr said the
independent counsel's office considered the videotaped testimony to
be ``evidence of a crime.'' The prosecutor is contending that
Clinton lied to the grand jury as well as in his Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape does not cast Clinton in a flattering light,
depicting him as occasionally impatient, and quibbling in his
discussion of his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. Democrats said an
edited transcript of the testimony would have sufficed.
</P>
<P>
   One official familiar with the material and the proceedings said
the videotape showed Clinton repeatedly relying on legalisms and a
narrow definition of sexual relations. He also refused to answer a
series of more prying questions about the sexual nature of the
affair, the official said. Surprisingly, many of the toughest
questions were asked by grand jurors and not prosecutors, the
person added.
</P>
<P>
   While much attention has focused on disputes over the
president's videotaped testimony, the panel spent much of the day
arguing about the supporting documents that Starr sent to Congress
to bolster his case that the president's actions may be cause for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The panel agreed on more than 100 separate edits of the report's
2,000- page appendix, which includes background information, maps
of the West Wing, a table of Ms. Lewinsky's White House visits and
a table of the contacts between the two of them. It also contains
lengthy footnotes and legal references.
</P>
<P>
   The protracted debates mainly involved squabbles over eight
passages containing the most sexually explosive material, officials
familiar with the proceedings said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting since Starr delivered his report to
Congress on Sept. 9, the panel's Republicans and Democrats bickered
about the merits of releasing the videotape and zeroed in on the
most sensitive sexual material. They debated, among other things,
the relevance of mentioning sexual props. Both sides said they took
decency into consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee aides have spent days poring over documents
in boxes delivered by Starr but Thursday's debate centered only on
the contents of one box, indicating that the process will be long
and slow. They have yet to take up the issue of whether to release
the transcripts of testimony given by Ms. Lewinsky and other
central figures, including Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, his
friend Vernon Jordan Jr. and Secret Service officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a debate that boomeranged between civility and partisanship,
members accused each other of political motives and questioned each
other's sincerity in pursuing the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let the public join in the decision making
process,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., a committee member,
who argued that the committee is searching for a balance between
privacy and decency concerns and the public's right to know. ``The
very fact today is balance. It must be presented in a balanced
fashion so the American people can make their own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's argument was echoed throughout the day by other
Republicans on the panel, who argued that the public should make
its own determination based on the same evidence handed to
Congress. And they accused Democrats of putting Clinton's concerns
ahead of the country's. The president's testimony, they said, is
vital to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats insisted, as they have all week, that hasty disclosure
of the materials is a strategy that will humiliate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans are trying to do is get the bad stuff out
about the president, as much as they can, as fast as they can,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a panel member. Frank added,
``They're frustrated that the president's official standing is as
high as it is, and they're trying to tear it down.''
</P>
<P>
   But some members said the party-line friction in the panel was
predictable. Last week, 11 of the Democrats on the panel voted
against a House-passed resolution to release Starr's report and
many of its accompanying documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe some Democrats would like to thwart the procedures
established under the resolution,'' said Rep. Charles Canady,
R-Fla., a member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that the partisan battle threatened to intensify, the
panel's ranking Democrat, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, filed
a letter of protest Thursday with Hyde, over the chairman's request
for the Jones tape without consulting Democrats. ``I have serious
concerns regarding the propriety of your seeking the release of a
videotaped deposition in a private civil case that has now been
dismissed,'' Conyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's meeting also came at a time of ill will between the
parties over an online magazine's disclosure that Hyde had
conducted an extramarital affair 30 years ago. Calling this
disclosure and a few others a smear campaign of intimidation,
Republican leaders blamed the president's allies and asked that the
FBI to look into it. The White House has denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans and Democrats continued to face divisions
within their own ranks about release of the material.
</P>
<P>
   An opening salvo in the Judiciary Committee meeting came when
Democrats asked that the gathering be held in public and not under
the cloak of secrecy. The motion was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have decided that the appropriate way to fight for
openness is in total secrecy,'' Frank said during one of the
committee's sporadic breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats complained that they had not had enough time to
sift through the material and the proposed redactions.
</P>
<P>
   But in an attempt to deflect charges of partisanship, Hyde
allowed members to speak on and on at the debate. After the
meeting, the chairman said: ``There's been lot's of debate. It's
been productive debate, not frivolous debate.'' He added, ``It gets
passionate at times, interesting at times.''

MONEY-WIRING COMPANIES OVERCHARGING MEXICANS, LAWSUITS SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Money-wiring service companies are cheating
Mexican customers by secretly pocketing commissions when converting
dollars to pesos, said a lawyer who has filed two class-action
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits, filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, name
Western Union Financial Services Inc. and MoneyGram Payment Systems
Inc. as two of a group of companies that allegedly make undisclosed
profits from clients who wire money to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits claim the companies discriminate against Mexicans
by charging fees three times higher than rates charged to
Canadians. They also claim that the companies do not disclose the
currency exchange rate to their customers and make profits as high
as 20 percent from unsuspecting clients, attorney Fred Kumetz said
during a news conference at the Mexican Consulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are abusing that relationship with their
customers,'' Kumetz said. ``You can't manipulate that money or make
a profit unless you get permission from the beneficiary.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Grad, an attorney for Western Union Financial Services
Inc., would not comment on the case Thursday. Cathy Rebuffoni, a
spokeswoman for Travelers Express, a Minneapolis-based company that
owns MoneyGram, called the lawsuits groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``MoneyGram is fully in compliance with the rules and
regulations regarding disclosure,'' Rebuffoni said. ``MoneyGram
forms are printed in English and Spanish, and customers find
MoneyGram a safe form to send money to Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The same two lawsuits were filed in federal court in November
but were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Perez, a suburban Panorama City resident who is not part
of the lawsuit, said he stopped using Western Union's services when
he found a friend who could deliver his money and letters
personally to Mexico for cheaper rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you do? What these companies charge is a lot,'' Perez
said in Spanish as he stood outside a Western Union office in
Panorama City, where he paid bills. ``People will charge a lot no
matter where you go.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuits, one of the plaintiffs tried to send
$250 to Mexico through Western Union, but his relatives only
received $225. Western Union told the plaintiff his relatives would
receive 1,750 pesos, when they should have received about 1,937
pesos at the exchange rate of 7.75 pesos per dollar, Kumetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Kumetz claims that Western Union pocketed the difference in
addition to the $12 fee it normally charges customers for wiring
money electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Through Western Union and MoneyGram, Mexican customers send
about $1 billion a year from the United States to Mexico, with
Western Union handling about two-thirds of that business, Kumetz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of what he described as illegal practices, Kumetz
estimates that about $100 million a year doesn't reach its intended
recipients in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law requires them to transmit the money or its equivalent.
They cannot take a secret profit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Consulate has received many complaints since 1995
from Mexicans living in Los Angeles about high fees paid to send
money to their homeland, said Mexican Consul General Jose Angel
Pescador Osuna.
</P>
<P>
   ``What worries me most is that they charge Mexicans so much when
they charge Canadians a third the amount. Why?'' Pescador said.
</P>
<P>
   The consul general asked that companies pay the best exchange
rate, provide instructions and information clearly and inform
customers of the exchange rate before handing over their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a profitable business for the companies, but it has a
negative impact on those who send money,'' Pescador said. ``It
takes a lot of effort for our people to earn their money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rebuffoni said the exchange rate is out of the company's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foreign exchange rate is something we don't control,'' she
said. ``I think they are trying to make a case over something we
have no control over.''

NORTHERN ARIZONA OFFERS ACID TEST FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ The way to get respect in the Big Sky
Conference, not to mention Division I-AA, is to win at the Walkup
Skydome in Flagstaff, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Since his days as defensive coordinator at Cal State Northridge,
Ron Ponciano has known this.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as first-year coach of the Matadors, Ponciano has the
opportunity to jump into prominence, not to mention grab a
monumental first win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern Arizona has been our measuring stick here,'' Ponciano
said. ``Three years ago, they just embarrassed us. They could have
possibly beaten us 90-0 (instead of 68-7). Two years ago, we went
up there ... and had a chance to beat them (but lost 32-14). And
last year, we beat them here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a big step for us to go up there and get a victory
because not many people go up there and get a victory in that
dome.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the Lumberjacks are 21-5 at the dome, which includes
a 12-3 mark in the Big Sky. But a win would also aid CSUN greatly
in its attempt to rise beyond the middle of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would a win Saturday against No. 13 NAU (2-0) mark the
highest-ranked opponent CSUN (0-1) has beaten, but it would also
mark the first time CSUN would win at NAU in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known NAU to be at the top of the conference, so
if you play NAU, Montana or Eastern Washington, that's how you
measure yourself,'' CSUN senior safety Vito Clemente said.
``They've been so dominant in the league, and they've been
respected. We're trying to get respect for our program, and the way
you do that is by beating teams that have respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup QB to start: The left, non-throwing elbow of NAU
quarterback Travis Brown hasn't responded to treatment in the way
the Lumberjacks coaching staff hoped, so word out of Flagstaff on
Thursday was that he would begin the day on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, sophomore Clay Brown, also the punter, will make his
second career start. This season he's completed 5 of 7 passes for
115 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of get a little bit more excited knowing he's going
to be out there and he's going to be a little unsure of himself,''
Clemente said. ``If we don't give him any confidence early we're
going to take him out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, one player that impressed the CSUN coaching staff on film
won't be in the NAU lineup. Tight end Nate Foreman, a transfer from
Brigham Young, was suspended prior to last weekend's game against
Southwest Texas State for violating team rules. It's questionable
whether he'll return to NAU any time this season, school officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another transfer: J.T. Stone played at Santa Barbara City
College, went on to Division II West Texas A&AMP;M, and has now landed
at CSUN. Stone, a quarterback, has a nice touch and a strong arm
but is ineligible this season since he transferred up a level to
Division I-AA. He was cleared to practice earlier in the week but
won't make any road trips. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

BROWN HURT BUT ROOKIES IMPRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no shortage of news at Spaulding Field
on Thursday as the Bruins zipped through a light workout in
preparation for Saturday's game at Houston.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 tailback Keith Brown did not practice (turf toe) and will
be evaluated this morning. If he can't play, senior walk-on Mark
Reynosa will travel. And with or without Brown, true freshman
DeShaun Foster will play second string, behind starter Jermaine
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Brown couldn't run (Thursday), it's likely DeShaun will be
the backup,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile two rookie defenders, nose guard Ken Kocher and
linebacker Robert Thomas, continue to impress despite injuries.
Kocher is recovering from a sprained ankle; Thomas has a broken
right hand that requires a cumbersome cast.
</P>
<P>
   Both are expected to play significantly this weekend (``They're
improving every day,'' Toledo said) but manpower concerns make
Kocher's progress essential to UCLA's long-term success.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, defensive line is the Bruins' most troublesome
position. One end, Pete Holland, plays hard but is limited
athletically. The other, Kenyon Coleman, is massive and gifted but
lacks intensity. Nose guard Micah Webb did not record a single
tackle against Texas, not even an assist.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kocher) is a big, strong guy. He's not as experienced as the
others, but there's no question he's a talented guy,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher, 6-foot-4 and 292 pounds, sprained his right ankle on the
first day of contact and missed the rest of training camp. He
returned in time to play 10 snaps against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has felt a lot better the last couple days,'' he said.
``The day off (Sunday) really helped. I'm almost 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   However, outside linebacker Michael Wiley (sprained back) is
not. Santi Hall will start in Wiley's place.
</P>
<P>
   Backfield bits: Fullback Craig Walendy, who missed four weeks
from an allergic reaction to bug bites, participated in contact
drills this week but is not expected to play extensively. Durell
Price, impressive against Texas, will make his second career start.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary situation: Ryan Roques apparently was going to usurp
Damian Allen as the backup cornerback when Allen quit the team
Monday to concentrate on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, a change was about ready to take place
and everybody knew it,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Whitfield will start at free safety over Jason Stephens. In
passing situations, however, Whitfield may slide to nickel back
(the third cornerback) while Stephens plays free safety.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle tidbits: Tackle Josh Webb, who switched from defense to
offense two weeks ago, has progressed quickly and will play as much
as possible to speed his transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get him in early if we can,'' Toledo said. ``He's
learning it well. He'll spell (starter) Brian Polak. It's hard to
go the whole game if you're 325 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Cougar concerns: Houston's starting cornerbacks, Kenny Hill and
William Fields, are 5-9 and 5-8, respectively. The free safety,
David Williams, also is 5-9. The Bruins will try to exploit their
size advantage with 6-5 split end Brian Poli-Dixon and 6-4 flanker
Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   On the edge: Two true freshmen are straddling the fine line
between playing and redshirting: guard Mike Saffer and defensive
tackle Anthony Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saffer's on the bubble; I don't know what will happen,''
Toledo said. ``(Fletcher) is real close. We'd like to save him a
year if we can with (senior defensive linemen) Vae Tate and Jayson
Brown. Why play a freshman if the seniors can be the backups?''
</P>
<P>
   Back to work: Freshman cornerback Lovell Houston practiced this
week after missing a month with a strained quadricep muscle. He's
so far behind schematically that redshirting seems the most-likely
path, unless a spate of injuries demand otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play, it's not that big a deal to me,'' Houston
said. ``Whatever's best for the team.''

LUNGREN CALLS ON CLINTON TO RESIGN PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Saying President Clinton has brought disrepute on
the presidency and embarrassed the country, California Attorney
General Dan Lungren said he believes the president should resign.
</P>
<P>
   In his most detailed remarks to date, Lungren -- the Republican
candidate for governor in the Nov. 3 election -- used a speech
Thursday before the Greater Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce to
criticize Clinton and his record. At a news conference afterward,
he said the president should quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be good for the president to step down,''
Lungren said. ``I think he has undermined his own presidency. I
think he undermined the institution of the presidency itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not partisan. That's not hitting someone when they're
down. This is about what's in the best interests of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren said he doesn't believe Clinton can be effective in his
relationship with Congress or in foreign affairs as long as he
remains embroiled in the scandal involving former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Lungren said he questioned his opponent,
Democrat Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, for his scheduled appearance at
fund-raisers for Democrats with the president next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not questioning his character, just his judgment,''
Lungren said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Davis said the lieutenant governor has not formally
committed to appearing with Clinton, but will do so if his schedule
permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no problems in appearing with the president,'' said
spokesman Michael Bustamante. ``(Davis) has made it clear that what
the president did was wrong and indefensible and he should be
punished, but that it's up to the Congress of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said Davis also continues to appreciate what Clinton
has done for California during his years as president.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several weeks and as a major part of his campaign,
Lungren has been hitting at the ``character issue'' concerning
public officials.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to the 40 members of the chamber gathered at the
downtown Marriott Hotel, Lungren again stressed the issue, asking
what the legacy of the present generation would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have had three great generations in our history,''
Lungren said. ``The Founding Fathers, those from the Civil War era,
and our parents, who came out of the Depression and World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legacy of my generation is Bill Clinton, and I don't think
that's the legacy my generation wants to leave.''

AS ERSTAD FALTERS, ANGELS HAMSTRUNG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Before Thursday's game against the Texas
Rangers, his first start since Sept. 2, the Angels' Darin Erstad
could joke about his strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' he said, ``I'm scoring from second
on a base hit, and I'm legging doubles into triples.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, however, didn't make it out of the first inning _ and
barely made it out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the game, he ripped the first pitch into the
left-center field gap. But Erstad hobbled to first and stayed there
with a single.
</P>
<P>
   After Randy Velarde walked, moving Erstad to second, manager
Terry Collins and third-base coach Larry Bowa consulted with
Erstad, then took him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running pretty decent, but the first step out of the
box, that's where you build into your speed, and that's what I'm
having problems with,'' he said. ``I thought I was good enough to
run around the bases tonight. Obviously, that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said it would be a ``best-case scenario'' for Erstad to
miss this weekend's series with Seattle at Anaheim and be ready for
Texas on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another down: Catcher Phil Nevin was on crutches after the game,
his left ankle wrapped. He sprained the ankle in the first inning
when Will Clark slid into him on a play at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin said he felt he would be able to play in spite of the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Quick assimilation: It hasn't taken long for Gregg Jefferies to
realize he fits in with the Angels. He was acquired Aug. 28 in a
trade with the Philadelphia Phillies and already performs like most
everybody else in an Angels uniform _ he plays hard, he plays hurt
and he doesn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why he wants to come back to play for the Angels next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great group,'' said Jefferies, who is hitting .362 (21
for 58) in 14 games for the Angels. ``As long as you want to win, I
don't care if you come to the park with a dress on; what you do off
the field doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the Angels want him back. Jefferies'
contract includes a 1999 club option for $6 million, a steep price
for a 31-year-old player who might not have a place to play if Tim
Salmon is healthy enough to return to the outfield next season.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Troy Glaus got his first start in three games. ``I
thought, `This guy's the future. This is a chance to make him a
better player,''' Collins said of Glaus, who had been struggling at
the plate. ``This is the time of year you make adjustments at-bat
after at-bat.'' ... Pitcher Ken Hill will make his scheduled start
tonight despite an arthritic condition in his right elbow. Hill
will pitch only from the stretch position to help alleviate the
pain ... Omar Olivares will start Sunday's game against Seattle in
place of Jeff Juden.

VACHON STILL OUT IN THE COLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Kings executive Rogie Vachon was in
his office Wednesday when media-relations director Mike Altieri
delivered the news he'd been hoping not to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Vachon _ a former star goalie with the Kings and
three other NHL teams _ had been denied entrance to the Hockey Hall
of Fame, this time in his final year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Vachon now must wait to be elected in the
veterans category after he's been retired for 25 years. Vachon,
seventh in NHL history with 355 victories, retired during the
1981-82 season after a 16-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disappointing,'' Vachon said Thursday. ``What
can you say? You're at the mercy of people voting, and somebody
obviously didn't think I did enough to make it. For an athlete,
making the Hall of Fame is icing on the cake. But, hey, life goes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Players elected Wednesday were former Quebec Nordiques Peter
Stastny and Michel Goulet, and the late Roy Conacher, who played
for four teams in the 1930s, '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty proud of what we accomplished here in the 1970s,''
Vachon said. ``We put hockey on the map. Of course, Wayne (Gretzky)
brought it to a different level. But I was proud to be a part of
that era.''
</P>
<P>
   On the outs: As their would-be teammates file onto the ice for
scrimmages each morning, three unsigned Kings quietly exit the
Iceoplex in North Hills after holding their own workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake, Matt Johnson and Jamie Storr can only guess how much
longer they will remain unsigned and out of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen today, it could happen in a week, it could
happen in two months,'' said Blake, voted the NHL's top defenseman
last season. ``I'm going to prepare the way I have to. I'm not
going to let this contract dispute get in my head and throw me off.
I'm going to stay in shape and do what I have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said, ``We've talked a bit. I'm just kind of digesting
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr, who would be battling No.1 goalie Stephane Fiset for
playing time if he was in camp, sounded a bit more upbeat when
asked when he thought he'd be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a huge gap,'' Storr said. ``It never has been.
Hopefully we can reach an agreement in the next couple of days or a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor, however, did not sound as
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say we're close,'' Taylor said. ``But we've had
discussions and we'll continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Contracts, Taylor added, are not the only thing he's focusing on
at the moment. With the Kings expected to send several prospects
back to their junior teams today, a sizable portion of Taylor's
attention is on player evaluation. The Kings also may assign at
least one player today to their IHL affiliate, the Long Beach Ice
Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth unsigned player, defenseman Aki Berg, has returned to
his native Finland and may be close to signing with a team in
Finland or Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Blast from the past: Also skating at Iceoplex has been
unrestricted free agent Marty McSorley, a two-time former King.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to compete and get a fair contract,'' said
McSorley, who earned $1.3 million last year with San Jose. ``I'm
not looking to break the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   McSorley, 35, would not say which teams have shown interest in
signing him, but Edmonton and Toronto reportedly are strong
contenders for his services.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative roster: The Kings open exhibition play with games
Saturday and Sunday in Las Vegas against Colorado. Manny Legace is
expected to start in goal Saturday, and the Kings will probably
take a look at some or all of these prospects: defensemen Sean
Blanchard and Peter Hogan, and forwards Olli Jokinen, Matt Zultek,
Scott Barney, Josh Green and Pavel Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   The games in Las Vegas will be played with two referees, as will
20 of the Kings' 82 regular-season games. Such veterans as
defensemen Mattias Norstrom and Sean O'Donnell and forwards Glen
Murray, Yanic Perreault and Ray Ferraro also are expected to play
Saturday.

CONFUSED BY SPORTS STATS? JOIN THE CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As Mariner fans know, Ken Griffey Jr. joined the 50/20
club this week, when he stole his 20th base to go with 53 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez is on the verge of the 40/40 club, needing one
more homer to go with his 43 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   What I wasn't sure about was when these things became clubs. Is
there an initiation ritual? A secret handshake? A cover charge? Do
the dancers have to stay a minimum distance from the customer?
</P>
<P>
   And who decides what constitutes a club?
</P>
<P>
   An exhaustive P-I search of sports rulebooks discloses no
requirements or policies regarding the creation of these clubs.
Apparently there is no rule against putting together any two stats
to make a club.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, we have discovered numerous clubs worthy of
mention:
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez and the 30/:30 club: The Mariner designated
hitter needs two home runs for a career-high 30, and needed 30
seconds to leg out Thursday's triple against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis and the 20/40 club: The Mariner third baseman has 20
home runs and needs just six more errors to reach 40, an amazing
feat considering the eye-hand coordination necessary for both
skills. How is it possible to have it for the top of an inning and
lose it in the bottom?
</P>
<P>
   Mariner management and the 1/0 club: First baseman David Segui
and the number of other new players acquired in the offseason or
from the farm club who made significant contributions to the team
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Ayala and the 10/10 club: 10 losses and 10 blown saves is
a difficult feat because it takes an unusually foolish team to keep
putting him out on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson and the 10/10 club: After 10 losses with the
Mariners, Johnson needs two more wins to get 10 for Houston in less
than two months, providing abysmal evidence for the he's-washed-up
cabal in the Mariner ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Piniella and the 1/300 club: He's about a half-dozen
pitchers short of becoming the first major league manager to go
through what seems like 300 pitchers in his tenure as Mariner
manager, and still doesn't have a complete starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   George Karl and the $5 million/2 club: By the end of the NBA
season _ should one occur _ Karl will join an NBA elite of Rick
Pitino, John Calipari and Larry Brown, who will earn top coaching
salaries but fail to get beyond the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp and the 0/6 club: With no marriages and six kids, the
ex-Sonic takes a big lead in the Reckless Paternity League,
although competition is heavy and the game is early.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wrenn and the 10/4 club: In 10 months, the O'Dea High
School basketball star will have committed to four educational
institutions: The University of Washington, two East Coast prep
schools and to the University of Connecticut. He is ahead of the
pace of former Husky running back Corey Dillon, who nodded at
admissions clerks at a half-dozen or so schools before graduating
to the NFL College of Cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer and the 1,000/3 club:
Number of tackles the Buckeye All-American needs to make everyone
forget the three classes he passed to stay eligible: Golf, music
and AIDS awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Washington-BYU game and the 17/3 club: Number of syllables when
Washington defensive tackle Toalei Mulitauaopele tackles Brigham
Young starting tight end Tevita Ofahengaue on Saturday, and number
of play-by-play broadcasters at Husky Stadium whose tongues will
explode in the collision.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks and the 4/16 club: Number of games the Seahawks play
against the NFC East this year, and number of games the Seahawks
would win if they could play all games against NFC East opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mirer and the 27/0 club: Number of NFL teams yet to
discover the former Seahawk quarterback has zero game.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and the $1.1 billion/2 club: We are the lone New
Testament member of this exclusive list, having dedicated about
$1.4 billion, including interest payments as well as principal, in
public tax money over 20 years for two sports stadiums. The Old
Testament club included Babylon, Sodom and Gomorrah.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle and the $1.1 billion/2012 club: Yet another exclusive
club the city can belong to if it successfully bids for the 2012
Olympics, whereupon it likely will be asked to cough up for
facilities and infrastructure at least as much as was offered for
the pro sports digs.

GRIFFEY, MOYER TWO-TIME ATHLETICS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Their season was officially stamped
``disappointing'' months ago, so for the Mariners, days like
Thursday would seem to be about numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The M's and left-hander Jamie Moyer beat the Oakland Athletics
8-0 to complete a two-game sweep in front of 11,707 fans at the
Oakland Coliseum. The wins over the A's followed a Twin killing in
Minnesota, and gave the Mariners victories in six of their past
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest development Thursday could be the status of second
baseman Carlos Guillen, who will miss the rest of the season after
injuring his left knee on a diving catch in the second inning.
Guillen will have a magnetic resonance imaging test in Seattle
Friday to determine the extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   The game itself, though, came down to these figures:
</P>
<P>
   --8: That was how many pitches it took Oakland knuckleballer Tom
Candiotti to run up a 3-0 deficit in the first inning. Guillen and
Alex Rodriguez led off with singles, bringing Ken Griffey Jr. to
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   --53: That's how many homers Griffey has after rifling
Candiotti's second pitch over the fence in right field, giving the
M's a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knuckleball,'' the AL home run leader said with a shrug.
``Just swing and if it hits the bat, it hits it, and if it doesn't,
go back to the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Candiotti went to the bench for good after five innings, with
the Mariners up 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Doubles by Edgar Martinez and Shane Monahan contributed to a
three-run rally in the fourth, and the first of two RBIs from Raul
Ibanez brought in a single run in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   --362: Rodriguez went homerless for his ninth game in a row, and
remains at 39 homers as he tries to become the third player ever to
hit 40 homers and steal 40 bases in the same season. He hit a
362-foot fly to lead off the fifth, but the ball hit high off the
17-foot fence and Rodriguez settled for a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It missed by inches,'' said A's left fielder Rickey Henderson,
who planted himself under the ball. ``It hit the numbers (on the
362-foot sign) up there, so it was just the luck of the draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Rodriguez: ``I thought I missed it big-time. I'm surprised
it went that far.''
</P>
<P>
   --0: Moyer has allowed zero runs and zero walks in two
complete-game shutouts of the A's this year. He threw a
three-hitter on June 12 and allowed only four hits Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was changing speeds really well and all his pitches were
hitting their spots extremely well,'' said catcher Joe Oliver. ``I
can't remember any pitches that went over the fat part of the
plate. He was really keeping the ball in a great location and
keeping the hitters off stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer improved to 14-9 and lowered his earned-run average to
3.47. But even numbers like those, Moyer said, can't take the sting
off '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think so,'' he said. ``We're in this as a 25-man
ballclub, coaching staff, organization and city. Whether I'm
pitching or not, I don't like to lose. And when you look down at
the most important column, it's wins and losses, and we're lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to swallow, because you look around this clubhouse
and there's a lot of pretty good players. We've had some
misfortune, but for the most part we just haven't gotten any run of
consistency together.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the numbers show it.''

ANGELS FALL TO RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Anaheim Angels probably could live with
getting beaten by Juan Gonzalez and Rick Helling. Getting beaten by
Tom Goodwin and Tim Crabtree is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   But that's exactly what happened Thursday night, as the Texas
Rangers completed a two-game sweep of the Angels with a 7-6 win
before 45,928 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin's RBI double in the eighth inning broke a 6-6 tie and
Crabtree's four hitless innings of relief keyed the victory, which
moved the Rangers into first place in the AL West by one game,
their first division lead since a half-game advantage on Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The flip-flop in the standings was made possible because the
Angels lost six of seven on the road trip to Baltimore, Tampa Bay
and Texas, while the Rangers were winning four of seven. The Angels
lost three games in the standings on the trip, having started out
two games up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a terrible road trip,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``You can't just look at the Texas series. We got beat three
times in Baltimore and we got waxed once in Tampa. We've got to
take a deep breath, go home to our ballpark and play well. If we
win five of six at home, we'll be in first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Angels are forced to play catch-up. The final 10 games
will show everybody exactly what the Angels are made of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we already did that,'' Angels center fielder Jim
Edmonds said, referring to the Angels' successful East Coast trip
in August. ``Now, we're struggling. The game goes in streaks. We've
got 10 games left. We've got to win two more than they do. If we
can't do it, we're not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels could not have asked for a better start, jumping on
19-game winner Helling for four runs and five hits in the first
inning. The Angels sent nine men to the plate in the inning and
only two made out. The other out came when Edmonds was thrown out
by Ivan Rodriguez trying to steal. But the lead lasted only until
the Rangers knocked around Angels starter Steve Sparks for four
runs and five hits in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Neither pitcher made it out of the second inning. Helling was
removed after allowing a two-run homer to Edmonds. Sparks left
after giving up a double to Gonzalez. The Angels, though, got out
of the second with a 6-4 lead and held it until solo homers off
Shigetoshi Hasegawa by Todd Zeile (in the third inning) and
Gonzalez (in the fourth) tied the game at 6.
</P>
<P>
   After the two teams had combined for 12 runs and 20 hits through
four innings, a couple of relievers took over. Crabtree (6-1)
pitched four hitless innings, allowing only one walk while striking
out four.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' Pep Harris (3-1) pitched three hitless innings
before giving up a leadoff single to ex-Angel Lee Stevens to begin
the eighth. After Zeile sacrificed pinch-runner Milt Cuyler to
second, Harris was replaced by Rich DeLucia. DeLucia hit Royce
Clayton with a pitch and Goodwin followed with a double to
right-center that scored Cuyler with what turned out to be the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 41st save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we've gained a little bit of an air about us now,''
Goodwin said. ``We've taken care of business here. Hopefully now
we'll make them do the scoreboard watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, say there's no reason to believe they can't
come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the way our whole season's gone,'' Angels catcher Phil
Nevin said. ``We have a way of bouncing back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the hype that was made about them being better than us
on paper, I thought we played them pretty well,'' Angels DH Tim
Salmon said. ``And we can beat them, too. We've still got 10 games
left. We have to play good baseball. We know what we're made of.''

A NEMESIS SHAKEN OFF BY HERTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So many times during his five-year CART racing
career, Bryan Herta had been poised to win.
</P>
<P>
   So many times the Valencia product had been overtaken just short
of the finish.
</P>
<P>
   So many times the guy in the passing car had been Alex Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed Sunday on the twisting, 2.24-mile course at
Laguna Seca near Monterey where Herta won the pole, led 81 of the
83 laps, and then held off a determined Zanardi over the final two
laps.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, the 28-year-old Hart High grad had
vindication and his first CART victory after 72 starts.
</P>
<P>
   He's been smiling ever since. ``I'm really happy with this win
for a lot of reasons,'' a still-giddy Herta said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He was happy to get a win _ any win, Herta said. And he was
happy for his crew, his sponsors and his owner, Bobby Rahal, for
keeping faith in him. And he was especially happy to have beaten
Zanardi.
</P>
<P>
   It was Zanardi who deprived Herta of victory at Laguna Seca in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Herta had the lead that year, was less than a lap away from
victory and was thwarting every pass attempt by the charging
Italian as the two wound through the twisting, turning course.
Finally, in a corner called the corkscrew, a thoroughly frustrated
Zanardi drove off the course, into the dirt and around a
disbelieving Herta, then back on the track and on to victory.
</P>
<P>
   And a year ago in Vancouver, Herta was leading again when
Zanardi, a lap down at the time, bumped him off the track and out
of contention.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Long Beach Grand Prix, Herta was leading with
Zanardi closing hard in the final laps again. And with his tires
all but worn to shreds, once again Herta was unable to hold off the
two-time CART season champ.
</P>
<P>
   Then in Friday's practice, the two mixed it up again, colliding
in a corner in an accident that broke Herta's drive train.
</P>
<P>
   So on Sunday, with two laps between him and victory, and
Zanardi's red racer in his rear-view mirror again _ Herta saw a
chance at vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `OK Herta. This is what you asked for: Zanardi on your
tail with a few laps left.' '' Herta remembered. ``... At the
corkscrew, I thought, `Please God, if I've got to run this thing
off the end of the earth to keep him back, I'm going to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi was his usual probing, aggressive self over those final
laps, trying to pressure Herta into a mistake. But to every Zanardi
move, Herta had an answer Sunday, finally crossing the finish line
0.343 seconds ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to me to have raced Alex the way we did,'' said
Herta, who plans to move back to Valencia from Ohio during the
offseason. ``I regard him as the best driver in the series, and to
have won ... makes me feel like it was a great accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   And potentially a breakthrough. Rahal expects Herta to grow on
the success. ``I'm so proud of Bryan and our team,'' Rahal said.
``I think this win will give our team lots of confidence to build
on for the rest of the season and going into next year.''
</P>
<P>
   As close as it gets: With two races remaining in Luxembourg and
Japan, Mika Hakkinen and Michael Schumacher are tied for the
Formula One series points lead with 80 each.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for four: Indy Racing League points leader Kenny Brack
will go for his fourth straight victory Sunday at the Lone Star 500
in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Brack has a 23-point lead over Davey Hamilton in the IRL points
race with one race remaining following this weekend. Tony Stewart
is 25 points back.
</P>
<P>
   Brack's three-race win streak is a record on the young circuit.
</P>
<P>
   More streak talk: Ricky Rudd has won at least one Winston Cup
race in each of the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the veteran driver has been in something of a slump so far
this season, with just three top-10 finishes (none in the top
five). And he ranks just 23rd in season points.
</P>
<P>
   With just seven races left, can he extend his streak to 16
season with a win? Rudd thinks he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to keep it going,'' said Rudd, who has 19 wins in
all, the last coming at last year's Miller 500 at Dover Downs, site
of this week's Winston Cup race. ``This is something special, and
it means a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is go out and give 120 percent, and hope for the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Substitutions: Ted Musgrave will drive the No.13 First Plus
Financial Ford in place of Dennis Setzer on Sunday. Hut Stricklin
will drive the No.77 Jasper Engines Ford for Robert Pressley, who
broke his right shoulder blade in a crash last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Tucson bound: NASCAR's Southwest Featherlite Tour heads for
Tucson, Ariz., on Saturday with Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke tied for
second place and trailing points leader and defending series champ
Steve Portenga by 133 points.
</P>
<P>
   Tied with Kanke entering the Featherlite Trailers Manufacturing
125 is Colorado's John Metcalf. Four races remain in the 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   Duel in the desert: Steve Barlow of Thousand Oaks won the pro
truck class of last weekend's SCORE Las Vegas Primm 300 off-road
race. George Seeley Jr. of Glendale was second in Baja Bug class.
Tim Braden of Chatsworth was second in stock mini trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Just 58 of the 128 vehicles to start the race finished.
</P>
<P>
   Mighty midgets: Simi Valley drivers Rick Hendrix and Alex Harris
continue to lead their USAC racing tours.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix has a 55-point lead over Bryan Stanfill in the Western
States Midget standings. Harris leads Wally Pankratz by 107 points
in the Three-quarter Midget standings.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Country's Jay Drake is in a much tighter battle for the
National Midget season title. Drake leads Jason Leffler by just
five points 770-765.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Palmdale's Ron Hornaday Jr. won the Memphis 200
NASCAR Craftsman Truck race Sunday, his series-best sixth win of
the year. His 22nd-place finish on Sept. 10, however, dropped him
out of first place. He now trails Jack Sprague by 15 points....
Busch series leader Dale Earnhardt Jr. has six wins going into
Saturday's MBNA Gold 200. The record is 10, posted by Sam Ard while
winning the 1983 points race.

PERFECT 10TH BOOSTS RED SOX OVER ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ They went small, they went old, they went tried and
true.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over Thursday night, the Red Sox went
triumphantly to Chicago, double winners on a night they beat the
Orioles, 3-2, on Mo Vaughn's single in the 10th inning at Camden
Yards while the Blue Jays were losing in the bottom of the ninth to
the Tigers, 7-4, in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The lead over the Blue Jays in the American League wild-card
race is five games. The magic number is six. Eleven games are left,
the next seven against the White Sox and Devil Rays, two teams the
Red Sox have beaten 11 times in 16 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is throwing confetti on Yawkey Way just yet, or wrapping
streamers around Pesky Pole. For the Sons of Jimy Williams, there
will be no party before its time. But John Harrington may want to
keep his calendar open in the coming days, just to be on the safe
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, this was huge,'' said Dennis Eckersley, who is two weeks
shy of his 44th birthday and days away from a return to the
postseason for the sixth time in his career but first time with the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around the seventh inning, we were losing and the Blue Jays
were winning, and it turned around. This was awesome. It couldn't
have happened at a better time.''
</P>
<P>
   How did it turn around?
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Sadler, who is small enough to be Vaughn's pocket watch,
hit a two-run homer in the seventh off Orioles ace Mike Mussina,
who gave up just six hits all night, three to the rookie second
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seized the moment without any fear,'' Vaughn said of the
23-year-old Texan, who appeared to begin the season with no clue,
going hitless in his only 11 at-bats before being shipped back to
the minors. ``He's doing all the little things and big things to
help this ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, who is older than his team's general manager, retired
three Orioles, including Cal Ripken, on five pitches in the bottom
of the ninth. Rafael Palmeiro, who had homered in the fourth off
starter Pete Schourek for Baltimore's first run, had singled off
Greg Swindell to start the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley threw one pitch to Ripken, who popped up his bunt
attempt foul to catcher Scott Hatteberg, a fundamental failure by
one of the all-time masters of the basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was funny how he bunted,'' Eckersley said. ``He didn't
square around. Maybe he doesn't bunt that much. But that was
probably the biggest play right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley's next pitch was to Harold Baines, the lefthanded
pinch hitter, who popped out to shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. ``He
knows I'm going to be around the plate,'' Eckersley said. ``I mean,
these guys are hacking off me. All I have to do is put my arm up
and they're hacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches later, Eckersley was through with Chris Hoiles,
who fouled out to Vaughn. This is as close as it gets to vintage
Eck, who usually is whisked away at the first sign of trouble by
Williams but has not allowed a run in more than a month, spanning
17 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis, who has been battling a slump but was anything but
an easy out Thursday night, doubled off Orioles closer Armando
Benitez to start the 10th. Lewis was back in the leadoff spot after
sitting the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stay with the people who brung you,'' Williams said.
``That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was John Valentin, who fouled off a bunt
attempt, took another strike, then caught a Benitez fastball in the
back of his left shoulder as his helmet flew off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad it didn't hit him in the head,'' Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn had had little success against Mussina, who struck out 10
batters in nine innings, including the first baseman on a
full-count knuckle curve with the bases loaded in the third. Vaughn
was 0 for 4 when he settled into the batter's box against Arthur
Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur Rhodes is one of the toughest lefthanders in baseball
to hit against,'' Vaughn said. ``Against him, I try to stay inside
the ball, try not to get too big, and drive it up the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-and-1 pitch from Rhodes, that's just what he did,
launching a soft single into center that scored Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit it too hard, but I did what I had to do in the
situation,'' said Vaughn, who has remained a rock no matter how
much the sand has shifted underneath him or how many other players
the Sox sign while leaving his future undecided.
</P>
<P>
   With a lead in hand, Tom Gordon, a.k.a. Jimy's Closer, set a
major league record with his 39th straight save in one season and
42d overall, though it took four outs to do it. Gordon struck out
Mike Bordick, but the shortstop reached first when the third strike
was a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Gordon had broken the club record for saves
held by Jeff Reardon. He said he had a stack of messages at the
team hotel. Someone asked if there were any VIPs in the bunch. A
Kennedy, perhaps, or a Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Gordon said with a smile, ``but I hope I get to talk to
Bill real soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Play deep enough into October and that just might be arranged.

BIG SKY WANTS CSUN STADIUM ON CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Forget renovating a local high school field
or Pierce College's stadium. Focus on finding a site, securing
funds and building a football stadium on campus.
</P>
<P>
   And do it soon.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message Big Sky Conference commissioner Doug
Fullerton gave Cal State Northridge administrators during a visit
to the campus last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the presidents (of the Big Sky) expect an on-campus
facility,'' Fullerton said Wednesday from Ogden, Utah. ``To take
the football program off to one of the smaller colleges there, I
don't think the presidents think that would be a commitment to the
football program. If they (CSUN) said, `Let's go to Pierce College
for three years,' then I think the presidents would say they're
(CSUN) not upholding their agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past Fullerton said CSUN's North Campus Stadium, which
seats 7,500, wasn't a sufficient venue because of substandard
locker rooms, lighting, coaches' boxes, press areas and ambiance.
When the Matadors entered the Big Sky Conference three years ago an
agreement was made that a new stadium would be built.
</P>
<P>
   However, area residents have opposed CSUN proposals for
facilities that could seat anywhere from 12,000 to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do it first-class, it doesn't matter how big it is. It
could be a 10,000-seat horseshoe,'' Fullerton said. ``But I think
it would be foolish if they built it without the possibility of
expanding it.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN formed a committee during the summer with the task of
finding a location for a new football stadium, as well as venues
for soccer, baseball and softball, that meets conference
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Though that committee's report isn't due until December, there
are two target areas on campus. One is at the intersection of
Halsted Street and Lindley Avenue. The other is adjacent to the
athletic department building, the site of the old parking deck off
Zelzah Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the conference is at a point where they're ready to
say, `It's been three years since you gave us your original plan
(to build it on the North Campus), which you know you can't do.
What are you going to do?''' CSUN athletic director Paul Bubb said.
``We need to build a facility that's comparable to other Big Sky
facilities. The majority of them are between 12,000 to 20,000
seats. Most of them have some type of skyboxes or VIP suites ....
That's what building a comparable facility means to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a location is established, the next step is finding money.
Bubb said public and private investors, and possibly the sale of
bonds, could help with a $12 million to $15 million bill.
</P>
<P>
   When CSUN entered the Big Sky Conference, there were three
stipulations put on the athletic department. CSUN had to increase
its scholarships with the football program to 55 and improve its
basketball facility. Both of those issues have been addressed. The
final step is the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I prefer to have it on campus,'' CSUN football
coach Ron Ponciano said. ``You look at everyone we play, those
stadiums are on campus. That's a huge, huge recruiting tool.''

KINGS, BLAKE AGREE TO TERMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: New lead) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Kings and defenseman Rob Blake
agreed to terms late Thursday on a contract that will make the
28-year-old Norris Trophy winner the highest-paid defenseman in NHL
history, a source close to the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Terms and length of the deal were unavailable. The signing will
be announced at a 12:30 p.m. news conference today at the Kings'
Iceoplex training facility in North Hills. The Kings also will
announce the signing of enforcer Matt Johnson at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Blake's signing brings to an end difficult negotiations that
have dragged through the summer. His salary will surpass the
average salary of St. Louis defenseman Al MacInnis, who had been
the highest-paid defenseman at $5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Blake earned $3.15 million last season, when he led NHL
defensemen with 23 goals and helped the Kings make the playoffs for
the first time since they reached the Stanley Cup finals in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The signings of Blake and Johnson, who earned $400,000 last
season, will leave the Kings with two unsigned players. Goalie
Jamie Storr said Thursday that he thought he might be close to
signing a new contract, but it hadn't happened as of Thursday
night. And defenseman Aki Berg has returned to his native Finland
and has said he might soon sign a contract to play in Finland or
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings open exhibition play with games Saturday and Sunday
against Colorado in Las Vegas. It is uncertain whether or not Blake
or Johnson will play in those games, though they have been skating
with Storr before Kings practices.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the cold: Kings executive Rogie Vachon was in his office
Wednesday when media-relations director Mike Altieri delivered the
news he'd been hoping not to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Vachon _ a former star goalie with the Kings and
three other NHL teams _ had been denied entrance to the Hockey Hall
of Fame, this time in his final year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Vachon now must wait to be elected in the
veterans category after he's been retired for 25 years. Vachon,
seventh in NHL history with 355 victories, retired during the
1981-82 season after a 16-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disappointing,'' Vachon said Thursday. ``What
can you say? You're at the mercy of people voting, and somebody
obviously didn't think I did enough to make it. For an athlete,
making the Hall of Fame is icing on the cake. But, hey, life goes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Players elected Wednesday were former Quebec Nordiques Peter
Stastny and Michel Goulet, and the late Roy Conacher, who played
for four teams in the 1930s, '40s and '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty proud of what we accomplished here in the 1970s,''
Vachon said. ``We put hockey on the map. Of course, Wayne (Gretzky)
brought it to a different level. But I was proud to be a part of
that era.''

BRAVES DO JUST ENOUGH TO TOP DAAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -There's no straitjacket hanging in Omar Daal's locker,
although he's beginning to wonder if there should be.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks left-hander went through another frustrating
evening on Thursday, limiting the Atlanta Braves to a run on four
hits in eight innings but came away empty-handed when the offense
deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 1-0 Atlanta victory in front of 43,251 at Bank
One Ballpark, putting the Braves within one win of triple digits
(99-55) and dropping the Diamondbacks to 61-93.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' run had a questionable tinge to it. Second baseman
Tony Graffanino bunted down the third-base line to begin the third
inning. Daal and catcher Kelly Stinnett converged on the ball about
halfway down the line, and Daal took a swipe at it with his glove
just as it appeared to cross into foul territory.
</P>
<P>
   Plate umpire Eric Gregg, maintaining a statue-like presence near
his normal position, ruled that Daal had touched the ball while it
was on the line, therefore making it fair and allowing Graffanino
to reach first base safely.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino was sacrificed to second by Denny Neagle, the
eventual winning pitcher, and scored when veteran shortstop Ozzie
Guillen slapped a single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Daal and Stinnett thought Graffanino's ball was foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Gregg) didn't move from where he was, but he said it was
on the line,'' Daal said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Stinnett: ``Maybe we should have let the ball roll longer,
but it was a good inch off the line already. Omar took a chance and
it didn't go our way.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other hits given up by Daal (7-12) were infield
singles, by outfielder Gerald Williams in the first inning, and by
outfielder Andruw Jones in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Daal's ERA dropped to 2.70, qualifying him for the National
League leaders. Of his past six defeats, four have been when
Arizona has been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got kind of mad when I got out of the game, that I continue
to pitch like that and don't get any runs. I'm trying not to lose
my mind. But what can I do about it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, had a good slider, fastball and change-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox, who has seen a lot of good pitching
in his day, was impressed with Daal, who was in the bullpen when
the teams last met here in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hearing a lot about Daal for a long time,'' Cox
said. ``I saw him pitch against the Cubs on TV, and he was every
bit as good tonight as he was then. He was awesome. They've done a
wonderful job with him.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed Neagle, who missed his two previous starts
because of bursitis in his left shoulder, did a wonderful job
himself. He scattered four hits through six innings and got help
from relievers Dennis Martinez, John Rocker and Kerry Ligtenberg to
pick up his 15th victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has five 15-game winners, the first time a team has
accomplished that since the 1930 Washington Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle said he was more concerned about the shoulder than
getting to 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six innings was plenty tonight,'' he said. ``It was the smart
thing to pull myself early.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' biggest opportunity to tie the score or
perhaps win it came against the right-handed Ligtenberg in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Devon White reached first with one out when he
swung for a third strike and the ball got past catcher Eddie Perez
for a passed ball. Matt Williams forced White at second on a
fielder's choice for the second out. Ligtenberg walked Travis Lee,
but struck out Jay Bell swinging for the third out and chalked up
his 29th save. &QL;

DE LA HOYA'S WBC TITLE, TYSON'S FUTURE ON THE LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The mismatch and the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   In a city full of wild deuces, it's a dice roll as to whether
the Oscar De La Hoya-Julio Cesar Chavez bout tonight and Mike
Tyson's hearing Saturday for reinstatement of his license will
fulfill or exceed the billing.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the oddsmakers, only the Tyson hearing before the
Nevada Athletic Commission is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield lost part of his ear and Tyson lost all of his
license the last time Tyson faced the Commission. The hearing is
too close to call. Perfect for a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, De La Hoya (28-0, 23 KOs) is an 8-to-1 favorite to
repeat the bloody whipping suffered by Chavez (101-2-2, 84 KOs) 27
months ago. De La Hoya, 25, looks bigger. He was 146 { pounds, two
heavier than the shorter Chavez at Thursday's weigh-in. Chavez, 36,
is just a couple of years older. It adds up to a mismatch.
</P>
<P>
   But odds never quite capture the inescapable intrigue that
always manages to build. It might prove to be another illusion
among the many cast by the blinking neon.
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing appears certain. De La Hoya and Chavez will fight
tonight for the World Boxing Council's welterweight title at Thomas
&AMP; Mack Center. Opening bell is scheduled for about 8:30. The
pay-per-view television portion of the undercard will begin at 6
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson? Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   There's speculation he will withdraw from Saturday morning's
hearing at Cashman Center, near a minor-league baseball park, out
of fear the Nevada Commission will reject his plea for
reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   One scenario has Tyson, under investigation in Maryland for an
alleged assault after a fender-bender, fighting abroad no matter
what Nevada does. He has signed a multimillion-dollar deal with
Showtime. If the cable network is going to make good on its
investment, it's fair to guess that it will go wherever necessary.
If Tyson doesn't get a license, he'll need a passport.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez? If De La Hoya is to be believed, his old boyhood hero
will need a lot of stitches, if not a stretcher. De La Hoya has
repeatedly promised to punish Chavez for not acknowledging him as
an equal after he scored a stunning fourth-round TKO in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been like a crybaby lately, crying about everything,''
said De La Hoya, who is guaranteed about $9 million and a
percentage of pay-per-view sales that promoter Bob Arum says could
top 800,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez might be less vulnerable to cuts this time around. In
the first bout, De La Hoya's whip-like jab opened up a cut above
Chavez's left eye. After the bout, Chavez had more stories than
Bill Clinton to explain the cut.
</P>
<P>
   He got it in sparring. He was nicked while playing with his son.
It was the result of head-butt.
</P>
<P>
   How ever it happened, Chavez hid the wound behind eye makeup
from the Nevada's ring physicians in a pre-fight physical. He also
concealed the wound by wearing a hat low around his eyes. He
couldn't afford not to fight, because of Mexican tax debt and other
financial problems. His purse for tonight is $6 million and a
percentage of pay-per-view receipts.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Nevada Commission took a closer look at the scar
tissue that crisscrosses Chavez's forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cuts are healed,'' Dr. Barry Markham said. ``The scars
are imperceptible. His skin looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya was glad to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his skin is fine, that makes me happy,'' said De La Hoya,
who already has agreed to a Nov. 21 date with African Ike Quartey.
``I can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   If Chavez' paper-thin scar tissue _ the result of 105 bouts _
withstands De La Hoya's early blows, it sets up an interesting
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has been known as a slow starter. Throughout his career,
he has been at his best in the middle-to-late rounds of battles
that exhaust the body and test the will. If there is a last roar in
the aging lion, it'll probably be heard in a late round.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has seldom had to go a full 12 rounds. In his 28
bouts, he has fought into the 12th only four times. He's not
expecting a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only satisfaction I will get is if I knock Chavez out,''
he said. ``If it's not a clean, devastating knockout, I will be
disappointed.'' &QL;

 HOME RUN DERBY TRANSCENDS GAME

<P>
   SAN DIEGO - The day after Sammy Sosa hit No. 63 the home team
still was in a full pout.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres couldn't get over their own fans celebrating the
grand-slam home run that had beat them. They were upset the
scoreboard flashed ``San Diego Salutes Sammy Sosa'' as the Cubs
slugger circled the bases, and angrier still when fireworks lit the
night sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's garbage,'' Padres pitcher Sterling Hitchcock fumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What, are we the ``enemy''?'' pouted Greg Vaughn, knowing they
are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they were going to roll out a new car,'' Andy Ashby
groused.
</P>
<P>
   Poor babies.
</P>
<P>
   They don't get it.
</P>
<P>
   This is bigger than the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   This is bigger than the West division champion's attempt to win
100 games and secure home-field advantage in the National League
playoffs. The story is bigger than one team. It's the biggest story
in baseball, the most compelling drama in sports.
</P>
<P>
   It's history.
</P>
<P>
   Did you see Sosa's grand slam? No. 63 launched Wednesday night
landed up there _ where? _ ``way'' up there, see, just to the right
of the Bimbo Bakeries sign, in the second deck. Went 434 feet.
</P>
<P>
   What happened today? Anyone hit No. 64?
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is talking about it, following it. Even world leaders
have taken note of America's magical late-summer preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   When the president of the Czech Republic was asked at a joint
news conference to comment on the characters in the White House
soap opera, one of whom stood stiffly at his side, Vaclav Havel
replied in halting English, ``I congratulate Mr. Mark McGwire and
wish success to Mr. Sammy Sosa.''
</P>
<P>
   His playful diplomacy broke the tension. Laughter filled the
State Department auditorium. The comic relief brought smiles,
welcomed smiles that remind us that despite all the political
in-fighting and and grim, hand-wringing uncertainty in Washington,
America has the Great Home Run Derby to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   We have Mr. Sosa, and Mr. McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa didn't hit one Thursday. With an opportunity to overtake
McGwire, whose team had the day off, Sosa came to the plate five
times. He hit the ball hard. On one swing, he broke his bat, the
splintered barrel whirling toward the third-base coaching box like
a helicopter blade. But the Cubs slugger failed to turn any pitches
into memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of letdowns, it was like watching the Fire Department
roar into action and aim their hoses only to discover they had no
water pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Out. Out. Out. When Sosa walked in the eighth inning, Padres
fans booed the pitcher, Randy Myers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs won the game, 4-3, with a 10th inning home run, but
Sosa didn't deliver it. Gary Gaetti did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I am not going to hit a home run,'' Sosa said,
almost apologetically. True. In June, which has 30 days, my choice
for National League MVP hit only 20.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and McGwire. McGwire and Sosa. They have given us a summer
to cheer and cherish. Fifty homers . . . 55 . . . 60 . . . 61 . . .
a record 62. We have watched the count steadily climb like the
mercury on a bulb thermometer. In the bleachers, fans scramble for
souvenirs. Former big league stars shake their heads in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson lives in Newport Beach, Calif. He took the day
off Thursday and drove 150 miles to San Diego. ``I came,'' Jackson
said, `'to meet the man and shake his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The long ball is an art form with which Jackson is familiar. In
1969, at age 22, he hit a career-high 47 homers, 37 by the All-Star
break. Like others who have played the game, Jackson marvels at
what Sosa and McGwire are doing. Your turn, my turn. One blast
after another.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives me goose bumps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson shook hands with Sosa before the game. Reggie held
Sosa's bat, gripped the handle, waggled it, admiring it, feeling
its weight. He liked how it felt in his hands, but he likes even
more what its owner is doing for the game he cherishes.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie gets it. This is bigger than the Padres. Bigger than the
Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've almost worn Michael Jordan out as a sports hero,'' Mr.
October said. ``These two guys have come along at the right time.
This is great, for everyone.'' &QL;

EARLY POLLS TAKE CRAZY BOUNCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Putting together a preseason ranking of the top 25 college
football teams has never been more than educated guesswork,
although the word ``educated'' should be used loosely.
</P>
<P>
   This season is only two weeks old, and already seven teams in
the preseason poll have dropped out of the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Four teams ranked in the AP's top 15 only a few weeks ago are
now listed among ``others receiving votes,'' including Michigan
(0-2), which was ranked fifth; Arizona State (0-2), ranked eighth;
North Carolina (0-1), 12th; and Colorado State (2-1), 15th.
</P>
<P>
   The two polls, the AP's and the ``USA Toda''y/ESPN coaches',
have been as volatile the past two weeks as the stock market. And
there are parts of the polls that make no sense. For instance why
did ASU receive 20 more votes than BYU in the most-recent AP poll,
even though the Cougars hammered the Sun Devils, 26-6, last week?
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe it's too early to get worked up about the
polls, because the inconsistencies usually take awhile to work
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``As (Florida State Coach) Bobby Bowden told me once, by
November those things usually have taken care of themselves,'' said
John Junker, executive director of the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That is Junker's hope. His bowl will host the top two ranked
teams in the country, as determined by a formula devised by
officials from the Bowl Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   That formula includes four parts: record, ranking in the two
polls, strength of schedule and the average of three computer
rankings. The coaches' poll will vote the winner of the Fiesta Bowl
No. 1, while the writers' poll reserves the right to pick another
team if the scenario presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, when bowl affiliations allowed, the polls almost
always were the determining factor in pairing two teams for a
national title matchup. While officials welcome the new rating
system, it might not eliminate controversy.
</P>
<P>
   What if Kansas State, which has one of the nation's weakest
nonconference schedules, is undefeated and ranked second, and
Florida State has one loss and is ranked third? The Seminoles could
earn a trip to the Fiesta by virtue of their tougher schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Junker is glad the Bowl Championship Series has established
criteria for making the selections and that it's not up to him to
select the two teams for what probably will be the national title
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Dec. 6 (selection day), I don't want to be telling a group
of 120 young men that they are not being invited to play for the
national championship,'' he said. ``I think it will be a healthy
transition to have, for the purposes of a championship game,
objective criteria used.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opening weeks, the polls are largely a work in progress.
And many coaches would like to see the first polls come out in
October, rather than August. That would give voters a better idea
of who is worthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure that even if you've won games at this point that
you know what you are,'' said Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti, whose
team is ranked 22nd after starting unranked. The Ducks caught the
nation's attention by opening with a victory over Michigan State,
but Bellotti said too much can be made of such a victory. Last
week, Oregon was less impressive, squeaking by UTEP on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you should get three games under your belt,'' Bellotti
said when asked when a poll should begin. ``Most of the time that
gives an indication of what kind of football team you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey agreed. The Wildcats have risen from
24th to 16th, although their two victories came against Hawaii and
Stanford, which are hardly powers this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way too early for anybody to get excited about their team
or down on their team,'' he said. ``There is too much football left
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder also would like the poll to start after a
few games have been played, but he understands the reasoning behind
having early-season rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entertainment dollar and the competitive dollar is with
the NFL in a lot of ways,'' he said. ``They start camp before we
do. That start games before we do. The volume of information in the
papers about them is ahead of us, and more excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, we would be taking away one of the things that
kind of interests people about college football and delaying it
another month.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches have complained that teams that start unranked or
ranked low are at a disadvantage in contending for a national title
because they have so far to climb. By waiting a month, the journey
could be made that much shorter, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Washington State started the season unranked and
didn't move into the top 10 until winning its first seven games.
Starting the poll in the preseason ``makes it more difficult for
Washington State,'' Coach Mike Price said. ``It just takes us a
little longer to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's still possible. Over the past few years, other
underdogs such as Northwestern and Arizona State have been able to
climb into the top 10 despite being unranked in at least one of the
preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   If there's an advantage to be gained in the preseason rankings,
it belongs to the schools at the top, Junker said. ``If a team is
winning, it's hard to fall,'' he said. ``If you're winning, it's
big news if you fall.'' &QL;

EAGLES FLYING SOUTH EARLY  
 ENTER VALLEY HOPING TO AVOID 0-3 START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time the Philadelphia Eagles started a season 0-3 Buddy
Ryan was their coach. They didn't have a winner in town, either.
</P>
<P>
   That was 12 years ago. In the interim, the Eagles have made the
playoffs on average every other year, six times, which is six more
than the Cardinals during that span.
</P>
<P>
   So after last year's first-round exit, history would suggest a
step backward for the Eagles. And so it is. The Eagles (0-2) have
shown there is another team in the NFC East just as bad as, or
worse than, the Cardinals (0-2), and the Big Red gets a shot at
them on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles haven't won on the road since beating the one-win New
York Jets two years ago (the Jets' win was over the Cardinals),
haven't won on grass since the 1996 opener, and have lost four of
their past five in Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a deterioration of talent in Philadelphia,
although the Eagles, like the Cardinals, have found a promising
young quarterback in Bobby Hoying.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, free agents such as All-Pro defensive end
Reggie White, Pro Bowl running back Ricky Watters, linebacker Seth
Joyner and end Clyde Simmons have left. The club had a chance to
trade with Green Bay for quarterback Mark Brunell. It fell through,
and Brunell is leading Jacksonville to the playoffs. The Eagles
moved too slowly in an offer to free-agent tackle Lomas Brown two
years ago, and he signed with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a draft, we have the same opportunities as other teams
to get players,'' said embattled Eagles Coach Ray Rhodes. ``We're
not looking for excuses, we just have to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rhodes points out there is a draft, but the Eagles have
squandered many of their picks, among them 1994 first-rounder
Bernard Williams, who was suspended by the NFL under its
substance-abuse policy; 1995 first-rounder Mike Mamula, a career
underachiever who is on injured reserve; and 1997 first-rounder
John Harris, a defensive end whom most clubs projected as a
third-rounder at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite naturally, I think when you're 0-2 no one's going to be
very happy, including myself,'' Rhodes said. ``We're struggling to
find a way to get on track. There's nothing to smile about. I don't
think there are a lot of smiles in Arizona, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles did seem to hit the jackpot with Hoying. The former
Ohio State standout was selected in the third round in 1996,
although Hoying, who turns 26 on Sunday, is suffering many of the
growing pains that Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer is
experiencing. After Hoying was sacked nine times by Seattle in the
opener, the Eagles got the ball out of Hoying's hands more quickly
last week in a 17-12 loss at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get Bobby relaxed again,'' Rhodes said. ``We did
a lot of film study and pinpointed things that he could do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoying emerged as the starter late last season after Ty Detmer
and Rodney Peete were inconsistent. The Eagles went 2-0-1, rallying
into the playoffs. Now, defenses are getting to know Hoying and are
game-planning for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my third year and Jake's second, and it's just
experience,'' Hoying said. ``It's not only seeing it on film but
also in live game situations and at game speed where you're picking
everything up. Seattle lit us up, got to us with various blitzes
and we didn't pick them up. It was a long day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one thing is just avoiding the bad play and coming
back for the next one instead of trying to make something happen
and taking a sack.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, sacked seven times by Seattle, agrees staying out of
trouble is a key Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby has come out with a lot of expectations and struggled a
little bit, too. Teams are throwing stuff at him. There definitely
are similarities. He's better than what he is playing right now.
It's not me against him, but we both want to get off these losing
streaks.'' &QL;

MURRAY'S FIRE FOR THE ICE  
 MINOR LEAGUE VET KEEPS DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Rob Murray won't lie. It's true, he said, he
actually gets excited about coming to training camp every year.
</P>
<P>
   (We pause for a moment while the rest of the veteran players on
the Coyotes snicker quietly.)
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, training camp is a necessary evil for the
guys who have been around the NHL block a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Murray, who is entering his 12th pro season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As nice as the summer is, I still get that itch,'' said
Murray, 31. ``The fire starts to build, and I really start looking
forward to getting back on the ice again.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray has made a career out of becoming the Crash Davis of
minor league hockey. Just like the fictional character in the
baseball movie ``Bull Durham,'' he dreams of playing in hockey's
version of The Show, but won't let that affect his role _ or his
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where, frankly, he's going to have a
difficult time making the (Coyotes),'' Coach Jim Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Anything can happen, of course. But Murray knows as well as
anyone that he likely will report back to the team's top minor
league affiliate, the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey
League, his home for the past four seasons. It's almost inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm a realist,'' Murray said. ``I understand that the
few spots that might be available aren't really looking my way. But
at the same time, I want to come here and make sure I make an
impression on the coaching staff, on management, so that they don't
forget about me, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they won't. Actually, the Toronto native is a big part of
their plans. He always has been. Just not at the NHL level.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been invaluable as the captain and team leader in
Springfield. In addition to providing quality play and experience
on the ice, he is equally important as a mentor, teacher and big
brother to the dozens of young players who come up through the
system. It's a job most veteran players probably couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty admirable when you think about it,'' said Dave
Farrish, now in his second season as the Falcons head coach. ``In
the back of his mind, I know he's still hopeful of getting a shot
(to stay in Phoenix). I don't care how old you are, if you're in
the minor leagues, you still have your eyes on the NHL.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Chad Kilger, for instance. When the highly touted center
was demoted to Springfield, he pouted and retreated into a shell.
His game suffered. No matter what the Coyotes tried to say to him,
it didn't work. Murray was about the only person who could get
inside his head. After a second demotion, Kilger left the team
entirely and eventually was suspended by the Coyotes. He was traded
to Chicago a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I got him back to the NHL,'' laughed Murray, a
third-round draft pick of the Washington Capitals in 1985. ``But
it's just like my situation. If I don't get called up, I can't moan
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Danny (Briere) got called up, I could have went into the
tank. I mean, I've been in the pros for over 10 years, and here's
this rookie who gets called up ahead of me. But you know what?
Danny deserved to go up because he's a great player and a great
kid. I love the guy. I was happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray hasn't played in an NHL game since 1995-96, when he
appeared in one game for Winnipeg against the New York Islanders.
Two days later, he was back in Springfield. He has appeared in 726
minor league games, just 94 in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   He vows to get back someday. If not as a player, then perhaps as
a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll make a good one,'' Farrish said. ``I have no doubts
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him well enough,'' Schoenfeld said, ``but
coaching does seem like it would be a natural progression for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   But not yet, Murray said. He still has some unfinished business
to attend to, whether it's in Phoenix or in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``My former coach in Springfield, Kevin McCarthy, told me, `Rob,
you can always coach, but you can never go back and play. So play
as long as you can and do as good as you can,' '' Murray said.
``With expansion coming, who knows? Maybe it'll be too late for me,
but if I can squeeze out another year or two, who's to say?'' &QL;

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - A thigh strain that has troubled Mitchell
Freedman since camp will keep him out of Saturday's game against
North Texas, Arizona State Coach Bruce Snyder said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the opponent,'' Snyder said. ``If it was (Southern
California), we'd still keep him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman's status beyond Saturday is uncertain. Snyder said the
free safety's injury worsens during competition. It also affects
his hip and groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's embarrassed by his play,'' Snyder said. ``We need to let
him heal.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Pac-10 player has has been noticeably less sharp in the
two games. He has posted 11 tackles and contributed to one sack. He
had 58 tackles, two sacks and four interceptions last season.
</P>
<P>
   He has been limited to conditioning in practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get him in shape,'' ASU trainer Perry Edinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Phillip Brown will start in place of Freedman. He has
played in both games, primarily in nickel packages, and has 10
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Brown moved to safety from cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils may catch a break against North Texas, which
prefers to run the ball. It completed only 6 of 19 passes against
Texas Tech last week. &QL;

DEVINE UNDER STANDS SNY DER'S PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If misery loves company, well,  &UR; Bruce Snyder,
move over.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dan Devine is here to commiserate.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's early struggles brought back a flood of memories
for former Sun Devils coach Devine, whose 1978 Notre Dame team also
started out 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to explain how lousy you feel,'' Valley resident
Devine said. ``The only way to get rid of the taste in your mouth
is with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, who have lost to Washington and Brigham Young,
will host North Texas on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the defending national champion Fighting Irish opened
with losses to Missouri, 3-0, and Michigan, 28-14. It got so bad
that Devine received letters demanding the benching of his senior
quarterback,  &UR; Joe Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I was concerned, but what we did was come back and take
it one game at a time,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One at a time'' is the philosophy Snyder preaches to his
players.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder can only hope 1998 ends the way the 1978 season did for
Devine. Notre Dame won its next eight games, including five against
ranked teams. The only remaining loss was in the regular-season
finale against Southern California, which won, 27-25, in the final
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish went on to beat Houston, 35-34, in the Cotton Bowl
after trailing, 34-12, with 7:37 left.
</P>
<P>
   Can ASU expect a similar finish? Devine pointed out
similarities: high preseason expectations and a large share of new
starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a horrible week for the players and coaches,'' Devine
said. ``You're just kind of waiting for Saturday night. You have to
look at North Texas as the season.'' &QL; 
Doing the shuffle &QL; 
At least six positions will have new starters against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Junior college transfer  &UR; Erik Flowers and  &UR; Junior Ioane will
start at end and tackle, respectively, for  &UR; Derrick Ford and  &UR; Ryan
Reilly.  &UR; Eric Fields will replace  &UR; Stephen Trejo, who is nursing a
knee sprain, at outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Phillip Brown steps in for free safety  &UR; Mitchell Freedman, who
has a thigh strain.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, left guard  &UR; Scott  &UR; Peters replaces  &UR; Randy Leaphart,
who is out with a knee injury. Punter  &UR; Stephen Baker will replace
 &UR; Stephen Gauthier as the kicker. &QL;

IOWA'S FRY NOT READY TO CALL IT QUITS YET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Iowa Coach  &UR; Hayden Fry, a former Marine, is not in the habit of
surrendering, although there's been a not-so-subtle suggestion this
week that he consider the option.
</P>
<P>
   After his first loss to rival Iowa State in 16 years, some Iowa
fans are ready to show him the door. Or, at the very least, offer
him a retirement package.
</P>
<P>
   But, for now, Fry has no plans for a retirement home in Arizona.
A victory, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'd be letting my players and coaches down,'' Fry said
about sudden retirement. He's too busy this week, as his Big Ten
Hawkeyes (1-1) prepare for No. 16 Arizona on Saturday night at
Tucson. ``It's the challenge of taking something like this and
making it into a good solid, football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, the challenge was made to sound like mission
impossible by his further comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tucson is not a place to look for improvement,'' said Fry, who
is in his 20th season with the Hawkeyes and 37th as a coach. ``I'm
not predicting we're going to lose, but everything sure points in
that direction. We're going to need a superb effort just to make it
competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   When told that desert temperatures continue to be at or above
100 degrees, Fry said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in trouble.'' &QL; 
Faster even than . . . &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fry had an interesting scouting report on the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fastest ballclub we've seen in years and years, faster even
than Arizona State,'' said Fry, whose Hawkeyes lost to ASU, 17-7,
in last year's Sun Bowl. &QL; 
Still learning &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dennis Northcutt, an ace in the Arizona air corps, was one of
the most effective players last Saturday at Stanford with five
receptions for 160 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Wildcats Coach  &UR; Dick Tomey isn't satisfied. He said
Northcutt still has a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to become a better player without the ball. That's
what he has to improve on from last week.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey cited receiver  &UR; Jeremy McDaniel as a complete player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy was everywhere with blocks and those kind of plays,''
Tomey said. ``That's what Dennis needs to do.'' &QL;

BRAVES KEEP ROLLING ALONG  
 AT TIMES, PLAY GOES UNNOTICED

<P>
   PHOENIX - Maybe you turned off the TV after the daily
installment of The Mac and Sammy Show. Perhaps your eyes grew weary
reading of the epic McGwire-Sosa battle, not to mention the race in
the American League West or the wild-card situations or the other
special individual efforts that turned Baseball '98 into a season
of rebirth, as some of the game's poets have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   It might be that you missed the Atlanta Braves doing something
special themselves, winning a seventh straight National League
division title. They did it Monday, beating Philadelphia to clinch
first place in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, don't we expect this? The Braves certainly do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of spoiled myself, being in this position so much,''
third baseman Chipper Jones said afterward. ``But I cherish every
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Jones' fourth. Pitchers John Smoltz and Tom Glavine
have been around for all seven. Not coincidentally, so have Manager
Bobby Cox, General Manager John Schuerholz and President Stan
Kasten, and a generous, aggressive owner, Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have all those division titles and more victories
than any team this decade. They have been to the World Series four
times since 1991. With the core of its six-time Cy Young Award
winning pitching rotation _ Greg Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz _
intact since 1993, they are the Team of the '90s, perhaps a team
for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Or so one would think.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are different variations in what people perceive,''
Smoltz said. ``We've done something no other team has done. But
it's disappointing the way our city has treated it, what's been
written and said. It's disappointing when you're viewed as a
failure instead.''
</P>
<P>
   If such harsh judgment exists, it stems from the Braves'
postseason failures. They did win one World Series, in 1995, but
lost the other three _ in 1991 to Minnesota, in 1992 to Toronto and
in 1996 to New York _ plus championship series to Philadelphia in
1993 and Florida in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as Atlanta closes in on 100 victories, there already
are warnings of potholes in the road ahead. Smoltz, who is 16-3
despite going on the disabled list twice, can hardly fathom the
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given the fans everything they want and more,'' he said.
``One of the best organizations and one of the best owners. But
it's like some people can't wait for us to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand,'' he said in the visitor's clubhouse at
Bank One Ballpark before the Braves' 1-0 victory Thursday. ``This
organization (the Diamondbacks) is an expansion organization.
They'd give anything to be in our position.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter, who scouted the Braves
extensively the past two years, is trying to attain that position.
If a franchise can serve as a role model, Atlanta is it. Showalter
is a big fan of Cox. He also cites the Braves' consistency, how
they develop talent while also filling needs through trades and
free-agent signings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to have that same vision,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks scouting director Don Mitchell, who worked for the
Braves from 1993 through 1995, said the organization's success is
rooted in the dark rebuilding days of the mid-1980s, when Kasten
became president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a commitment to scouting and player development, and
they stuck to it,'' Mitchell said. ``When John Schuerholz came
aboard (in 1990), he filled in some gaps. He signed Maddux, traded
for (Fred) McGriff. But they stuck with the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, young pitchers Kevin Millwood and Kerry Ligtenberg
have blossomed, along with outfielder Andruw Jones, adding to the
list of home-grown talent that includes Chipper Jones, catcher Javy
Lopez and outfielder Ryan Klesko. First baseman Andres Galarraga
and shortstop Walt Weiss were key free agent pickups.
</P>
<P>
   But it goes beyond talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of confidence there,'' said Diamondbacks pitcher
Alan Embree, a former Brave. ``You know everyone at each position
is confident of his ability. . . . Schuerholz is just as confident
as the players and Bobby Cox is as good a manager as I've played
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each player makes the other better. Each one of the starters
wants to outdo the other, night after night. You've got older guys
the younger guys look up to. It's just a really professional
group.'' &QL;

GILKEY SETS IMPROVED SIGHTS ON NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Diamondbacks outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey looked like
someone standing on the edge of a swimming pool, waiting to stick
his toe into the water to test the temperature. He wanted so much
to walk onto the field at Bank One Ballpark, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta stay away. Can't be around dust too much yet,'' he said
as he stood on the dugout steps before Thursday night's game
against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he returned from Calgary, Alberta, where he
had corrective laser surgery on both eyes Wednesday. There is a
remote chance he could play in the season-ending three-game series
against San Diego at BOB Sept. 25-27, but a more likely scenario
has him returning to action at full strength when spring training
begins in late February in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see things a lot better now, and they will continue to
get better,'' said Gilkey, acquired in a trade with the New York
Mets on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird and sort of scary, but it was impressive. I went
from 20/40 to close to 20/20 in about 10 minutes. They didn't put
me under or anything.'' &QL; 
Springer returns &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed middle reliever  &UR; Russ Springer is making his return
to Arizona for the first time since being traded from the
Diamondbacks to the Braves on June 23 for left-handed middle
reliever  &UR; Alan Embree.
</P>
<P>
   He was 4-3 with a 4.13 ERA with Arizona and is 1-1 with a 4.50
ERA in 20 games for the Braves. In his most recent appearance
before this series, he gave up one hit and struck out one in one
inning against Philadelphia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Springer was on the disabled list from Aug. 6-21 with bone spurs
in his pitching elbow. He likely will have arthroscopic surgery
after the season to remove the chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see some of the guys over there (in the Arizona
dugout), but it's also nice to win a few games,'' said Springer,
with thoughts of a trip to the playoffs and a chance at a World
Series championship ring dancing in his head. &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players from the Diamondbacks' farm system who will play in the
Arizona Instructional League reported to Tucson on Thursday night
and will have their first workout today. Games begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are looking for a left-handed batting practice
pitcher. One candidate threw to the pitchers Thursday _  &UR; Tony
Dello, who pitches batting practice for Coach  &UR; Pat Murphy at
Arizona State. &QL;

TUCSON FOOTBALL STAR HAS HEART FOR SPORTS  
 SURGERY PUTS HANTLA BACK IN PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON - A 12-inch scar runs down his chest. A wire the size of
a No. 2 pencil lead lies beneath the skin to hold the sternum
together. There are two holes in his belly.
</P>
<P>
   Battle wounds?
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Hantla likes to tell a naive freshman football player at
Tucson's Rincon/University High School how he was shot and stabbed
while saving a woman from getting her purse snatched.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as the standout varsity athlete has the kid buying
the story, he begins to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have fun making up stories about it,'' said Hantla, a
two-way starter at halfback and defensive end for the 2-0 Rangers.
``They think it's pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't too cool two Christmases ago, when his cardiologist,
Dr. Scott Klewer, told Hantla that he needed open-heart surgery and
couldn't play sports.
</P>
<P>
   They might as well have ripped his heart out then, he felt upon
hearing the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the hardest thing,'' Hantla said. ``I had no
symptoms. I was in the best shape of my life. I had just come off a
triple-double (in a junior varsity basketball game) the night
before.''
</P>
<P>
   In July of last year, Hantla had a rim of tissue that developed
under the aortic valve removed by world-renowned heart transplant
surgeon Dr. Jack Copeland. The procedure allowed for blood to flow
more smoothly through the left ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't something he absolutely had to have, but if he did
not have the surgery, he wouldn't be able to do anything more
active than play golf or pingpong,'' said Jacob's father, Jeff
Hantla, a physical therapist who was an all-state linebacker at
Scottsdale Coronado in the early 1970s. ``He wanted to keep doing
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, medically cleared, Jacob, a strapping 6-foot-2, 210-pound
senior, is playing football for the first time. It's a sport in
which his father and grandfather, Bob Hantla, excelled. Bob Hantla,
who lives in Scottsdale, played for the San Francisco 49ers in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to play football before, but with the heart thing . .
. ,'' said Jacob, a National Merit Scholarship student with a 4.28
grade point average at University High, which is combined with
Rincon on the same campus. ``Now, I'm really excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   So is his coach, Jeff Green, who coached Jacob's father at the
University of Arizona in the 1970s. Green was the defensive-ends
coach under Jim Young, and Jeff Hantla was a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Jacob work out this summer, Green had no idea about his
medical history until he saw him in the weight room one day with
his shirt off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got this great big scar on his chest, and I asked him
what happened,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Hantla didn't try to snow his coach with a wild story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Oh, I had heart surgery,' '' Green said. ``By then,
he was one of our tougher and best-conditioned kids in the weight
room and in the passing league.''
</P>
<P>
   Born with a heart murmur, Hantla was diagnosed early in his
childhood with a subaortic membrane, Klewer said. At the time, it
didn't seem to cause a problem, and Hantla grew up like most
children, running, playing ball, not a worry in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The only difference in his life from that of his friends, he
said, was going into the University Medical Center once every three
years to have an echocardiogram.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a cool way to get out of school,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just before Christmas of '96, his echocardiogram showed
him in peril if he continued sports without the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Klewer said Hantla's aortic valve had begun leaking. Surgery was
needed to prevent further deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so healthy and in good shape,'' Klewer said. ``But we
couldn't recommend competitive sports, based on his heart
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hantla's insurance allowed for Copeland to do the surgery.
They felt in good hands, but the final decision for the surgery was
left up to Jacob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in better shape than most people now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months after the surgery, however, Hantla experienced
extreme chest pains. Significant amounts of fluid had built up
around his heart, Klewer said. He was treated with
anti-inflammatory agents, and it was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Hantla spent two weeks in the hospital. Teachers took schoolwork
to him. Classmates dropped by for study hall.
</P>
<P>
   He caught up on his studies but was too late for varsity
basketball tryouts. He was allowed on the JV team, where he posted
impressive numbers in scoring, rebounds and steals.
</P>
<P>
   It was during basketball season that Hantla said he thought, for
the first time, of his own mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the shock of surgery, you look down and see the scar,''
he said. ``It was weird to play with that. It made me think. I was
afraid of my heart going out when I got real tired.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't now. He said he shows it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my battle scar,'' he said. &QL;

GOP SEEKS FBI PROBE OF SEX STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders called on the FBI Thursday to
investigate whether the White House is spreading stories of
adulterous affairs by key lawmakers as part of a clandestine
campaign to influence impeachment proceedings against President
Clinton.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The action came a day after the San Francisco-based Internet
magazine Salon reported that 74-year-old Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
had a five-year affair with a married woman in the 1960s. As
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Hyde would be in charge of any
impeachment hearings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The White House vehemently denied that anyone on its staff
played any part in exposing the affair. ``If there is someone in
our building who has completely lost their minds that they think
this is helpful, they should be fired,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart, traveling with Clinton in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But the accusations and counter-accusations set off a vigorous
debate about what has become fair game for public disclosure and
discourse in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the disclosures underscore the hypocrisy of some
lawmakers who, like Hyde, have cloaked themselves in a mantle of
family values and are now in a position to judge Clinton's
indiscretions. To others, they signify a dangerous trend in which
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's graphic report into the sex
life of President Clinton may have invited unwarranted prying into
the private lives of public figures.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who was 41 when the affair started, admitted being ``good
friends a long time ago'' with Cherie Snodgrass, but said that
``the statute of limitations has long since passed on my youthful
indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde report followed an admission last month by Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., perhaps Clinton's most strident critic in Congress,
that he too had had an adulterous affair and fathered a child out
of wedlock. Burton, chairman of the Government Reform and Oversight
Committee, led the investigation into White House fund-raising
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho, one of the most conservative
members of Congress, then admitted having had an affair with a
married man in the 1980s. Chenoweth, who did not hold office and
was not married at the time of the affair, acknowledged the
relationship shortly after she began airing ads that said
``Clinton's behavior has severely rocked this nation and damaged
the office of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, accused White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal Thursday of trying to ``shop the story'' about
Hyde to various media outlets. That, he said, would be a violation
of federal laws, which prohibit attempts to influence Congress in
conducting inquiries. ``I have no doubt in my mind that we have an
operation in the White House that is trying to destroy members of
Congress in order to intimidate them from doing their duty under
the Constitution of the United States,'' said DeLay. ``We believe
it warrants an investigation by the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon editor David Talbot rejected charges that the story on
Hyde came from the White House. Instead, he described in detail how
a man named Norm Sommer, who was a friend of Fred Snodgrass,
Cherie's ex-husband, approached dozens of media outlets with the
story, including the Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe. Except
for Salon, none expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle McManus, Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times,
said in a statement that the paper passed on the story because ``we
don't write about politicians' sex lives unless they come up in the
context of a story about an issue of legitimate public concern,
such as sexual harassment or abuse of power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into the allegations about Rep. Hyde and found no
issue of legitimate public concern,'' McManus said.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbot said it was Starr, not his publication, who should be
held responsible for encouraging disclosures of the most intimate
details of a politician's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans and Kenneth Starr opened up the Pandora's box of
sexual investigations long before Salon ever got into the sexual
exposure business,'' said Talbot. ``As soon as Ken Starr delivered
that report, he rewrote the rules in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Washington culture now says you can make someone's private
life the subject of a public investigation,'' he said. ``We just
wanted to level the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde received support from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who
expressed fears that the disclosures could further discourage
potentially qualified candidates from running for office. ``If
everyone is going to look for perfect people in these jobs, the
only ones who are going to run will be from the press,'' she said
in a tongue-in-cheek comment to a group of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said there is a big difference between an affair that
took place decades ago and the one conducted by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is focusing on the president's life 30 years ago, or
even seven years ago,'' said Feinstein. ``The fact that it was in
the workplace, in the Oval Office, under the imperative of the
president, that is very different.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the new inquisitional climate would create
turmoil in electoral races across the country provoked a remarkably
rapid response from both political parties. Rep. Martin Frost,
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and
Rep. John Linder, head of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, both promised to withhold money from any candidates who
attack the private lives of their opponents in the November
election races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen often, but it is certainly possible that it
would happen this year because of everything that has happened,''
said Frost. ``If they engage in it, they engage in it at their own
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brody, professor emeritus of political science at
Stanford University, said that ever since presidential candidate
Gary Hart was forced out of the presidential race in 1988,
politicians have been at risk of having their private lives
exposed. ``To some degree, the monster has been released earlier
on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Starr's report has pushed the level of exposure to
new extremes. ``Once you look at the president's sex life, every
politician's sex life is subject to examination,'' he said. ``None
of them are or should be immune from scrutiny, no matter how
unpleasant that scrutiny might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the revelations in recent days were not that
different from what has been standard practice in local campaigns
for years _ hiring what are called ``opposition researchers'' to
uncover dirt on an opponent and then leaking it to the press.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that now, the revelations are taking place in
the full glare of the national press, in the middle of an
unprecedented national scandal that at its heart deals with sex.
``Probably the reason it was not done earlier in Mr. Hyde's case is
that none of his opponents ever had the money to hire an opposition
researcher to dig up this stuff,'' said political scientist Mark
Petracca of the University of California at Irvine.

 Real Estate Guru Tries to Make REITs Less Vulnerable to Cycles   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Bill Sanders is probably the biggest name in real estate you never
heard of.
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you think of Chicago real estate magnates, the predatory
Sam Zell is usually the first name that comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While Zell is relatively accessible and outspoken, Sanders is
somewhat professorial and reclusive. So, when I learned that
Sanders would make a rare appearance at the NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities investment conference, it was worth a listen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sanders would pitch the long-term benefits of REITs _
which like everything else have taken a beating.
</P>
<P>
   REITs are mutual funds consisting largely of real estate
holdings such as apartments, hotels and shopping centers. And they
are required to pass almost all of their income from rents and fees
along to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that they are vulnerable to real estate cycles:
When commercial markets get overbuilt, rents go down and so do
yields to REIT shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is trying to make Security Capital REITs less vulnerable
to real estate cycles by linking them to other income-producing
businesses such as parking garages and refrigerated warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   These additional revenue streams provide insurance against real
estate busts, making his REITs less cyclical, Sanders says. ``Real
estate is moving from being an asset class to a (type of) operating
company,'' Sanders says.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is revered in national real estate circles. He founded
Chicago's LaSalle Partners in 1968, which was an innovator in
national tenant representation _ the practice of finding new space
for big corporations as they expand.
</P>
<P>
   As the national real estate picture got ugly, Sanders cashed out
and left LaSalle in 1989, opting for the arid climes of Sante Fe,
N.M. After a couple of years contemplating new approaches to
investing in real estate, Sanders launched his current venture,
Security Capital Group, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Security Capital has a market capitalization of $4.3
billion, and it oversees 17 real estate operating companies with a
combined market cap of about $21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanders is probably one of the leading visionaries in treating
real estate as an operating business ... and not a passive
investment,'' says Montgomery real estate analyst Chris Hartung.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Sanders is trying to take some of the guesswork out
of real estate by employing hundreds of well-paid executives,
researchers and financial tacticians.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as public real estate companies go, (Security
Capital's) management teams are very deep, and they've found new
avenues to grow revenues,'' says Montgomery's Hartung.
</P>
<P>
   REITs have been pounded much of this year as investors began to
sense that construction is overheating and another commercial real
estate glut is in the offing. Also, investors began to perceive
REITs not as long-term, income-producing investments (as they were
designed) but as growth equities. And when an explosive run-up in
REIT shares slowed, momentum investors bailed on the equities,
investors and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, REITs were more like bonds, with (income) and
some opportunity for growth,'' notes portfolio manager Eric Von der
Porten, whose Leeward Investments has a fund heavily weighted in
real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, we went through this (recent) period where they were
great growth vehicles,'' Von der Porten said.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-year period ended January 1998, the Morgan
Stanley REIT index was up 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the index is down 21 percent, and it may be a
good time for long-term investors to look at them as a way to
diversify their portfolios, says Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Global real estate ``is a multitrillion (dollar) private
industry in the very early stages of going public,'' said Sanders.
``You are going to see many changes.''

 Chiron's Lab Kit Unit Sold   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Chiron Corp. has agreed to sell its diagnostic division for $1.1
billion to concentrate on its core drug, vaccine and blood testing
businesses.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Emeryville firm will receive $1.1 billion from the sale of
Chiron Diagnostics Corp. to Bayer Group of Leverkusen, Germany. The
unit makes kits that clinical laboratories use to test for
conditions such as allergies and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While the move will cut the biotech firm's revenues in half, it
will increase its earnings by an estimated 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chiron rose 56 cents to close at $17.44 yesterday.
``Wall Street was happy to see (diagnostics) go and pleasantly
surprised at the price,'' said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with SG
Cowen &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The sales price was about twice the division's annual revenues,
compared to an analyst's estimated value of between 1 and 11/2
times revenues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Chiron will maintain its highly profitable HIV and hepatitis C
blood testing businesses and license rights to them to Bayer and
other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   While no decisions have been made, some proceeds from the sale
may be used for acquisitions, expansion of Chiron's drug and
vaccine businesses or a stock buyback, said Sean Lance, Chiron's
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron will also pay off $60 million in debt from the
diagnostics unit (Bayer assumed another $10 million of the
division's debt) and improve its data systems, including preparing
its computers for the year 2000, said Lance, who joined the company
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron's board will decide on the company's strategic direction
next month, said Lance. ``The money won't burn a hole in our
pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Although diagnostics was a mildly profitable business, Chiron
will see higher profits without it.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns analyst David Molowa estimates earnings per share
next year of 76 cents, compared to 71 cents had Chiron not sold the
diagnostics unit, a 7 percent difference. Revenues will drop to an
estimated $659 million from $1.3 billion with yesterday's sale, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance says Chiron lacked the scale necessary to compete against
diagnostics giants such as Rhone-Poulenc SA, Novartis AG and Roche
Holding AG, which recently purchased Boehringer Mannheim GmbH.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chiron's costs of goods sold in the diagnostics
division were about four times higher than the costs of competitor
Amgen when measured against each dollar of revenue generated, said
Mark Edwards, managing director of Recombinant Capital in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron will continue to receive substantial royalty payments
from the diagnostic products it sells to Bayer, said Lance.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is expected to close late this year, pending regulatory
approval. About 3,000 of Chiron's 6,500 employees work in the
diagnostics division, including 250 in Emeryville. The division is
based in Walpole, Mass. No significant layoffs are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron has disappointed Wall Street several times in recent
years by failing to bring profitable drugs to market. About 38
percent of analysts who follow Chiron maintain holds on the stock,
according to Bloomberg.

HEALING BEGINS WITH BIGGER LOSERS FOR LOCAL TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, we get a first-hand look at the difference between
college and pro football.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Sun Devils and the Cardinals. Arizona State is off to a
bad start (see national title hopes: dashed), losing to Washington
and Brigham Young, mostly because its secondary developed a
pathological fear of opposing receivers.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, ASU gets a breather, the 0-2 Eagles from North
Texas, who have been getting knocked down ever since they stepped
up to Division I.
</P>
<P>
   Then you have the Cardinals. Arizona is off to a bad start (see
playoff hopes: dashed), losing to Dallas and Seattle, mostly
because the West Coast offense went surfing.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Arizona, instead of a cream puff, must play the
0-2 Eagles from Philadelphia, who . . .
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Maybe there isn't much difference after all.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Beagles in town, that old fantasy football adage
comes to mind: You can always mine mediocre teams for good talent.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most fantasy football fans are like regular football
fans, that is to say, they're front runners. Everybody wants the
marquee players, like
 &UR; Brett Favre, &UR; Barry Sanders and  &UR; Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   But those guys are gone in the first few rounds. In fantasy
football, success depends on the lower picks, and then finding good
no-name guys during the season to replace all the players who break
important bones in Week Two (see  &UR; Brad Johnson, &UR; Dorsey Levens
and &UR; Troy Aikman: &UR; yee-ouch!)
</P>
<P>
   And there's no better place to find replacements than on bad or
overachieving teams.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Atlanta, San Diego and New Orleans. They're all
2-0, a tribute to luck, bad competition and a few good players who
want to win.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, before the season started, were you dying to draft
running back  &UR; Jamal Anderson, wide receiver
 &UR; Bryan Still or quarterback  &UR; Danny Wuerffel? How about quarterback
 &UR; Chris
 &UR; Chandler, tight-end  &UR; Freddie Jones or receiver  &UR; Sean Dawkins?
</P>
<P>
   If you were, stay out of my FFL league.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler and Anderson have carried the Falcons, Still and Jones
(not to mention 6-foot-5, 235-pound receiver  &UR; Mikhael Ricks) have
loads of potential for San Diego and Dawkins and Wuerffel hooked up
for 110 yards and a touchdown Sunday for the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   And the teams don't have to be overachievers to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   On the Eagles, I'd take a look at running back  &UR; Duce Staley, who
has done a good job filling in for oft-injured  &UR; Charlie Garner. And
don't forget the ageless  &UR; Irving Fryar, who is still catching balls
like he invented the forward pass.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, that's not true. Some other guy invented the forward
pass. Fryar just caught it.
</P>
<P>
   What about the much-maligned Chicago Bears? Quarterback  &UR; Erik
Kramer doesn't quicken the pulse, but he has the brains to get rid
of the ball. He also has good receivers in  &UR; Curtis Conway and
 &UR; Bobby Engram.
</P>
<P>
   Quick quiz: How sorry do you think the Packers are that they let
 &UR; Edgar
 &UR; Bennett slip away? Can you spell  &UR; Travis Jervey?
</P>
<P>
   Nice try. &QL; 
Tip of the week
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting  &UR; Jake Plummer gets back on track Sunday against the
Eagles at Sun Devil Stadium. Then again, I also bet that this whole
 &UR; Monica Lewinsky business would blow over. Don't forget, the
dreaded bye weeks start Sunday. Atlanta, Carolina, New Orleans and
San Francisco are off. &QL; 
Waiver wire
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins is a quality receiver who probably wasn't taken in your
draft. Cincinnati receiver  &UR; Darnay Scott is flourishing with  &UR; Neil
O'Donnell throwing to the right-colored jerseys. San Francisco
49ers tight-end  &UR; Irv Smith should get plenty of action. &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
This week it's running back  &UR; Chuck Levy, 49ers. Levy's numbers look
good (eight rushes, 44 yards, one touchdown), but he did it against
a pathetic Washington defense that gave up in the second half. &QL;

 Financier Penner Quits Capital Co.   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Ethan Penner, the flamboyant financier who helped create the $75
billion market for commercial mortgage-backed securities, resigned
yesterday as vice chairman of San Francisco's Capital Co. of
America after clashes with the firm's owners and rumors of mounting
losses.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only two months ago, Nomura Securities spun off Capital America
as a wholly owned subsidiary with $500 million of equity capital,
and Penner moved headquarters of the 420-employee business from New
York to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Penner hosted the firm's annual $3 million to $5
million gala under a tent at Treasure Island.
</P>
<P>
   Between quips from celebrities Robin Williams and tunes from Don
Henley, Joni Mitchell, Stevie Nix, Sheryl Crow and Michael
McDonald, many guests traded rumors that Capital America might be
in trouble and Penner might be on his way out.
</P>
<P>
   Capital America and other lenders who bundle securities and sell
them to investors have been under stiff financial pressure since
the world markets went into a tailspin.
</P>
<P>
   In their search for safety, investors are now demanding yields
on commercial mortgage bonds that are at least 1.25 percent to 1.35
percent higher than those on U.S. Treasury notes. That's an
increase of close to 50 basis points (half a percent) in two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Since the price of bonds moves inversely to their yields,
billions of dollars of commercial loans have nose-dived in value,
and that has put Capital America and its competitors in a bind.
</P>
<P>
   Capital America, for example, has about $4.5 billion in lines of
credit from Morgan Stanley and draws down these funds to make loans
and then pays them back as it sells the loans as bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the falling value of its loan portfolio and reserve
requirements imposed by Morgan Stanley, Capital America has
received two margin calls from the financial firm, one for $15
million a few weeks ago and another this week for $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined comment on rumors that it might have
suffered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Spokeswoman
Cameron Brown said, ``We have easily met the margin calls and are
very well capitalized,''
</P>
<P>
   Penner said he was quitting because of frustration with Nomura
management rather than financial problems. ``Everyone involved in
real estate finance has done poorly in the last 30 to 90 days,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Penner said it took him nearly 18 months to persuade Nomura to
spin off the commercial real estate unit he started in 1993. He
also said he wanted Nomura to open ownership to the employees but
``that still has not happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said that he long pleaded to turn the company
into a financial giant like GE Capital with a broad product line
spread around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every business has its cycles and I wanted to diversify our
revenue stream,'' said Penner. ``Finally I ran out of patience with
all the foot-dragging.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Penner gave up the title of chief executive and
day-to-day responsibilities to become vice chairman. But the
37-year-old executive, who earned $47 million last year, said that
didn't resolve his fundamental differences with management.
</P>
<P>
   Before quitting the company yesterday, Penner signed an
agreement not to compete in commercial real estate loan
originations for six months. But he said he already is exploring
other real estate finance opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Penner's friends and co-CEOs Brian Pilcher and Boyd Fellows
greeted Penner's decision with ``great sadness'' in a prepared
statement. They also promised that ``the house that Penner built
will carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the unit that Penner started in 1993 reportedly made
$200 million and was one of Nomura's most profitable businesses.
Stung by mounting financial problems in Japan, Nomura earned only
$322 million on $7.5 billion in revenues in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Capital America is not the only mortgage-backed securities
firm under pressure. Two weeks ago, WMF Group of Vienna , Va. took
a $30 million pretax loss selling $691 million in commercial
mortgage loans to a unit of Merrill-Lynch. Credit Suisse first
Boston also has dramatically scaled back its commercial mortgage
business.

PLUMMER THE PUNTER? MAYBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 and TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If the Cardinals have to use an emergency punter,
they might turn to an all-stater from Boise (Idaho) Capital High
School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go out there and do it 30 yards,'' starting
quarterback  &UR; Jake
 &UR; Plummer said. ``If they put me in to pooch punt, I'd be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin asked his players after Thursday's
practice if any of them had punted before.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin was interested because punter  &UR; Scott Player suffered a
strained right-calf muscle in the workout while running down the
field in a punt return drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something pop,'' Player said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he doesn't know the extent of the injury.
Special-teams coach  &UR; Al
 &UR; Everest said he hopes it's more of a cramp than anything.
</P>
<P>
   With Player's status unknown, the Cardinals likely will bring in
some punters today for a tryout. Among the available punters are
three veterans who attended a tryout with the San Francisco 49ers
earlier this week _  &UR; John
 &UR; Kidd, Greg Montgomery and  &UR; Reggie Roby. Another likely candidate is
rookie free agent  &UR; Marcus Williams, a former Arizona State punter
who was cut in training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the easiest thing in the world to do, to come right
in and punt,'' deep snapper  &UR; Trey Junkin said. '`I would think
they'd have to focus more on a veteran player who has been through
the wars. He knows what's fixing to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Player said he thinks he will be ready to play against the
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will loosen up,'' he said of his right leg. ``If
not, there will be 10 guys ready to go. But I need to be out there
playing and continue to prove myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tight end  &UR; Chris Gedney said he was asked if had punted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't, but I could,'' he said. ``I know I can drop-kick
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Place-kicker  &UR; Joe Nedney probably could punt in a pinch, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although no team wants to use its starting quarterback in
punting situations, Plummer has experience and would draw
comparisons to former ASU and Dallas Cowboys quarterback and punter
 &UR; Danny White.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kicked a knuckleball in high school,'' Plummer said. &QL; 
Ready and willing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Ronnie Anderson, the former Green Bay Packer who
signed two weeks ago, is anxious to get on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He has been inactive the first two games but could play Sunday
if starter
 &UR; Rob Moore's hamstring injury isn't healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here for a fashion show,'' Anderson said. ``I'm not
here to be running pass routes in practice and not getting a chance
to play. They brought me in for a reason. I worked too hard to get
where I am, not to play. I'll be ready to play; you can bet on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson thinks he knows the West Coast offense better than many
of his teammates because the Packers use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is terminology, and once you get that
down, it's second nature,'' he said. &QL; 
Staying put &QL; 
Don't believe the talk radio speculation that offensive coordinator
 &UR; Marc &UR; Trestman, who called plays from the field the first two
games, plans to move to the press box.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, he called plays from the field for the Cleveland
Browns, who reached the AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he was in the press box as coordinator of the San
Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, Vince (Tobin) thought it was pertinent for me to be on
the field to be close to Jake,'' Trestman said. '`I agree, because
there shouldn't be a buffer between Jake and I this year, and there
are adjustments to be made on the sideline. Plus, we have people
(other assistants) in the press box who can see from there what
we're doing.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moore and center  &UR; Aaron Graham, &UR; who has a calf injury, missed
their second consecutive day of practice. Moore said he expects to
play Sunday. Graham's status should be clarified after today's
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller, who missed Wednesday's workout because
of an ankle injury, returned to practice. &QL;

 Philippines Link Lost  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Philippine Airlines Inc., the only carrier with direct flights from
San Francisco International Airport to Manila, will shut down
Wednesday because of mounting financial losses and labor strife,
the airline announced yesterday.
<P>
   Saddened employees in the airline's downtown San Francisco
ticket office held onto hope that Philippine President Joseph
Estrada would broker a last-minute deal to save the struggling
carrier. Estrada was slated to meet today with Lucio Tan, chairman
and majority owner of the airline known as PAL. Tan owns 70 percent
of the company, while the government owns 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news stunned passengers like Rene de Guzman, who in the
middle of the frantic two weeks before his wedding suddenly had his
honeymoon plans tossed in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been planning this for a year and a half,'' said de
Guzman, who rushed to the ticket office after learning the news via
the Internet. ``I'm at the point where there's so much to do, you
just have to throw up your hands. What can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Tan said the grounding came after the Philippine Airlines
Employees Association reversed its decision to accept a labor
agreement that suspended the union's bargaining rights for 10
years. In exchange, the union would have received a 20 percent
stake in PAL and three seats on the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management has exhausted all efforts to keep the company
operational,'' PAL said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, the
insurmountable burden of continued losses has become too heavy for
the company to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Already hit with declining revenues from the Asian economic
crisis, the 57-year-old carrier was crippled by a pilots strike in
the second quarter and posted a loss of $50.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-day strike alone cost PAL about $1 million per day, said
Bert Lim, general manager of the carrier's U.S. and Canada
operations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Lim said the closure was not just a ploy to force the airline
unions to accept the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The revenues are not there,'' said an emotional Lim, a 32-year
PAL veteran. ``I'd rather have a job than dream of any salary
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   PAL was offering refunds but had not worked out any ticketing
agreements with other airline, so stranded passengers would have to
make their own travel arrangements, Lim said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to shutter the country's national air carrier came
even as Philippine Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was in
the Bay Area trying to convince business leaders and the Filipino
American community that her country has not been as hard hit by the
Asian economic crisis as neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a reputation for spotty service, PAL was popular among
the Bay Area's Filipino American residents because it was the only
carrier offering nonstop flights from San Francisco to Manila. PAL
also operates from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines dropped all service to Manila earlier this year
because it could not attract enough business travelers to make the
routes profitable, said spokesman Joe Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   United continues freighter service between the two cities, but
Hopkins said it was too early to say if United would try to pick up
passenger service once PAL is grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Airlines carried 10,000 passengers a month with
once-a-day flights, but that number plummeted to about 3,000 during
the strike, said SFO Airport Superintendent Tryg McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   Fer T. David, president of Luvy's Travel Service in San
Francisco, said he was trying to stay calm even though about 90
percent of his business is tied to the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd hate to lose Philippine Airlines,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco travelers, though, found during the PAL strike
that they could still fly on several other airlines with connecting
flights to Manila for comparable or cheaper prices.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy said the most popular alternative is Northwest Airlines's
route to Tokyo, connecting to another flight into Manila. Korean
Air and Singapore Airlines also have connecting flights from Seoul,
South Korea, while EVA Airways has a flight from Taipei. Cathay
Pacific Airways also serves Manila from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But David said without PAL, it will be harder finding seats on
those flights, especially during the heaviest Philippine travel
season in December. Many of his clients have already booked on PAL
for that month.

 BP Honoring Pledge to Slow Global Warming   By Alex Barnum  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The chief executive of British Petroleum, who last year became the
first oil industry leader to acknowledge the threat of global
warming, will outline an ambitious program today for cutting the
company's share of heat-trapping gases.
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEO John Browne is expected to announce today in a speech at
Yale University that the company, No. 3 in the oil industry, will
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases by 10 percent
below 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every producing oil field, every refinery, every chemical
plant'' owned by the oil industry giant will ``contribute to the
overall objective,'' Browne will announce, according to a
transcript of his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Browne has been outspoken on the threat of global warming ever
since he broke ranks with other oil industry leaders 17 months ago
and urged the industry to take steps to head off a catastrophic
shift in the world's climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no good preaching precautionary action unless you're
prepared to do something yourself. Now we're in a position to
announce a target,'' Browne says in his speech.
</P>
<P>
   And he notes that the target will have the force of the
company's other goals. ``In our terms, that target will now sit
alongside our financial targets. That means it is a promise, and as
with our financial targets, a promise is a personal commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, some of whom were skeptical that the
company would match its promises with concrete actions, praised the
announcement as courageous and farsighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What BP is going to announce is unprecedented,'' said Fred
Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund. The
Washington environmental group is advising BP on its
emission-reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   Krupp said the fact that BP is willing ``to follow forward and
cut emissions on the same timetable as the Kyoto agreement but
independent of whether it is ratified is an example of corporate
leadership that is historic.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's goal of reducing emissions by 10 percent is double
the 5 percent cut in emissions agreed to at last year's United
Nations conference on global warming, which was attended by roughly
160 nations. Only about 35 nations have signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although uncertainties exist, most scientists believe that
humans gradually are influencing the climate through the burning of
fossil fuels, which releases carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping
gases into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Keefe, senior vice president of the American Petroleum
Institute, said many oil industry executives have acknowledged the
threat of global warming and factored it into their business plans.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that Browne is the only one to support the
Kyoto accord. Most industry groups believe that the uncertainties
are too great to justify binding requirements among nations to
reduce heat-trapping gases.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech today, Browne will urge other companies to control
global warming despite the uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the science of climate change is not proven. The
science is provisional and perhaps always will be,'' Browne says in
his speech. ``But it would be unwise and potentially dangerous to
ignore the mounting concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne cites a number of examples of how the company will reduce
its emissions over 1990 levels:
</P>
<P>
   _ By developing ways to speed the flow of oil through the Trans
Alaska pipeline, the company is cutting out a number of pumping
stations along the way. The result is a 236,000-ton annual
reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Since 1995, the company's oil refineries and chemical plants
have cut flaring _ the burning off of waste gas _ by two-thirds.
That has reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   _ On pipelines used to transport oil from North Sea oil
platforms to shore, BP is installing devices to capture vapors that
escape when tankers are loading oil from the pipelines. That will
reduce emissions by 100,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, BP is undertaking the emissions reductions in a pilot
program that will involve 12 of the company's 90 business units, or
about 25 percent of its worldwide operations. Eight of the units
are in Europe, three are in the United States and one is in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the pilot program, the company has set up a trading
system with the help of the Environmental Defense Fund that will
enable each unit to buy and sell emissions rights to meet the
targets efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The trading system is similar to one that has been used
successfully in the United States to reduce sulfur dioxide
emissions from coal-burning power plants. Environmentalists
envision a similar system for controlling greenhouse gases
worldwide.

PARTISAN SQUABBLE STALLS VOTE ON RELEASE OF VIDEO 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Washington erupted in venomous partisan rancor
Thursday as Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee unexpectedly
delayed release of President Clinton's videotaped grand jury
testimony and other evidence that would be embarrassing to the
president.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After more than seven hours of contentious debate, the
closed-door meeting adjourned after Republicans shot down 11
attempts by Democrats to delay or limit the release of grand jury
material. The sharply divided committee will meet again Friday,
when Republicans are expected to succeed in making the tape public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're partisan, sure,'' said Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of
the 37-member panel. ``It was strongly partisan, vigorously
partisan. I prefer that it would go more smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate Thursday centered not on the videotape, but on the
2,000 pages of supporting documents from independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's report that contain more graphic details of
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Throughout the day, the
panel's 21 Republicans overruled repeated attempts by Democrats to
hold out parts of Lewinsky's sexually explicit testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Despite intense interest in the videotape, the committee spent
so much time squabbling over the other evidence that it never dealt
with the question of what to do with Clinton's grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the evidence came as San Francisco Bay Area
Democrats indicated they are united in holding off calls for the
president's resignation, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who said
she ``is not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of our democracy is that this is a government
that does not easily fall,'' said Feinstein, in her first extended
comments on the matter. ``People's discontent can be met through a
regular electoral process. When we elect a president, we do so for
four years. This isn't Italy, where you can have a government every
two months. . . . What has to be determined is whether the
definition of impeachment is met.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., urged lawmakers not to make a
decision on Clinton's fate too quickly. ``If you cavalierly draw
conclusions, you are not paying proper respect to our system of
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Democrats argue that the videotape will do
nothing to help determine whether Clinton's actions merit
impeachment, and they have fiercely opposed the release of the tape
and other documents on the grounds that it would serve no purpose
other than to humiliate him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, sounded a similar theme,
saying he had demanded that the tape be destroyed because ``the
only purpose of preserving this videotape . . . was to ensure its
public release and embarrass the president.'' His request was
dismissed by Starr, who pointedly contended that the tape contains
``evidence of a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the judiciary panel decides what evidence to release, the
material will probably not be made public for at least a day
because of the logistics of handling such a large volume of
documents, committee counsel Paul McNulty said. Television networks
are already setting aside time to air Clinton's four-hour testimony
as soon as it is available.
</P>
<P>
   The tape is expected to show Clinton alternately defensive,
angry and evasive in response to questions from prosecutors about
his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee will have even more material to look at
_ and probably release _ after Thursday's surprise announcement by
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark., that
she will turn over to the panel Clinton's videotaped testimony in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. Wright dismissed Jones'
suit, which provided the initial grounds for Starr's inquiry into
whether Clinton lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Wright agreed to relinquish the tape at the request of Hyde,
prompting the panel's ranking Democrat, John Conyers of Michigan,
to protest the decision to seek the tape without the consultation
of Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, Clinton's grand jury testimony is a
bigger concern, and Sacramento Democrat Robert Matsui, whose wife
once worked at the Clinton White House, said he is ``outraged'' by
its proposed release.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president should have some rights,'' Matsui said. Release
of the tapes ``serves no purpose at all. The (impeachment) inquiry
is by 435 of us, not the public. For the Judiciary Committee to try
to influence public opinion, to humiliate the president publicly,
would result in the public putting pressures on members to
impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   But one moderate Democrat, the Central Valley's Gary Condit,
argued strenuously to release all the remaining Clinton material
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said that all the material will eventually become public
and that it is better to get it out all at once than to let it
dribble out and prolong the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, all that information is eventually going to
get out, and it's better for us to have it now, to move the process
along,'' Condit said. ``Today we're talking the tape, last week it
was the report, next week it will be something else, and it just
becomes somewhat suspicious that somebody is parceling out to us
the information whenever they want us to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Without accusing Republicans directly, Condit said, ``Let's get
through that game. . . . We can't make this decision . . . unless
we all have the information. The American people need the
information, to see what we've got and then get to the decisions
that we have to make so that we can get on with our lives and
running the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left Washington for a Democratic fund-raiser in
Cincinnati, where he rallied supporters and criticized Washington's
fixation on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm concerned about is the rest of the people that live
in this country and one more time having Washington obsessed with
itself instead of America,'' Clinton said. He also assured the
crowd that he and Hillary Rodham Clinton are ``working on what we
need to be working on, and we're fine.''

HYDE ADULTERY STORY ANOTHER SCOOP FOR SALON 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON SWARTZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Salon's revelation that House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde conducted an adulterous affair in the
1960s was just the latest political news exclusive for the upstart
online publication.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-year-old news organization _ started by former San
Francisco Examiner reporters and editors _ has gained national
attention for breaking several news scoops about independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the magazine's relentless coverage of Starr
prompted its critics to suggest that it was being used by the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely false,'' said Gary Kamiya, executive editor of
Salon. ``We are in no way affiliated with the White House. We have
blasted Clinton from every angle, and we've been hard on Starr. We
call them as we see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon has emerged as something of a sophisticated online
counterweight to the muckraking Drudge Report. In March, it ran a
series of articles on David Hale, a key Whitewater witness who
allegedly received payments from conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, it detailed the Arkansas Project, an expensive,
multiyear investigation designed to ``dig up dirt'' on President
Clinton, according to Kamiya.
</P>
<P>
   But Salon has been equally hard at times on the president for
his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
the focus of the Starr report. Conservative columnist David
Horowitz last week called for Clinton to step down.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, Salon has been closely associated
with reports fiercely questioning the nature of the Starr report,
according to media watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone can report anything on (the Starr
investigation) without being accused of having a political
agenda,'' said Beverly Kees, editor and program director of the
Freedom Forum Pacific Coast Center, a foundation dedicated to media
education. ``Any paper that told the cigar story is not in a
position to take the moral high ground over the Hyde story.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon editors ``agonized'' over the story and were ``leery''
about delving into Hyde's private life, Kamiya said.
</P>
<P>
   But the publication decided to run the story, it explained in an
editorial, because ``Starr opened up his Republican supporters to
sexual scrutiny the moment he delivered a 445-page report to
Congress that was nothing more than a sensationalistic accounting
of the president's affair designed to drive him from the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr's investigation is the true scandal, a political
lynching party that, finding nothing of legal import in Whitewater,
quick-changed into the most expensive and tawdry sex probe in
American history, sullying the presidency and the nation's world
standing in the process,'' the editorial concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Salon employs 60 people in San Francisco and New York. Its
columns and features are syndicated in about 30 North American
newspapers, including the New York Daily News, Hartford Courant and
Toronto Globe and Mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The publication is a salon in the truest sense _ it is a
gathering place and focal point for discussion,'' spokesman Patrick
Hurley said. The magazine has also won kudos for colorful and
lively features by contributors such as sex therapist Camille
Paglia and humorist Garrison Keillor.
</P>
<P>
   Among Salon's investors is Frank Hambrecht, a Democratic booster
who is co-founded of the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist investment banking firm
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the online publication has received financial
backing from Adobe Systems Inc. and ASCII Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House officials denied during a senior staff
meeting Wednesday that they had worked with Salon on the story.
</P>
<P>
   Kamiya said Salon got the story from Norm Sommer, a Florida
retiree who is friends with Fred Snodgrass, the former husband of
Cherie Snodgrass, who had an affair with Hyde. The story was
confirmed by other sources, Kamiya said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who has admitted to the affair, vowed the report will not
affect any impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Despite raves about his Whitewater stories, Salon's coverage of
Hyde has generated criticism because several mainstream
publications chose not to run the Hyde account.
</P>
<P>
   Sommer, 72, a lifelong Democrat who served as a Henry Wallace
delegate at the 1948 presidential convention, said he had called 57
journalists over six months in an effort to publicize the story
Fred Snodgrass had told him.
</P>
<P>
   He said reporters for the Los Angeles Times and Boston Globe
expressed interest but were overruled by editors. Sommer said he
also called the White House and Democratic National Committee for
guidance but that ``nobody would speak to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle McManus, Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times,
said in a statement that the paper passed on the story because ``We
don't write about politicians' sex lives unless they come up in the
context of a story about an issue of legitimate public concern,
such as sexual harassment or abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked into the allegations about Rep. Hyde and found no
issue of legitimate public concern,'' McManus said.

STARR WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE PERJURY BY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARRIET CHIANG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr may have convinced most of America that President
Clinton lied under oath, but he would have a difficult time proving
in a court of law that the president is guilty of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have chastised Clinton for ``legal hairsplitting,''
but former prosecutors say he should not be faulted for covering
himself legally. They point out that perjury is a highly technical
crime that requires such an airtight case that prosecutors rarely
pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to get convictions on perjury,'' said San
Francisco attorney James Brosnahan, who was a deputy in the
Iran-Contra special prosecutor's office. ``I don't think Ken Starr
understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the case wound up before a criminal jury, ``I think it would
be problematic,'' agreed Joseph Russoniello, the former U.S.
attorney for Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report focuses on whether Clinton repeatedly lied under
oath about his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. Five of the 11 possible grounds he lays out for
impeachment are perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what action Congress takes, there is strong
speculation that the prosecutor will attempt to indict Clinton for
lying under oath. Several legal experts said federal law allows
presidents to be charged while still in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very dangerous for Bill Clinton to accept the bait when
they say, `Come on, admit it,''' said a former federal prosecutor
who did not want to be named. ``If he admits he perjured himself,
Ken Starr has a slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   A conviction under federal law carries a maximum sentence of
five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Perjury charges, when they are brought at all, arise in
conjunction with other crimes. In those unusual cases when someone
is charged solely with perjury, it often involves a high-profile
figure.
</P>
<P>
   The California attorney general has not pursued a perjury charge
since the O.J. Simpson case, when Mark Fuhrman, the former Los
Angeles police detective, pleaded no contest in 1996 to charges
that he lied in court about using a racial epithet in the previous
10 years. He was sentenced to three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's case, Starr has targeted the president's testimony
before a grand jury and his deposition in the sexual harassment
suit brought by Paula Jones, which was ultimately dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, a person who makes an inaccurate statement
under oath is not necessarily guilty of perjury. The prosecution
must demonstrate that a person knew that the statement was
inaccurate and intended to make a false statement _ two
requirements that are often raised by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   A 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision makes it clear that an
unresponsive or misleading statement, or even a half-truth, is not
enough for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is on the questioner to pin the witness down to
specific objects of the questioner's inquiry,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   To successfully prosecute a perjury charge, the questioner must
verbally box in the defendant so that the false statement can be
interpreted in only one way. Any doubt about whether the person
understands the exact meaning of the question could torpedo the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crime of words,'' said Brosnahan, who has both
prosecuted and defended people in perjury cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to make a perjury case is to ask the question 10
different ways,'' said Brosnahan, who has called in linguistics
professors to aid his defense of clients charged with perjury.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the questioning may be the key to Clinton's
defense in connection with his civil deposition. Lawyers who have
read the transcripts said Jones' lawyers failed to ask any
follow-up questions of Clinton after he denied having sexual
relations with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they nailed him in an accurate enough manner
to support a perjury case,'' said Jerry Ladar, a San Francisco
criminal defense lawyer who is a former federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Rory Little, a professor at Hastings College of the Law in San
Francisco and a former associate deputy attorney general under
Janet Reno, regards the possibility of perjury before the grand
jury as a far more serious offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you ordinarily prosecute someone for lying about a
private affair?'' he asked. ``Probably never, because it's
private.''
</P>
<P>
   But if a public official continued to evade the truth after a
parade of witnesses testified about an affair, Little said he would
press forward with the perjury charge. ``It's the person's
arrogance that makes prosecutors want to indict.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Clinton's biggest problem now is simultaneously
dealing with his political and his legal problems. Clinton must
deal with his political future, but he should also keep in mind
that he is likely to end up in court. ``This isn't some idle law
school textbook argument,'' said a former federal prosecutor.
``This is real.''

SAN ANDREAS FAULT KICKS UP TINY TEMBLORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Andreas Fault is stirring again beneath
Parkfield, and earth scientists are watching closely to see what
happens next.
</P>
<P>
   A series of six small earthquakes rippled gently through the
ground of the Monterey County village Thursday and Wednesday, and
instruments along the fault there showed ``subtle but significant''
earth movements, said William H. Bakun of the U.S. Geological
Survey in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   People in the area said they felt nothing, but the mini-temblors
intrigued the Geological Survey's seismologists who for years have
conducted an experiment there as they try to tease out the meaning
of the fault's behavior and possibly predict a real shaker whose
magnitude might well reach 6 or larger.
</P>
<P>
   Earthquake records show that quakes of at least magnitude 6 have
shaken the Parkfield area roughly every 22 years since 1857, with
the last one hitting in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The first of this week's six temblors was recorded at 9:17 a.m.
Wednesday with a magnitude of 2.6, and the most recent, at 8:42
a.m. Thursday, had a magnitude of 2.9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know any of them happened,'' said Bonnie Speer
at the Parkfield Inn Thursday, ``but we're used to it all, and I
don't know that anyone around here has felt anything this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, seismic experts worldwide have followed the
Geological Survey's ``Parkfield Experiment,'' as scientists have
installed more and more subtle detection equipment on both sides of
the fault there.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an elaborate laser Geodimeter shoots beams of red and
blue light against mirrors on the fault's opposite side to measure
the slightest deformation of the ground. Creep meters, tilt meters
and strain gauges cross the fault on the surface, while
seismometers buried more than 600 feet deep measure quakes 10 times
smaller than anything detectable on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Wells pick up tiny changes in groundwater levels and
magnetometers constantly measure changes in the strength of the
local magnetic field, which might cause the fault's movements.
</P>
<P>
   One of the five creep meters installed at Parkfield has measured
a significant increase in the rate of slippage as the two sides of
the ground along the fault have slid almost imperceptibly past each
other this week, Bakun said. But it is still too early to infer
what is happening within the fault's complex geology deep
underground, where the six quakes were all centered a little more
than four miles down.
</P>
<P>
   Their epicenters, about six miles northwest of Parkfield, were
all within a half-mile of the spot around a formation known as
Middle Mountain, where two quakes with magnitudes of 3.5 were
recorded a year ago. A larger quake with a 4.7 magnitude struck in
October 1992 in the same location, and it initiated a brief
official alert for an imminent magnitude 6 temblor that never
happened.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A private matter
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Here's a story from long ago, a small
town's tale of love, sex and six-guns ...
</P>
<P>
   A rich man's daughter had become involved with a married man who
was in the process of a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The outraged father forbade that she ever see the man again. Her
brother, who could be a hothead at times, warned her that he
intended to enforce their father's orders.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the brother surprised them one night at her
lover's apartment. Tempers exploded. Gunfire erupted. Her lover
fell wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, it was only a flesh wound. Such was the target that had
presented itself, most fleshy.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrived. An ambulance was called. The wounded man was
taken to the hospital. The brother was taken to jail. Bail was
quickly arranged by the family.
</P>
<P>
   The father, as powerful as he was prominent, made sure nothing
would appear in the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the wounded man was scooted out of town and checked
into a big-city hospital under a disguised name.
</P>
<P>
   After the victim refused to press charges, police let the
incident drop, and it should have ended there.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the big-city newspapers had received a tip about the
story. The editor cared not a whit that it involved a wealthy
family.
</P>
<P>
   All the better to sell newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   As reporters began searching high and low for the victim, the
family began to seek counsel. What should they do? What could they
do?
</P>
<P>
   If there was to be a confrontation, wise heads advised them, let
it be on their own terms. Turn the tables. Surprise the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Their attorney did exactly that, marching the shooting victim,
still badly limping, into the office of the big-city newspaper,
unannounced and demanding to see the editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand you've been looking for me,'' the man told the
editor. ``Well, here I am. What I can I do for you?''
</P>
<P>
   The editor called in a reporter, and together they quizzed him
at length.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there had been a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had been wounded, but not seriously.
</P>
<P>
   No, he had not pressed charges, nor did he intend to.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning went on for an hour or more. The answers were
always the same.
</P>
<P>
   This was a private matter. It was being handled privately.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the editor threw up his hands and threw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the reporter, he said, ``If the guy who got his butt
shot off doesn't care, why should we?''
</P>
<P>
   End of story.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is recounted simply for the purpose of saying this:
</P>
<P>
   If the wife of the man who was involved with Monica Lewinsky has
forgiven him, why shouldn't we?
</P>
<P>
   P.S. For the record, the rich man's daughter married the man she
loved. It was predicted the marriage wouldn't last six months. But
they remained husband and wife for more than 30 years, separated at
last only in death.

MCDOWELL PLAYS THE DARK SIDE OF FANTASY ISLAND

 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 With color slide and black and white photo of Malcolm McDowell in
``Fantasy Island.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    ``It's a very interesting part _ rather dark with great
emotional variety. I get to do it every week. I get paid for it and
we're shooting it in Hawaii. What the hell else is there to talk
about, really?''
 &HT;    What indeed?
 &HT;    Malcolm McDowell, the young English rebel of such classic films
as ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), ``If'' (1968), ``O Lucky Man''
(1973) and ``Britannia Hospital'' (1982) is 55 now. Silver haired,
slim, just right to step into the white shoes of ``Fantasy
Island'''s Mr. Roarke. The show debuts on ABC Sept. 26.
 &HT;    Remember Roarke (Ricardo Montalban) in the l978-l984 series
welcoming guests to his tropical island with his sidekick Tattoo
(Herve Villechaize)?
 &HT;    Well they're reviving the concept but with a few differences,
starting with Roarke. When McDowell's Roarke is getting dressed,
riffling through a wardrobe full of white suits, he selects the
only black one. This is not the smiling, charming, benevolent
Montalban version anymore.
 &HT;    ``He's much darker and edgier,'' grins McDowell, ``not
saccharine, not pontificating.''
 &HT;    McDowell says his first reaction to stepping onto the new island
was one of horror and he had to be persuaded to look at a script.
``I took the part because it was dark. I liked the producer's sort
of 'Men in Black' approach to it.''
 &HT;    Travelers to this ``Fantasy Island'' will first pass through a
mysterious travel agency run by a couple of veteran actors _
``Picket Fences''' Fyvush Finkel and movie great Sylvia Sydney.
Then on to the island where their fantasies will be fulfilled
though they may not always like it.
 &HT;    The old Roarke made sure his guests had a pleasant time.
McDowell's Roarke believes firmly in the old saying: ``Be careful
what you wish for _ you may get it.''
 &HT;    He's attended by a strange concierge and a bellhop played by
Louis Lombardi (``Natural Born Killers'') and ``Frasier'''s Edward
Hibbert, both of whom keep dropping clues that they are on the
island to pay for their sins. Their female colleague Ariel played
by ``Twin Peak'''s Madchen Amick can morph into any female form to
fulfill any fantasy.
 &HT;    Is the island really the afterlife, as some think?
 &HT;    ``We're all dead, yeah,'' laughs McDowell collapsing in an easy
chair in a bungalow suite at in the Pasadena Ritz. ``But they make
the afterlife seem quite palatable, with these gorgeous babes
coming out of the water waving at the camera.''
 &HT;    But do Roarke and his crew inhabit heaven or hell? ``When I show
it to friends in Europe,'' says McDowell, ``they see Roarke as God.
When I show it to Americans they think he's the Devil. What do you
think that says about the two cultures?''
 &HT;    Married to his third wife Kelly, McDowell has two teenage
children from his marriage to Mary Steenburgen, now Mrs. Ted
Danson. He lives in homes in Los Angeles, the Ojai Valley (50 miles
north of L.A.) and in Tuscany.
 &HT;    A slightly sinister air is notably absent in person but has
served him well in his long career. He's made over 70 movies, some
of them among the greatest British movies ever made. And he's been
kept busier than most of the screen's nice guys.
 &HT;    Just by casting him as Roarke the producers are sending a
message about the kind of show this will be. ``Of course this
Roarke is malevolent,'' says McDowell, ``There are no boundaries
and so many layers to him. Somewhere there is a glimmer of
something, but God knows how deep or locked away it is. He is
all-knowing, all-seeing. He is this Machiavellian character.''
 &HT;    The original ``Fantasy Island'' was made cheaply in and around
Los Angeles, but this one is first cabin all the way. The pilot was
shot on three Hawaiian Islands. Not a bad place to go to work every
day.
 &HT;    And if McDowell ever gets to fulfill his own fantasy, the actor
has one all lined up and ready to fly:
 &HT;    ``When I was in my early teens, I lived near a race track in
England. And they had the British Grand Prix. My heroes were
drivers like Stirling Moss and Mike Hawthorne. So my fantasy would
be to be in a 1950s race car in a race with those great champions
and beat them.''

A GUIDE TO THE QUICKIE STARR PAPERBACKS  
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flytrap aficionados will need to purchase one of the three
paperback versions of the Starr report, which hit the stores
Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They are Pocket Books ($5.99), Prima ($9.99) and the Washington
Post's Public Affairs edition ($10).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how they match up:
</P>
<P>
   Format: The Washington Post edition) is a trade paperback, with
bigger-sized pages and a more pliant spine. Unlike the other two
editions, it can be stretched out and laid on a table while you
munch a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Introductory material: In the Pocket Books version, Phil Kuntz
of the Wall Street Journal writes a five-page intro that is an
economical-but-thorough explanation of how a 1992 New York Times
story about Whitewater by Jeff Gerth led to a 1998 report about
Monica Lewinsky by Ken Starr. This is precisely what readers will
need to be reminded about, especially in a few years, when the
details become hazy in everybody's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Fairness: The Pocket Books and Post versions both reprint the
preliminary rebuttal from Clinton's lawyer. The Prima version does
not. None of the three paperback versions contains the rebuttal
Clinton's lawyers produced after they actually had a chance to read
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Did Journalists Get Rich Off This?: The Pocket Books version
earned Kuntz an undisclosed sum, but he won't be getting royalties.
The Post reporters whose articles are being reprinted in the Post
edition won't get paid at all, because they don't own their
stories. The Prima version contains no material from journalists at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Overall Winner: The Post version, entirely on the grounds that
it's a trade paperback. But the Pocket Books version is the more
practical choice for those who don't need to worry about eyestrain.
The Prima version places a distant third.

THE PROPER DEGREE OF PANIC 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the rush to describe the recent turmoil as simply a fit of
collective market irrationality, it's easy to overlook some
important truths that underlie what's happened, not just in Asia
but also in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of this is Brazil. Last week Brazil looked like
it was on the verge of devaluing its currency. This week the
country has enjoyed a remarkable stock-market rally that's sent the
market up 45 percent in three days. (A rally that itself smacks of
some hysteria, it has to be said.)
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is obviously key to the entire future of Latin America,
and for that matter of the global economy. And under President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the country has made a remarkable
recovery from the days of hyperinflation and high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the punishment Brazil has taken at the hands of
currency traders in the past few months must have been difficult to
bear. And it's understandable why economists like Joseph Stiglitz
of the World Bank would argue that investors willing to put their
money into Brazil are demanding interest rates too high for the
small amount of risk involved.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that Brazil in some sense was asking for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, after pushing through a constitutional
amendment that would allow him to run for president again, Cardoso
promised to push through spending cuts (or, more unlikely, tax
increases) that would trim the country's budget deficit. Almost
none of those cuts have been realized, in part because Cardoso is
in an election campaign and doesn't want to alienate anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Brazil's budget deficit is now 9 percent of the
country's GDP. The equivalent for the United States would be a
budget deficit of $630 billion. With a deficit that size, is it
really surprising that interest rates are high, or that currency
traders are skeptical of the value of the Brazilian real? For all
the good that he's done, Cardoso has essentially been living on
IOUs for the past year. At some point those were bound to come due.

WHY ECONOMISTS AREN'T ALL RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  By HERBERT STEIN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You are falling into a common error (if you) think that
economists know how to manage investments in the stock market, or
other markets, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   I was recently at a party where there was a superstar, whose
name I will not mention, but who undoubtedly had a very large
income. I was introduced to him as an economist, and he immediately
said to me, ``If you're an economist tell me why I don't have more
money.'' I tried to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists have been good private investors. J.M. Keynes is
said to have been one of them. I have heard of a few living ones
who have made a lot of money by their investments. But there are
also a lot of liquor storeowners and anesthesiologists who have
made a lot of money by their investments.
</P>
<P>
   If economists, qua economist, knew how to make a lot of money
there wouldn't be so many of them grading papers in obscure
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember ever seeing the name of an economist on the
list of the 100 richest people. David Rockefeller may have been an
exception. He had a Ph.D. in economics from the University of
Chicago. But that isn't how he became rich.
</P>
<P>
   Markets and the economy are two different things. Maybe the
point is that economists are not capable of talking about anybody's
money but are capable, or feel themselves capable, of talking about
everybody's money. Everybody's money being, of course, the subject
of fiscal and monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   I often wonder whether we are really capable of talking about
that. But everything is relative. Economists may not be very good
at talking about fiscal and monetary policy; they are just better
at it than other people.

VICE IS NICE  
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVE CHAPMAN  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legal gambling brings out the latent puritan in many Americans.
The right detests gambling because it promises something for
nothing. The left hates it because it enriches corporations by
emptying the pockets of the gullible lower classes.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to detest legal gambling--everyone, that is,
except the public. Americans spend nearly $51 billion a year on
various games of chance--twice as much as they spend on movies,
plays, operas and spectator sports combined.
</P>
<P>
   Now gambling's place at the table is threatened by the puritans,
who've used their political muscle to help establish a National
Gambling Impact Study Commission. They hope its June 1999 report
will prove their claims that gambling wrecks lives, stimulates
crime, saps local economies, mercilessly exploits human weakness,
and sustains itself through bribery and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A review, then, and a brief refutation of their best arguments:
</P>
<P>
   People Become Addicted to Gambling: The critics warn of an
exploding epidemic of addicted gamblers, but a recent study by
researchers at Harvard Medical School's Division on Addictions
argues against this notion. An estimated 1.6 percent of American
adults will become pathological gamblers, compared with 6.2 percent
who will succumb to drug addiction and 13.8 percent who will become
alcoholics. A study published last year claimed that the
legalization of casinos causes an increase in suicide rates.
Indeed, Nevada's suicide rate is the highest in the country, double
the national average. But New Jersey, home of Atlantic City, enjoys
the lowest rate. Mississippi, the South's gambling Mecca, falls
slightly below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Gambling Fosters Crime: Exhibit A for the prosecution is
Atlantic City, which went from being No. 50 among American cities
in crimes per capita to being No. 1 after the arrival of casinos.
This increase fails to account for the city's huge influx of
tourists, who on any given day outnumber residents by more than
2-to-1. As noted in a study by University of Maryland Professor
Peter Reuter, homicides barely increased at all, despite the influx
of outsiders, and assaults rose only about as fast as the average
daily population. The real increases have come in robbery and
aggravated assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, though, it's impossible to detect any consistent
relationship between the existence of casinos and the prevalence of
lawlessness. Jeremy Margolis, who headed the Illinois State Police
when the state introduced 13 riverboat casinos, has testified that
``crime has not been a problem.'' Looking at rural Colorado, Texas
A&AMP;M scholar Patricia Stokowski found that with the arrival of
casinos, ``the likelihood of becoming a crime victim in Gilpin
County has decreased.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal Gambling Causes Corruption: Casino operators are portrayed
as the Typhoid Marys of political corruption, the usual evidence
being their lavish bankrolling of politicians. But of the 16
industries that gave ``soft money'' to the two major political
parties in 1996, the gambling industry ranked 16th, according to
the ultrafastidious Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Casino owners are right to take a greater-than-average interest
in the workings of government. 1) Until recently, their industry
was illegal almost everywhere. 2) They cannot operate without
hard-to-get government licenses. 3) Their many enemies want to
legislate them out of existence.
</P>
<P>
   As long as we're talking about corruption and exploitation, we
should not forget that the wickedest gambling sharpies don't live
in Las Vegas but in the state capitals, where the lotteries are
headquartered. The lotteries' pitiful payout--about half of all
money wagered, compared with 92 percent or so at your average
casino--rightly draws cries of outrage. If the critics were
interested in remedying the lotteries, they'd have the states
repeal their monopolies on these games and let the market compete
away the excess profits.
</P>
<P>
   Whose Life Is It, Anyway?: Gambling's opponents never tire of
reciting statistics and anecdotes to suggest that the costs of
legalized gambling dwarf any possible benefits. But they fail to
count the central benefit--the diversion and pleasure it provides
to millions of people. Until 1978, casinos were accessible only to
people with the means to travel to Las Vegas. The relaxation of
prohibitionist laws has brought them within easy reach of most of
the American public, and the public has voted for them with its
feet. The overwhelming majority of these patrons gamble responsibly
and impose no burden on their fellow citizens. They treat games of
chance as exactly that--games.
</P>
<P>
   Yet critics insist on portraying gamblers as a pitiable class of
suckers, enslaved by fantasies of unearned wealth. It's hard to see
why. No one accuses movie theaters or gardening-supply outlets of
ruthlessly exploiting the weaknesses of clients who turn over their
money only because they lack the self-control to refuse. Most
people who patronize the lottery, the track, or the slot machines
end up poorer, with nothing to show for the transaction--which is
also true of people who eat in restaurants and attend concerts. To
incurable bluenoses, gambling is an infuriating scam. But why
assume gamblers are being fooled? It's more reasonable to assume
that they know they will probably lose but are happy to take that
chance for 1) the pleasure of playing and 2) the chance of coming
out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that's a decision they ought to be free to make,
unimpeded by moralists and social reformers who think ordinary
people cannot be trusted to look after their own interests. If
gambling were the grim scourge portrayed by its opponents, it would
not have gone from a contemptible vice to an innocent diversion in
a single generation. People who have visited casinos and played the
lottery have seen that misery and damnation don't necessarily
follow, either for themselves or for surrounding communities.
Gambling has become a widespread pastime for the simple and
unassailable reason that it adds to the sum of human happiness.
That's reason enough to leave it alone.

 &HT;    The Internet is finally a viable tool for enthusiasts who like
to plan their own travel. Many Web-based services are now capable
of accepting credit cards for purchases, and the proliferation of
faster modems has meant that glacial waits for downloads are now
largely a thing of the past.
 &HT;    Here are some of the better sites around for those who want to
get somewhere fast.
 &HT;    ----
 &HT;    There's been a proliferation of Web-based travel agencies, many
of which are now routinely used by business travelers. But leisure
travelers who are savvy enough can use them to their own advantage
and sidestep airline reservationists and conventional travel
agents.
 &HT;    Virtually all of them have some sort of fare-finder that enables
the traveler to enter flights and come up with fare and carrier
options in short order. In addition to airfare, the following sites
allow the traveler to book a car rental and a hotel as well.
 &HT;    Start with BizTravel.com (www.biztravel.com), which has become a
favorite of business travelers. It allows user to create very
detailed traveling profiles of themselves and manage their
frequent-flier programs. It has a good, fast fare-finder and has a
wide-ranging data base of hotels and car-rental agencies as well.
 &HT;    Microsoft Expedia (www.expedia.com) is one of the best-known
on-line travel agencies around, with a good fare finder and a
pretty sophisticated search engine that allows users to look for
the best-priced flights and scroll through scheduled flights
easily.
 &HT;    Flifo (www.flifo.com) makes it easy to set up a detailed
itinerary. The fare-finder is speedy and the free ticket delivery
is a bonus.
 &HT;    Preview Travel (www.previewtravel.com), the preferred travel
service for America On-Line (AOL) members, is also one of the best
and the fastest for leisure travelers. Users have access to a
responsive fare-finder that ranks flights not only by price but
also provides aircraft model and up-to-the-minute availability of
seats in all classes.
 &HT;    The Trip.com (www.thetrip.com) is an all-purpose travel site
that allows users to not only book flights but to track them as
well. Waiting for someone to arrive at the local airport? This site
gives real-time locations of flights enroute, something no airline
toll-free number can do.
 &HT;    Travelocity (www.travelocity.com) was one of the first on-line
travel agencies and is linked to SABRE, one of the systems used by
professional travel agents. But it's easier to use than its parent
and is quite good at finding low fares.
 &HT;    There's also 1travel.com (1travel.com), which has a somewhat
less sophisticated fare-finder than the others and still requires a
phone call to complete a transaction. What makes this site
noteworthy is that it provides consolidator flights, a boon for
anyone looking for discounted airfares to Europe and Asia.
 &HT;    For hotels alone, two discount hotel brokers who can help
travelers ease the sting of big-city hotel prices are Hotel
Reservations Network (www.180096hotel.com) and Quikbook
(www.quikbook.com).
 &HT;    Some of the airline's own Web sites are useful for rooting out
deals. The leading site must be American Airlines' (www.aa.com),
which began offering Net SAAver fares a couple of years ago. These
are last-minute, round-trip deals that are posted every week to
subscribers via e-mail. International deals are listed on Mondays,
domestic deals on Wednesdays. The e-mail subscription is free.
 &HT;    This site is a clearinghouse for unsold tickets, most of which
originate at the airline's hub cities of Chicago, Dallas and Miami.
These deals are good for long weekend travel from either Thursday
to Monday or Friday to Monday or Tuesday.
 &HT;    American also offers discounted first-class fares every week and
usually has additional short-lived deals from American Airlines
Vacations.
 &HT;    Other airline sites worth a look are U.S. Airways
(www.airways.com) and Continental (www.flycontinental.com) for
weekly e-mail specials.
 &HT;    Both TWA (www.twa.com) and Cathay Pacific
(www.cathaypacific(TILDE)air.com) send them out periodically. The
latter, of course, still has what is probably the greatest airfare
deal of the year, an $899 Asia Pass that includes round-trip
airfare from New York to Hong Kong and unlimited travel to the 18
cities that Cathay serves within a 30-day period, including Bali
(Indonesia), Bangkok (Thailand) and Seoul (Korea).
 &HT;    For anyone who's contemplating mountain biking in the Lake
Geneva region of Switzerland or hiking in the Rockies, there's
GORP, the Great Outdoors Recreation Pages (www.gorp.com), with
traveler's tales about biking, hiking and fishing and listings of
dozens of adventure-travel companies.
 &HT;    Thinking about going around the world? High Adventure Travel
(www.highadv.com) offers dozens of sample itineraries and allows
users to plan their own world jaunt on-line.
 &HT;    Council Travel (www.ciee.org) and Air Brokers International
(www.airbrokers.com) are also good sources for would-be
round-the-world travelers _ or for anyone who'd like to dream about
such a trip.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    What could possibly be more romantic than an island cruise on
board a Greek caique?
 &HT;    Beverly Shaver of El Cerrito, Calif., and her 32 fellow
Elderhostelers visualized that the tiny vessel scheduled to take
them around the Aegean to explore the fabled Cyclades Islands would
be a combination of the Bounty (as in Mutiny) and a Sultan's
barque. Even the ship's name _ the Zeus III _ conjured idyllic
images.
 &HT;    ``Of course the reality, when we first glimpsed her bobbing at
the Pireaus mooring, resembled neither Bounty nor barque,'' Shaver
says. ``One-hundred-sixteen feet long, she was a chunky blend of
Manhattan Island ferry and tugboat-with-mast painted red and
white.''
 &HT;    From Piraeus, the port for Athens, the Zeus set a course due
east, sailing on a serene sea _ no seasick stomachs here. Forty
nautical miles and four hours out, it glided into snug St. Nicholas
Bay on the tranquil little island of Kea.
 AN UNTAINTED WORLD  
 &HT;    Modern Kea is a typical Cycladic village with small sugarcube
houses lining narrow, winding, stone-paved streets. Here one can
find the unspoiled little Grecian paradise always promised in
brochures, Shaver says, and which is so seldom delivered. Here, as
on almost all the Cyclades, are 2,000-year-old ruins and sparkling
beaches for snorkeling and swimming.
 &HT;    The passengers' first dinner aboard the Zeus consisted of
chicken broth thickened with rice and eggs, prawns with rice,
artichokes and broad beans in oil with dill and lemon. The feast
was topped off with honey-and-nut cake with custard filling.
 &HT;    These Elderhostelers were now pretend-patrons of the Zeus'
gourmet restaurant. A deckhand named Demos, who only hours earlier
was seen wearing greasy overalls and cursing a jammed winch, was
transformed into a dignified, cummerbunded waiter. Passengers and
crew would treat one another with the formal politeness due their
respective, changeable roles.
 &HT;    Captain Voul-garikis urged everyone to try Retsina, the famed
liqueur. But of course, they agreed, eager to have the whole
glorious Greek experience.
 &HT;    Retsina, Shaver found, was clearly an acquired taste.
``Retsina,'' said the group wag, ``tastes like pure turpentine
that's been strained through a fisherman's sock.''
 &HT;    A pattern was quickly established. Zeus passengers were hooked
on listening to lectures, reading Greek novels and exploring the
wonders of the island. Watching the sun set became a ritual, and
dogged efforts were made to master Greek dancing.
 THE SALON CLASSROOM  
 &HT;    In the mornings, the salon became a classroom where
anthropologist Akis Papataxiarchis held forth for several hours
each day before reaching the next port.
 &HT;    Staying almost always in sight of land, the Zeus scudded from
island to island _ places such as Tinos, Delos, Ios, Mykonos,
Naxos, Paros, Thira.
 &HT;    Sleeping in ports through the nights, Elderhostelers saw the
darkness studded with flickering lanterns as fishermen speared
octopus and squid off the rocks. They wakened each morning to the
cries of gulls, the clop of mules on quayside planks and the sound
of limp octopuses being slapped against wharf pilings by young
Greek boys working to tenderize the meat, Shaver says.
 &HT;    Delos, one of the smallest of the Cyclades, was the most famous
of all in ancient times. Legendary birthplace of Apollo, it
attracted hordes of pilgrims bearing gifts and became the treasury
for the Delian League.
 &HT;    Now Delos stands deserted and uninhabited, strewn with the
bleached bones of ruined temples, mansions, baths and splendid
mosaics _ all guarded by the celebrated lean and hungry stone
lionesses.
 &HT;    On picturesque Mykonos prices in the bustling boutiques are
unsettling _ about 30 percent higher than in less touristed Naxos
and Tinos.
 &HT;    There are 365 churches on Mykonos, a church for every 10 people.
It is said that sailors swore to build a chapel to their patron
saints if the men survived the perilous storms at sea and were
delivered home safely. The churches stand as the survivors'
promises fulfilled.
 &HT;    The most spectacular stop, Shaver remembers, was Santorini, now
called Thira. The Zeus sailed close to the huge, black, forbidding
caldera of an exploded volcano. Sometime in the Bronze Age the
volcano erupted, wiping out the flourishing Minoan culture of Crete
and burying the ancient Thira under tons of debris.
 &HT;    The modern town of Thira is 900 feet straight up above the
little dock where tenders deposited visitors. A few intrepid
tourists tried to ascend in the old, traditional way _ by mule. But
most, upon taking a look at the bony, weak-looking mules, opted to
take the gleaming steel funicular that carries visitors painlessly
up the cliff.
 THE VOYAGE HOME  
 &HT;    On the last night, the Zeus glided back toward the mainland and
anchored at Kea, much like the ancient galleons had done _ and for
the same reason: The winds were gusting dangerously.
 &HT;    Shaver fondly recalls that final night on board the Zeus, as
voices grew loud and heavily sentimental: ``Akis stretched out and
and held forth about the hunger in the Greek soul, the terrible
angst that is part of the Greek heritage.
 &HT;    ``And our most verbal Elderhosteler responded by waxing eloquent
about the indelible impact of standing in Cycladic fields strewn
with columbine and anemones, pondering the stories the stones could
tell, feeling the breeze stirring the embers of past
civilizations.''
 &HT;    The study cruise described was packaged for Elderhostel by
International Study Tours Inc., one of many overseas learning
programs offered year-round through Elderhostel. For more
information, contact Elderhostel, 75 Federal St., Boston, Mass.

 &HT;    What could possibly be more romantic than an island cruise on
board a Greek caique?
 &HT;    Beverly Shaver of El Cerrito, Calif., and her 32 fellow
Elderhostelers visualized that the tiny vessel scheduled to take
them around the Aegean to explore the fabled Cyclades Islands would
be a combination of the Bounty (as in Mutiny) and a Sultan's
barque. Even the ship's name _ the Zeus III _ conjured idyllic
images.
 &HT;    ``Of course the reality, when we first glimpsed her bobbing at
the Pireaus mooring, resembled neither Bounty nor barque,'' Shaver
says. ``One-hundred-sixteen feet long, she was a chunky blend of
Manhattan Island ferry and tugboat-with-mast painted red and
white.''
 &HT;    From Piraeus, the port for Athens, the Zeus set a course due
east, sailing on a serene sea _ no seasick stomachs here. Forty
nautical miles and four hours out, it glided into snug St. Nicholas
Bay on the tranquil little island of Kea.
 AN UNTAINTED WORLD  
 &HT;    Modern Kea is a typical Cycladic village with small sugarcube
houses lining narrow, winding, stone-paved streets. Here one can
find the unspoiled little Grecian paradise always promised in
brochures, Shaver says, and which is so seldom delivered. Here, as
on almost all the Cyclades, are 2,000-year-old ruins and sparkling
beaches for snorkeling and swimming.
 &HT;    The passengers' first dinner aboard the Zeus consisted of
chicken broth thickened with rice and eggs, prawns with rice,
artichokes and broad beans in oil with dill and lemon. The feast
was topped off with honey-and-nut cake with custard filling.
 &HT;    These Elderhostelers were now pretend-patrons of the Zeus'
gourmet restaurant. A deckhand named Demos, who only hours earlier
was seen wearing greasy overalls and cursing a jammed winch, was
transformed into a dignified, cummerbunded waiter. Passengers and
crew would treat one another with the formal politeness due their
respective, changeable roles.
 &HT;    Captain Voul-garikis urged everyone to try Retsina, the famed
liqueur. But of course, they agreed, eager to have the whole
glorious Greek experience.
 &HT;    Retsina, Shaver found, was clearly an acquired taste.
``Retsina,'' said the group wag, ``tastes like pure turpentine
that's been strained through a fisherman's sock.''
 &HT;    A pattern was quickly established. Zeus passengers were hooked
on listening to lectures, reading Greek novels and exploring the
wonders of the island. Watching the sun set became a ritual, and
dogged efforts were made to master Greek dancing.
 THE SALON CLASSROOM  
 &HT;    In the mornings, the salon became a classroom where
anthropologist Akis Papataxiarchis held forth for several hours
each day before reaching the next port.
 &HT;    Staying almost always in sight of land, the Zeus scudded from
island to island _ places such as Tinos, Delos, Ios, Mykonos,
Naxos, Paros, Thira.
 &HT;    Sleeping in ports through the nights, Elderhostelers saw the
darkness studded with flickering lanterns as fishermen speared
octopus and squid off the rocks. They wakened each morning to the
cries of gulls, the clop of mules on quayside planks and the sound
of limp octopuses being slapped against wharf pilings by young
Greek boys working to tenderize the meat, Shaver says.
 &HT;    Delos, one of the smallest of the Cyclades, was the most famous
of all in ancient times. Legendary birthplace of Apollo, it
attracted hordes of pilgrims bearing gifts and became the treasury
for the Delian League.
 &HT;    Now Delos stands deserted and uninhabited, strewn with the
bleached bones of ruined temples, mansions, baths and splendid
mosaics _ all guarded by the celebrated lean and hungry stone
lionesses.
 &HT;    On picturesque Mykonos prices in the bustling boutiques are
unsettling _ about 30 percent higher than in less touristed Naxos
and Tinos.
 &HT;    There are 365 churches on Mykonos, a church for every 10 people.
It is said that sailors swore to build a chapel to their patron
saints if the men survived the perilous storms at sea and were
delivered home safely. The churches stand as the survivors'
promises fulfilled.
 &HT;    The most spectacular stop, Shaver remembers, was Santorini, now
called Thira. The Zeus sailed close to the huge, black, forbidding
caldera of an exploded volcano. Sometime in the Bronze Age the
volcano erupted, wiping out the flourishing Minoan culture of Crete
and burying the ancient Thira under tons of debris.
 &HT;    The modern town of Thira is 900 feet straight up above the
little dock where tenders deposited visitors. A few intrepid
tourists tried to ascend in the old, traditional way _ by mule. But
most, upon taking a look at the bony, weak-looking mules, opted to
take the gleaming steel funicular that carries visitors painlessly
up the cliff.
 THE VOYAGE HOME  
 &HT;    On the last night, the Zeus glided back toward the mainland and
anchored at Kea, much like the ancient galleons had done _ and for
the same reason: The winds were gusting dangerously.
 &HT;    Shaver fondly recalls that final night on board the Zeus, as
voices grew loud and heavily sentimental: ``Akis stretched out and
and held forth about the hunger in the Greek soul, the terrible
angst that is part of the Greek heritage.
 &HT;    ``And our most verbal Elderhosteler responded by waxing eloquent
about the indelible impact of standing in Cycladic fields strewn
with columbine and anemones, pondering the stories the stones could
tell, feeling the breeze stirring the embers of past
civilizations.''
 &HT;    The study cruise described was packaged for Elderhostel by
International Study Tours Inc., one of many overseas learning
programs offered year-round through Elderhostel. For more

 &HT;    Sosa frenzy comes to Cincinnati
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ The Cincinnati Reds once again dip their very
cold toes into the hot waters of Sammy Sosaville, where there is a
feeding frenzy of home runs and very real dreams of playoff
qualification for the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Wrigley Field, baseball's brickyard of dreams, will be a boiling
cauldron this weekend when the Reds and Cubs play three straight
afternoon games September 18, 19, and 20.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is Sosa's chase of the all-time home run record,
coupled with Sosa leading the Cubs toward the promised land of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And right now, that's what makes Sammy run.
</P>
<P>
   While Mark McGwire has nothing for which to play _ no postseason
aspiration, at least _ Sosa is driven by the obsession of taking
the Cubs to the playoffs. They are in a noose-gagging battle with
the New York Mets for the National League wild card, a spot from
which the Florida Marlins won the World Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa actually is on a three-pronged mission _ playoffs, home run
title, Most Valuable Player. He can have all three. McGwire can
have only one, the home run crown.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes what Sosa is doing all the more special, all
more important than what McGwire is doing. Sosa is slam-banging
home runs for the glory of the Cubs, not just for the glory of The
Man.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example was Wednesday night in San Diego, against one
of baseball's best teams, and in the roiling waters of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa broke a 0-0 tie with a two-run bases-loaded double, then
won the game with a grand slam home run, his 63rd, tying McGwire
for the all-time record. It was another step toward the home-run
record, a bigger step toward leading the Cubs to the playoffs and a
giant step toward the MVP title.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa leads the league with 154 runs batted in. The grand slam
was the third this year for Grand Sammy. . .this from a guy who had
no grand slams before this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what everybody waits for me to do,'' Sosa said. ``It's
my responsibility to go out and finish strong to take the Chicago
Cubs to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Finish strong?
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, Sosa had 26 home runs and 60 RBI in his last
49 games. Numbers like that are mythological, but there is nothing
mythology about Sammy Sosa, who has blown more kisses this year
than Tiny Tim.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Cubdom wants the playoffs. But they want more from Sammy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are all here to see Sammy make history and he continues
to make it,'' teammate Mark Grace said after Sosa received a
standing ovation from the tightly packed Qualcomm Stadium crowd,
nearly all San Diego Padre fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has carried us all year and he did it again,'' manager Jim
Riggleman said after Sosa drove in all six runs of Wednesday's 6-3
victory. ``He wants to get in the playoffs and that's what is
driving him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa just keeps flashing that coast-to-coast smile, blasting
home runs and blowing kisses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I live a miracle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he wants to win the home-run title or make
the playoffs, Sosa said quickly, ``I would like both.'' Nobody
asked about MVP. That's a no-brainer. Put S-o-s-a on the trophy and
hand it to him now.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati manager Jack McKeon hopes a packed Wrigley and the
national media lifts his team out of a funk _ 11 defeats in 16
games. It didn't a couple of weeks ago when the Reds lost three
straight to Sosa &AMP; Friends in Wrigley, then went to St. Louis and
lost two of three to McGwire &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the excitement and fanfare in Chicago will perk us
up,'' McKeon said. ``And I'm going to tell Sosa, 'Hey, if things
get tough for us, I'm gonna walk you, buddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   While McKeon has walked McGwire several times, situations
haven't called for him to pitch around Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember any instances this year where Sammy could
beat us, so we pitched to him,'' McKeon said. ``There were several
times where McGwire could beat us or hurt us, so we walked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is 12 for 34 (.353) against the Reds this year with a
double and four home runs _ including two off Brett Tomko, whom he
won't face, one off Scott Sullivan and one (No. 56) off Jason Bere,
whom he will face Saturday.

 &HT;    Review of ``Rush Hour''
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Rush Hour'' is a lame action-comedy that
proves a good rap has more punch than a good slap.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel-injected motor-mouth Chris Tucker teams with balletic
brawler Jackie Chan, who's really the top name here. But it's
Tucker who strong-arms center stage, lassoing the formula buddy
picture with his elastic tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Chan fans will be disheartened watching their hero reduced to
wooden straight man here. The congenial stunt pixie rarely gets to
demonstrate why he's Hong Kong's most adored action deity. His
famous physical pyrotechnics are snuffed for banal chop-socky
exchanges, and the end-credit outtakes reveal the worst news of
all: None of Chan's high jinks placed him anywhere near the maw of
death. Too many scenes ask Chan to act, and we all know how painful
that can be.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker plays the obligatory loose-cannon cop, whose wildly
irresponsible law enforcement tactics have landed him a demotion in
the LAPD. When the Chinese consul's young daughter is kidnapped by
a sinister crime lord, Tucker gets the flunky assignment of keeping
Chan's crack Hong Kong cop out of the hair of the FBI, which is
depicted as an inept force of nebulous evil destined to bungle
every big case.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Glover, er, Tucker and Chan will have none of it.
Their renegade spirits fling them smack into the eye of the
criminal storm, where Tucker's slapdash tactics collide with Chan's
contained professionalism. The resulting friction, of course, makes
potent chemistry, a righteous force the baddies aren't prepared
for. The movie tries to wring comic energy from the hackneyed clash
of East and West. But unless watching Tucker call Chan ``Mr.
Rice-a-Roni'' and Chan call a black man the ``N'' word strikes your
fancy, you'll expose the equation as just more cuddly racism from
Hollywood (see, too, ``Lethal Weapon 4'').
</P>
<P>
   And don't think the filmmakers don't know they're being racist.
They do. They just think we're too stupid to detect it as such. The
cynicism involved here is breathtaking.
</P>
<P>
   If Chan disappoints, Tucker furnishes some vague pleasures. He's
a rapper par excellence, brandishing his underwear-too-tight voice
like a weapon. His rapid, serpentine prattle swirls and coils
around people like a quicksilver cobra, annoying them into
surrender. If only he had more than four funny lines.
</P>
<P>
   Why Chan gets dragged behind the Tucker hurricane is easy to
figure: Even in an action caper you can only battle bad guys in
staggered spurts; kicking people in the face takes a lot out of
you. But lips _ especially Tucker's mad puckers _ can jabber on
without pause.
</P>
<P>
   (Parenthetical kudos must be given to the film's most piercing
presence, Ken Leung, who plays vile henchman Sang with a
self-possession that nicely finesses the line between Zen placidity
and killer iciness.)
</P>
<P>
   The fear lingers _ and is fueled by this wan romp _ that Chan is
being misused in his late American phase. Where we once likened his
gonzo daredevilry to Buster Keaton by way of Gene Kelly, we're now
tempted to compare his mugging, prop-reliant antics to Carrot Top.
He spins and bludgeons foes with whatever he can get his hands on,
be it a food tray, giant rug or another body. The goofy grin
doesn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Chan was a one-man supernova, who wrote, directed and
starred in his hugely entertaining movies. Hampered by a weak grasp
of English, his smarmy charm doesn't translate well in the
multiplex. And, at 44, he's not about to jump a motorcycle on top
of a moving train anymore. That Chan has to be yoked with a
scene-stealing co-star says it all. `Rush Hour' 2 stars Starring:
Jackie Chan, Chris Tucker Director: Brett Ratner Screenwriters: Jim
Kouf and Ross Lamanna MPAA rating: PG-13 for action-comedy
violence, language Chris Garcia is the Austin American-Statesman's
film critic.

 &HT;    Review of ``One True Thing''
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Near the end of ``One True Thing,'' Kate Gulden
(Meryl Streep) admonishes her daughter, Ellen (Renee Zellweger), to
``love what you have.'' It is one of the film's most affecting
moments because it marks a turning point between mother and
daughter, a moment of realization for Ellen as her once lovely
mother, now ravaged by inoperable cancer, speaks candidly about the
choices she made in her own life. Choices that helped Ellen to
succeed in her own way as an independent, talented and driven
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Anna Quindlen's semi-autobiographical second novel,
``One True Thing'' is an emotional movie, and it is a smart film.
An oxymoron? Hardly. As former journalist Quindlen demonstrated in
her regular columns for The New York Times, to acknowledge one's
emotions while interpreting current events and contemporary issues
is not to admit one's weaknesses. Rather, it is one way of making
the political personal, and therefore more relevant for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Gulden is a magazine writer living in New York. When her
mother is diagnosed with cancer, Ellen's father, George (William
Hurt), an esteemed professor of literature, instructs his daughter
to move back home to care for Kate. Such a move threatens Ellen's
career, but she agrees, partly out of a sense of duty and partly
out of a lifelong habit of seeking her father's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The dichotomies that exist among the Gulden family, which also
includes Ellen's younger brother Brian (Tom Everett Scott), are
familiar not because they are cliche(accent)d characters but
because these contrasts are universal among families. Ellen grows
up to be much like her scholarly father: bright, witty, a talented
writer. In her nearly absolute devotion to her father, she looks
down upon her mother, who represents little of the cerebral world
Ellen wishes to live and succeed in.
</P>
<P>
   What is refreshing about ``One True Thing'' is that it avoids
the either/or split that cripples so many debates about feminism.
The film (and the novel) is not saying that Ellen is wrong for
wanting to succeed in her career, nor is it condescending to Kate
for her desire to care for her family above all else.
</P>
<P>
   ``One True Thing'' explores the emotional landscape of a
mother-daughter relationship with patience, humor and realism.
Directed by Carl Franklin (``One False Move,'' ``Devil in a Blue
Dress'') and adapted from Quindlen's novel by Karen Croner, the
film succeeds as well as it does because of the performances by
Streep and Zellweger. Streep's dramatic talents are obvious. Less
familiar to audiences but equally appealing is her comedic ability,
and Kate's witty observations establish a subtle connection between
mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zellweger's breakout role was as Tom Cruise's biggest
fan in ``Jerry Maguire,'' her other performances (``The Whole Wide
World'') do a better job of forecasting her range. In ``One True
Thing,'' Zellweger and Croner's script successfully capture the
schizophrenic dance that occurs when adult children, particularly
women, return home to visit their parents.
</P>
<P>
   One book reviewer wrote of Quindlen's novel that it was not
great literature, but it was a compelling story. Similarly, the
screen adaptation of ``One True Thing'' is not great cinema: The
story has its problems, such as the prologue-as-framing-device in
which Ellen is questioned about her role in her mother's death. But
``One True Thing'' is a compelling story. It is a story about
mothers and daughters and the messy, emotional bonds that nothing,
not even death, can sever completely. `One True Thing' 3 stars
Starring: Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt Director:
Carl Franklin Screenwriter: Karen Croner MPAA rating: R for
language Alison Macor writes for the Austin American-Statesman.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: The other kind of baseball immortality
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball is a game of long memories.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire not only faced down this year's
pitchers but generations of past players. Nobody really plays them
one game at a time. Each game projects into an eternity of
statistics, lists and stories.
</P>
<P>
   This continuity enlarges the game's best moments. Gives them
permanence. Transforms tobacco-spitting kids into immortals.
</P>
<P>
   It works the other way, too. One bad moment, one dumb move can
overshadow a career.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Fred ``Bonehead'' Merkle. So-called for a single action
that happened 90 years ago this week.
</P>
<P>
   Merkle had a solid career -- played 16 seasons, earned a .273
batting average in the dead-ball era, appeared in five World
Series. Still, his place in baseball lore comes from failing to
touch second base in a game played Sept. 23, 1908, at the Polo
Grounds before 25,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   In the 9th inning of a 1-1 pitching duel between the Chicago
Cubs and the New York Giants, two men were out and a 19-year-old
Merkle was poised on first base.
</P>
<P>
   Al Bridwell singled to center field bringing Moose McCormick
home with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it looked like to the thousands of fans who streamed
onto the field. That's what it looked like to Merkle as he stopped
midway between bases and headed to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next would be debated years afterward. Cubs second
baseman Johnny Evers (of Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance fame), seeing
that Merkle hadn't reached second base, called to the center
fielder who caught the single. The outfielder couldn't pick out
Evers in the milling crowd. He threw toward him and missed.
</P>
<P>
   A Giants coach noticed and went for the ball. Evers and Joe
Tinker wrestled him for it. The coach threw the ball into the
stands where a delighted fan in a bowler caught it. Another Cubs
player chased down the bowler-guy, slugged him, recovered the
souvenir and threw it to Tinker.
</P>
<P>
   Tinker tossed it to Evers at second. The umpire said Merkle was
out. The game-winning run didn't count.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the game was declared the rarest of the things in
American baseball -- a tie. It had to be replayed. The Cubs won the
re-play and gained the 1908 National League Pennant by one game.
</P>
<P>
   New York said it was robbed. Fans and sportswriters were
apoplectic, and when not cursing the umpire, blamed one player:
Merkle.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, Merkle still was living it down.
</P>
<P>
   When he left baseball in the '20s, he moved to a place that was
the next best thing to the end of the earth -- central Florida. He
manufactured fishing gear in Daytona Beach, Fla., and became
something of a recluse.
</P>
<P>
   There was a story that he coached an Ormond Beach, Fla., team
only to walk off the field, never to return, when someone used the
word ``bonehead.''
</P>
<P>
   By the '40s he shook it off a little. He became a regular at
Florida State League games, sitting on a stool near the first-base
foul line in what is now called Jackie Robinson Ballpark. A park
that became, as fate would have it, home to the Chicago Cubs'
single-A Daytona Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   A large, quiet, kindly and introspective man, Merkle seemed
haunted and hurt the rest of his life for not touching second base
in that one game played when he was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kahn, a sportswriter for the Daytona Beach News-Journal,
struck up an acquaintance with Merkle, always being careful never
to allude to the 1908 season in print or in his presence. Here's
what he wrote in 1956 when Merkle died: ``Reticent Fred Merkle,
perhaps the most maligned man in the history of baseball, has gone
where the jibes of the wiseacre wolves can't hurt him anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   We live in a busier time now. We can sit in a sports bar and
follow six games in three sports on a dozen monitors pulled in by
cable and satellite. It's hard to recreate the emotions stirred 90
years ago when a city was riveted on the only game in town, one
keenly felt, heartbreakingly close race for the pennant that hinged
on a single disputed play.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has a long memory. Merkle is one of those few players
to whom it granted immortality.
</P>
<P>
   But only as a bonehead.

 &HT;    Zippergate, think of Reno
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Americans should think of Janet Reno when are
grossed out by the Clinton-Lewinsky zippergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Parents disgusted by the need to shelter their children from the
emerging details of the White House sexcapade should think of Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Had Attorney General Reno recommended the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate serious and credible evidence of
President Clinton's felonious corruption of America's election
laws, it's possible that the nation would have been spared the
sordid Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, at least with Clinton as
president.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though Reno is reluctant to ask for the appointment
of independent counsels. She has asked for seven independent
counsels to investigate credible evidence of law-breaking by
Clinton or his administration officials. This is the most
investigated administration in American history.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to the charges that should be the easiest to
investigate and the easiest for everyone to understand, Reno has
refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Besides nationwide newspaper editorials (including in the
Tribune-Herald) that have urged her appoint an independent counsel
to investigate allegations of the repeated and systematic breaking
election laws, many Democratic heavyweights, including Sens. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Russ Feingold, D-Wis., and Jay
Rockefeller, D-W.Va., have asked her appoint a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's hard-headed refusal also is against the advice of FBI
Director Louis J. Freeh and FBI Special Agent James V. Desarno.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, former Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles G. LaBella,
who oversaw the Justice Department investigation of 1996 campaign
finance abuses, advised Reno that the law required her to seek a
special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans may be willing to overlook lying and covering up
of an adulterous Oval Office affair with a White House intern, but
it's unlikely that the public would be as dismissive of evidence
that Clinton sought dirty money to help him buy the election.
</P>
<P>
   Lies and cover-ups stemming from sex are one thing. But few
Americans tolerate lies and cover-ups when they involve money.
</P>
<P>
   If an independent prosecutor presented Congress with evidence
that Clinton engaged in a pattern of perjury, witness tampering and
obstruction of justice to cover up illegal acts designed to
influence the 1996 presidential election, few Americans would
defend him by saying that lots of politicians are corrupt and have
bought elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Americans have a strong bipartisan intolerance to
lies and cover-ups when they involve dirty money and underhanded
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Due to Reno's refusal to ask for an independent counsel to
investigate a lengthy list of allegations that put the White House
at the hub of an illegal fund-raising scandal, Americans may never
know if an investigation would have cleared Clinton or found
evidence of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   We do know that Clinton turned the White House into a hot-bed
flop house as he rotated campaign contributors in and out of the
Lincoln bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   We also know the White House had a rate card that listed what
donors could get for their money. We know that Clinton ran a series
of felons, swindlers and tax-cheats in and out of the White House
along with fat cat donors, Hollywood stars and the occasional
Chinese arms-dealer and fugitive Lebanese businessman. We know that
White House telephones were used to solicit campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   We also know that Clinton himself said most of the money he
raised for his 1996 campaign was legitimate. That's like being a
little bit pregnant, except you go to jail when it involves the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever zippergate makes you ill, think of Reno.

 &HT;    Struggling to keep identity, Jewish groups nourish tradition
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dipping apples in honey and chanting ancient prayers mark the
Jewish new year that begins Sunday at sundown.
</P>
<P>
   Most Jews throughout the world will eat traditional foods Sunday
night to taste the sweetness of the new year. At synagogue, they
will repent the misdeeds of the past, reciting appointed prayers
for Rosh Hashana.
</P>
<P>
   And they will begin the 10 Days of Awe leading to Yom Kippur,
the most solemn day in the Jewish year.
</P>
<P>
   But for many American Jews, these are lost traditions. They have
neglected or forgotten _ or never knew _ the ancient ways of their
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Interfaith marriages, the cornucopia of choices available in
America and the openness of American culture could weaken what
centuries of persecution could not destroy. And Jewish educators
are out to make sure that doesn't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community is struggling to hold onto its
identity,'' said Rabbi Alan Sherman, community chaplain at the
Jewish Federation in West Palm Beach, Fla. ``Society is so open and
so accepting that being Jewish now becomes a choice among other
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla Atkinson is typical of the dilemma confronting segments of
American Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson, 39, moved to Palm Beach Gardens about a year ago and
has relatively few Jewish friends. Her family did not observe the
traditions of the Jewish home, and her husband, Blaine Mercereau,
is not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   But the interfaith couple want to raise their three kids in
Jewish tradition. They want to discover the richness of a Jewish
home, keep the Sabbath and celebrate Jewish holy days.
</P>
<P>
   So, Atkinson has joined a new yearlong program that begins this
fall for about 50 young, unaffiliated, interfaith families.
</P>
<P>
   In a program called ``Around the Shabbat Table,'' they will
explore the ancient traditions and modern joys of keeping the
Sabbath from sundown each Friday until sundown Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to catch people who are not in what I call the
Jewish net and may not be doing Jewish things,'' said Carolyn
Yasuna, director of the Mishpacha Family Center of the Commission
for Jewish Education in West Palm Beach. ``What we are trying to do
is give people a forum to connect with other families who do not
have a history with Shabbat but want to learn more about the
holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups of three or four families, children included, will share
a Sabbath meal every other month until May, Yasuna said.
</P>
<P>
   Each group will begin at the home of a trained ``mentor'' family
who will demonstrate how to keep the Sabbath. Then, each family in
the group will host a Sabbath evening throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, four workshops will teach Jewish Sabbath rituals,
cooking, songs and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more beautiful time for a Jewish family than
Friday evening,'' said Barbara Steinberg, the executive director of
the Commission for Education and principal of the Meyer Jewish
Academy in West Palm Beach. ``The love of parents and children is
obvious. The importance of Jewish traditions is primary.''
</P>
<P>
   But the danger of losing that way of life is real. By some
estimates, nearly 85 percent of the Jewish community in South
Florida is not affiliated with a temple or synagogue, Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary freedom possible in America has taken a heavy
toll on the traditional patterns of Jewish life. A highly mobile
society tends to separate families that once formed close-knit
communities. Intermarriage can weaken the resolve to keep one's
traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we suffer assimilation from the freedom this country
allows,'' Sherman said. ``Not that I want it any other way. Jewish
people come into contact with others very freely. We've been
welcomed into many groups where we were not previously.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes it harder to keep Jewish customs and meet Jewish
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie and Jeff Garelick have been married for 10 months,
recently moved to Jupiter and want to connect with the Jewish
community. They joined a newly formed havurah, a small group that
meets monthly to study and observe Jewish life together.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by the Jewish Community Center in West Palm Beach,
five havurahs flourish. Each includes about 15 couples who meet for
two years with a trained coordinator and, thereafter, meet as the
group decides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found couples who are often isolated, without family,
busy and unable to find social connections,'' said Charlotte Kula
from Boca Raton, who with her husband, Morton, are havurah
coordinators. ``With both working, you come home. You eat dinner.
You watch TV. You get on the Web. Other people just aren't
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County in Boca Raton
also offers programs to preserve and celebrate Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   One innovative club is designed for Jewish teens and meets after
school at Omni middle school and Spanish River High School in Boca
Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the club, JIST, stands for ``Jewish identity scene
for teens.'' It is modeled after Christian groups that meet on
school property before and after school hours.
</P>
<P>
   The club was formed to attract teens who were bar or bat mitzvah
as youngsters but have not been to synagogue since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are probably not affiliated and their parents probably
aren't either,'' said Ken Swart, speaking for the South County
Commission for Jewish Education. ``The club is designed to re-spark
Judaism in them.''
</P>
<P>
   The club wants to attract older kids. Kathryn Kesler wants her
children to discover their Jewish roots at home before they are old
enough for school.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiley, 6, and Lindsey, 4, live in a very different world
than Jewish kids did a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kesler, 36, who lives in Jupiter, remembers the stories of happy
Sabbath dinners when she was a child.
</P>
<P>
   She can almost smell the table laden with traditional foods. She
can see, in her mind's eye, the extended family gathered around it,
hear their laughter and feel their support.
</P>
<P>
   Today, members of her family live in four other states. She has
an interfaith marriage, and her kids are exposed to the unrelenting
demands of a non-Jewish culture.
</P>
<P>
   So, her family is gathering ``Around the Shabbat Table'' for the
program in Jewish customs. They hope to preserve the roots of their
faith and assure its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to meet with other people who have shared traditions
and show our kids what Shabbat and other holidays are about,''
Kesler said.
</P>
<P>
   CUSTOMS OF ROSH HASHANA
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana begins at sunset Sunday to mark the beginning of
the Jewish year 5759. The holiday lasts for two days for Orthodox
and Conservative Jews, one day for Reform Jews. Rosh Hashana is
Hebrew for head of the year. Here are the holiday's customs:
</P>
<P>
   _ THE RITUAL focuses on leaving the old year and entering the
new.
</P>
<P>
   _ IT BEGINS 10 days of repentance called the Days of Awe that
culminate with Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   _ JEWS PRAY to be inscribed in the Book of Life for the coming
year. They take stock of their sins, examine their commitment to
repentance and affirm their faith in God's mercy.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE SHOFAR (ram's horn) is blown during synagogue services as
an expression of God's sovereignty, his role in history and the
people's faith in the future.
</P>
<P>
   _ DURING ONE CEREMONY, Tashlich (Hebrew for throw), Jews toss
bread crumbs into a body of water to symbolize casting away their
sins from the past year.
</P>
<P>
   _ HOLIDAY FOODS include honey and apples to symbolize hope for a
sweet new year.

 &HT;    Sharp and the 'Truth Squad' squabble
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Comptroller John Sharp, who is running for lieutenant
governor, is battling accusations by Republican backers of his
opponent, Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry, that his claims of
having saved the state $8.5 billion over the past seven years are
grossly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of GOP legislators who've dubbed themselves ``The Truth
Squad'' have been meeting with newspaper editorial boards,
brandishing a thick book they say proves Sharp, who gained a
national reputation with his performance reviews of state agencies,
has inflated the amount the state saved by implementing his
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth Squad came through here several days ago. (A Sharp
spokesman jokingly refers to them as The Goon Squad.)
</P>
<P>
   All three GOP legislators were earnest, intelligent and
determined to convince me Sharp's claims are exaggerated. Then,
they hoped (but didn't say), I would write an editorial saying just
that, which would end up being used in a political commercial.
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before. Once I was lying in bed in a hotel room in
Austin as an election neared, about half asleep, when I heard a TV
political commercial that used one of my editorials to convince
voters what a wonderful fellow this particular candidate was. I
can't remember anymore who it was, or if they even won. And I
wonder how many voters in Austin were swayed by a TV commercial
touting this little newspaper's editorial. Darned few, I suspect.
</P>
<P>
   What made this latest foray by these backers of Rick Perry a bit
novel is that:
</P>
<P>
   -- All three legislators admitted voting for all of Sharp's
recommendations. The only exceptions were that two of the
legislators haven't been in office the entire time, but they did
back his recommendations in the last session, and say if they had
been in the Legislature at the time they would have voted for the
earlier recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   -- Further, all three said they would vote for those proposals
if they had it to do over again.
</P>
<P>
   -- None of them made any secret about backing Rick Perry, or
being Republicans. They're being sponsored by the Associated
Republicans of Texas, a group that Sharp says tried hard to get him
to switch parties after lavishly praising his performance reviews.
There was no attempt at subterfuge, at least concerning which horse
they're backing, and who's paying the bills.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers over whether some of Sharp's ideas are
really ``savings,'' as he claims in his campaign material and out
on the stump. Some of his proposals included putting off paying
state bills for a week, or maybe a fiscal quarter. Some
recommendations meant raising money off increased fees and
licenses. Sharp recommended being more aggressive at getting money
out of the federal government for school meal programs as a way to
cut state costs. And, he pushed a spate of cuts in spending -- far
more than were actually implemented by the Legislature, which had
the ultimate power to act on Sharp's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Gang of Three say that while they supported Sharp's
ideas, many of them aren't really ``savings,'' as Sharp claims. For
example, they contend putting off paying bills until a later time
isn't a savings because the bill still has to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   I called the Sharp campaign to get a response. The next day,
Sharp called back to defend his program. As might be expected, he
has a different interpretation. His contention is that if the cuts,
delayed payments and other measures weren't enacted during a
particular session, taxes would have been raised. Putting off
payments kept taxes from being raised, and luckily the economy
improved enough in the interim to allow the state to make the added
payments the following year, or quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, if we hadn't done these programs, we
would have spent $8.5 billion more than we did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp admits it could have gone the other way, if the economy
hadn't improved when it did. ``It was a wing and a prayer,'' he
said. Remember, all this started in 1991, when the state faced
sizable deficits and a sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp points out he recommended far more cuts than were enacted,
which is one reason he had to use some money management tricks to
tide the state over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (state legislators) the ones who decided they couldn't
stomach the cuts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He makes a persuasive case, especially when he points out
legislators, Republican and Democrat alike, praised him to high
heaven when his recommendations kept legislators from having to
consider that ol' bugabear, a state income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sure never complained (back then),'' he said, adding the
performance reviews were often praised as ``the best thing since
sliced bread.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know for sure if Sharp can prove to the penny that he
saved the state $8.5 billion in seven years. But I'm personally
unpersuaded by the Gang of Three's road show, especially since they
all backed Sharp's ideas and say they would do it again.
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, I asked Sharp if he thought President Clinton's
travails would hurt him and other Democrats; he doesn't think so,
but he has no plans to get up on a stage with the embattled
president during this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to explain to my children why I'm up there with
him,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a smart politician to me.

 By CARL ZIMMER 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Justin Kalesto doesn't want to wake up. A woman is calling his
name, but he turns his head deeper into his pillow. He is 12 years
old, and from Mangbangau, a village deep in remote southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's sunken abdomen curves inward like a bowl. His nostrils
are clogged with bacteria and dried mucus and the skin around his
closed eyes puffs out, giving him the face of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has become home for hundreds of thousands of whip-shaped
parasites called trypanosomes. They have fed on his blood and made
their way into his brain. Generally the human victim of such an
invasion sinks into an irritable haze, slips into a coma and dies.
Hence the name of the disease: sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where you are?'' a woman asks in English, and a
Sudanese nurse translates. He nods and says, ``Tambura,'' the name
of the town where this hospital is located. The woman tries to bend
his head, but it's too stiff _ his entire back is rigid as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in and you can't bend their head,'' the
woman says to the Sudanese men and women standing with her by the
cot, ``get a doctor immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mickey Richer. She is a short 53-year-old woman with
a gray mop of hair, dressed in a T-shirt and pale-blue surgical
pants. She prescribes shots of steroids and says, ``OK, Justin, see
you later.'' He offers no response, not even a glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102 other patients at the Tambura County Hospital
being treated today for advanced sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 in Tambura County
who are sick with the disease _ 20 percent of the population. And
he is only one of perhaps hundreds of thousands who have become
infected recently in southern Sudan and its neighbors, the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly
Zaire).
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a disease fading into oblivion, sleeping
sickness is raging again, particularly here. In all of southern
Sudan, Richer is running the only program to fight the disease, and
she is able to save only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richer was already in her 40s when she began working in places
like Tambura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do Third World work; that's why I went to
medical school,'' she says. ``I thought I'd be a pediatrician for
one or two years and then move on. I loved the kids so much I
stayed around for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally left her practice in Denver in 1987 to spend a year
in northern Sudan, working in a camp for refugees driven there by
recurrent famines.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward she went to the prestigious Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine and then returned to Africa with the
International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based group of doctors
and nurses who bring medical care to places wrecked by war and
disaster, such as Angola, Bosnia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer first came to Tambura in 1994, she didn't know she
was landing in the middle of an epidemic. Her job was to resurrect
the county hospital, abandoned during the ongoing civil war. But it
didn't take Richer long to notice the parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a few people with sleeping sickness in 1994,'' she
remembers, ``and in 1995 I treated 19 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and
mortality, things like malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections.
Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Richer has in fact managed to keep this corner of Tambura County
healthy, but she doesn't feel much sense of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deluding myself that by treating 1,500 patients we've
done anything with the epidemic. Probably not. There are probably
12,000 infected people out there, and still a lot of people left
for those tsetse flies to bite. But you've got to start
somewhere.''

 By CARL ZIMMER 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Justin Kalesto doesn't want to wake up. A woman is calling his
name, but he turns his head deeper into his pillow. He is 12 years
old, and from Mangbangau, a village deep in remote southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's sunken abdomen curves inward like a bowl. His nostrils
are clogged with bacteria and dried mucus and the skin around his
closed eyes puffs out, giving him the face of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has become home for hundreds of thousands of whip-shaped
parasites called trypanosomes. They have fed on his blood and made
their way into his brain. Generally the human victim of such an
invasion sinks into an irritable haze, slips into a coma and dies.
Hence the name of the disease: sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where you are?'' a woman asks in English, and a
Sudanese nurse translates. He nods and says, ``Tambura,'' the name
of the town where this hospital is located. The woman tries to bend
his head, but it's too stiff _ his entire back is rigid as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in and you can't bend their head,'' the
woman says to the Sudanese men and women standing with her by the
cot, ``get a doctor immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mickey Richer. She is a short 53-year-old woman with
a gray mop of hair, dressed in a T-shirt and pale-blue surgical
pants. She prescribes shots of steroids and says, ``OK, Justin, see
you later.'' He offers no response, not even a glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102 other patients at the Tambura County Hospital
being treated today for advanced sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 in Tambura County
who are sick with the disease _ 20 percent of the population. And
he is only one of perhaps hundreds of thousands who have become
infected recently in southern Sudan and its neighbors, the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly
Zaire).
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a disease fading into oblivion, sleeping
sickness is raging again, particularly here. In all of southern
Sudan, Richer is running the only program to fight the disease, and
she is able to save only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richer was already in her 40s when she began working in places
like Tambura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do Third World work; that's why I went to
medical school,'' she says. ``I thought I'd be a pediatrician for
one or two years and then move on. I loved the kids so much I
stayed around for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally left her practice in Denver in 1987 to spend a year
in northern Sudan, working in a camp for refugees driven there by
recurrent famines.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward she went to the prestigious Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine and then returned to Africa with the
International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based group of doctors
and nurses who bring medical care to places wrecked by war and
disaster, such as Angola, Bosnia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer first came to Tambura in 1994, she didn't know she
was landing in the middle of an epidemic. Her job was to resurrect
the county hospital, abandoned during the ongoing civil war. But it
didn't take Richer long to notice the parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a few people with sleeping sickness in 1994,'' she
remembers, ``and in 1995 I treated 19 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and

Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.

   ``I saved the most interesting case for last,'' said Molly
Wilson, the resident who'd been on call the night before.
</P>
<P>
   As the attending physician that month, the most senior doctor on
the service, it was my job to make sure the children in the
Infants' Unit got the best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby's name is Jarret Fox,'' Molly continued. ``He's a
3-month-old who was admitted last night for dehydration. His mom
says Jarret was happy and healthy a week ago. Then, on Tuesday, he
seemed to lose interest in nursing. He just stopped sucking, his
mother says, and he hasn't eaten anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right,'' I responded. ``Three-month-olds don't
just suddenly stop nursing and starve themselves until they get
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't believe it either at first, but the mother
keeps telling the same story: She's been trying to force-feed him
since Wednesday but hasn't had any success. Yesterday she brought
him to her pediatrician. He said Jarret was about 5 percent
dehydrated. He also said the kid was much floppier than he'd been
the last time he'd seen him. So he sent him in for rehydration and
a full evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The part about the increased floppiness made my heart sink. It
suggested a condition I hoped this baby didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas about a diagnosis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think of is spinal muscular atrophy,''
Molly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm thinking, too,'' I replied. ``I hope we're
wrong. Let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a diagnosis of the infantile form of SMA is a death
sentence. A relatively rare inherited disease in which the nerves
that control movement mysteriously degenerate and disappear, it is
the childhood equivalent of the better-known (but no better
understood) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the nerves vanish during the first months of life, a child
with SMA grows progressively weaker. After initial problems with
feeding, the infant loses the ability to move its arms and legs.
Breathing also becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the child becomes more and more hungry for air until
finally, by about the first birthday, he or she dies. The cause is
usually pneumonia, a common infection in lungs that aren't getting
enough air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox,'' Molly said as we approached Jarret's crib, ``this
is Dr. Marion. He's our attending pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry we have to meet under these circumstances,'' I said.
Barefoot, clad in a peasant blouse and bell-bottom jeans, her long,
straight hair parted down the middle, Jarret's mom looked like a
long-lost refugee from the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, Ms. Fox spilled out the short tale of her son's
life. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Jarret had been born at his
parents' home. He was the couple's second child: their daughter,
Jessica, now 3 years old, was ``healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his birth was attended only by a midwife, Jarret was
examined on the first day of life by the family's pediatrician (the
only one in the area who practiced homeopathic medicine and made
house calls) and declared to be in excellent health. His mother
could think of nothing unusual about her son's newborn period.
</P>
<P>
   The infant had been seen by the pediatrician on a regular
schedule. He'd received his immunizations and had been growing and
developing normally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained that her family were strict vegetarians who
ate only whole, natural foods. She assured me that Jarret had had
nothing but breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago this idyllic existence had ended. Jarret had
simply refused to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wouldn't latch onto my breast,'' she said sadly.
``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

<P>
   ``I saved the most interesting case for last,'' said Molly
Wilson, the resident who'd been on call the night before.
</P>
<P>
   As the attending physician that month, the most senior doctor on
the service, it was my job to make sure the children in the
Infants' Unit got the best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby's name is Jarret Fox,'' Molly continued. ``He's a
3-month-old who was admitted last night for dehydration. His mom
says Jarret was happy and healthy a week ago. Then, on Tuesday, he
seemose interest in nursing. He just stopped sucking, his
mother says, and he hasn't eaten anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right,'' I responded. ``Three-month-olds don't
just suddenly stop nursing and starve themselves until they get
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't believe it either at first, but the mother
keeps telling the same story: She's been trying to force-feed him
since Wednesday but hasn't had any success. Yesterday she brought
him to her pediatrician. He said Jarret was about 5 percent
dehydrated. He also said the kid was much floppier than he'd been
the last time he'd seen him. So he sent him in for rehydration and
a full evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The part about the increased floppiness made my heart sink. It
suggested a condition I hoped this baby didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas about a diagnosis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think of is spinal muscular atrophy,''
Molly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm thinking, too,'' I replied. ``I hope we're
wrong. Let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a diagnosis of the infantile form of SMA is a death
sentence. A relatively rare inherited disease in which the nerves
that control movement mysteriously degenerate and disappear, it is
the childhood equivalent of the better-known (but no better
understood) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the nerves vanish during the first months of life, a child
with SMA grows progressively weaker. After initial problems with
feeding, the infant loses the ability to move its arms and legs.
Breathing also becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the child becomes more and more hungry for air until
finally, by about the first birthday, he or she dies. The cause is
usually pneumonia, a common infection in lungs that aren't getting
enough air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox,'' Molly said as we approached Jarret's crib, ``this
is Dr. Marion. He's our attending pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry we have to meet under these circumstances,'' I said.
Barefoot, clad in a peasant blouse and bell-bottom jeans, her long,
straight hair parted down the middle, Jarret's mom looked like a
long-lost refugee from the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, Ms. Fox spilled out the short tale of her son's
life. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Jarret had been born at his
parents' home. He was the couple's second child: their daughter,
Jessica, now 3 years old, was ``healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his birth was attended only by a midwife, Jarret was
examined on the first day of life by the family's pediatrician (the
only one in the area who practiced homeopathic medicine and made
house calls) and declared to be in excellent health. His mother
could think of nothing unusual about her son's newborn period.
</P>
<P>
   The infant had been seen by the pediatrician on a regular
schedule. He'd received his immunizations and had been growing and
developing normally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained that her family were strict vegetarians who
ate only whole, natural foods. She assured me that Jarret had had
nothing but breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago this idyllic existence had ended. Jarret had
simply refused to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wouldn't latch onto my breast,'' she said sadly.
``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

 By CARL ZIMMER 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Justin Kalesto doesn't want to wake up. A woman is calling his
name, but he turns his head deeper into his pillow. He is 12 years
old, and from Mangbangau, a village deep in remote southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's sunken abdomen curves inward like a bowl. His nostrils
are clogged with bacteria and dried mucus and the skin around his
closed eyes puffs out, giving him the face of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has become home for hundreds of thousands of whip-shaped
parasites called trypanosomes. They have fed on his blood and made
their way into his brain. Generally the human victim of such an
invasion sinks into an irritable haze, slips into a coma and dies.
Hence the name of the disease: sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where you are?'' a woman asks in English, and a
Sudanese nurse translates. He nods and says, ``Tambura,'' the name
of the town where this hospital is located. The woman tries to bend
his head, but it's too stiff _ his entire back is rigid as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in and you can't bend their head,'' the
woman says to the Sudanese men and women standing with her by the
cot, ``get a doctor immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mickey Richer. She is a short 53-year-old woman with
a gray mop of hair, dressed in a T-shirt and pale-blue surgical
pants. She prescribes shots of steroids and says, ``OK, Justin, see
you later.'' He offers no response, not even a glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102 other patients at the Tambura County Hospital
being treated today for advanced sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 in Tambura County
who are sick with the disease _ 20 percent of the population. And
he is only one of perhaps hundreds of thousands who have become
infected recently in southern Sudan and its neighbors, the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly
Zaire).
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a disease fading into oblivion, sleeping
sickness is raging again, particularly here. In all of southern
Sudan, Richer is running the only program to fight the disease, and
she is able to save only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richer was already in her 40s when she began working in places
like Tambura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do Third World work; that's why I went to
medical school,'' she says. ``I thought I'd be a pediatrician for
one or two years and then move on. I loved the kids so much I
stayed around for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally left her practice in Denver in 1987 to spend a year
in northern Sudan, working in a camp for refugees driven there by
recurrent famines.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward she went to the prestigious Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine and then returned to Africa with the
International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based group of doctors
and nurses who bring medical care to places wrecked by war and
disaster, such as Angola, Bosnia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer first came to Tambura in 1994, she didn't know she
was landing in the middle of an epidemic. Her job was to resurrect
the county hospital, abandoned during the ongoing civil war. But it
didn't take Richer long to notice the parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a few people with sleeping sickness in 1994,'' she
remembers, ``and in 1995 I treated 19 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and
mortality, things like malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections.
Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Richer has in fact managed to keep this corner of Tambura County
healthy, but she doesn't feel much sense of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deluding myself that by treating 1,500 patients we've
done anything with the epidemic. Probably not. There are probably
12,000 infected people out there, and still a lot of people left
for those tsetse flies to bite. But you've got to start
somewhere.''

 By CARL ZIMMER 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Justin Kalesto doesn't want to wake up. A woman is calling his
name, but he turns his head deeper into his pillow. He is 12 years
old, and from Mangbangau, a village deep in remote southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Justin's sunken abdomen curves inward like a bowl. His nostrils
are clogged with bacteria and dried mucus and the skin around his
closed eyes puffs out, giving him the face of a frog.
</P>
<P>
   Justin has become home for hundreds of thousands of whip-shaped
parasites called trypanosomes. They have fed on his blood and made
their way into his brain. Generally the human victim of such an
invasion sinks into an irritable haze, slips into a coma and dies.
Hence the name of the disease: sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know where you are?'' a woman asks in English, and a
Sudanese nurse translates. He nods and says, ``Tambura,'' the name
of the town where this hospital is located. The woman tries to bend
his head, but it's too stiff _ his entire back is rigid as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone comes in and you can't bend their head,'' the
woman says to the Sudanese men and women standing with her by the
cot, ``get a doctor immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Mickey Richer. She is a short 53-year-old woman with
a gray mop of hair, dressed in a T-shirt and pale-blue surgical
pants. She prescribes shots of steroids and says, ``OK, Justin, see
you later.'' He offers no response, not even a glance.
</P>
<P>
   There are 102 other patients at the Tambura County Hospital
being treated today for advanced sleeping sickness.
</P>
<P>
   Justin is one of an estimated 9,000 to 12,000 in Tambura County
who are sick with the disease _ 20 percent of the population. And
he is only one of perhaps hundreds of thousands who have become
infected recently in southern Sudan and its neighbors, the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly
Zaire).
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a disease fading into oblivion, sleeping
sickness is raging again, particularly here. In all of southern
Sudan, Richer is running the only program to fight the disease, and
she is able to save only a handful of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Richer was already in her 40s when she began working in places
like Tambura.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do Third World work; that's why I went to
medical school,'' she says. ``I thought I'd be a pediatrician for
one or two years and then move on. I loved the kids so much I
stayed around for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally left her practice in Denver in 1987 to spend a year
in northern Sudan, working in a camp for refugees driven there by
recurrent famines.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward she went to the prestigious Liverpool School of
Tropical Medicine and then returned to Africa with the
International Medical Corps, a Los Angeles-based group of doctors
and nurses who bring medical care to places wrecked by war and
disaster, such as Angola, Bosnia and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer first came to Tambura in 1994, she didn't know she
was landing in the middle of an epidemic. Her job was to resurrect
the county hospital, abandoned during the ongoing civil war. But it
didn't take Richer long to notice the parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a few people with sleeping sickness in 1994,'' she
remembers, ``and in 1995 I treated 19 patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The single-celled trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness
spend their time cycling between humans and tsetse flies. They
linger in the gut of the fly, absorbing amino acids and other
molecules that the fly gets by biting mammals. After about 10 days
the trypanosomes move into the fly's salivary glands.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for their new home, the parasites cloak themselves in
a coat made of millions of copies of a single sugary molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Our immune cells fashion antibodies that correspond to this
molecule's shape, and the antibodies enable the immune system to
kill the parasite in huge numbers.
</P>
<P>
   But some individual trypanosomes take evasive action. They shut
down the genes they use to build their coat and turn on a new set
in their place. They can then build a new surface molecule, one
similar enough to the old one to do the job but which no longer
matches the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now invisible, the parasite thrives while the immune system
starts a new eradication campaign from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But trypanosomes have hundreds of coat-coding genes that they
hold in reserve, and they can easily continue to slip away from the
body's attack. As they wear out the immune system, the parasites
feed on their host's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Months or years can pass before some of them cross the barrier
that protects the brain.
</P>
<P>
   When Richer came to Tambura, there hadn't been a major outbreak
of sleeping sickness since the late '70s, and at first she simply
dealt with cases as they came in. But the number steadily grew: The
19 patients she treated in 1995 became 87 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Richer estimated that in Tambura County, 20 percent of
the people were infected. Back in 1988, she calculated, the rate
had been no more than .5 percent. Over the course of nine years it
had multiplied 40 times.
</P>
<P>
   If a person tests positive for sleeping sickness, there is only
one way to know if the trypanosomes have reached the brain, and
that is to perform a spinal tap.
</P>
<P>
   If the patient is lucky, and no parasites are found in the
cerebrospinal fluid, he or she will be treated with a drug called
pentamidine. After 10 daily injections, most of them are cured.
</P>
<P>
   People with parasites in their cerebrospinal fluid have a much
harder future ahead of them. Pentamidine is useless for these
people. In their advanced condition they need stronger stuff _ a
nasty potion known as melarsoprol.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol is, essentially, a poison. It is almost 20 percent
arsenic. If the melarsoprol should seep out of the vein, it kills
the surrounding tissue, creating a swollen, painful mass of flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least the therapy has to be stopped for a few days,
and at worst the arm may have to be amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Carsello, a nurse from San Francisco, has been teaching the
nurses at the hospital how to administer melarsoprol and deal with
its side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The adult patients bow their heads and clench their teeth as the
drug hits their veins. The screaming children have to be pinned
down.
</P>
<P>
   Melarsoprol works its cure quickly. However, it can cause
trouble quickly too. In a small fraction of patients such as Justin
Kalesto, the brain suddenly swells. Other patients come out of
their comas in a psychotic state.
</P>
<P>
   Richer and Carsello remember some of the nicer psychotics
fondly: the girl who danced through the yard all day, the boy who
escaped from the hospital, went to a compound where care workers
lived, took 21 empty yellow plastic jerricans and stacked them
meticulously next to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ----
</P>
<P>
   The next day Justin is still alive. In fact, the swelling of his
head and neck has gone down, his nose is clean, and when Richer
comes to examine him he is propped on his elbows, slowly drinking
broth out of a bowl. He still doesn't want to smile or talk, but
Richer is glad to see he's better. It means he'll probably be
cured.
</P>
<P>
   Richer's original plan was to stop the epidemic by wiping out
the disease throughout Tambura County. It called for screening
every village, testing everybody in the ones hardest hit,
identifying the patients' stage of the disease, treating them and
following them up for two years to make sure they didn't relapse.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag came to $2.4 million for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance at the U.S.
Administration for International Development agreed to come up with
money, but only $1 million _ enough to screen and treat 20,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government said, `I'm sorry, it's a million. You can find
and treat as many people as you can with a million, but that's it,
you're not getting any more,''' Richer says. ``I cried and fought
and yelled and screamed and kicked. I said to them, `God, how can I
pick which 20,000?'''
</P>
<P>
   According to Valerie Newson Guarnieri, senior regional team
leader for USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, stopping
the outbreak was beyond their focus on primary health care in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to address the major causes of morbidity and
mortality, things like malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections.
Sleeping sickness was not part of that strategy,'' she says. ``We
were willing to contribute to get the disease back down to endemic
levels, but we just don't have the resources to eradicate the
disease. We hoped our initial input would help bring other donors
to the table.'' It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As of April, Richer's staff had screened more than 10,000
people, and they'd treated more than 1,500 of them. Only four
people out of 700 in the first stage of sleeping sickness died, and
20 out of 800 stage 2 patients. About 10 percent of stage 1
patients have relapsed, and 25 percent to 35 percent of stage 2
patients. Some of them can be treated with alternative drugs, but
others can't be helped.
</P>
<P>
   Richer has in fact managed to keep this corner of Tambura County
healthy, but she doesn't feel much sense of victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not deluding myself that by treating 1,500 patients we've
done anything with the epidemic. Probably not. There are probably
12,000 infected people out there, and still a lot of people left
for those tsetse flies to bite. But you've got to start
somewhere.''

   ``I saved the most interesting case for last,'' said Molly
Wilson, the resident who'd been on call the night before.
</P>
<P>
   As the attending physician that month, the most senior doctor on
the service, it was my job to make sure the children in the
Infants' Unit got the best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby's name is Jarret Fox,'' Molly continued. ``He's a
3-month-old who was admitted last night for dehydration. His mom
says Jarret was happy and healthy a week ago. Then, on Tuesday, he
seemed to lose interest in nursing. He just stopped sucking, his
mother says, and he hasn't eaten anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right,'' I responded. ``Three-month-olds don't
just suddenly stop nursing and starve themselves until they get
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't believe it either at first, but the mother
keeps telling the same story: She's been trying to force-feed him
since Wednesday but hasn't had any success. Yesterday she brought
him to her pediatrician. He said Jarret was about 5 percent
dehydrated. He also said the kid was much floppier than he'd been
the last time he'd seen him. So he sent him in for rehydration and
a full evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The part about the increased floppiness made my heart sink. It
suggested a condition I hoped this baby didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas about a diagnosis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think of is spinal muscular atrophy,''
Molly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm thinking, too,'' I replied. ``I hope we're
wrong. Let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a diagnosis of the infantile form of SMA is a death
sentence. A relatively rare inherited disease in which the nerves
that control movement mysteriously degenerate and disappear, it is
the childhood equivalent of the better-known (but no better
understood) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the nerves vanish during the first months of life, a child
with SMA grows progressively weaker. After initial problems with
feeding, the infant loses the ability to move its arms and legs.
Breathing also becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the child becomes more and more hungry for air until
finally, by about the first birthday, he or she dies. The cause is
usually pneumonia, a common infection in lungs that aren't getting
enough air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox,'' Molly said as we approached Jarret's crib, ``this
is Dr. Marion. He's our attending pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry we have to meet under these circumstances,'' I said.
Barefoot, clad in a peasant blouse and bell-bottom jeans, her long,
straight hair parted down the middle, Jarret's mom looked like a
long-lost refugee from the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, Ms. Fox spilled out the short tale of her son's
life. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Jarret had been born at his
parents' home. He was the couple's second child: their daughter,
Jessica, now 3 years old, was ``healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his birth was attended only by a midwife, Jarret was
examined on the first day of life by the family's pediatrician (the
only one in the area who practiced homeopathic medicine and made
house calls) and declared to be in excellent health. His mother
could think of nothing unusual about her son's newborn period.
</P>
<P>
   The infant had been seen by the pediatrician on a regular
schedule. He'd received his immunizations and had been growing and
developing normally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained that her family were strict vegetarians who
ate only whole, natural foods. She assured me that Jarret had had
nothing but breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago this idyllic existence had ended. Jarret had
simply refused to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wouldn't latch onto my breast,'' she said sadly.
``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

   ``I saved the most interesting case for last,'' said Molly
Wilson, the resident who'd been on call the night before.
</P>
<P>
   As the attending physician that month, the most senior doctor on
the service, it was my job to make sure the children in the
Infants' Unit got the best care possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This baby's name is Jarret Fox,'' Molly continued. ``He's a
3-month-old who was admitted last night for dehydration. His mom
says Jarret was happy and healthy a week ago. Then, on Tuesday, he
seemed to lose interest in nursing. He just stopped sucking, his
mother says, and he hasn't eaten anything since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't be right,'' I responded. ``Three-month-olds don't
just suddenly stop nursing and starve themselves until they get
dehydrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I didn't believe it either at first, but the mother
keeps telling the same story: She's been trying to force-feed him
since Wednesday but hasn't had any success. Yesterday she brought
him to her pediatrician. He said Jarret was about 5 percent
dehydrated. He also said the kid was much floppier than he'd been
the last time he'd seen him. So he sent him in for rehydration and
a full evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The part about the increased floppiness made my heart sink. It
suggested a condition I hoped this baby didn't have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas about a diagnosis?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think of is spinal muscular atrophy,''
Molly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm thinking, too,'' I replied. ``I hope we're
wrong. Let's go see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Put simply, a diagnosis of the infantile form of SMA is a death
sentence. A relatively rare inherited disease in which the nerves
that control movement mysteriously degenerate and disappear, it is
the childhood equivalent of the better-known (but no better
understood) amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   As the nerves vanish during the first months of life, a child
with SMA grows progressively weaker. After initial problems with
feeding, the infant loses the ability to move its arms and legs.
Breathing also becomes difficult.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the child becomes more and more hungry for air until
finally, by about the first birthday, he or she dies. The cause is
usually pneumonia, a common infection in lungs that aren't getting
enough air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox,'' Molly said as we approached Jarret's crib, ``this
is Dr. Marion. He's our attending pediatrician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry we have to meet under these circumstances,'' I said.
Barefoot, clad in a peasant blouse and bell-bottom jeans, her long,
straight hair parted down the middle, Jarret's mom looked like a
long-lost refugee from the Summer of Love.
</P>
<P>
   At my request, Ms. Fox spilled out the short tale of her son's
life. After an uncomplicated pregnancy, Jarret had been born at his
parents' home. He was the couple's second child: their daughter,
Jessica, now 3 years old, was ``healthy as a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his birth was attended only by a midwife, Jarret was
examined on the first day of life by the family's pediatrician (the
only one in the area who practiced homeopathic medicine and made
house calls) and declared to be in excellent health. His mother
could think of nothing unusual about her son's newborn period.
</P>
<P>
   The infant had been seen by the pediatrician on a regular
schedule. He'd received his immunizations and had been growing and
developing normally.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fox explained that her family were strict vegetarians who
ate only whole, natural foods. She assured me that Jarret had had
nothing but breast milk.
</P>
<P>
   But four days ago this idyllic existence had ended. Jarret had
simply refused to nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wouldn't latch onto my breast,'' she said sadly.
``Nothing I did got him interested. It was like a switch had been
turned off in his brain and he wouldn't do it anymore. Just like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Has he been hungry?'' I asked, less certain now about the
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first he was,'' she said. ``That first day, he cried and
cried. It was pathetic. But since then, he's just been lifeless,
like he just doesn't care anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me again, when did you first notice this change in
Jarret?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday afternoon,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``When he woke up from
his nap. He's usually starving when he wakes up. But that day, I
couldn't get him to take my breast for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded. ``And your 3-year-old. Tell me, how does she get along
with Jarret? Does she help you take care of him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, she's crazy about him,'' Ms. Fox replied with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Jarret's exclusively breast-fed, she hasn't ever fed
him, has she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we'd never let her. But she always pretends to feed him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But as far as you know, she's never actually fed him?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely not,'' Ms. Fox replied. ``My husband and I are
always at the table supervising. We'd never let Jess put anything
in the baby's mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded and continued: ``Ms. Fox, what does Jessica have for
breakfast?''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, somewhat surprised by the non sequitur, answered
without hesitation: ``A bowl of hot oatmeal and a glass of milk.
Why do you ask?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Jessica eat the oatmeal plain, or does she put sugar on
it?'' I asked, already knowing what the answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Ms. Fox gave me an angry look. ``Dr. Marion, we eat
only whole, natural foods _ no meat, no processed food, no sugar.
Sugar is poison.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, no sugar,'' I pushed on. ``But does Jessica use anything
to sweeten her oatmeal?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow her to use a teaspoon or two of honey,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Fox, we have to do some tests, but I think Jarret's going
to be OK. I'm pretty sure he's got botulism.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Early that Tuesday morning, the Foxes were all in the kitchen.
Jarret had been placed at the table next to his sister, who was
enjoying a bowl of oatmeal that had been topped with a few dollops
of natural honey, straight from the hive.
</P>
<P>
   The children's parents had perhaps stepped away from the table
to prepare their own breakfasts. Suddenly, Jessica, pretending to
be Jarret's mother, silently offered her brother a spoonful of
cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The infant eagerly accepted the offer, and Jessica, still in
silence, finished off the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jarret took his usual afternoon nap. When he
awoke, his mother found that he could no longer take her breast.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Fox continued to answer my questions, I became more
convinced that this scenario (or one like it) had occurred. It had
to have: After hearing the story and seeing Jarret, there was no
other logical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans believe that when applied to foods, terms like
``pure'' and ``natural'' are synonymous with ``healthy'' and
``nutritious.'' This may be accurate for most foods, but not honey.
</P>
<P>
   Eating honey _ in both natural and processed form _ can lead to
serious disease or even death in infants. Because of the
environment in which it's produced, unprocessed honey often
contains spores of Clostridium botulinum, the bacterium that causes
botulism. The same can be true for processed honey.
</P>
<P>
   In most humans, the spores cause no problems: Immune cells in
the intestinal tracts of older children and adults release proteins
that readily bind to and destroy the toxin. But in children under 1
year of age, infants whose intestinal tracts are still immature,
the C. botulinum survives and starts making toxins. And that spells
big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If the child is supported through this period _ if he is
tube-fed, provided with oxygen, and placed on a ventilator if
breathing becomes difficult _ he will eventually return to the
state he was in prior to the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Lab results confirmed the presence of C. botulinum toxin not
only in Jarret's serum and feces but in a specimen taken from the
jar of honey from the Foxes' pantry as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jarret, it took him more than five weeks to return to his
prepoisoned state, and his recovery was not without complication.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of his admission to the hospital, his breathing
had become labored, and when a blood-gas analysis revealed signs of
respiratory failure, he was transferred to the icu, where he was
intubated and placed on a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks he remained dependent on machines, unable to breathe,
suck or swallow, cry or smile, or move any of his muscles. He
continued to be fed milk pumped from his mother's breast (she
wouldn't allow him to be fed anything else) through the feeding
tube.
</P>
<P>
   Then in early March, his nurse noted what appeared to be a
flicker of movement in his left leg. It was so subtle at first that
she thought she'd only imagined it, but more movement occurred in
the following hours. Slowly but surely, Jarret was regaining
control of his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, he was gradually weaned off the
ventilator. Soon the feeding tube was removed, and he began eating
on his own again, first from a syringe, then from a bottle, and
finally, more than a month after he had entered the hospital,
directly from his mother's breast. Just about back to his old self,
he was discharged in the middle of March.

 &HT;    Ohioans protest: ``Adulterers end up in hell''
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington and Laura Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI , Ohio _ It took Bill Clinton's sexual turmoil to put
the civic spirit into Debbie Graham and Peggy Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The two, from nearby Kenwood, Ohio, stood in a warm, drizzling
rain in a crowd of about 150 protesters recently near a Amberley
Village home where Bill Clinton visited for a $5,000 per plate
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   They had never protested anything in public before, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her today and said 'I'm angry' and she said she was
angry, too,'' said Graham, 43.
</P>
<P>
   The two were not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about sex; this is about honor,'' said Jane Thole,
a homemaker from suburban Sycamore.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a crowd filled with veteran protestors were
dozens of people who said Clinton's behavior with Monica Lewinsky
infuriated them so much they came to shout their outrage in public
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Their signs were blunt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Resign''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is unfit for any public office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adulterers end up in Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Clinton's affair with Lewinsky and the public
turmoil it has created has made her job more difficult trying to
raise her son to respect women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of mothers who are dealing with these very
difficult issues,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The new protestors found strange bedfellows with the others,
most anti-abortion protestors, who unfurled religious banners and
held large, graphic photographs of fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   A protesting regular, who would not give his name but said he
had picketed hundreds of abortion clinics, looked around. ``There
are a lot of people here I have never seen before,'' he said. ``New
faces. It's real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's dark-windowed limousine and its caravan whisked past
the group in less than a minute, serenaded with the angry shouts of
``Time to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the home of attorney Stanley Chesley, Clinton helped
raise an estimated $250,000 for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, eating lunch with about 50 people including
Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls, who is running for Congress, and
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Leland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told them the money raised would help get Qualls and
other Democrats elected to Congress. He alluded only briefly to the
Lewinsky scandal, talking instead about work that needs to be done
to strengthen the economy and the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary and I are fine,'' he said. ``We're working on what we
need to work on. We are doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Chesley's home, Clinton made unscheduled visits in
downtown Cincinnati, dropping in at the Findlay Market for about 20
minutes, shaking hands and saying hello to the 100 patrons there,
then crossing the street for a bowl of Tex-Mex chili.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an experience for me because I knew the chili was good
but I didn't know it was that good,'' said Greg Magruder, co-owner
of the Gold Star Chili on Race Street. ``It was an experience I'll
probably never get over in my life _ to meet a person of that
magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Magruder answered the president's questions about how he got
into the restaurant business and served Clinton a 3-ounce bowl of
chili and cup of Maxwell House decaf. ``He seemed to enjoy it,''
Magruder said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was becoming well fed; in his remarks an hour earlier at
the Chesley fund-raiser Clinton said he had eaten so much he was
feeling a little sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder said Secret Service agents ate at the restaurant on
Wednesday and asked questions without identifying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Magruder plans to hang the photo of him and the president in the
restaurant as well as in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kroeger of Kroeger &AMP; Sons Meats in the Findlay Market said
Clinton received cheers from most of the people around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of neat to see. It was good for the neighborhood.
It made people here feel special,'' Kroeger said.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ In the end, public opinion may
decide whether President Clinton serves out the rest of his term.
But, for now, public opinion is having little impact on the nasty
doings here. (Glass, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ While we all vicariously joined the president of
the United States as he contemplated Monica flashing her thong
undies and in general were puzzling out who had done what and with
which and to whom, there was a murder in Washington. Congressional
Republicans finally did in campaign-funding reform. (Teepen, Cox
News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   LANE-COLUMN _ Baseball is a game of long memories. Sammy Sosa
and Mark McGwire not only faced down this year's pitchers but
generations of past players. Nobody really plays them one game at a
time. Each game projects into an eternity of statistics, lists and
stories. (Lane, Daytona Beach News-Journal) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ There are lost episodes of ``The
Honeymooners,'' lost episodes of ``I Love Lucy,'' lost episodes of
just about any timeworn sitcom. And television is not alone in this
gambit. Now Ernest Hemingway will publish another ``posthumous''
book. It's his fourth. I don't think he'd agree with the decision.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN19 _ Who can recall what you did with the pan after
your mother finished baking cookies or cake? John C. Westervelt of
Tulsa, Okla., remembers it in delightful detail. Here's his story.
(Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   MURRAY-COLUMN20 _ ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Here's a story from
long ago, a small town's tale of love, sex and six-guns. (Murray,
Cox News Service) MOVED FRIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ Texas Comptroller John Sharp, who is running
for lieutenant governor, is battling accusations by Republican
backers of his opponent, Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry, that
his claims of having saved the state $8.5 billion over the past
seven years are grossly exaggerated. (Borders, Nacogdoches Daily
Sentinel) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EZZARD-COLUMN _ I have difficulty understanding why President
Clinton or any leader who cared about his family and country would
not resign, given the nature of his behavior in the Lewinsky affair
and the public revelation of it. (Ezzard, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   LATHAM-COLUMN _ What I hope is that pornography, whether from
your dirty book store or direct from your government, doesn't
become a way of life. (Latham, Marshall News Messenger) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Americans should think of Janet
Reno when they are grossed out by the Clinton-Lewinsky zippergate
scandal. Had Attorney General Reno not recommended the appointment
of an independent counsel, it's possible that the nation would have
been spared the sordid Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, at least with
Clinton as president. (Nethaway, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 &HT;    Dolphins aren't fed a line_just a lineman
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Some NFL rookies take their newfound wealth and
stockpile cars. A Porsche for Monday. A Mercedes for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Lorenzo Bromell. He has loaded up on baseball
caps. Not different caps, mind you. Just New York Yankees' caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the Bronx, 20 blocks from Yankee Stadium,'' he
explained. ``It's in my blood.''
</P>
<P>
   New York to Miami. It's hardly an unusual journey. But the path
Bromell took to get where he is today _ a fourth-round pick who
suddenly looks like the steal of the NFL draft _ is different.
</P>
<P>
   His journey included high school in a small South Carolina town,
5:30 a.m. wakeup calls at a military school in Georgia, and,
finally, two years at Clemson University _ all of which went
virtually unnoticed by NFL scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell people about him,'' said Reggie Herring,
Clemson defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was trying to convince people to look past the fact
that Bromell didn't have 285 pounds on his 6-foot-6 frame, that he
``only'' weighed 265. Herring tried putting into words what made
Bromell special, what had made Clemson alumni repeatedly come up to
the coaching staff and say, ``We love that 99.'' But even as
Herring was uttering the words, he knew they sounded like hyperbole
and cliche.
</P>
<P>
   (ITALICS) ``He's so fast he can pluck a rooster while he's
chasing it. ... He works hard every day, every snap. ... He loves
to play.'' (END)

   As Herring tossed out this praise, he could see the scouts' eyes
glaze over. They had heard it all before. Another kid who plays
really hard. Yeah, yeah. Probably gives 110 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all figured I was just another coach trying to sell one
of my kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came the guy who gave Herring his first coaching job
back at Oklahoma State: Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson figured Herring wouldn't feed him a line. He looked at
the tapes of Bromell. He saw a player who lived in the opponents'
backfield. So on draft day Johnson waited until the fourth round.
Then, as the Baltimore Ravens were on the phone talking to Bromell,
telling him they were going to draft him, Johnson traded a fourth-
and fifth-round pick to Philadelphia. The move was only 10 spots.
But Johnson calls it the second-best trade he's ever made _ behind
the one that landed Emmitt Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Bromell missed the season opener with a knee sprain. But in his
NFL debut, he sacked Buffalo quarterback Rob Johnson twice. That,
combined with his play in preseason, has made believers around the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all coming back and saying, `Boy, we blew it on that
Bromell kid,''' Herring said. ``(Johnson) got a Wal-Mart special.
... He paid 35 cents and got a kid that I guarantee they're having
a hard time keeping off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Bromell off the field has been a problem ever since that
Saturday morning when Rita Bromell took her son to sign up for
Little League football. He fell in love with the game instantly.
Kept telling his mom he was going to be a football player. She was
more worried about other things _ like an education, and how he was
going to get one in New York.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Rita Bromell knows all about the New York Public School
System. She has been working as school security officer for 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lock up kids every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, when it came time for her second son to enter high
school, she shipped him to Georgetown, S.C., the small town where
she and her ex-husband grew up, the place where Lorenzo's father
still lived and worked in a steel mill.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, violence had become a part of Bromell's life. He
shrugs when asked about the time he got mugged _ then explains it
was hardly one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to it,'' he said. ``It sounds funny, but you get
used to it. You see it. You end up doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   To take him away from that, his mother sent him South. That
started the process. But it didn't complete it. That required two
occurences. First, he failed to meet academic requirements to play
Division I football. Second, he met Robert Nunn.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn is the football coach at Georgia Military College, a small
two-year college located in Milledgeville, Ga. It is a school where
the football players used to get up at 5:30 a.m. _ now they get to
sleep to 6 a.m. _ put on a military uniform and begin a highly
structured day. Classes. Morning formation. Study hall. Meetings.
The only free time is the 45 minutes before the 10:30 p.m. lights
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were more schools like GMC, there'd be a lot less
jails,'' Nunn said.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Bromell was headed to jail. The problem, Nunn
recalls, was that he didn't seem to be headed anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed direction,'' he said. ``My wife tutored him. She
said right away, `Lorenzo is plenty smart enough. He just needs
some guidance.'''
</P>
<P>
   He got that from Nunn, who played for Johnson and Dolphins tight
end coach Pat Jones at Oklahoma State. Nunn laughs when he recalls
some of the talks he had with Bromell during Bromell's freshman
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wore out my size 12 Nikes a few times,'' he said. ``But
eventually something clicked. It was like there was a switch. And
once it was flipped, it stayed on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still on.
</P>
<P>
   He has made it to the NFL and he is doing everything Nunn and
Herring said he would. He is making cliches come true every day in
practice. And afterward, he is slipping into a New York Yankees'
cap. The first-place Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life,'' he said, ``is grand.''

 &HT;    Longhorns fight the odds
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Manhattan is the land of opportunity, with or
without a little help from Vernon Jordan. In 1626, an enterprising
Peter Minuit flagged down some passing locals, plied them with
beads, cloth and trinkets worth an estimated $24, and walked away
with the whole island.
</P>
<P>
   OK, different Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan where the Texas Longhorns will venture September
19 has transportation woes _ they're trying to figure out where to
put the bike paths _ and it's nickname officially is the Apple. The
Little Apple.
</P>
<P>
   There lurk the Kansas State Wildcats, bullies of the weak,
untested claimants to the title of the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   There, for the Longhorns, lurks opportunity. To get crushed,
humilated, ripped apart _ yes.
</P>
<P>
   To find out what they've got _ you bet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's giving us a chance,'' Coach Mack Brown said. ``I told
the team the other day their nickname should be, 'Against All
Odds.'''
</P>
<P>
   Little is expected from the Longhorns defense, which would have
to play far above its collective heads to remain competitive
against a Wildcats offense that has a quarterback and kicker who
can hit the deep ball better than Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   And they probably really haven't shown anything yet.
</P>
<P>
   Brown marveled over the Wildcats' 59-7 halftime lead against
Northern Illinois. ``That game plan didn't even get to the second
page,'' he said. ``Not even to the second column.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the Longhorns' opportunity comes in. If the Horns
can match up to the 25-point favorite Wildcats anywhere, it is on
offense, even with redshirt freshman Major Applewhite getting his
first career start.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the only running back with a 100-yard game against
the Wildcats was Nebraska's Ahman Green, who ripped them for 193.
Ohio was the only other team with success running on KSU last year,
utilizing an option attack and losing only 23-20 in the season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   So far this season, the Wildcats have faced two option teams.
They dismantled both. They haven't even shown much of their blitz
packages. They will Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for the Horns and their West Coast
offense, even though KSU plays an overshifted front similar to
UCLA's, and the Horns had moderate success against the Bruins, who
are good, but not at KSU's level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time for miscommunication or a slow start,''
said tackle Jay Humphrey. ``We have to go after it from the get
go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose, we won't be slaughtered,'' Horns halfback Ricky
Williams said. ``If we're slaughtered, it'll be because we beat
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Williams said, ``For me to win the Heisman,
the team has to go out and win the rest of our games, or close to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Horns to win their next game, Williams needs to be even
more powerful, more elusive, a better blocker and a more competent
receiver than he has in any game he's played at Texas. And he must
do it against a defense he lumps with the '95 Oklahoma and Texas
A&AMP;M defenses as the best he's faced. Williams averaged .5 yards a
carry against the Sooners, but against the Aggies he averaged 11.6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of (Kansas State's) linebackers,'' Williams said.
``They're aggressive, hit, take pride in playing defense, and
they're fast. They come after you.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's a challenge, a mano-a-mano confrontation, whose pads get
lower, whose legs stop driving last . . . something to relish,
right Ricky?
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on who the line blocks,'' Williams said.
``If they don't block well, I won't like going up against them.''
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, every play will look like a Wildcats team picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always outnumber you,'' offensive coordinator Greg Davis
said. ``Their philosphy is to outnumber the run. We have to do
things, formation-wise, to establish the run. The key is to make
sure Ricky knows where the extra guy is.''
</P>
<P>
   And he must beat him. Flanker Kwame Cavil, who will have to make
the most of the passes he sees on Saturday, has the right idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a receiver you want them to stack it up, because then it's
you and the corner, how bad you want to beat them, how bad they
don't want to get beat,'' he said. ``When it's one-on-one it's his
heart on yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get that, too. We'll see eight on the line . . . nine .
. . 10 . . . 11 . . . 12 . . . however many they can put there.''

 &HT;    Tame hockey takes over rink
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. _ Remember the joke about the guy who went to the
fights and returned home to report that a hockey game broke out?
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the new $185 million home of the Florida Panthers
are probably more concerned that fans will leave their rink talking
about the heated croquet match that ignited.
</P>
<P>
   The days of going to a hockey game and getting intimately
acquainted with the beer breath and body odor of the fan in the
next seat have come to a screeching halt for some. Just listen to
the latest point-of-sale buzzwords pitched to corporate patrons of
the new National Car Rental Center: `
</P>
<P>
   `Segregated from the general population.''
</P>
<P>
   In a press tour Thursday, managers for the Panthers' impressive
new digs explained how the almost 4,000 club-level and
executive-level patrons will park their cars under the arena in
private lots, be met by a concierge and whisked quickly up four or
five flights in private elevators to private rooms with private
seating equipped with private bathrooms. Private bars (with private
bartenders) and private catering is par for the course. In-house
business centers provide access to fax machines and computers, and
private media rooms are nearby if the big deal is cinched.
</P>
<P>
   And if your corporate customer wants a smoke, there are private
outdoor patios for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Beer and pretzels? You'd be slumming it. The catered menu in the
private suites, leased for $70,000 to $120,000 a year, include
herb-encrusted salmon, pulled pork and boeuf bourguignon carving
stations, sushi, fruit salad and 18 different types of desserts _
all made on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   The upscale facility is the most recent example of the new wave
of sports complexes competing for the same buck. Facility managers
know the way to break into the black after eight-digit investments
is to tap the vast corporate entertainment dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual suites have become more entertainment venues than
just sports facilities,'' said Michael Thompson, president of
Boston Concessions Group, which provides food for the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting the suite patrons to pay $25 to $30 a head (on
food) and the general public to spend between $7 and $10 on
concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend of upscale arenas and ballparks started in the late
'80s with sequestered seating and has taken off ever since. The
972,000-square-foot National Car Rental Center, with three function
rooms that can be rented out for anything from conventions to
weddings, is designed to maximize tangential profits.
</P>
<P>
   The arena was built in just 26 months. The Panthers, owned by
businessman H. Wayne Huizenga, are moving from the Miami Arena,
which they shared with the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise, which came up with $34 million in incentives, was
chosen from among six sites. To pay for the new digs, Broward
County sold $185 million in bonds. The arena's $13.4 million debt
will be covered by rent (the team will pay $3.4 million annually),
Broward County's hotel tax and the state sales tax rebate. A study
in 1995 by Arthur Andersen estimated the arena would generate $87
million in annual fan spending.
</P>
<P>
   National Car Rental Center will seat 19,088 for Panthers games.
It also features The Lexus Lounge, The Budweiser Terrace and
Stanley's Shoot Twice sports bar, a high-class pub with faux
panther-claw scratches on the glass tables. The pub is open only to
the upper echelon of clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Situated to take advantage of the Broward, Dade and Palm Beach
County markets, the arena offers a good view of the Fort Lauderdale
skyline, the Sawgrass Mills Outlet Mall and the Everglades from the
upper patios.
</P>
<P>
   Though the seat covers for Joe Sixpack aren't leather and the
armrests are plastic, not wood, the sight lines from every section
are exceptionally good. Even the nosebleed seats offer an excellent
view: Just 95 feet above the rink, compared with 250 feet at other
stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs ($3.50) and beer ($4.50-$5) are on sale at the public
concession but so is conch chowder ($3.50) and chicken Caesar salad
($5.50).
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices for Panther games start at $14 and go up to $65,
but parking is $10 for each of the 4,787 general spaces. Suite and
club seat parking is $15. There are a total of 7,600 spaces,
including 95 disabled spots. The lot is lighted, and officials say
every space is within a seven-minute walk of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition hockey games will be played at the center Sept. 27
and Oct. 1. Celine Dion will play Oct. 3, and Elton John is
scheduled for the following day.
</P>
<P>
   The facility also will house boxing matches, basketball
tournaments, arena football (AFL South Florida Bobcats) and indoor
soccer (the Florida Thundercats), ice shows, circuses and
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as potty parity is concerned, Huizenga kept his word
when he promised two years ago that the new facility wouldn't have
any of the long lines at women's restrooms so common at arenas.
There are 274 toilets for women and total of 226 toilets and
urinals for men. Both are NHL records.

 &HT;    The Starr Report, Fanny Hill and the dangers of pornography
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading the Starr Report, skimming and skipping to get to all
the good parts, I couldn't help but feel as if I had read all of
this before. Nothing in the recent past, to be sure, but sometime.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit me. As a blossoming teenager (and I use that term
loosely) I had uncovered a copy of Fanny Hill, an 18th century
novel by John Cleland underneath my parents' bed.
</P>
<P>
   Starr Report; Fanny Hill. Much the same. The writing is better
in Fanny Hill, but there are more good parts in the Starr Report.
I'd call it a toss-up.
</P>
<P>
   (Which brings me to an aside. Why would any parent who wanted to
hide anything put it under their bed? It is the first place
children look. No, if you want to hide something put it smack dab
in the middle of the bookcase where it will be totally safe from
the observation of children. Put math books under your bed. It
might be the only way to get your kids to study.)
</P>
<P>
   In any case , reading Fanny Hill was a revelation for me. Well,
it was in a way. Unfortunately, I couldn't tell all that much about
what was going on in Fanny Hill.
</P>
<P>
   I recognized the word ``bosoms'' which, for a 13-year-old, is
pretty much all I needed to know. I had no idea what ``tumescence''
meant or the dozens of other high-class words Cleland used to write
what essentially was porn. Funny, but once I was old enough to
understood the words, I had no desire to read the book.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Fanny Hill and the Starr Report is, of
course, that what my parents called filth, kids today have another
word for: Homework.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the first time in the history of the Republic that
everyone in civics class actually completes a reading assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is we're going to have to convince all those boys
to just say no to cigars.
</P>
<P>
   What I hope is that pornography, whether from your dirty book
store or direct from your government, doesn't become a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I can tell you a story of woe what happened to a friend
of mine when she and her husband ventured into the seedy world of
pornography and literally found the world crashing down around
them.
</P>
<P>
   It began so innocently, as such things usually do. My friend and
her husband were getting frisky one night and began talking about
watching a dirty movie. Her husband allowed as how he had never
seen one (which sounds a bit fishy to me). My friend said she
hadn't either but was willing to try anything once.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, had they only known what the future would hold.
</P>
<P>
   What they did know was that the local video store rented porn of
the ``soft'' variety, just a little bit more risque than you might
find on HBO. They hopped in the car and made it down to the store,
which was uncommonly busy for being so late at night.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dilemma. Which one of them would actually get the
movie from the shelf? Then, once pulled from the shelf, who would
present it to the clerk for actual rental? They negotiated back and
forth and, having a good marriage, they decided to share the
responsibility. My friend would quickly grab the movie and her
husband would actually check it out. This did not make it any
easier for my friend to do the grabbing,
</P>
<P>
   especially since there was a large sign above the area that said
``Adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she had a plan. She would walk backwards to the section
and then, lo and behold, just be there. It would not be necessary
to actually pick and movie, since all pornography is essentially
the same. She would grab the first box she found and get out.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the plan worked perfectly. She sauntered
sideways and backwards until she was standing by the adult movies
but actually looking out toward the middle of the store. She
reached up quickly and grabbed the first video she put her hands
on.
</P>
<P>
   That is when it happened -- blame it on fate, a higher power, or
even termites. Because at the exact moment my friend reached up and
took that movie, the entire shelf of pornography gave way. That
shelf fell upon the next shelf, which also gave way, which fell
upon the next shelf and the next.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust cleared a few moments later, my friend was holding
one tape of pornography and standing in the middle of dozens of
other tapes, lying at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the entire store saw and heard the whole thing,
people asking her, in a standoffish kind of way, if she had been
hurt. Several of them undoubtedly noted that she was an education
official with the local adult learning program.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband was nowhere to be found, having fled the store as
the avalanche began. Needless to say, she was not feeling romantic
that night. Fortunately, their marriage survived this brief brush
with pornography, but remember their experience if you should ever
be tempted.
</P>
<P>
   Because porn weakens not only moral fiber, but apparently wood
fibers, as well.

 &HT;    Germany becomes Buckeye amid media scrutiny
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Sporting a bright lime-green T-shirt,
glow-in-the-dark sneakers and Nike ballcap with neon green swoosh,
Reggie Germany stood out at a recent interview like Dennis Rodman
would at an accountants' convention.
</P>
<P>
   It was a far cry from the blend-into-the-woodwork posture the
St. Louis, Mo., native tried to take two years ago when he shunned
his home state school to sign with Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, one of four top wide receivers at the Buckeyes'
disposal this season, whipped the Missouri Tigers and their fans
into a temporary frenzy in 1996 when he verbally committed to their
program in December, then reneged on his decision three weeks later
to sign with OSU.
</P>
<P>
   Germany said he initially said yes to the Tigers to stay close
to home. But after his mother told him to do what was best for him,
he decided OSU, with its history of producing NFL receivers, was
the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he changed his mind, we were sick,'' Missouri coach Larry
Smith said. ``We got a lot of heat for losing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one felt the heat as much as Germany, a prep
All-America at Hazlewood East High School who had to endure the
phone calls and questions and media scrutiny that surrounded his
decision to become a Buckeye.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a good three weeks where he was really down with
it,'' Germany's mother, Jeannette, said. ``There was a lot of
criticism. They kind of bad-mouthed him on some of the radio
stations. But I told him, 'You have to make your decision and then
you have to live with it.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Which is what Germany, a 6-2, 195-pound sophomore backup to
starting OSU receivers Dee Miller and David Boston, has done. But
with No. 21 Missouri visiting Ohio Stadium on Saturday, the
questions cropped up again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have a lot of people looking at me to see if this
was the right place for me,'' said Germany, whose only reception
last season came against Missouri in a 31-10 Buckeye victory. ``I'm
not trying to go out and prove people wrong or have a big game.
I'll get more satisfaction out of my team winning the game than me
having big individual stats.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a year under his belt and an impressive
two-touchdown performance against Toledo last week, Germany said
he's finally at peace with his decision.
</P>
<P>
   `` I wanted to be a better receiver and I felt that with
(Missouri's option quarterback) Corby Jones being there, I wasn't
going to get a good chance to be the best possible receiver I could
be,'' he said. ``I'm happy, very happy that I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper is, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably in terms of all around play _ blocking, recognizing
the defense, making adjustments, running the right routes and all
that kind of stuff _ he's as good as any receiver we have,
including David Boston and Dee Miller,'' Cooper said. ``He's been a
very dependable receiver for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State receivers coach Chuck Stobart said it's just a matter
of time before Germany works his way into a starter's role. Germany
said he's looking forward to that _ as long as he can maintain his
low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt this would be the place where I could live my life and
get away from a lot of the fame that I had at home,'' he said. ``I
just want to be an ordinary person.''

 &HT;    Anderson needs ``A'' against Packers to make Pro Bowl
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ If Bengals right tackle Willie Anderson plans
to reach his goal of making the Pro Bowl, then he needs an A on his
Sunday exam.
</P>
<P>
   All he has to do is block one of the most feared and revered
linemen in NFL history _ Packers' left defensive end Reggie White,
a 14-year veteran and the league's career sacks leader with 179.5.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 300-pound White, who earned a record 12th straight
Pro Bowl trip in 1997, turned in a dominant three-sack performance
in the Packers' 23-15 victory over Tampa Bay last week, beating
Buccaneers' tackle Jerry Wunsch at least a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   That Bengals quarterback Neil O'Donnell isn't among the 64
quarterbacks sacked by White only adds to the pressure on the 6-5,
340-pound Anderson, the Bengals' top pick (10th overall) in the
1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals offensive line coach Paul Alexander was moved to tears
talking about Anderson's matchup against White.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have one heck of a right tackle,'' Alexander said.
``We're going to find out just what kind of right tackle we've got.
I'm kind of choked up about it already. We've been talking about
this game for quite a while. I can't wait to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Anderson, ``I grew up a fan of Reggie White. I watched him
for 10 years. He's probably the best defensive end to ever play the
game. He's great and that's it. That's the only comment I'm going
to give you about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``People around here _ when we play against a great player _
tend to put a little more added pressure on. That's why I'm not
going to mention it any more. He's Reggie White and it's a big
game. There's a sold-out crowd. It's pressure, but it's another
game.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes White so good?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much he can come at you with,'' said Bengals
defensive end Clyde Simmons, White's teammate at Philadelphia from
1986-92. ``He's strong enough to run over you. He's fast enough to
run by you. And he's quick enough that he can make you miss. That's
the difference between him and a lot of players in this business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the measuring stick as to where you are as a player.
Willie understands he's going to have to play one of his best games
ever. He's going to play Reggie hard and clean and do his best.
That's all I can ask. He's going to come out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   White generated controversy in the offseason when he made some
remarks to Wisconsin lawmakers that offended gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes great courage to speak your mind,'' Simmons said.
``He was just saying what he believes. He's probably the most
loving man, the most genuine, giving man that you could ever
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the football field, White's a true warrior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an unbelievable player,'' Packers quarterback Brett Favre
said. ``We've run out of adjectives to say about Reggie White. He's
a class act on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``To watch what he did Sunday is something you can look back on
in 20 to 30 years and tell your kids and grandkids what a feat that
was. He took young guys and handled them like they were little
kids. As I told Reggie: 'You took 'em to school.' It was really
fascinating to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   White announced his retirement in the offseason, then changed
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he made the decision to play again,'' Packers coach Mike
Holmgren said, ``he dove into this offseason program and really is
in as good a shape as he's been in in five or six years. He showed
he's a force to be reckoned with still. I'm glad he changed his
mind and unretired.''

 &HT;    Forex Intenational Inc. faces financial troubles
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson, John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ His company is closed. Lawsuits are piling up.
State and federal investigators are looking into claims of
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Erxleben, former University of Texas football great
turned foreign-currency trader, wants the world to know he isn't
running away.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-minute press conference filled with concerned
investors looking for answers, Erxleben said his Austin Forex
International Inc. has experienced trading losses because of world
currency instability.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't offer angry investors any answers about what is
left of their money _ some say the company had as much as $60
million in investors' money _ or what he will do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past few days there's been a lot of speculation, a
lot of accusations concerning my stealing client money and running
off,'' Erxleben said. ``I'm here. I'm not running anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he decided last Friday to stop trading foreign
currencies, and on Sunday he met with attorneys and Michael
Shapiro, a former officer in the company who now runs a trading
company that has Austin Forex as a customer. He said he directed
Shapiro to keep the office open and send a letter explaining the
situation to investors.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Erxleben, Shapiro told an assistant to close
the office and tell other employees not to come to work. A
spokesman for Shapiro declined to comment on Erxleben's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Closing the office, Erxleben indicated, has fueled confusion,
concern and rumors about himself and the company that he said are
untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This story has gotten to a point that yesterday afternoon my
little girl came home from school and said, ``'Daddy, why did you
steal everybody's money?' ``My little boy at breakfast this morning
said, ``Mommy, I wish I could be in heaven right now,''' Erxleben
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These false stories and reports have got to stop,'' he said.
``I'm telling you they will stop. I have nothing more to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, when Erxleben's company closed its doors, he has
been at the center of a firestorm. The Texas State Securities Board
is investigating him and his company, and so is the Federal Bureau
of Investigation. Meanwhile, investors and former partners have
filed several suits against the former All-American kicker and his
company. and even Erxleben's attorney says it could take weeks
before they figure out what is left of the company. On the same day
that Erxleben was attempting to quell rumors that he has left town
with investors' funds, a group of 16 investors in Erxleben's
foreign currency trading activities filed suit in Austin, claiming
they were defrauded out of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The two lawyers who filed the suit Friday said they each had
invested hundreds of thousands of dollars, as part of an estimated
$3 million to $5 million the entire group invested.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Polotko, one of the two Houston attorneys who filed the
suit _ and one of the 16 in the investment group _ claims he was
planning to travel to Austin to meet with Erxleben on Tuesday. But
Austin Forex closed its doors on Monday and hasn't reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Named as a defendant in Polotko's suit was Bradford D. Keene,
who filed a suit against Erxleben and others earlier this week
claiming he was lured by Exrleben through ``intentional
misrepresentations and false promises'' to invest in ownership of
Austin Forex.
</P>
<P>
   Others defendants named in Polotko's petition are Erxleben,
Shapiro, David McGee, and E-Forex, a separate California company
that worked with Austin Forex.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims Austin Forex traded foreign currencies using
E-Forex and had accounts at Bank of America. The investors are
seeking an injunction prohibiting the transfer of any of their
funds from Bank of America or E-Forex. According to Polotko and
David Slaughter, another attorney who filed the suit, between 600
and 800 people have invested in Austin Forex.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and our clients would like to know as current investors
what happened to the money,'' said Slaughter, who also is one of
the 16 investors in the group.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't the only ones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the investors who came to Thursday's press conference to
hear Erxleben with hopes of learning more about what's happened to
her money was Lynn Alexander-Mints.
</P>
<P>
   She said she gave $240,000 to Austin Forex to invest in foreign
currencies, but fears it is all gone now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everything I own,'' said Alexander-Mints. ``I mortgaged
my home. I have children that are going to college next year and I
don't know how I'm going to make the mortgage payment. I just got
married last month, I have nothing, nothing. I have no way to even
make a car payment.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Erxleben assured her she could never lose more than 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me this is as safe as going to the grocery store,''
she said. ``That's his exact words.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Yeakey said he invested with Austin Forex and also had
worked seven months as an independent trader for an affiliate,
International Foreign Exchange Corp. Yeakey said his family
invested $94,000 with Austin Forex. He said he invested after he
heard that in its first year Erxleben's clients had doubled their
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to hear more facts, what really happened,'' Yeakey
said. ``He said there's substantial losses, we ceased trading. What
are substantial losses? Does that mean all the money is gone? Does
it mean there's some left over? How did it happen? Why can't he
tell us that?''
</P>
<P>
   John Stratton, an attorney representing Erxleben, said he
expects it to take several weeks before a true picture of the
company's financial situation can be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors are left to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Talbert, an Austin investor who continued to interrupt
Erxleben during Friday's press conference, said he invested ``six
figures'' with Austin Forex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a can't lose situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I realize it was 'can't win.'''

 &HT;    Panthers: Some rise in Sunrise?
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla._ The dateline is perfect, they hope.
</P>
<P>
   Sunrise. The signal of a new day.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers are in their new digs _ though National Car Rental
Center, to be accurate, remains in the finishing-touch stages of
construction _ looking for a new start.
</P>
<P>
   They have slipped from Stanley Cup finalists three seasons ago
to first-round playoff losers two seasons ago to last season's
standing as the next-to-worst team, by record, in the NHL. It is
not quite as precipitous a fall as the Marlins have suffered in
transforming themselves from World Series champions to baseball
laughingstock, but it's close.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business during this summer's training camp
has been for the Panthers to settle and soothe themselves after the
turmoil of a year ago when General Manager Bryan Murray fired head
coach Doug MacLean and took the spot behind the bench himself.
</P>
<P>
   Murray is still the head coach, but now it's Bryan's brother,
Terry on the job. The goals this season are modest ones _ show some
improvement on the ice and recover some balance off it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret Panthersville was not a happy place last season.
</P>
<P>
   There was a locker-room schism between veterans and young
players that grew deeper and more divisive as the losses mounted.
There was a distracting season-long contractual squabble involving
goalie/franchise hero John Vanbiesbrouck, who has since packed his
pads for Philadelphia. And, as Vanbiesbrouck abdicated his role as
a team leader, no one emerged as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had tremendous highs and tremendous lows here in the
last few years,'' said Murray the GM. ``We hope we're good enough
to make the playoffs. For now, that sets the standard.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, must Murray the Coach set a standard, because he
inherits a team a team that had softened in terms of discipline
after his brother replaced MacLean as coach. Bryan admits as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I had the reputation of being firm,'' he said. ``Not
tough-tough, but someone whose teams played hard. But when I took
over, I thought we had very little confidence and were fragile.
Doug had been very emotional, and I think the guys were sensitive
to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, I probably should have been tougher on them.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he hired his brother to do what he couldn't (or wouldn't)
do.
</P>
<P>
   After a lackluster practice Wednesday, it was Terry Murray who
scolded the Panthers for falling into their old routine. And his
explanation Thursday afternoon _ after spending six hours on the
ice with the team broken into three groups _ was succinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reasons things fall apart on you very quickly,''
Murray the Coach said. ``I don't know how it happened. It doesn't
matter. It's behind us. We need to wipe it clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that you have to keep the pressure on. Push.
Kick. Shove. The guys who are looking to win want us to do those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Panthers will have a few more young players on the
roster this year (wingers Oleg Kvasha, Marcus Nilson and Mark
Parrish). Maybe other young players already on the roster _ Rob
Niedermayer, Ed Jovanovski, Radek Dvorak _will rediscover early,
promising form. Maybe the loss of Vanbiesbrouck, replaced by Sean
Burke, won't be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   They are the possibilities of every sunrise.

 &HT;    Expect sack rate to get Slashed
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Don't expect a repeat performance from the
Dolphins' pass rush this week. After all, Pittsburgh's Kordell
Stewart isn't about to sit around waiting for a hit as did
Buffalo's Rob Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins dropped Johnson eight times last week, a number
that would have been reduced had Johnson taken lessons in
scrambling and/or throwing away the ball. Stewart, conversely, is
considered the best running quarterback in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so difficult rushing the passer any way, but when you're
having to rush the passer and you have to be very disciplined about
your lanes and how you rush. ... you just can't open up gaping
holes for the quarterback to run through,'' Dolphins coach Jimmy
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   And Stewart will run. Slash, as he is called by Steelers coach
Bill Cowher, was Pittsburgh's second-leading rusher last season
with 476 yards. By comparison, Miami's Dan Marino has rushed for 96
yards in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to contain him,'' linebacker Zach Thomas said.
``He's a great athlete. He can run, he can catch. He does it all
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has 12 sacks in two games, almost 40 percent of its entire
total of 31 last season. But those came against a confused rookie
(Peyton Manning) and a statue (Johnson). Jimmy Johnson says Stewart
is the best ``running quarterback'' in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Miami _ and most Steelers opponents _ is it
never faces a quarterback like Stewart and cannot emulate his
running ability in practice. But all agree the Dolphins cannot lose
their aggressiveness despite Stewart's ability to escape the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be less aggressive, you just have to be more
disciplined,'' said defensive end Trace Armstrong, who is tied with
Jason Taylor for the team lead in sacks with three. ``You can get
into a lot of trouble by being less aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   More praise for Marino: Johnson continues to back peddle on his
criticism of Marino, saying Thursday more was made of his comments
than warranted when he said Marino was missing open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also gave another excuse for the Dolphins' low passing
yardage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're keeping more receivers in to block,'' he said. ``The
priority for us right now is to protect Dan Marino. We've been able
to do that fairly well. I look around the league and there are nine
or 10 quarterbacks no longer playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Light at the end of the dog house: Wide receiver Charles Jordan
will return to the active roster after a good week of practice.
Jordan has bounced back after losing his starting job, sulking,
suffering a groin injury and being placed in the inactive list last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan will be the fourth receiver and play on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   History says plan for playoffs: The Dolphins are 2-0 for the
14th time in their history, and have qualified for the playoffs
11-of-13 years in which they won their first two games, missing in
1977 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Of those years, Miami finished first in the AFC East eight
times, second four times and tumbled to fourth with an 8-8 record
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Robbie honored: A statue of team founder, the late Joe
Robbie, will be unveiled at Pro Player Stadium Sunday at noon
outside Gate G. Members of the Robbie family and the Dolphins
organization will be present for the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Boo!: Johnson continues to insist the running game is on
schedule, but says it isn't exactly in the Steelers class just yet.
Pittsburgh led the NFL with 154.9 yards per game last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that our running game is going to scare anybody
right now,'' Johnson said. ``Hopefully they'll be a day here that
people will be concerned about it. We're kind of feeling our way
right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy that we have run the ball better these first couple
of games than we did a year ago. But we're not there yet. We still
have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami is averaging 126.5 yards on the ground, 11th best in the
league.

 &HT;    Pre-sales keep condo developers in line with market
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the past, luxury condominium developers
needed little more than a dream and a few million dollars to build
their posh palaces.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, luxury condo developers, investors and lenders _
still smarting from their experiences during the last real estate
downturn _ are waiting for sales before they turn their first
spades of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are attempting _ as much as possible _ to be
responsive to the market without getting too far ahead of the
market,'' said Ron Witten, president of Dallas-based M/PF Research,
a real estate research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Nokonah, the 70-unit condo project planned for
Ninth Street and North Lamar Boulevard on the edge of Austin's
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Developers won't break ground on the project until half the
units are pre-sold, said Robert Barnstone, vice president of New
Urban Partners GP Inc., which is building the condo. In Dallas,
developers waited until more than half of the 145 units in the
23-story Mayfair were sold before it broke ground.
</P>
<P>
   To secure construction financing for a high-rise condo project,
most banks these days require developers to sell between 30 percent
to 90 percent of the units before they can begin construction.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they're able to find financing without plenty of
pre-sales, they may have a hard time selling the individual units.
</P>
<P>
   That's because for most new condo projects, permanent mortgage
lenders require that half the units be sold to ensure the project
won't become a glorified apartment, Witten said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nokonah will include 30,000 square feet of office and retail
space. Units in the project will range from $250,000 to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, work on the project could start during
the second quarter of 1999, with the first residents moving in by
Christmas 2000.
</P>
<P>
   New Urban Partners is halfway toward its goal of pre-selling $15
million worth of units at the Nokonah.
</P>
<P>
   It won't commit to long-term construction financing for the $30
million project without reaching that goal, Witten said. The list
of people who have put down deposits on units in the project
include local politicos, business leaders, doctors and a federal
judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our buyers view (this conservative attitude) as a positive,''
Barnstone said. ``They can be assured the project will be a success
from day one.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always that way.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s and early 1980s, banks were eagerly pouring
money into condo projects. With inflation high, it wasn't always in
a developer's best interest to pre-sell a project when he or she
might be able to get more for the units after the building was
completed, Witten said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no Austin luxury condo was more indicative of the 1980s
way of doing business than the Towers of Town Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The $30 million in financing was easy to get for the 183-unit
condo off Interstate 35, even though there wasn't a proven market
for these units, which sold for up to $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the project faced tough times when it was completed in 1984.
More than a year after it opened, only 37 of the units had been
sold.
</P>
<P>
   Then the real estate bust hit. The Towers of Town Lake went back
to Texas Commerce Bank, which provided the construction financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disaster,'' recalled Bert Pence, one of the project's
original investors.
</P>
<P>
   More than a decade later, the Towers of Town Lake is finally a
success. The Austin condo market, dormant for more than a decade,
is stirring and new projects are rising around the city.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, condo developers learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenders and developers have become more conservative,'' Pence
said. ``Debt, we've learned, can destroy you. And nothing stays the
same, whether it be good times or bad times.''

PAULA WOLFERT: MISTRESS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Repeating for Allenton and all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Paula Wolfert demands that you leap into her
passion. She is standing in the kitchen of Casablanca, where chef
Ana Sortun and guest chef Joe Simone of Hingham's Tosca are cooking
from Wolfert's new book and _ at this moment _ memorizing
everything she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taste this,'' she commands a visitor, holding up a cup of
seedless Turkish red-pepper flakes called Maras with a color so
startling they look fearsome _ not fire-engine red or candy-apple
red but a red that embodies burnt sienna, vermilion, port, pumpkin,
umber, dark ocher, crimson, carmine, and plum.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the taste. ``Notice,'' she says. ``No seeds.''
The tiny scarlet dots hit the tongue in layers _ not fiery layers
but smooth ripples, smoky and pleasingly warm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this not the elixir of the '90s?'' Wolfert asks.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if Wolfert says so, it shall be. At least if the pepper
flakes follow the route of preserved lemons and couscous, which she
found in Morocco 40 years ago; foie gras, the crowning glory of her
intense research into southwestern French cuisine in the early
1980s; and pomegranate molasses, the sweet-sour syrup she stumbled
upon in wanderings along the eastern Mediterranean. All of these
ingredients, now on restaurant menus across the country, were swept
up by her passion _ and her influence. Professional cooks listen to
Wolfert. They cook from her books and they eagerly learn from her.
The San Francisco resident willingly teaches everything she knows.
</P>
<P>
   Her sixth book, ``Mediterranean Grains and Greens''
(HarperCollins), offers more ingredients that you never heard of,
grains that have been around since the beginning of civilization,
and greens similar to the ones the earliest gatherers collected,
sorted, and boiled down until vast basketfuls were reduced to small
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how they say that the oldest profession is motherhood
and the second oldest is whoring? That's ridiculous,'' she says.
``The oldest is gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert loves ethnobotany, the plant lore of a particular
culture. Information about ancient history and historical
geography, religion and anthropology pours forth when she talks
about food.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the subtleties of a culture, some hard to
comprehend at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put water in your bulgur, and no man will marry you,'' a
cook in Turkey told Wolfert. Good cooks, she learned, moisten the
bulgur with the juices of the flavorings they add _ such as chopped
young greens, onions, tomato paste, and red pepper paste _ then
knead them into the grain. Pummel is more like it, really,
according to a slide shown as part of Wolfert's lecture at Boston
University's Seminars in the Culinary Arts, the day after dinner at
Casablanca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grains and greens are canvases,'' she says. ``People still eat
this way, even though they're moving to the cities. Cottage
industries are bringing the ingredients to the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The cultures for whom grains and greens are essential components
of the diet live in the remotest regions, where the food uses
seasonings _ Maras pepper flakes, for instance _ largely unknown on
Western tables. Wolfert is famous for long treks into the
countryside to visit a cook. She travels with a translator and a
driver (she doesn't have a license), and always leaves with a
recipe whose edges seem parched by the ancient sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone should document how it's made, right?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert took on the job of recording food that might be
forgotten, dishes that might start with a shepherdess in Tunisia
who collects khobbeiza (mallow leaves with the same mucilaginous
quality as okra), brings them home, and pounds them with oil, the
hot-pepper paste harissa, and coriander, until the greens are
creamy.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Wolfert found nettles, purslane, salsify greens,
lamb's-quarters, wild mustard, bergamot, garland chrysanthemum,
borage leaves, and shepherd's purse. She watched cooks work wonders
with stale bread and rice, chickpeas, semolina, and green wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The world spins more slowly where she travels, and Wolfert, 60,
softens her pace in those corners. She is mellow from many years
with these ordinary women, no longer prickly. And she is more
understanding when chefs take her recipes and multiply them to feed
a restaurant full of customers _ and don't succeed.
</P>
<P>
   She brings food she has learned about in unusual dialects and
diverse languages, from cooks who unravel their kitchen lives to
her. ``I kiss each woman on both cheeks and I touch my heart. It's
the way women are with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert describes them in the countryside where they spend their
days, scarves tied tightly under their chins to keep the dust away,
pocketed aprons secured around their broad middles, as they collect
``apron greens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther east you go in the Mediterranean,'' she says,
``the better the hospitality.''

 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... the hospitality.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wolfert's stories begin like this: ``We flew from Istanbul to
Kars, near the Armenian border. Then we drove to Trabzon on the
Black Sea coast of Turkey. We had a Kurdish driver, of course. It
was Ramadan and no one had eaten all day.''
</P>
<P>
   During her visit here, someone wants to know if she has ever had
to sleep in a tent in some faraway place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that plural?'' she countered. ``I've slept in many, many
tents. I've also slept high up so the scorpions wouldn't get me.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Wobbles like your belly'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paula Wolfert stumbled into the world of food. She was a young
bride when she went with her husband at the time to live in Morocco
in 1959. ``Couscous and Other Good Food From Morocco'' was born
there. It took many more years, the end of the first marriage, and
the beginning of a romance with crime novelist Bill Bayer to
finally produce the couscous book in 1973. It is still the
definitive work on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   She has eaten so much ill-prepared couscous that ``Grains and
Greens'' covers the territory again. By the time she finishes her
lecture at BU, she has most of the students convinced that they'll
never simply follow the package directions on instant couscous.
They'll steam it, aerate it, steam it again. ``It multiplies 18
times,'' she says. ``You lift the couscous. This is the most
sensual thing. Play with it.'' She shows slides to demonstrate.
``This is air,'' she says. ``It wobbles like your belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructions for couscous from scratch appear in ``Grains and
Greens.'' You begin with coarse semolina and add fine semolina,
cold water, sea salt, and olive oil. You have to press it through a
strainer, then a fine sieve, and steam it three times. But you
don't have to do it sitting on the floor the way they do in North
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As Wolfert says, someone's got to record this, right?
</P>
<P>
   When she spent a brief interlude in southwestern France, she
made confit and foie gras sound so irresistible, they showed up on
menus as soon as ``The Cooking of South-West France'' was
published. As a result of the book, Ariane Daguin, the daughter of
French chef Andre Daguin, set up the foie gras business D'Artagnan,
which is flourishing today. Her father sold his two-star restaurant
in Auch last year. American foodies already had made a pilgrimage
there. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Mediterranean course &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mediterrean cooking has taken a different course. It spans
restaurants in so many demographics that it appears on the tables
of celebrity chefs and at fast food-places along the highway.
Wolfert never set out to research food that would become
commonplace. Her cooking is too involved, and many ingredients
aren't available here, although she gives extensive mail-order
lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larder's better on the East Coast than the West Coast,''
she declares. She has found the Maras peppers in Formaggio Kitchen
in Cambridge, and she likes the Middle Eastern markets along
Belmont and Mt. Auburn streets in Watertown.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert and Bayer, who have been married 15 years, moved to San
Francisco several years ago. At the time, she told a reporter that
she went ``kicking and screaming.'' She had already moved with
Bayer from Manhattan to Connecticut; the couple summered at his
house in West Tisbury. They sold both homes.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer had a ``midlist crisis'' and changed his nom de plume to
David Hunt. His ``The Magician's Tale,'' set in San Francisco, came
out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now they weekend on six acres in Sonoma, where Wolfert is
growing wild greens from seeds she has collected all over the
Mediterranean. In the city, she's friendly with restaurateur Alice
Waters, cookbook writer Carol Field, and author Peggy
Knickerbocker. It took some time to settle into this life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live in New York, you come up in the trenches
shoulder to shoulder,'' she says. ``In San Francisco, it takes a
long time to make a best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert stocks her larder mostly from Kalustiyan, the Manhattan
purveyor of Middle Eastern foods. She and Bayer live on
California's ``unbelievable'' produce, her own greens, and Sonoma
lamb. Her house salad comes from Greek Cyprus and combines shredded
savoy cabbage, baby spinach, arugula, cilantro, scallions, and
green olives tossed with a lemon and olive oil dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blending greens is the art,'' she says. ``If I tell you to use
Swiss chard, and it doesn't look good, don't buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfert wants cooks to try uncommon ingredients. ``In the
Mediterranean, you have a meal and you think you'll never reproduce
it at home. But now you can make the dish and share it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon you'll see these greens everywhere,'' she says. She keeps
repeating this, not so much to amass support for her book but
because she knows something we don't: Jean-Georges Vongerichten,
the celebrated, much imitated, New York chef, hired Francois
Couplan, an ethnobotanist who lives in Switzerland, to teach him
about leafy greens and weeds. Someone grows them for Vongerichten
in upstate New York. They're all over the Jean Georges menu.
</P>
<P>
   So it shall be.

instructive stories on ventures that worked _ and some that didn't
_ along with information useful to anyone interested in enterprise,
no matter what the scale.

   CLINTON-CALIF (Sacramento, Calif.) _ A week after independent

eject him from office, a San Francisco Examiner poll shows. By
ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-LAWYERS (San Francisco) _ Leading lawyers have this

semantic arguments about the definitions of sexual relations and
perjury, they said. By SETH ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   SALON-HYDE (San Francisco) _ While powerful Republicans accuse
the White House of leaking the Henry Hyde infidelity story to a San
Francisco-based on-line magazine, a World War II veteran says the
secret was first revealed through an offhand remark at a tennis
match six years ago. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   TAILWIND-SUIT (Burlingame, Calif.) _ Unappeased by the

By ERIC BRAZIL.

<P>
   TREE-DEATH (San Francisco) _ An Earth First activist from Texas

in the head and killed by a falling redwood. By ERIC BRAZIL.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ In the era of sensitivities about
sexual harassment, it may not be easy to talk at work about the
detailed descriptions of President Clinton's extramarital affair
contained in the independent counsel's report to Congress. By L.M.
SIXEL.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTING-COLUMN (Undated) _ The graphic report presented to
Congress by Kenneth Starr drew a lot of attention to the Internet,
but for all the wrong reasons. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN.

to computer utilities; Is it worth it upgrading to 56K? By DWIGHT
SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-INSURANCE (San Francisco) _ Working on the premise that
the last thing most people want to do is shop for insurance,
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush has provided a forum for
doing just that. But this is different: It's state of the art. By
GEORGE RAINE.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-TRUE (Undated) _ In ``One True Thing,'' Meryl Streep
reaffirms her place in America's film acting corps: She's peerless.
No one else assumes a character as fully and selflessly, and no one
else has been as outstanding in such remarkably different roles.
Think of ``Sophie's Choice,'' ``Ironweed,'' ``Death Becomes Her.''
By WALTER ADDIEGO.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-PERMANENT (Undated) _ Ben Stiller, known for his
comedic work, takes a surprisingly smooth turn into drama in

</P>
<P>
   FINGER-BOWLS (Albany, N.Y.) _ There's nothing like a finger bowl
to lend an air of sophistication to a formal dinner table. Finger
bowls _ used for cleansing the fingers and wiping lips prior to the
dessert course _ were used at the best tables from the 19th century
through 1950. By FRANCES INGRAHAM. (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)
</P>
<P>
   TONGUE-DEPRESSORS (Troy, N.Y.) _ Dr. Alfredo B. Cruz, a family
practitioner, had too many tongue depressors. So he decided to make

FINGER BOWLS ADD A GENTEEL TOUCH TO THE DINNER TABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ There's nothing like a finger bowl to lend an air
of sophistication to a formal dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Finger bowls were used at the best tables from the 19th century
through 1950. The purpose of the finger bowl was to cleanse the
fingers and wipe lips prior to the dessert course. This also saved
the main dinner napkin, which was usually made from the very best
materials, from getting too soiled or ruined.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 19th century, doilies were often placed under the
finger bowl to be used to wipe the finger tips dry after dipping
them in the bowl. Because dining tables were so highly polished,
this created a demand for complete sets of doilies for table
service. These small fabric circles, or squares, protected the
table's finish after the (perhaps soiled) tablecloth was removed
prior to the fruit or dessert course.
</P>
<P>
   A finger bowl half full of warm water was placed above the
dessert plate of each guest or served with the doily directly on
the dessert plate, with the fork to the left and dessert spoon to
the right.
</P>
<P>
   Finger bowls are most apt today to be used for appetizers, cold
soups and desserts. They're used in a formal sit-down dinner only
if finger food, such as artichokes and corn-on-the-cob, are being
served.
</P>
<P>
   They often are brought out on china or clear or colored glass
plates with a doily or small fruit napkin in between.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a common practice to float a fresh flower or flower
petals in the water, or a slice of lemon or orange. You dip your
fingers into the bowl and rub them with the slice of fruit before
wiping with the doily or small napkin.
</P>
<P>
   Some sets of new china come with finger bowls. But it is more
common to find them at antiques shops and estate sales. Victorian
or 20th-century American glass bowls from the 1920s and '30s sell
from $300 to $400 for a set of eight to 12 crystal bowls, and
English Regency sets of six have sold for $1,200 and up. Finger
bowls are often mixed and matched with sets of china. Contemporary
ceramic bowls for $2 or $3 also work well.
</P>
<P>
   It was the custom in the mid-1800s on both sides of the Atlantic
Ocean to rinse the mouth out from the finger bowl, spitting the
rinse water back into the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That is one use that is frowned upon today. No gargling, please.
Fingertips only.
</P>
<P>
   If you are served a finger bowl, for the first time, don't worry
about making a faux pas. It occasionally happens to the best of us.
</P>
<P>
   Finger bowls contributed to Martin Van Buren's failed bid for a
second term as the eighth president of the United States. An 1840
speech by Charles Ogle, a Whig congressman from Pennsylvania,
denounced Van Buren's lavish spending on furnishings and his
aristocratic ways while at the White House, which included the
purchase of a set of green finger cups ``to wash his pretty, soft,
white, lily fingers, after dining.''

IRISH TITAN FINALLY GETS RECOGNITION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Thursday in this town was a Renoir painting _ a
wonderous glory of a day adorned with golden spangles of sunlight
and caressed by silken breezes.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dominick Lizzi's day, his glittering personal property.
He's a retired social studies teacher who understands that the
shape of the world is the product of human character. For better or
worse, the world is what it is because certain people were in
certain places at certain times and behaved in certain ways. With
somebody else in the same place at the same time, the world would
wear a different face.
</P>
<P>
   Slavery, for example. It festered as an open sore for
generations until Abraham Lincoln became president. Hitler might
have consumed the globe but for the unique resolve of titans like
Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   And the Republic of Ireland might never have been born if not
for Martin H. Glynn. He was the son of Irish immigrants. He was
born 127 years ago Thursday in the Albany suburb of Valatie, where
Dominick Lizzi serves as village historian.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a law degree, Glynn went to work for the Albany Times
Union. He ended up as publisher and, eventually, as the newspaper's
owner. Finally, he sold the newspaper to the Hearst Corp., the
current owner, and concentrated on politics.
</P>
<P>
   Martin H. Glynn served as a member of Congress, as state
comptroller and as lieutenant governor of New York. In 1913, when
Gov. William Sulzer was bounced out of office in a vicious war with
Tammany Hall, Martin H. Glynn _ not Al Smith _ became the first
Catholic to sit as New York's governor.
</P>
<P>
   Glynn left business and politics as a wealthy and honored man.
As a prominent Irish American, he involved himself in the Irish
rebellion. Serving as a liaison between British Prime Minister
Lloyd George and IRA leaders Michael Collins and Eamon De Valera,
he brokered the peace that led to the formation of the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, 1923, Lloyd George went to Albany and delivered a
speech lauding Glynn for his critical role in the birth of the
Irish republic. Dominick Lizzi documented all this in his book,
``Martin H. Glynn, Forgotten Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   But for decades now, the name of Martin H. Glynn has been
mentioned only in hushed whispers among people in the know. That's
because, 11 days before Christmas in 1924, in his elegant
brownstone mansion, he shot himself to death. Glynn had endured 40
years of excruciating back pain. Surgery had failed. Despair and
prolonged, relentless agony finally had swallowed him whole.
</P>
<P>
   For a Catholic, there's no graver sin than suicide. That's why,
for decades in this heavily Catholic city, Martin H. Glynn rested,
more or less anonymously, in St. Agnes Cemetery. Dominick Lizzi
believed that this extraordinary man's life should be honored with
a memorial, despite the despondency that had provoked Glynn's
suicide. One day earlier this year, Dominick Lizzi called me for
help. I spoke to Mayor Jerry Jennings, who immediately recognized
the need to acknowledge Glynn's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he doesn't always back winning candidates _ one of
his guys had gotten whomped in a primary election two days earlier
_ Jennings gets things done. He got this done quickly and
elegantly.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in a dignified ceremony outside Glynn's former home
across the street from Albany's sprawling Washington Park, a plaque
honoring this talented, tortured man was unveiled. I was among
those asked to say a few words to the crowd gathered for the
occasion, and so was Dominick Lizzi.
</P>
<P>
   After 74 years, a significant human being was finally honored
for a noble life that towered over the tragic circumstances of his
death. Sure, it was Martin H. Glynn's plaque, and he had it coming.
</P>
<P>
   But that lush, lavish day was the exclusive property of Dominick
Lizzi, the persistent historian who'd rescued the memory of a
memorable human being.

STREEP RESCUES AN OTHERWISE MIDDLING MELODRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``One True Thing,'' Meryl Streep reaffirms her place in
America's film acting corps: She's peerless. No one else assumes a
character as fully and selflessly, and no one else has been as
outstanding in such remarkably different roles. Think of ``Sophie's
Choice,'' ``Ironweed,'' ``Death Becomes Her.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep's work elevates what is otherwise a middling melodrama
that's part coming-to-terms-with-your-family story and part
``few-months-to-live'' plot. She isn't even the central figure
here, but when she's on screen she moves the picture to a different
level.
</P>
<P>
   While the emotional focus is on Streep's 50ish matriarch,
technically the main character is her daughter, Ellen, played by
Renee Zellweger. Ellen's an intense and ambitious Harvard graduate
trying to make a name for herself as a reporter at New York
magazine. She's tracking down a juicy story when she hears
devastating news from her father, George (William Hurt), a
brilliant and well-connected professor of literature.
</P>
<P>
   Kate, her mother _ a homemaker and nonintellectual _ is to be
operated on for cancer. Citing his responsibilities as a department
head, George asks Ellen to take a leave from her job and move home
to care for mom. Reluctantly, she does so.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellen we meet early on is a hard case: self-centered,
aggressive and totally career-focused. She's simply an exaggerated
version of her father, who's a bit less driven since he's already
made his mark in life. In contrast to this cerebral pair is Kate, a
member of the local ladies' auxiliary and busy with charity work
during the holidays _ the picture of domesticity and a lover of
simpler things. In case we should miss the point, we learn that she
enjoys Erma Bombeck and even see her dressed up for a costume party
as Dorothy from ``The Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Firecracker Ellen can hardly stand it.
</P>
<P>
   She'll learn differently, and also discover cracks in her dad's
sterling facade. She begins to suspect him of fooling around with a
female graduate student _ and not for the first time. And she is
increasingly upset as he keeps his distance from the family crisis,
insisting that he's terribly busy. At the same time, Ellen finds
her mother much more than a dull homebody. Kate has depth and an
understanding of life and matters of substance that is far beyond
anything her daughter suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen's callowness is exposed, and it's only as her mother's
sickness accelerates that she begins to understand her, and how
much she, Ellen, is about to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``One True Thing'' is based on the best-seller by Anna Quindlen,
the former New York Times columnist. Her story doesn't rely on
challenging insights; it's the dependable nature of what
transpires, the glowing lessons learned by hard-hearted Ellen in
the face of her mother's death, that are the reassuring core here.
You may find yourself weeping toward the end, and, later, you may
also find yourself wondering why. The revelations are staggeringly
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all praise is due to Streep for a magisterial performance
as the wise, down-to-earth and serenely centered mother, shepherd
to a family of lost sheep. Zellweger (``Jerry Maguire'') is better
than you might expect as the arrogant but emotionally needy
daughter; but even though she gets the lion's share of screen time,
she's simply overwhelmed by Streep. And the English professor with
the feet of clay is a role Hurt was born to play; he is the soul of
cockiness _ the East Coast, literary brand.
</P>
<P>
   The direction by Carl Franklin (``Devil in a Blue Dress'') is
quiet and assured, as actor-centered as the material requires. He
springs no surprises and makes no unexpected turns; neither does
the story.

MAN ABOUT HOLLYWOOD OFFERS CONVINCING PERFORMANCE IN `MIDNIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Ben Stiller the busiest guy in Hollywood, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Host of the MTV video awards, a star in the hit gross-out movie
of the summer, ``There's Something About Mary,'' and a key player
in the latest misanthropic piece from Neil LaBute, ``Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors,'' the man doesn't seem to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stiller, known for his comedic work, takes a surprisingly
smooth turn into drama in ``Permanent Midnight,'' playing a TV
scriptwriter with a $5,000 a week heroin habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight,'' written and directed by first-time
helmer David Veloz from a 1995 memoir by Jerry Stahl, is nothing
new, thematically speaking. Otto Preminger told the tale of a
self-destructive junkie better in 1955's ``The Man With the Golden
Arm.'' But ``Midnight'' is vividly rendered and nicely paced and
serves as an expressive audition tape for Stiller.
</P>
<P>
   Gaunt, permanently sweaty, face covered with stubble, eyes
bloodshot, speed-rapping his way into trouble, Stiller convincingly
portrays the obsessiveness and desperation of a man in way over his
head. He ties off and shoots up in the hospital john when his
girlfriend (Elizabeth Hurley) is giving birth to their child, again
just before an interview for a job he needs, and _ sickeningly _
again while he has his infant daughter in the car on a dark Los
Angeles street.
</P>
<P>
   Even the scene with the infant, though, pales next to the truly
horrific moment where Stiller's character, Jerry, and a new-found
druggie friend hurl themselves at the ceiling-to-floor window
inside a highrise, bouncing off the glass with laughing, howling,
maniacal energy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite its subject _ an addict's dark interior life _
``Permanent Midnight'' offers little in the way of character
development and no jolting insight. Moreover, we glimpse little of
Jerry's life before he becomes addicted, so it's hard to measure
how his drug-related losses changed him. The movie's overriding
point _ heroin is bad for you _ is true, but hardly novel. There's
a hole at the center of this familiar cautionary tale to match the
holes in Jerry's arm.
</P>
<P>
   As Stiller's co-star, Hurley plays a British producer who
marries Jerry so she can get a green card, then unwisely falls for
him. Hurley has improved as an actress, but she doesn't show the
range or depth needed for this part; moreover, with her strong,
angular frame and crisp diction, her Sandra doesn't look or sound
needy enough to be Jerry's patsy.
</P>
<P>
   Maria (``ER'') Bello is lovely and empathetic as Kitty, a fellow
ex-junkie to whom Jerry tells his life story, shown in flashbacks.
Jeanane Garofalo is her usual smart self as a Hollywood agent who
Jerry really should flatter and court. It's a small part, and
Garofalo can't get enough out of it to match her portrayal of a
hilariously droll FBI agent in the upcoming ``Clay Pigeons,'' but
she lets a little badly needed light shine into ``Permanent
Midnight.''

EX-MILITARY DISCOVER JOBS IN CIVILIAN LIFE ARE HARD TO FIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The military used to sell itself as a training ground for the
future, but veterans are finding it's increasingly difficult to be
all they can be once they leave the service.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to recruiting for the civilian work force,
companies are often reluctant to hire ex-military people, said
Linda Carlson, author of ``How to Find A Good Job in Seattle,''
(Barrett Street Productions, 1990, $21.95)
</P>
<P>
   The seventh edition of her book, available next month, has a new
chapter focusing on problems faced by the growing number of
ex-military people looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   The military has been downsizing along with everyone else, which
means more people are leaving the service and needing to find other
jobs, she said. About 275,000 people leave the military every year.
</P>
<P>
   While potential employers don't admit they won't hire people who
have been in the military, the reality is many don't.
</P>
<P>
   People coming out of the service often come across as rigid and
seem out-of-place in the ``real world,'' she said. Companies are
nervous about hiring them, fearing they won't work well in
high-risk, fast-changing, unstructured business environments.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson recently worked with one colonel who was shocked to
discover he would have to use a computer terminal himself, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The military is a ``somewhat artificial environment,'' she said.
Its structure, promotion system and pay scales are all different
than those in the civilian world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operating destroyers,'' she said. ``Those skills are not in
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in finding new jobs or careers, those leaving the
military have to figure out how to sell themselves to civilians,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, their problems are similar to those of people
coming out of very large corporations, and their coping strategies
would be similar.
</P>
<P>
   ``A corporate executive who says, `I've had it,' after 25 years
and walks out is going to suffer some of the same challenges'' (in
the job market, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first step for both is to translate their skills into ones
the market can use and understand.
</P>
<P>
   For military folks that means eliminating military jargon and
titles when they speak to recruiters, and translating their job
experiences in the military into business terms.

   ``Use phrases such as, `What I did was similar to running a ...
' or `Managing a facility like yours would be much like when I ...
''' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to tell a potential employer that you've worked
on multi-million dollar equipment he wouldn't understand, or that
all your experience is classified, she said. ``That comes across as
arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers want to know how someone cut costs or saved money at
his or her previous job. They want to know how flexible people are
in their skills, and how well they work with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the military get promotions without
interviewing,'' she said. They may never have thought about or had
to present their experiences in those terms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to assessing their skills in light of the market,
ex-military people need to be realistic about the demand for those
skills and the pay, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of military people have had staff jobs, such as directing
personnel, that are not valued as highly in the civilian world, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The business world tends to put a premium on line jobs _ those
involved directly in creating or selling the company's products or
services, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of the military is often a chance for people to
consider a whole new career, such as teaching, she said. ``People
who have a commitment to something, or feel as though they have a
mission, tend to adjust better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some military skills are in demand. People with
training in engineering, languages or adult education can find
satisfying niches in the private sector, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of the military is an adjustment, but it can be
done, she said. It just takes overcoming some culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't expect anyone to call you Sir, or Ma'am,'' she said.
``Or even Mr. or Ms.''

`WILL &AMP; GRACE' STANDS TALL AMONG NEW FALL OFFERINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the all-female comedy block NBC tried on Monday nights
last season? For two hours straight, it was sitcom after sitcom
with a different woman in the lead, but with what seemed like the
same show playing in repertory.
</P>
<P>
   The network has bagged the ``Must She TV'' approach in favor of
a little more gender equity, and guess what. ``Conrad Bloom'' still
looks like all those other Monday comedies _ from the departed
``Fired Up'' and ``The Naked Truth'' to the still extant ``Suddenly
Susan'' and ``Caroline in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   It is from the space between the latter two that ``Conrad''
blooms. Whether it will thrive is open to question. Mark
Feuerstein, the star of the show, knows the territory; he was a
supporting player on ``Fired Up.'' But ``Conrad Bloom'' is on the
same turf that countless other comedies have trod, many of them
better, most of them about the same.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that Conrad is one of the last of the nice guys
in Manhattan. As such, he is fair game to the women in his life:
his mom, his ex-girlfriend, his boss, etc. They take advantage of
him ad nauseam, and we get to watch while he musters up enough
courage to say no without a trace of guilt. By my calculations,
that will be _ oh, let's see _ never.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein isn't bad as Bloom. Linda Lavin is even better as his
mother. But there's a sameness to this workplace series that fairly
shouts: ``You've seen this before and you probably have something
better to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Keep your fingers crossed. ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is one of those
comedies that seems to have gotten it right. This endorsement, of
course, is subject to retraction, but even the second episode looks
good enough to anoint ``Will &AMP; Grace'' as the best new comedy of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The credit may rest with James Burrows, the most popular hired
gun among TV sitcom directors. Burrows directs scads of pilot
episodes each season, but the difference is that he has signed on
to direct at least the first 13 of ``Will &AMP; Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to good direction, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' has the
attractive cast and snappy writing that most comedies never have
the luck or skill to achieve. Debra Messing is smartly cast as the
vulnerable but not insufferable Grace Adler, a successful young
interior designer who, on the advice of her best friend, decides to
leave her fianc &UR; gfacute &LR; e at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   The best friend is Manhattan attorney Will Truman (Eric
McCormack), but don't get the wrong idea here. Will doesn't have
eyes for Grace. At least not in that sense. He's gay.
</P>
<P>
   Will and Grace do see eye to eye on everything else, and since
Will just ended his own long-term relationship, it's only, uh,
natural that they live together. (Memo to gay bashers: No need to
call or write; if you don't like the premise, just don't watch.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; xr &LR; It's a touch of d &UR; gfacute &LR; ej &UR; gfgrave &LR; a vu for Messing, who
had a similar oddball arrangement in ``Ned &AMP; Stacey,'' but this
time she's in a better ensemble package with McCormack and two
riotously funny supporting players, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   With a little will and a touch of grace, this show could be a
big winner.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion Bay, Calif., is a sleepy, economically depressed
coastal community that somehow has escaped the notice of
vacation-home developers and eco-tour operators.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Sweeny might change all that. The computer wonderboy has
returned to his hometown to open and manage a new plant for his
Bill Gates-style boss, who reminds Sweeny during a visit to this
burg named for a Greek god that it is the geeks who now rule the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Like any high-tech magnate these days, Sweeny is viewed with
equal parts awe and suspicion, even by his own family. Is his
return a monumental ego trip? Does he want to revive the town?
Change it forever? Or is he just trying to show his father and
older brother that he isn't a loser?
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities for conflict seem limitless, but the first
episode of ``Hyperion Bay'' bogs down in some unconvincing writing
by creator Joseph Dougherty, who earned his stripes on
``thirtysomething.''
</P>
<P>
   The angst-filled earnestness of ``thirtysomething'' is there,
though. And the performances are reasonable enough, especially by
Mark-Paul Gosselaar as Dennis Sweeny and Dylan Neal as older
brother Nick, so ``Hyperion Bay'' may yet catch fire.
</P>
<P>
   But with family-relationship dramas as plentiful as adulterers
in D.C., ``Hyperion Bay'' could get lost in the fog.

AN AMERICAN CONSUMER CONFESSES HIS FAILURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ Wall Street is on a wild ride, economies
around the world are shaking like banana trees in a hurricane and
Alan Greenspan is still Alan Greenspan, which means nobody knows
what he really thinks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So as a true patriot, I'm taking matters into my own hands. I've
come here to the super, huge, mega, humongous and pretty big Mall
of America to do my Christmas shopping early. And I'll start as
soon as I finish my chicken fingers, fries and fruit punch and quit
gawking at the Camp Snoopy roller coaster that wooshes over my head
every few minutes on green rails. (I've never ridden a roller
coaster in a mall. I have my standards.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My theory is that if America is to keep its strong economy, the
job, as usual, will fall to consumers because our econony is based
largely on consumers buying expensive and unnecessary stuff for
themselves and others. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most American place to acquire this wretchedly excessive
collection of junk, of course, is at a suburban mall. And the
largest, most astonishing suburban mall in the world is right here
at the edge of the Twin Cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mall of America has more than 400 stores on a 78-acre site,
meaning 2.5 million square feet of retail space. And it employs
nearly 12,000 people, including the young woman running the Schafer
Crystal kiosk on the mall's first level (of four). She has no
customers just now so she's reading a paperback, ``The Last Day''
by Glenn Kleier. It looks stupid. I don't think I'll buy it _ or
any of her crystal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I want to help the economy, so I have my shopping list and
my credit cards ready because, well, America has been very, very
good to me, allowing me to rise from the upper-lower middle of the
middle class to the lower-upper middle of the middle class, all the
while accumulating debt that my upper-lower middle-class parents
could only have dreamed about. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And America has allowed me to rear children who already owe more
money than I ever could imagine at their age. What a country. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, as I say, I intend to help out. But first, now that my
chicken fingers (I ordered them minus the nails) are gone, I'm
engaged by a small competition going on at a mini bumper-car game
at the edge of this middle-of-the-mall amusement park, Camp
Snoopy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two little kids, egged on by grandparents, are operating red car
No. 9 and white car No. 10, smashing one into the other in that
most American of sports _ demolition derby _ in this most American
of places. It's fun to watch these squirts learning to destroy
cars, no doubt in preparation for teen-age driving years. But I
need to move on if I'm going to stay on task here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But wait. What's this? A ``Log Chute''? Ah, I see. A small
log-shaped boat with one passenger (or empty, if no one wants to
ride) is shot down a steep hill flowing with water and into a small
lake, where it splashes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If I had a spare hour and lived near here, how sad would my
existence have to be to spend it coming to the Mall of America and
riding the Log Chute? Or, around the corner, the Screaming Yellow
Eagle, which I refuse to describe to you for fear you'll want to
come ride it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking just now of stopping in a sportswear store called
``Going to the Game.'' But I'm here the day after Mark McGwire has
hit his 62nd homer. And guess whose baseball jersey is prominently
displayed in the store window. Sammy Sosa's. McGwire's, meanwhile,
is half-hidden on a rack inside. What can these people possibly
know about sportswear? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before long, I notice that what usually happens to me at malls
has happened again. I have spent all my allotted shopping time
wandering around wondering why all this stuff is here, and I've
bought nothing but chicken fingers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My fellow Americans, I've done my best to be your friend. But I
also let you down and I let my family down and I let this country
down. But I'm going to try to make it right. And I'm determined
never to let anything like this to happen again. And I'm convinced
that nothing I've done or not done here at the mall rises to the
level of an impeachable offense. God bless America. &QL;

A SPANISH GALLEON EMERGES FROM DOCTOR'S FLOTSAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA LEE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Dr. Alfredo B. Cruz, a family practitioner, had too
many tongue depressors. He can only use depressors that are
entirely round at the ends, and the extras had been stacking up. So
he decided to make use of them by building a detailed,
six-foot-long model of a Spanish sailing ship.
</P>
<P>
   The project also gave him something to do on nights he couldn't
sleep and it turned out to be a great stress release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am on call every night,'' he said. ``When the nurses call
and wake you up at night, you can't get back to sleep. One of my
patients said you must be under stress and asked how I cope with
stress. This is better than taking medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruz's ship is a replica of the Spanish galleon the Concepcion
which was featured in the November 1990 issue of the National
Geographic Society Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in Spanish galleons,'' Cruz, 55,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,000-ton wooden ship was built in 1600 in the Philippines
when the Philippine islands were under Spanish rule. It sailed
between Manila and Mexico. During one of its voyages, the Golden
Hind under the command of Francis Drake intercepted the ship off
the coast of California and ransacked it. Queen Elizabeth I of
England was so impressed that she knighted Drake.
</P>
<P>
   The Concepcion continued to sail until 1638 when it went down in
a typhoon. The magazine showed a cut-away section of the ship, and
Cruz used his imagination to fill in the details. Along with the
tongue depressors, Cruz used 2,000 wooden coffee stirrers and
toothpick nails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laid the keel the way it would have been done at the time,''
Cruz said. Some of the tongue depressor planks were fastened by
drilling holes and pegging them with toothpicks. Other joints are
held with carpenter's glue. The windows, which can be opened, have
panes made from microscope slides. Inside the ship's cabins are
tiny stairwells and working, battery-powered lanterns. The string
rigging can be adjusted with working pulleys. Cruz even constructed
a tiny, functioning cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put a pellet in here, light it, and it fires,'' he said
with a grin. Cruz completed his model at a surprising pace. He
began work two years ago, shortly before Thanksgiving, and
completed it early last year. The ship is not his first woodworking
project. The doctor's office is decorated with many original
carvings.
</P>
<P>
   When a storm knocked down his cherry tree a few years ago, Cruz
carved a mermaid from the wood. Beside it is a humming bird made
from wood shavings. Cruz plans to make more cannons for the ship,
and to continue working with wood, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to keep my hands busy.''

CALIFORNIA OFFERS INSURANCE INFORMATION ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Working on the premise that the last thing most
people want to do is shop for insurance, California's insurance
commissioner has provided a forum for doing just that. But this is
different: It's state-of-the-art.
</P>
<P>
   At the Department of Insurance's World Wide Web site _
www.insurance.ca.gov _ a new feature called ``premium comparisons''
offers a mountain of information and estimates on auto insurance
premiums, and additional data on homeowner, condominium, renter and
earthquake insurance premiums. While the Web site has quickly drawn
fire from critics of Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, he praises it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people shopping for insurance tend to stop at the first
place they call when they can get a much better deal somewhere
else, something much more appropriate for their own particular
needs,'' Quackenbush said Thursday as he demonstrated the free
on-line service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to make this as painless as possible,''
Quackenbush said. ``If they come here, they are going to see this
wide variety, the many choices available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Insurance is strictly regulatory;
only an insurer or their appointed representative can provide
actual quotes. Therefore, the numbers in the survey are estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers can enter information about themselves and receive the
estimated premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The survey provides profiles of each insurance company and links
to agent organizations. Consumers can learn the size of a company,
see how willing they are to pay claims, check for enforcement
action against a company.
</P>
<P>
   For consumers who do not have access to the Internet, the
information is also available via the Department of Insurance's
Consumer Hotline at 800-927-HELP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the private (insurance) comparisons on-line are
motivated by a hidden sales force, and some even charge fees,''
Quackenbush said. ``This neutral comparison is free of charge and
arms consumers with information needed to arrive at smart insurance
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, a Republican seeking a second term in the November
election, is challenged by Democratic Assemblywoman Diane Martinez.
Martinez asserts that Quackenbush has not been an advocate for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet service, Quackenbush said, illustrates his
commitment to consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's critics said Thursday it was disturbing that the
service provided direct Internet links to the 29 companies it
featured.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unethical, and possibly illegal, for the commissioner to
be providing quick Internet access to the companies,'' said Gina
Calabrese, litigation director for the consumer-advocacy group
Proposition 103 Enforcement Project, based in Santa Monica.

A PRIVATE MATTER INDEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To borrow from Tina Turner, President Clinton would have us
believe that he and Monica Lewinsky were merely private dancers.
That would explain his chutzpah in asking Americans not to ``get
mired in all the details'' of Kenneth Starr's sleaze sheets. He
begs us to ignore the details so he can play president with Vaclav
Havel, Nelson Mandela, and anyone else whose larger-than-life
presence stuffs straw into his empty and ever-shrinking suit.
</P>
<P>
   What has yet to be explained or thoroughly debated in either the
press or public opinion is whether Clinton's actions with Lewinsky
were truly private. Even though I have already written that Clinton
should resign, I pose this as an open question, one that should be
debated not just to determine the fitness of this individual
president, but to determine whether we should allow politicians
different standards to retain their jobs than we know darn well
would not be accepted for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton's lawyers, in their 78-page rebuttal to
Starr's report, said ``holders of public office are therefore not
to be impeached for private conduct.'' But I wonder how that fits
with the first alleged sexual encounter, on Nov. 15, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lewinsky's testimony, Clinton took at least one
telephone call from a member of Congress. She performed oral sex on
Clinton ``while the President continued talking on the phone.''
Starr said White House records showed that during the time span of
the encounter given by Lewinsky, Clinton talked on the phone to
then Representative Jim Chapman, Democrat of Texas, and
Representative John Tanner, Republican of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman, now retired from office, does not remember such a call.
Tanner does not recall the specifics of his call, but said he was
``flabbergasted'' about the possibility of what happened. He said
the call was likely about welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   Was that private or public? A president who may have been
discussing his get-tough, get-a-job, close-your-legs rhetoric for
millions of low-income single parents while being sexually serviced
in the area of the Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, Clinton and Lewinsky had their second sexual
encounter. Lewinsky testified she performed oral sex on Clinton
``While the president was on the telephone'' with ``a member of
Congress with a nickname.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said White House records corroborate that Clinton spoke
with Representative Sonny Callahan, Republican of Alabama. Callahan
said, ``I have not seen the Starr report, nor the alleged reference
to me. However, if it is true that my name is somehow mentioned in
this report, I can say unequivocally and without hesitation that I
had no knowledge I was sharing the president's time or attention
with anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do recall talking to the president during which time he was
seeking my assistance for the American mission in Bosnia. But I do
not have any recollection of any inappropriate behavior or comments
coming from the president during my conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Was that private or public? A president being sexually serviced
while perhaps discussing an operation in which the lives of
American soldiers are at risk? Does this not make it particularly
ironic that Clinton, our commander-in-chief, claims his actions
with Lewinsky, a direct subordinate as a 22-year-old White House
intern, is his own business?
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, Defense Secretary William Cohen
announced the prohibition of intimate contact between senior
officers and junior troops. Is the president asking us to excuse
him for behavior that could get any of our 1.4 million soldiers a
dishonorable discharge?
</P>
<P>
   In February of 1996, Clinton and Lewinsky allegedly had a Sunday
afternoon affair. According to the Starr report, ``After their
sexual encounter, the president and Ms. Lewinsky sat and talked in
the Oval Office for about 45 minutes. Ms. Lewinsky thought the
president might be responding to her suggestion during their
previous meeting about `trying to get to know me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Was that public or private? A starstruck groupie gets 45 minutes
of chit-chat in the most powerful office in the world when
Americans with all kinds of legitimate causes would kill for five
minutes of White House time?
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the use of the White House secretary to conceal
the relationship, the use of top White House personnel staffers to
find Lewinsky a job after her internship, and the implicit threat
by Clinton to fire uniformed White House Secret Service guards who
were on duty during Lewinsky's visits.
</P>
<P>
   According to testimony, Captain Jeffrey Purdie said, ``I was
just in the Oval Office with the president and he wants somebody's
ass out here.'' Thus a Secret Service officer might have lost his
job and his family might be scrimping by on unemployment because
the president could not keep his pants zipped up.
</P>
<P>
   A private dance or an abuse of the public trust that fatally
weakens the presidency? You decide.

THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE WASP-OISIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best books I read this summer was a review copy of
``My First Cousin Once Removed,'' by Concord's own Sarah Payne
Stuart. ``Cousin'' has all the virtues of my favorite opera, Henry
Purcell's ``Dido and Aeneas'': It is beautifully written, it is not
too long, and it is in English.
</P>
<P>
   The first cousin in question is Robert Lowell, the magnificent,
batty Boston poet who was related to Stuart's mother. But the book
trades lightly on Lowell. His presence might have helped Stuart
land a book contract _ ``Cousin'' springs from her amusing 1994 New
York Times essay on Lowell titled ``Bobby Was a Difficult Child'' _
but he's not the center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin'' is simultaneously a wry primer on WASP folkways _
their obsession with the family burial plot; their inexplicable
lust for turtle soup at Thanksgiving _ and a poignant, loving
memoir/meditation/investigation of the manic-depressive ``madness
gene'' that ravaged the Lowells and several members of the author's
own family. ``Half of my family is manic depressive,'' Stuart
writes, ``the rest is screwed up about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also much family interplay between money and genius.
The Lowells, Cottings, and Thorndikes who count, in the Boston
WASPocracy, are those with money. Long after Robert Lowell won the
first of his two Pulitzer prizes, the family elders had no idea why
he garnered so much praise for trashing them in his poems. Lowell's
wealthy aunt Sarah once complained to the author (on the deck of
her yacht, no less): ``Why doesn't Bobby write about the sea? It's
so pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also Aunt Sarah who said, ``I never read Bobby's poetry,
so I can have him to dinner.'' Eventually, inevitably, she stopped
having him to dinner, and cut him out of her will.
</P>
<P>
   The book should be in stores within a few days.

   Boston University officials are bracing themselves for a tough
article about their disastrous involvement with Seragen Inc.
scheduled to run in Sunday's New York Times. Seragen is the
biotechnology firm into which BU has poured $85 million over the
years, an investment now worth about one-quarter of that.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Times story springs from the pen of the one
reporter in America who understands BU president John Silber better
than any other journalist. He is David Barboza, formerly a
roustabout with the BU student newspaper who has devoted seven
years of his (young) life to researching a biography of Silber.
</P>
<P>
   Barboza crossed swords with Silber at BU and became fascinated
by the mercurial academic. He traveled to Texas and Germany to
research Silber's roots. In 1990, after initially refusing, Silber
agreed to cooperate with the journalist, who signed a book contract
with John Wiley &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1989 and 1997, Barboza says he spent countless hours
with Silber and conducted 1,000 interviews. In 1994, the pair
shared a weekend alone at Silber's Squam Lake, N.H., hideaway;
Barboza handled the tape recorder while Silber wielded the skillet.
(Barboza: ``He was a very good cook; he really knew his food.'')
Silber allowed Barboza unprecedented access to his files, deluging
him with Xeroxes that Barboza scrupulously paid for. ``I think I've
sent him thousands of dollars' worth of checks over the years,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   How does this story end? Eighteen months ago, the Times offered
Barboza the first full-time job of his life, as a business
reporter. ``I dropped the book'' and canceled the contract, he
says. Silber likes and respects Barboza, who wrote a firm but
fair-minded profile of the BU prexy for a Times education
supplement three years ago. After this weekend's Seragen story,
Barboza jokes, ``he'll hate me as much as he hates you'' _ a
statement that I suspect is wrong on all counts.

   ``Behind the Crimson Curtain,'' David Greenberg's cover story in
the current issue of Lingua Franca, is a must-read if only for this
detail: Backers of Harvard political science prof Peter Berkowitz,
who was turned down for tenure, hired famed sleazomane Terry
Lenzner to ``investigate'' the murky details behind their man's
rejection. Lenzner, himself a product of the World's Greatest
University, is a top-shelf private investigator whose most recent
clients include President Clinton and the Brown and Williamson
Tobacco Co., which hired him to help discredit whistle-blower
Jeffrey Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   But wait _ it gets better. According to Greenberg, Lenzner
muffed the assignment! Retained to ferret out the names of the men
and women on Berkowitz's tenure committee, Lenzner got one of them
wrong; he apparently confused New York University's Jerome Bruner
with Harvard's Jerome Kagan. (Hey _ they're both named Jerome, OK?)
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Berkowitz movement, spearheaded by New Republic owner
Martin Peretz and WGU law prof Charles Nesson, lies dormant.

`PERMANENT MIDNIGHT' TOO WHOLESOME FOR ITS OWN BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
PERMANENT MIDNIGHT 
Directed and written by: David Veloz (based on Jerry Stahl's
memoir) 
Starring: Ben Stiller, Elizabeth Hurley, Maria Bello, Owen Wilson,
Cheryl Ladd, Peter Greene, Janeane Garofalo 
Running time: 87 minutes 
Rated: R (pervasive graphic drug use, strong sexuality and
language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ben Stiller has become the bad-news nerd of 1998. Farcially in
``There's Something About Mary,'' malignantly in ``Your Friends &AMP;
Neighbors,'' but palely and opaquely in ``Permanent Midnight.''
Based on Jerry Stahl's memoir, it sets up a wallow through showbiz
heroin addiction and a subsequent back-from-the-ashes detox story
that rewards its protagonist with good sex from the woman whose ear
he bends with his saga. And who, you may ask, is Stiller's
self-made loser, Jerry Stahl? A highly-paid TV writer for such
shows as ``Alf'' and ``Moonlighting,'' who, we are told, feels
guilty of making big money for writing drivel and for pocketing a
lot more take-home than his hard-working father back home in
Pittsburgh ever dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stahl took it home. Although Stahl was making $5,000 a
week, he was spending $6,000 a week on his drug habit while
rendering himself unfit for work, or much else. Although Stiller
can do a lot when he flexes his eyebrows, leans forward in a simian
slump and throws his lower jaw forward in a determined way, there's
only so much he can do to supply what writer-director David Veloz's
script lacks, namely any compelling reason to care much about what
this shlemiel does to himself. We get little more of Stiller's
Jerry than a succession of glowering stares, needles, cold sweats
and, worst of all, episodes of self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   He's funny when he exhibits self-deprecating irony, responding
to a comment about his black leather garb with, ``It's Jewish
leather, it's designed for humiliation.'' But when his habit begins
upstaging him, the interest level drops drastically. When he
whines, ``I need six bags just to turn to the typewriter,'' one
does not feel an uncontrollable urge to commiserate. Not only is
there no psychological complexity from a character ostensibly so
sensitive that he can't stand the fact that high-priced hack
writing has turned him away from more rarefied creativity, there
isn't even much back story.
</P>
<P>
   In short, ``Permanent Midnight'' is about what you would expect
from a mild-at-heart movie that wants to titillate with a fallen
artist story that has a wholesome outcome. The ones who evoke
sympathy are Maria Bello's patient listener to the post-rehab
Jerry's saga, and especially Elizabeth Hurley as Jerry's British
green card wife, who married him to be able to stay and work in the
US. We're never really clear on why she takes her sham marriage as
seriously as she does, or why she cares. We only know she's more
appealing than anything else in this half-baked consignment of
narcissism masquerading as uplift. As for Stiller, two nerds out of
three isn't bad, but ``Permanent Midnight'' is the kind of movie
that gives reform a bad name.

ON STAND, LONGTIME BULGER COMPANION ADDS LITTLE TO LORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She lived with gangster FBI informant James J.
``Whitey'' Bulger for 30 years and says she never knew his deepest
secrets. She didn't ask. And he didn't tell.
</P>
<P>
   That's just the way it was with Bulger, according to his
longtime companion, Teresa Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   Still, US prosecutors called Stanley to the witness stand
Thursday, hoping she could refute defense claims that the FBI
warned Bulger to skip town on the eve of his January 1995
racketeering indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Although today Bulger is believed to be on the lam with another
girlfriend, he was with Stanley, driving back to Boston after a
sojourn in the South and West, when the warrant was issued for his
arrest. In an earlier interview with the Globe, Stanley said Bulger
heard on the car radio that investigators had nabbed his longtime
partner, Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi. That news, according to
Stanley, changed his plans and ultimately drove him away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after waiting in the hallway outside US District Judge
Mark Wolf's courtroom for more than three hours, Stanley, 57, took
the stand at the federal courthouse in Boston. She initially cited
her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked if
she knew James Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Then Stanley, a soft-spoken woman with snow-white hair, was
granted immunity and compelled to testify against the man who had
treated her like a wife and helped raise her four children. She
testified for only 15 minutes, then was told that court was
suspended for the day and she'd have to return today.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanley's brief debut on the stand was long enough to
demonstrate that the ever-cautious Bulger was guarded even with
her.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, Bulger and Stanley vacationed in Dublin,
London, and Rome, where they traveled without an itinerary. In
fact, Stanley said, she was never told how long they'd be gone.
</P>
<P>
   They were home in South Boston for only a few weeks in November
1994, Stanley testified, when Bulger ``just said he wanted to go
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he tell you where you were going?'' asked Assistant US
Attorney Fred Wyshak.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he tell you for how long you were going?'' Wyshak asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ask?'' Wyshak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said she packed one bag for the trip and set off in a
car with Bulger, ending up in New York. She is expected to resume
testifying today, when she will be asked how Bulger learned he was
facing federal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi testified earlier that Bulger was warned by former FBI
supervisor John Morris that the indictment was about to be
returned. Morris, testifying under a grant of immunity, admitted
taking $7,000 in bribes from Bulger and Flemmi, but denied tipping
them to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   James G. Reardon, a Worcester lawyer who represents Stanley,
said, ``She's here to tell the truth exactly as she knows it.
She'll testify without any anger or hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley declined to comment Thursday, but in an interview with
the Globe in April she described her travels with Bulger in the
weeks before he became a wanted man.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving New York, the couple traveled to San Francisco and
then to New Orleans, she said. They were driving back to Boston
from Louisiana when Bulger heard on the car radio that Flemmi had
been arrested, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple stopped at a hotel for the night while Bulger
considered what to do, Stanley said. After deciding not to
surrender, Bulger dropped Stanley off at a Hingham restaurant and
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just said, `See ya,' or something like that,'' Stanley
said. ``I have not heard from (Bulger) since he's been gone,'' she
said in the interview. ``I haven't laid eyes on him or spoken to
him. I don't know where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But authorities say that on the same night he dropped Stanley
off in Hingham, he picked up Catherine Greig of Quincy, a woman he
had been seeing secretly for 20 of the 30 years he spent with
Stanley. Greig now faces charges of harboring a fugitive, and the
FBI has offered a $250,000 reward for Bulger's capture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real womanizer,'' Stanley said. ``He was leading a
double life with me and a double life with the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley cooked dinner for Bulger nearly every night, and he
spent every holiday with her family. And yet, she said, she never
knew he was an FBI informant until it was revealed in federal court
last year, when Flemmi argued that the FBI allowed him and Bulger
to commit crimes in exchange for information about the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley's testimony came in hearings launched in January to
explore allegations of FBI misconduct that could topple the case
against Flemmi, Bulger, reputed New England Mafia boss Francis
``Cadillac Frank'' Salemme, Robert DeLuca, and John Martorano.

 BOSTON: ... including Sargent.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Londons,'' as he called them, made fog and soot romantic,
and made buildings and bridges blend in an opalescent haze. In
addition to admiring the dream-like dissolve Monet gave the British
capital, it's fun to trace the provenance of some of these
paintings. One oddity, the 1904 ``Houses of Parliament, Seagulls,''
includes a flock of birds, quick V-shapes that hover on the
surface, bringing the depths of the painting up for air.
``Seagulls'' was bought right out of its first and only Paris show,
by Sergei Shchukin, the visionary Moscow collector whose holdings,
including a total of 13 Monets, were nationalized after the Russian
Revolution. Shchukin's ``Seagulls'' now ``belongs'' to Moscow's
Pushkin Museum; its trip to Boston marks the first time it has been
seen outside Russia since the year it was painted.
</P>
<P>
   The last and largest of the Evans galleries includes a
staggering number of waterlilies _ 24, all but one from the
landmark 1909 show that saw Monet pushing the boundaries of his
art. He aimed at nothing less than besting those two younger stars,
Picasso and Matisse, by reinventing Impressionism. Scrapping the
horizon line, immersing himself in water, that's just what he did.
</P>
<P>
   What's wonderful about this room is the collision of the placid
and the explosive: You sense the artist fighting to grow. Some
tondo paintings seem demurely 19th century, cameo-like. Others,
like the 1907 water lilies owned by the Goteberg Museum of Art in
Sweden, are raw. The Goteberg picture has a tart, even jaundiced
palette, and slashing strokes. Monet so abstracted the subject here
that you can almost imagine the painting hanging upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The Venice pictures come next. Monet edited the fairytale
architecture, cropping the tops of palazzi to focus on facades
where recessed doorways are as mysterious as caves. Some of these
paintings, however exquisite, are also touristy. The most dramatic
are those painted from the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, which
have an asymmetrical, angular slice of pavement jutting up from the
bottom, an oddly contemporary touch. Had Monet stepped to the
water's edge, he would have had a far more conventional postcard
view.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the shocker, a room of waterlily studies that will
make you gasp. These huge, scribbly works didn't leave Monet's
studio during his lifetime, and one, a dazzling 1914-1919 ``Weeping
Willow and Water Lily Pond,'' has never been exhibited before. Its
barbaric tangled strokes have none of the gentle evanescence of
earlier Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these works surfaced in the 1950s, just in time for the
powerful critic Clement Greenberg to proclaim these pictures the
root of the kind of abstraction he championed, conveniently
ignoring Monet's profound and permanent connection to nature. Not
everybody in the avant-garde has always agreed with Greenberg's
rewriting of the history of modernism. The Museum of Modern Art, no
less, deaccessioned one of the most radical of these sketchy works
in the MFA show _ one you might assume was abstract were it not for
the ``Water Lilies'' title _ in the late 1980s. Its permanent
residence is now the boardroom of Japan's Asahi Breweries, Inc., a
company that has also built a Monet mini-museum outside Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   Of a trio of circa 1917-1922 waterlilies in the MFA show, one
that the artist considered finished, two that he regarded as
studies, it's the latter that most appeal to contemporary
sensibilities attuned to spontaneity and process-oriented art. The
weeping willows that follow these works have an agitated,
anthropomorphic presence. Their trunks seem engaged in a
shamanistic dance; their spooky environs could be the set for a
Wagnerian opera.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Monet revisited that Japanese bridge he'd made
into an icon _ but with what a difference! The early bridges make
you yearn to be there, under that wisteria canopy; the late ones,
from around 1920, fairly snarl at you. And so crusted with paint
are the late ones that in some, it's hard to discern a bridge at
all. These are anguished canvases, overheated and apocalyptic. It's
easy to imagine Monet working at not being pretty here, in the same
way that some contemporary glass artists try to make an ugly work
in their medium, which is an automatically alluring one. This was
also the era of Monet's cataract surgery: There is much speculation
about the state of his eyesight when he made the works in this
room.
</P>
<P>
   Grandeur and generosity of scale and spirit mark the
exhibition's last gallery. Plenty of previous painters had tackled
canvases this big, but generally their works were on themes of
history or myth, not landscape _ certainly not on so narrowly
focused a landscape, nor on one that so bared the artist's soul.
These ``Grandes Decorations'' prophesy installation art and
earthworks. But what a shame it would be to see them only as
beacons pointing the way to the future; they're so much more. Be
prepared to surrender yourself to these panoramas, to enter their
end-of-the-world wooziness. ``End'' is what Monet must have known
they were; he was, after all, in his 80s when he made them.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest of these final works at the MFA is ``The Water-Lily
Pond'' from the Kunsthaus in Zurich, a painting nearly 20 feet
across. Dark clouds encroach from either side. For the moment, they
fail to reach the golden heart of the piece. You feel you're
looking down onto a world in microcosm, reflected in the water. But
Monet also creates a sense of elegy and inevitable leave-taking.
You first sense yourself being pulled into this beauty; ultimately,
you're pulled away.

CONTENDERS TRY TO GET TO THE FORE IN THE WOODWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free House and Gentlemen from the West, and Skip Away and
Coronado's Quest from the East, were entered Thursday for
Saturday's $500,000 Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park in New York. If
all four face the starter, the 1 1/8-mile Woodward would contain
without question the most talented field assembled to this point in
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Free House, Gentlemen, and 6-5 morning line favorite Skip Away,
who is 6 for 6 in 1998 and the leading candidate to be Horse of the
Year, are all handicap division powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The horse risking the most is Coronado's Quest, the only
3-year-old in the race. A former bad boy, Coronado's Quest has
redeemed hmself, winning five in a row, including the Haskell at
Monmouth and the Travers at Saratoga, against felllow sophomores.
Entering Coronado's Quest, who now has a long-shot chance to be
Horse of the Year, against the iron was a brave act by trainer Shug
McGaughey, who could have shipped him to Louisiana Downs to run in
the Super Derby Sept. 27 against horses his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the Woodward,'' said McGaughey. ``This
looks like as tough a race as I've ever been in, but I'm looking
forward to walking over to the Belmont paddock instead of spending
a week in Shreveport. I know he's up against it. He'll be running
against seasoned pros. But to run a 3-year-old against older
horses, you have to have a horse with experience and talent, and
we've got that. If you're going to do it, this is the time of year.
We'll get a little bit of weight (3-year-olds carry 121 pounds in
the Woodward, older horses 126), and the older horses have been
lugging a lot of weight all year. They're maybe not as fast as they
were in July. I'm hoping that Coronado's Quest is starting to
improve and maybe he's on the same level as the older horses right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward probably will be the second-to-last career race for
Coronado's Quest. Owner Stuart Janney has announced that the gifted
son of Forty Niner will be retired to Claiborne Farm at the end of
the year, likely after the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs Nov. 7. Janney indicated that the downside to
racing Coronado's Quest as a 4-year-old would be a necessary return
to Florida, where the horse acted badly last winter, including for
the Breeders' Cup, which is at Gulfstream next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning the Travers and Haskell with him is what I set out to
do,'' said McGaughey. ``Now we'll just see how he can do against
these older horses. Basically, the pressure is off. He's doing
fine. He's at home. I'm not worried about that other stuff
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag, an invader from Europe, was the fifth Woodward
entrant. A 4-year-old son of Cozzene, Running Stag has won only
three of 20 starts but captured a Group III race on the turf in
France. ``I beleive he is the best dirt horse in the United
Kingdom,'' said trainer Phillip Mitchell, who saddled hin to an
allowance tally over a dirt course at Lingfield earlier this
sesson.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This much you can predict about Tennessee
Oilers quarterback Steve McNair. When the Oilers' offense takes the
field against the Patriots here Sunday, the fourth-year veteran
will step up to the line of scrimmage and, upon calling signals,
take the snap from center.
</P>
<P>
   What's likely to happen after that was one of the main topics at
Patriots practice Thursday, according to coach Pete Carroll. Ask
the coach or any player about McNair's options and you get varying

   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Force the signal-caller out of the pocket and he'll dash forward
with the speed and power of a running back. Make him go east to
west, cut off the running lanes, and he can throw a spiral across
his body downfield to the open receiver the defensive backs ignored
while trying to get in on the pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   Put him in a grasp and he'll shake your hold with one motion,
then start over again. Corner him for an arm tackle and you'll
discover how difficult an agile 6-foot-2-inch, 225-pound frame is
to bring down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those quarterbacks that's not afraid to run it. A
lot of guys are scared. They throw it away,'' said Patriots free
safety Willie Clay, who will try to contain the multiple threat who
is eighth in the AFC in passing efficiency while averaging 8 yards
a carry. ``This guy is looking to make a play every time.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, who has never played against the Patriots, has run or
thrown for a touchdown in 19 of 24 NFL starts. He is fourth in the
league in third-quarter passing _ 7 of 14 for 98 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He did not avoid the rash of injuries that bedeviled NFL
quarterbacks the first two weeks. He suffered an elbow injury in
the first half of the opener against Cincinnati but came back last
week to rush for a team-high 31 yards on just three carries in a
13-7 loss to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``He breaks a lot of tackles and a lot of sacks,'' said
defensive end Willie McGinest, who offered a critique of McNair
that would rival that of any NFL scout. ``He brings something else
a lot of quarterbacks don't bring to the table _ there are only a
few who do, like (Mark) Brunell and (John) Elway _ and that's
speed. He can get outside and he can throw on the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a strong arm, so that makes it hard for defensive backs
to come up and try to contain him, because if they leave their guys
in coverage, he can usually hit them downfield. He also has good
awareness of where the rush is and he can see guys coming from his
back side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is so quick he can let you get close and spin out with a
quick juke move. He usually sends guys flying. We want him to move
around because any quarterback is not as accurate if he's on the
run, but we have to be careful we don't give up any big yardage on
third down because of his scrambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the Chargers. McNair avoided several would-be tackles
and sacks against San Diego last week to complete 20 of 34 passes
for 193 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``(San Diego was) all over him and he slips out of there and
he's out of nowhere,'' said Carroll. ``That's the fact that is
difficult that we are stressing a great deal in particular,
Thursdayjust so we can adapt to the quarterback running.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Patriots haven't seen running, scrambling
quarterbacks before. Elway, Brunell, and Pittsburgh's Kordell
Stewart have had success out of the pocket. But McNair, though not
possessing the passing numbers of those three, has more options.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that same type of speed, but the one thing that
separates him from those guys is he's stronger,'' said Ty Law.
``He's not going to go down with an arm tackle. He's like a
fullback playing quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   This season he has more weapons with which to work, with the
acquisition of former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Yancey
Thigpen. Still, Carroll believes the Oilers are bent on being a
running team _ despite the troubles of Eddie George (15 carries, 11
yards last week).
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to get back to their running emphasis,'' said
Carroll. ``I think they got out of the mode they'd like to be as
far as hammering the football. They have very good receivers. If
they can get the running game going, they will have the balance
they're seeking.''

 &HT;    First lady shows poise under pressure
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The only figure in the Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr lineup
who has consistently exhibited dignity is first lady Hillary
Clinton. While independent counsel Kenneth Starr, son of a
fundamentalist preacher, rejected legal writing for pulp fiction,
and ``family values'' lawmakers nodded for the lurid sex report to
go on the Internet for the world's young people to read, Mrs.
Clinton issued a simple statement, saying she remains committed to
her marriage. Then she proceeded to carry out her normal duties
with calm competence.
</P>
<P>
   And for her loyalty in the face of unprecedented embarrassment,
she's being criticized not by her political enemies but by feminist
friends who say her trailblazing independence is forever tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary can't direct her energies toward social policy if she's
busy maintaining ``domestic tranquility,'' cried Wendy Wasserstein,
prize-winning playwright, in a New York Times opinion piece. Well,
why not? Wasn't feminism about allowing women to be the complex
beings they are instead of simplistic stereotypes?
</P>
<P>
   I have seen and heard the first lady close-up, though I'm no
close friend, and I'm not at all surprised by her poise under
pressure. She was in my home on two occasions when I was practicing
law in Denver, once to tape ``PrimeTime Live'' at the height of the
Gennifer Flowers flap. After answering two hours of questions from
Sam Donaldson, she drew the line on her time and rushed back to
Little Rock for Chelsea's dance performance. She hurriedly ate a
tuna sandwich in my kitchen, apologized for the ABC cameras' black
marks on my light wood floors and later sent me flowers the color
of my living room drapes.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the interview that stood out in my mind was edited
out. Nobody but the ABC crew and a handful of aides and onlookers
ever heard her comments about the need for equal partnership in
marriage or the differing strengths she and her husband have as
lawyers. Essentially, she said, she liked being an advocate, going
to bat for a cause, while her husband was better at conflict
resolution _ negotiation and compromise _ skills suited to
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Her approach to speaking of the president has been unwavering.
She does not gush as if he were some superior being _ the penchant
of political wives. She speaks respectfully of his policy
decisions, nothing more. How she conveyed that respect again last
week in an introduction at a fund-raiser was a wonder _ but she did
it.
</P>
<P>
   Scandal aside, the Clintons' relationship is none of our
business, and it has nothing to do with feminism.
</P>
<P>
   Women of all political persuasions should appreciate this first
lady's effective advocacy of policies that benefit women and
children. From the committee rooms of the U.S. Congress to the
villages of Africa to the controversial podium of the Beijing
Women's Conference, she has used her position to strengthen
families. (History, I believe, will credit her for pushing health
care issues to the top of the policy agenda in Congress, which has
resulted in positive legislation, though many still call her work a
failure.) That legacy cannot be taken away from her, whether Bill
Clinton's presidency survives or not.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after listening to Mrs. Clinton address a women's group
in my home, I attended an event at which then-Gov. Bill Clinton
spoke. It was a small gathering, and most of us shook his hand on
the way out. I told him jokingly that I had come to see if he was
as splendid a speaker as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sets a high standard, doesn't she?'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Higher than his. Then and now.

BLITZ OF NUMBERS BAFFLES SHORT-DISTANCE CALLERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hope Carmines likes to travel a lot now that she's retired from
her job as a nurse in Edenton, N.C. She doesn't much care, however,
for one previously simple task that she has to perform in each new
city she visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know from place to place just how to dial the
telephone,'' she said while waiting for her luggage at Logan
Airport. ``After a while you get used to just about anything, I
guess, but it still drives me absolutely crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   She's got a lot of company.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so long ago that you had to dial just seven digits to
reach someone within your dialing area, plus a ``1'' at the
beginning for a toll call elsewhere in your state. Anywhere.
Anytime. But not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who learn the rules for their home regions today
aren't likely to know them for the states next door _ and don't
even know whether to dial seven, eight, 10, or 11 digits. Or
they're thrown for a loop when flying into a new place and
discovering that the airport has a different area code than the
downtown it serves. Or can't figure out whether to put in a quarter
(or is it 35 cents?) before or after dialing a pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at home it drives you nuts,'' said Victor Tartaro, an
insurance agent who lives in Newton. ``With the 617s and the 781s
and the 978s and all the long-distance carriers trying to get your
business ... and then there's all the different kinds of billings
for different phones. It's just insane sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   While America's technological revolution is changing many
aspects of everyday life, it's the intriguing and
imagination-stirring new inventions and processes _ the Internet,
for example _ that get the most attention. Few technologies touch
people's lives more directly than the telephone, however, and the
modifications taking place in its use provide a vivid example of
how modernization can turn previously simple tasks into complicated
and frustrating operations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, little about using the phone has remained constant since
the breakup of the AT&AMP;T monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The number of local and long-distance carriers seems to grow
daily, as evidenced by the dinnertime solicitations many people
receive, forcing consumers to deal with choices they never had to
consider before. Likewise, the proliferation of alternatives for
making calls, particularly with access numbers and credit cards,
leads many people to dial 35 digits or more to save money when
placing long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   On all those issues, though, people can make choices. But when
it comes to making a local call, what you get is what you get _ and
what you get today is fragmented and uncoordinated because each
state makes its own decisions on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if you go to Maryland, you've got to dial 10 digits every
time, 11 if the person being contacted is outside the immediate
calling area, which you'll learn from the recording telling you to
hang up and try again. Go to California and it's 11 key punches
even if you call next door, a consequence of the state's 22 area
codes _ heading up to 23 in two months.
</P>
<P>
   Even within a given state, say, Massachusetts, the explosion of
area codes _ from two in 1988 to five today _ often makes it
difficult for residents to know which adjoining jurisdictions are
local and therefore exactly which, not to mention how many, numbers
to dial. (Dial isn't the right word anymore, of course, but no one
seems to have come up with a better one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There comes a point where one has to ask how many nuisances
you have to accept,'' said Richard Tedlow, a professor of business
and technology at the Harvard Business School. ``And there is that
sort-of psychic tariff today that didn't exist when you used to
have just one phone company. ... I think cumulatively, except for
people up to speed on these technological advances, it adds to the
sense that you have less and less control over the environment in
which you live.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Cooprider, an associate professor of computer information
systems at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass., suggested that the
designers of increasingly sophisticated equipment were to blame for
not taking into account the ability of consumers to adapt to
innovation. Rather than build in ways to make a product easier to
use, for instance, Cooprider said inventors tend to think only
about how far they can advance technologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way a user uses it is really irrelevant to many
technologists,'' Cooprider said, ``and I think that's very true,
even especially true, of telephones.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of area codes, regulators do seem to be trying to
provide a smooth road _ but they've been left with few easy options
because of the seemingly ceaseless explosion of computers, cell
phones, fax machines, and start-up phone companies that buy tens of
thousands of lines to resell. The result is that all the numbers in
some area codes are running out, so more digits and new area codes
are added.
</P>
<P>
   Many specialists believe it will be only a few more years before
nearly every state, except perhaps low-population ones like Montana
and New Hampshire, will require 10- or 11-digit dialing for local
calls. And sometime in the longer term, they believe, all 792
possible area codes will be assigned; so far, 260 have been.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, analysts foresee more and more people talking
to computers in the future, especially while they work their way
through long series of options to connect to the person or
department they want. ``That's what I find most annoying, not
getting to talk to real people anymore,'' said Deanne Josephson of
Brookline, Mass., an advertising agency producer.
</P>
<P>
   This multinumbered, mechanical vision of the future conjures
fears that making any call could become a nightmarish experience,
particularly for people who have trouble remembering all the phone
numbers they need already. But most specialists predict other
technologies will come along to alleviate the aggravation and even
make phone use easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``All revolutions take longer than expected, and the changes
they cause are more fundamental than expected,'' said Samuel Simon,
chairman of the Washington-based Telecommunications Research and
Action Center, a nonprofit consumer-advocacy organization. ``We're
at an early and most irritating stage of all that in terms of the
telephone, but we'll get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Deak, who oversees Lockheed-Martin's government-directed job
of administering the implementation of additional area codes around
the United States, was among several specialists who predicted that
fewer Americans in the future were likely to try to remember phone
numbers, while more would carry electronic devices that either
store or dial them. More also will use their computers to dial,
while others will increasingly use the Intenet rather than any
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these innovations already are available and in use,
along with Caller ID systems that automatically return calls
without the user needing to know the number being dialed. Voice
activation also is expected to become commonplace, perhaps allowing
consumers to simply tell their phones to ``call Mom'' rather than
dialing or saying any numbers at all.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most analysts believe people get enough benefits from
newfangled systems _ from lower rates to convenient use (such as
cordless phones) to easy message recording _ that they are willing
to live with short-term hassles. And the analysts maintain the
irritations won't last, because they are more the result of
people's difficulty in adapting to any change than the result of
any complexity of the innovations themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of readjusting,'' said Ellen Langer, a
psychology professor at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that people aren't finding the situations
caused by telephones stressful; they are,'' she added. ``People buy
into the notion that life is becoming more complicated. But
whenever there's a transition, people go through this. ... In the
end, they'll get used to it. It's no big deal.''

 &HT;    FACED WITH RISING CRIME, CARIBBEAN TURNS TO HANGINGS AS
DETERRENT
 &HT;    With HANGINGS-BOX-$ADV19.

<P>
   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ Caribbean governments have a message for
the 250 or so inmates sitting on death row in the region: Hangings
are coming back, and with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Officials stopped hangings in the 1980s in response to protests
from human-rights groups. But judges have started to impose the
punishment again, seeing it as a deterrent to rising crime -- much
of it drug-related.
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier to carry out hangings, governments are taking
controversial steps. They're changing their justice systems and
constitutions, and breaking long-standing ties with international
appeals bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once somebody has been found guilty of a really bad murder, I
feel that that person should go down,'' said Barbados Attorney
General David Simmons, a strong proponent of hangings. ``We don't
want to hang people all the time, but we do want to use it for the
worst types of murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbados, a country of 266,000, generally experiences only nine
or 10 murders a year. But calls to impose hangings have grown
louder in the wake of the shooting deaths of four men in August
that allegedly occurred as gangs jostled over a missing supply of
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the parts of the Caribbean, floggings also have
been revived as a form of punishment after years of being
discounted due to an outcry from human-rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Floggings are performed with the cat-o'-nine tails, which
consist of nine knotted cords attached to a handle designed to tear
an offender's back to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, a judge in Jamaica sentenced Noel Samuda,
30, to 12 strokes and 15 years in jail for rape and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that crime is up and that something must be
done about it,'' Simmons said. ``You'll find judges in many
countries imposing tougher sentences on criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and other groups estimate that there are
nearly 250 prisoners on death row in the English-speaking Caribbean
out of a population of five million -- one of the highest rates in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Kitts and Nevis, the first hanging since 1985 took place
in July when David Wilson was hanged for beating a man to death in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hangings also are imminent in Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and
in other Caribbean countries following the hearing of last-ditch
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Neville Lewis, 32, was scheduled to be executed on Sept. 4 in
Jamaica, where the gallows have been idle for 10 years. But Lewis
has appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights,
which may hear the case as early as Sept. 28. Lewis was convicted
in 1994 of robbing and strangling a businessman who asked him for
directions in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In Jamaica, where there were a record-breaking 1,038 murders
last year, support for the death penalty has become widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were killed in shooting incidents in Jamaica last
weekend, bringing this year's total number of murders to 659.
</P>
<P>
   ``If hanging is the penalty, as it is in Jamaica, then those who
ought to hang, ought to be hanged,'' said Jamaica National Security
Minister K.D. Knight. ``Otherwise, the law will become a laughing
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, there were nearly twice as many people on
death row in the Caribbean as there are today.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentences of many prisoners were commuted to life terms
following a 1993 ruling by Britain's Privy Council -- the region's
final legal arbiter -- that deemed it inhumane to hang inmates who
are on death row longer than five years.
</P>
<P>
   This ruling virtually eliminated hangings since appeals often
drag on for anywhere from five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Britain banned hangings in 1991 in its five Caribbean
possessions, but they remain on the books in all 12 former British
colonies in the Caribbean, including Barbados and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Britain has pressured these former colonies to
abolish the death penalty, which the European Union has long
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Privy Council's ruling has so frustrated Caribbean
governments that many have decided to change their constitutions to
free themselves of the council. They hope to replace the council
with a Caribbean Court of Justice -- to be headquartered in
Trinidad and Tobago -- as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ending ties with the council would break a colonial link
stretching back 165 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are re-evaluating our relationship with Britain, and one
reason is because we want to resume hangings,'' said Barbados Sen.
Phillip Goddard. ``There have been some brutal crimes here and the
people here want the government to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean governments are also severing relations with
international appeals bodies that officials say are used by death
row inmates to stall their fates for years.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad and Tobago partially withdrew from the U.N.
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights this year and
pulled completely out of the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, too, plans to drop out of that commission.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups vehemently oppose the push to revive both
hangings and floggings, saying there is no evidence that they
deflect crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad trend that is taking shape across the region and
we're watching it closely,'' said Sarah DeCosse, an expert on the
Caribbean for Human Rights Watch in Washington, D.C. ``We are
worried that some due process protections are being taken away from
the prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   But most residents in the Caribbean support harsher punishments,
emphasizing that the relatively small size of the region means
everyone shares the impact of even the slightest increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a really bad crime, everyone knows about it, and
everyone feels it,'' said Jeff Cowen, a taxi driver. ``If someone
takes a life, well, we don't believe that person has a right to
live.''

RATIONALIZING ROULETTE: GAMBLING IN JERICHO  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; JERICHO, West Bank _ In the land of the Bible, people for
thousands of years have learned about the high and lasting price of
sin.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Israelis and Palestinians who flocked to the grand
opening of a new casino here this week dismissed warnings from
Orthodox Jewish rabbis and conservative Muslim sheiks alike about
the sin of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Orthodox Yeshiva students in black yarmulkes played roulette
while women in traditional Islamic dress hovered around the
blackjack tables. Israeli surfers with ponytails and Teva sandals
lined up to buy chips as Palestinian Authority officials tried to
remain invisible. Russian immigrant tough guys in open shirt
collars and Star-of-David gold chains mingled with glittery Tel
Aviv types who are heavily into spandex and body piercing.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the entire cast of characters in the long, bloody
drama that is Israel and Palestine put aside their religious and
political differences to put down bets.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Shteren, 26, a Yeshiva student spreading his chips on the
roulette table, said, ``The Torah says not to gamble, but I gamble.
There's money in it. I do it for fun and money. I think God's OK
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou'ai Izheman, 35, a Palestinian hotel worker from a devout
Muslim family in Jerusalem's Old City, pushed his week's earnings
through the slot at the cashier's window to collect $200 in chips.
``My family doesn't know I'm here,'' he confided. ``They wouldn't
like it. But if I win, they'll like it. And I don't think Allah
will mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oasis, which opened to the public Wednesday night, is a $50
million venture that is majority-owned by Austrians. There have
been Israeli and Palestinian news reports as well that one of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's chief aides, Khaled Salam, is a
large investor in the venture, and that other Palestinian officials
helped the casino to open. Once the casino turns a profit, the
Palestinian Authority will take a healthy 25 percent of revenues in
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Oasis captures the surreal contradictions of
life in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is located in the Palestinian-controlled West Bank
because the Israeli government, bowing to the powerful Jewish
orthodox lobby, does not allow casinos on its soil. Nonetheless,
casino advertising targets Israelis, who have flocked for years to
casinos just across the border in Taba, Egypt. Oasis is expecting
big crowds over the High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Palestinian Authority permits casinos, most
Palestinians are traditional Muslims who avoid gambling because it
is ``haram,'' or a sin, in Islam. Even if they did, the Palestinian
Authority, bowing to pressure from powerful Islamic
fundamentalists, formally bans them from the casino. The spiritual
leader of the Islamic movement, Hamas Sheik Ahmed Yassin, called it
``Satan's casino.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Palestinians can skirt the ban by using their Israeli
employment identity cards. Still others can use passports from
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, the Palestinian parking attendants checked the
trunks of cars for bombs. At the door, guests passed through a set
of metal detectors. Amid the flickering lights and bells of the
slot machines, Palestinians and Israelis gambled side by side. The
decorum was Las Vegas kitsch, with ``elements of the Orient,'' as a
brochure put it.
</P>
<P>
   The casino has 35 gaming tables, 220 slot machines, a bar
serving cheap, strong drinks, and a restaurant. Kosher? Not by a
long shot. The ``Jackpots Cafe'' menu features bacon, a bald insult
to observant Jews and Muslims alike.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, a senior official in the Palestinian Authority and
chief negotiator for the stalled peace process, lives in Jericho
and has been a vocal opponent of the casino. ``We are the oldest
city in the world, but we are actually a very small town,'' he
said. ``We are puritans. We are a Christian and Muslim society with
deep family values, and we don't want a casino and all that it
brings in terms of drugs and prostitution and fast money.''
</P>
<P>
   And gambling is only the beginning. There are grandiose plans
for the addition of a luxury hotel, swimming pool, and golf course
as well. Alexander Tucek, director general of the resort, said,
``Our role, together with the Palestinian Authority, will be to
create jobs, which is the first step of all people to create peace.
Our role is not to touch any religious or political questions.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Palestinian leaders, like Erekat, scoffed at the notion
that the casino will somehow bring people together in the spirit of
the peace process. ``Palestinians and Israelis don't need to get
together at a gambling table,'' he said. ``They need to get
together over dinner tables, and at negotiating tables, and board
tables in business, but not a gambling table.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the majority of gamblers Wednesday night were cynical about
the ability of a casino to pave a path to peace. ``The casino wants
to make money. People want a chance to win. And that's it. Don't
look beyond that because there's nothing there,'' said Habib Nimri,
40, an Israeli Arab who works as a tax collector.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few people who felt that the casino could contribute
to peace was Ilana Haimovich, a librarian in Farsaba, who only came
to accompany her husband, Nimrod, an arson investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't gamble. Never in my life,'' she said. ``But this place
is very pretty really. I think it will be very good for the people
of Jericho that Israelis come and do shopping and eating. It's good
for them and it will be good for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband pulled hard on a cigarette and rolled his eyes.
``Everybody looks after their own pocket,'' he said. ``This has
nothing to do with peace, only has to do with whether you win or
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the casino say Jericho, a faded city of 25,000,
benefits because of the 400 jobs that the casino has created. But
at least half of those jobs have gone to European veterans of the
casino circuit and many to Israelis as well.
</P>
<P>
   At night, it is difficult to tell from its front entrance that
the casino is located directly across the street from the Akbet
Jaber United Nations Refugee Camp, where 5,000 Palestinians live in
cracked mud huts with tin roofs, open sewers, and garbage-strewn
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority are devout Muslims from traditional families
who refuse to work at the casino on religious grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Yaghi, 40, who still lives in the refugee camp where he
was born, said, ``I don't believe it will bring jobs. We always
hear promises here. Promises from the UN, the Israelis, the
Palestinian Authority, and now the casino. They are all liars. What
we need are factories, housing that will provide jobs and a good
life for the people.''
</P>
<P>
   On a scorching day this week, Jamal Samarat, 22, was breaking
bricks with a hammer for a sidewalk that leads to the casino. He
makes about $25 a day. He explained that he was brought to the
casino by the Israeli contractor for whom he has worked for two
years. He protested, but was told that he would lose his job if he
refused to work there. ``I have to work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samarat blames not the Israelis for the casino, but the
Palestinian Authority officials who made it a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to make money at the sake of our Islamic principles.
This is the core of corruption,'' he said. ``God destroyed Jericho
once before and after this casino he will destroy it again.''

TURN DRIVEWAY BUMP INTO A RAMP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a slight imperfection in my poured concrete driveway.
The concrete was laid in two different slabs and there is a 2
1/4-inch dropoff where the two slabs meet. How can I turn that bump
into a ramp?
</P>
<P>
   BOB, from Indianapolis
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fixing it should be easy, I think. Buy a large
pressure-treated beam, say 6 by 10 inches, and cut it at an angle,
like a wedge. Stick this wedge up against that 2 1/4-inch lip.
Drill holes through it and into the concrete and insert a long bolt
or reinforcing bar into each hole to hold the wedge in place.
Presto, a gradual ramp so your teeth won't set on edge when you
drive over it. To drill through concrete, rent an impact drill; it
hammers as it drills and goes through concrete as if it were
butter. Using a masonry bit on a power drill will take days to
drill those holes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 100-year-old bath has asbestos tiles on an uneven floor.
How can I straighten out that floor and what can I put over the
asbestos tiles to be safe?
</P>
<P>
   MARK LYLE, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You might be able to take off those vinyl-asbestos tiles and
dispose of them safely, because they may contain a low percentage
of asbestos. Break off a small sample, put it in a poly bag and
take it to an asbestos abatement company for analysis. Whether you
take off the tiles or not, lay down a sheet of exterior grade 5/8-
to 3/4-inch plywood, which will span the slight unven areas. Screw
down the plywood tightly. You will have to remove the toilet to do
this. Then apply new tiles or even ceramic tiles to the plywood.
This new floor will be thicker than the old, but at least even, if
not level. When you reinstall the toilet, the plumber will have to
put an attachment on it to make up for this extra thickness. At the
doorway, you'll have to put in a threshold to span the different
levels of floor in and out of the bathroom. You may have to trim
the bottom of the door to clear the threshold. While you're at it,
put in a new low-flow toilet; you will be amazed at how much lower
your water bills will be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a crack in the top cover of my toilet tank. Do I need
to replace it? What if the tank itself is cracked?
</P>
<P>
   HELEN GREGOIRE, Stoneham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't have to replace the cover, which is only
decorative. If the cover is not in two pieces, there is no need for
replacement. Besides, covers are not available individually that I
know of. You might be able to find one at a house salvage company,
but then the problem is getting one to fit.
</P>
<P>
   If the tank itself is cracked, and not leaking, there is also no
need to replace it, until it starts leaking. If it is leaking, you
might be able to make a reapir. Empty the tank and let it dry off,
then press plumber's epoxy into and on the crack and let it set.
Refill the tank and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   If the tank continues to leak, you will have to put in a new
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a water stain on my ceiling, and I noticed that you
don't like BIN to seal it because it is too white, and hard to
cover with ceiling paint. What can I use instead of BIN?
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM MORRISON, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Clear shellac. It will seal the stain and prevent it from
bleeding the new ceiling paint. And, it is easy to cover with one
or two coats of ceiling paint. But alas, the whole ceiling must be
done.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have had luck in eliminating the stain rather than
sealing it, by using a bleach and water solution on the stain. You
could try it, using a solution of one part bleach and one part
water. If the stain disappears, you probably won't even have to
repaint.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I read your reference to hard, smooth ceiling tiles, to cover
an old, peeling bathroom ceiling, which you said are easy to keep
clean. I looked around and found nothing like that. What are you
talking about?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID HELMER, New Orleans
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I am talking about ceiling tiles that are hard (not soft as
many fiber tiles), smooth (not acoustic tiles, those with holes or
fissures). They come 12 by 12 inches, sometimes 12 by 24 inches,
and can be put up with adhesive. They are sold in lumber and
building supply stores; even the chains like Home Depot should
carry them. Armstrong, a big name in ceiling tiles, makes them,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   I put them in one of my bathrooms years ago; they not only are
hard and smooth and washable, but the paint, which gives the tiles
their hardness, does not peel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I bought a thick wool runner, which is nice looking, but the
glued-on backing stinks. What can I do to get rid of that
permeating smell?
</P>
<P>
   GABRIELE COLAO, Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Wait. It will dissipate over time, a long time, but probably
not enough for the odor to go away completely. Take it back, return
it or exchange it for one that does not have a backing; you can get
wool runners and rugs without this odious backing. Then put down a
pad of some kind that does not stink.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

HEAD START: CONGRESS FOCUSES ON ITS REAL JOB  
 (THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE SEPT. 18 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Believe it or not, there were signs this week that our
nation's leaders busied themselves with the normal, mundane
business of the nation. Yes, matters of great issue are unfolding
in Washington, but there is also other business to tend to.
</P>
<P>
   The House this week reminded us that little things matter with
approval of reauthorization legislation for Head Start, a Great
Society program that has enjoyed bipartisan support because of its
worthy service to poor young children.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson's program has withstood more than 30 years of
partisan politics largely because it is difficult to argue against
a program that so clearly embodies the nation's philosophy in
fighting poverty: Education is key, and poor kids need to be ready
to learn. When implemented as designed, the health and education
programs of Head Start achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Clinton. They've all signed legislation
allowing Head Start to continue.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Head Start hasn't been kicked around in
political games. This year, for example, reauthorization
legislation was held up for months because of odd provisions
imposed by the House Education and Workforce Committee. That
committee wanted to prohibit enrollment of children whose families
receive welfare unless the mother helped establish paternity.
</P>
<P>
   It also wanted to exempt Head Start from requirements under the
Davis-Bacon Act that construction workers on federal projects be
paid the ``prevailing wage.'' And it wanted to allow Head Start
agencies to give parents vouchers for temporary, private care if
their center is forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   All the provisions touch public policies that we've supported,
but they are ancillary, even punitive, when attached to Head Start
reauthorization.
</P>
<P>
   Don't punish children because of their parents' mistakes.
Construction is a pittance of the $4 billion Head Start budget. And
the greater worry about access to preschool and child care is how
to make available Head Start services to more children. Only 50
percent of eligible children, about 830,000, are served.
</P>
<P>
   The debate specific to Head Start is whether the quality
controls imposed during the last reauthorization have worked. The
Department of Health and Human Services says they have. More than
100 centers have been terminated, and 200 have been rehabilitated
to meet higher standards, according to press spokesman Michael
Kharfen.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved legislation Monday that extends the life of
the program for five years without the provisions. The Senate had
approved Head Start legislation earlier this summer. A conference
committee will smooth over differences between the two bills. The
primary sticking point is whether the proposed budget increase
should go to expanding Head Start or continuing improvements in the
quality of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a bill to the president is not an easy challenge for the
conference committee, given the events of the day and a ticking
clock. Authorization for Head Start expires Sept. 30, and Congress
is set to go home in a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A Head Start bill isn't, shall we say, a sexy issue in
Washington. It's a little thing in today's very grand scheme of
political intrigue. But there are at least 830,000 little reasons
Congress should finish its work and give the president a bill to
sign. &QL;

LESSONS FROM THE HYDE AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scooped again.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after Clinton testified for the grand jury and then,
unwisely, tired and angry and wrung out, went on TV to talk
Monica-talk, I sat in as guest host of C-SPAN's morning call-in
show on national politics. That same day, a viewer in Florida wrote
to me: ``I just caught you on C-SPAN, and ...''
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, the writer had been aware that one of his
friends, a regular tennis partner, bore a grudge against US
Representative Henry Hyde, Republican of Illinois and chairman of
the Judiciary Committee that is now mounting the impeachment drive
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is one of the GOP's elder statesmen, elected to Congress 24
years ago from Chicago's western suburbs, an Irish Catholic
conservative whose name is on ``the Hyde Amendment'' banning
federal funding of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The letter writer wanted The Boston Globe to know that Hyde had
cuckolded his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This `family values' salesman broke up my friend's family ...
my friend was seriously damaged economically and emotionally,
permanently and irreparably, and his family was left dysfunctional.
Hyde took advantage of my friend and his former wife by using his
superior status (successful lawyer and state legislator) to seduce
a young mother (of three children) and have a 5 1/2-year affair
with her, while still managing to maintain his own marriage. So
much for his version of `family values.'''
</P>
<P>
   The writer was obviously hostile to Hyde and the conservatives
running Congress, and angry at ``the amount and volume of hypocrisy
in this lengthy and vigorous effort to bring our president down''
and offered to make his friend available to confirm the tale and
make public this ``Jekyll and Hyde story.''
</P>
<P>
   I turned a copy of the letter over to an experienced Globe
colleague, who talked to the letter-writer, the husband who had
been victimized, and confirmed details: His wife, then mother to
three kids aged 5, 8 and 9, ran an unlicensed hair salon in her
basement. The 6-year old son began telling his dad of a man named
``Hank'' who called often; mom began staying out late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The couple (Hyde and the hairdresser) went to restaurants and
ballgames together, traveled together. Hyde bought her a Lincoln
convertible, pink luggage, jewelry, set her up in an apartment and
set her up in business for herself.'' The hairdresser's husband,
after his divorce, a remarriage to the same woman, and a second
divorce, later remarried and divorced again, ``is quite bitter,''
my colleague found. ``He never remarried. He says that the affair
screwed up his marriage and the divorce screwed up his three
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Globe editors decided not to publish the story initially, a
decision that will confound right-wing media bashers. The on-line
magazine Salon broke the tale Wednesday. A Reuters account in
Thursday's Globe said that the Los Angeles Times, Miami Herald, and
Globe ``had all turned down an opportunity to do the story.''
Hyde's office put out a press release: ``The statute of limitations
has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions,'' which began
when he was in his 40s.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde called the story ``an obvious attempt to intimidate me and
it won't work.'' With the sort of unthinking partisanship for which
he is noted, Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas blamed ``the Clinton
attack dogs'' for promoting the story. DeLay is completely off
base; the cuckolded husband has been telling his friends his tale
of woe for years, the Globe check showed.
</P>
<P>
   The real lesson of Henry Hyde's Scarlet Letter is the Bible's
oldest: ``Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.'' With
the same sort of hubris in their power that led them to shut down
the government, the Sun Belt conservatives running Congress felt
they could tear down Clinton while avoiding any damage to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   For the lipreaders in Congress, who don't understand how the
devil-ray of scandal harms those who shine it as well as those upon
whom it is shined, I will explain how this works:
</P>
<P>
   First the dime drops; then the shoe drops; and then your
reputation drops. You start splashing around in the mud, and your
nice dress shirt gets muddy. No one in politics got into power
without making mistakes, enemies, and misleading statements about
some embarrassing moment or other. That's human nature. But it's
also human nature to suspect duplicity in harshly partisan
political skunkfights.
</P>
<P>
   This Monica business has gone nuclear. There's radioactive waste
all over Washington, and the media act like the devilish winds that
wafted radioactivity thousands of miles from Chernobyl, spreading
cigar tales and DNA-drenched stains everywhere. Not every news
medium picks up every scrap of garbage. But some one will print it,
sooner or later, and then we all recycle the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightline'' began as the nightly chronicle of the Iran hostage
outrage. Cable news networks thrived on O.J. gore. Now the Lady in
the Black Beret is the profit center for all those double-digit
channels on the cable box. And the longer the Republicans screw
around with impeachment, the more exposed they become to just the
sort of dime-dropping that nicked Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Congress's biggest foe of abortion is unmasked as a
long-time-ago adulturer. Mr. Family Values broke up another man's
family. The stain is not just on that infamous blue dress. The
stain is spreading. This Congress is not squeaky-clean; no Congress
ever is. There'll be more collateral damage if impeachment talk
lasts beyond the midterm elections in November. The warning signs
abound: don't go there, or you may be next.

`DIGGING' IS A TENDER MINIATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DIGGING TO CHINA 
Directed by: Timothy Hutton 
Screenplay by: Karen Janszen 
Starring: Kevin Bacon, Evan Rachel Wood, Cathy Moriarty, Mary
Stuart Masterson, Marian Seldes 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Rated: PG (thematic elements and some emotional moments) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Actor Timothy Hutton ably follows the less-is-more route in his
directing debut, ``Digging to China,'' keeping the canvas small,
but filling it artfully and with a sensitive, tender eye for
behavioral nuance. It adds Evan Rachel Wood to the list of
expressive child actors as the film's protagonist. Harriet is an
unhappy 10-year-old longing for a UFO to rescue her from her drab
rural Pennsylvania '60s milieu, where her alcoholic mother (Cathy
Moriarty) halfheartedly runs a motel and an older sister, Gwen
(Mary Stuart Masterson), distracts herself with promiscuity. If the
UFO doesn't show, she's willing to start digging and come out on
the other side of the world; hence the film's title.

   Ironically, Harriet's world expands with the arrival of a
character whose world is shrinking, and who knows it. Kevin Bacon's
childlike Ricky is about to be delivered to a permanent-care
institution by his mother (Marian Seldes), who has been diagnosed
with terminal cancer. When their car breaks down en route to the
institution, they check into the motel until repairs can be made,
and a friendship develops between Harriet and Ricky. Just as they
reach a fragile equilibrium, based on Ricky's ability to empathize
with Harriet's desire for escape, Harriet's mother dies in a car
crash, whereupon a family secret is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Masterson's Gwen starts mothering Harriet as if to make up for
lost time, which means trouble for Harriet's sweetly platonic
friendship with the retarded but exquisitely sensitive Ricky.
Bacon, given a new kind of acting stretch, never overdoes the
physical dimension of the role and achieves the film's most
poignant moment when he looks into the future. All the women, from
the youngest to the oldest, take their material to the max,
convincingly running a gamut from innocent camaraderie to hollow
weariness.
</P>
<P>
   All the characters are sympathetic, or at least not badly
motivated, especially Bacon during Ricky's moments when his face
tells us he knows that to do what Harriet asks is to invite
trouble. But he does it anyway, out of a desire to please her,
right to the end. Obviously, Hutton remembered from his acting
debut in ``Ordinary People'' that details matter. This film is
meticulously crafted, keenly observed, beautifully gauged in climax
after climax. ``Digging to China'' confirms Hutton's abilities and
instincts and whets our appetite for his next directing assignment.

AUTHENTIC PERFORMANCES DEEPEN `ONE TRUE THING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ONE TRUE THING 
Directed by: Carl Franklin 
Screenplay by: Karen Croner, based on Anna Quindlen's novel  
Starring: Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger, William Hurt, Tom Everett
Scott, Nancy Katt, Lauren Graham 
Running time: 128 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you think Meryl Streep's woman hollowed out by illness
in ``One True Thing'' is going to be all technique, with no
emotional jolts, she swings around and zings you with a
tough-mindedness that wipes away all the dithery domestic
role-playing and overpitched cheerfulness in which she had been
trafficking. Pale and raccoon-eyed under layers of makeup, her
character reminds us in one extraordinary assertion of personality
that she's no victim now, and, what's more, never had been one,
despite appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, her grown daughter, played by Renee Zellweger as if
from a briar patch of tension and love and anger, had been raging
at her selfish father, partly on her mother's behalf, but also for
her own reasons. Zellweger's Ellen Gulden is the counterweight in
Anna Quindlen's novel about an ambitious journalist yanked off the
career express in Manhattan to return to her family home in an
upstate college town to care for her mother. She's tart and
impatient, so much so that you can't help wondering if Quindlen
borrowed her last name from a popular brand of mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, played in one of his more memorable displays of
lockjawed emotional stinginess by William Hurt, is an academic and
enough of a literary light to have won a National Book Award. Yet
he's insecure enough and egocentric enough to feel he has to crush
what he sees as competition from his daughter. He dismisses her
career by ignoring it, then laying a few empty homilies on her.
Making it clear that his career is too important to interrupt, but
that his daughter's is not, he guilt-trips her home, then hides on
campus from his wife's needs and his daughter's resentment.
</P>
<P>
   Matters are exacerbated by Ellen's inability to continue her
freelance writing from her parents' home and, more wrenchingly, by
the fact that she has always looked down her nose at what she
perceives as her mother's trivialized world filled with meaningless
activity _ ladies club lunches, volunteer work, artsy-craftsy
decorating projects. When Ellen's mother, Kate, stages a costume
birthday party for her husband and dresses as Dorothy from the
Wizard of Oz, Ellen is ready to scream. Instead, she lapses into
begging for scraps of approval from her father, whom she has
idealized.
</P>
<P>
   His cruel reward to Ellen for asking her to take on her mother's
care is an offer to let Ellen write the introduction to his next
book of essays. As Kate's confinement continues, Ellen's view of
her parents shifts. Her father's stock falls, her mother's rises,
and Ellen finds herself growing and deepening. Finally, she
realizes how horrifyingly apt her mother's choice of costume was,
that her father, like the Wizard of the Emerald City, is something
of a humbug, and that her mother's lifelong denial _ so
astonishingly and completely repudiated _ was a kind of strength
and mercy, not stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Streep's acting is filled with mature mastery, more internalized
than her previous bravura performances. And Zellweger holds the
screen with her, scene for scene, deepening her capacity for
projecting waspish anger with a weight and gravity that leave us in
no doubt that she, too, is a formidable personality. The film's
framing device seems superfluous, and the ending succumbs to
sentimentality. But ``One True Thing,'' which represents an
impressive change of pace for ``Devil in a Blue Dress'' and ``One
False Move'' director Carl Franklin, delivers the emotional goods.

`A MERRY WAR' AIMS FOR ORWELLIAN BITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
A MERRY WAR 
Directed by: Robert Bierman 
Screenplay by: Alan Plater 
Starring: Richard E. Grant, Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Wadham,
Jim Carter, Harriet Walter, Lesley Vickerage 
Running time: 101 minutes 
Rated: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Merry War'' is a nice try that doesn't quite nail the
double-edged complexity of its target, George Orwell's gently
satiric novel, ``Keep the Aspidistra Flying.'' One says gently
satiric because one of the things Orwell was satirizing was himself
in his portrayal of a successful ad man turned impoverished poet
and thinking himself pure because he's chasing his muse instead of
Mammon. Still, Mammon is never far off in the wings and Orwell's
novel is always aware that the hubris of the would-be poet is a
little silly. The truth is that Orwell was at least as
affectionately disposed toward the lower middle class as he was
contemptuous toward it, and he knew it. The leafy green house plant
in the window of any respectable house with curtains was at least
as reassuringly comforting to him as it was a symbol of
capitulation to mindless conformity.
</P>
<P>
   The film, while handsomely mounted, is a bit too single-stranded
to capture the ironies and contradictions of the novel. Richard E.
Grant's Orwell surrogate, Gordon Comstock, is a bit too exclusively
manic and wide-eyed. There's little of the Orwellian mix of slyness
and anger in this bumptuous Comstock, who's acute enough to mock
the left-wing poses of his rich publisher, but conveniently blind
to the fact that he pays for a minimally fancy lunch in the country
with his girlfriend with money borrowed from the hard-earned tips
of his spinster sister working for starvation wages as a waitress
in a tea shop. Not even stylishly arrogant (his publisher fills
that slot), he's merely loud and toilsome.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Bonham Carter, as Comstock's patient girlfriend who
considers herself lucky to have her illustrator's job in the depths
of an economic depression (the story takes place in 1934), becomes
the sympathetic character by default, the one who keeps her wits
about her while the man she loves goes off the deep end on the
strength of a favorable review of his slim book of poetry, a review
he doesn't find out until later was written by his publisher. What
does emerge is a picture of all the people close to Comstock
putting up with his nonsense with more than a little grace. Ditto
for the inhabitants of his descent through the social order, from a
bed-sitter in Camden Town to a squalid but comfortably unbuttoned
neighborhood in Lambeth.
</P>
<P>
   The political incorrectness that emerges intact from the pages
of Orwell's affectionate lampoon of British life is refreshing, but
the pieties about money and purity seem banal in the pop-eyed
earnestness with which they are unrelievedly uttered. His
sentimentalizing of the poor puts you in mind of Preston Sturges'
patronizing Hollywood director in ``Sullivan's Travels,'' deciding
to mix anonymously with the underclass in order to add authenticity
to his impending social protest film called ``O Brother, Where Art
Thou?'' The kindness and patience of Bonham Carter's and Wadham's
servitors of capitalism are, in the end, what make ``A Merry War''
worth seeing for more than its picture-postcard views of
Depression-era London.

HEALING BEGINS WITH BIGGER LOSERS FOR LOCAL TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - This week, we get a first-hand look at the difference
between college and pro football.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Sun Devils and the Cardinals. Arizona State is off to a
bad start (see national title hopes: dashed), losing to Washington
and Brigham Young, mostly because its secondary developed a
pathological fear of opposing receivers.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, ASU gets a breather, the 0-2 Eagles from North
Texas, who have been getting knocked down ever since they stepped
up to Division I.
</P>
<P>
   Then you have the Cardinals. Arizona is off to a bad start (see
playoff hopes: dashed), losing to Dallas and Seattle, mostly
because the West Coast offense went surfing.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Arizona, instead of a cream puff, must play the
0-2 Eagles from Philadelphia, who . . .
</P>
<P>
   Hmmm. Maybe there isn't much difference after all.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Beagles in town, that old fantasy football adage
comes to mind: You can always mine mediocre teams for good talent.
</P>
<P>
   After all, most fantasy football fans are like regular football
fans, that is to say, they're front runners. Everybody wants the
marquee players, like Brett Favre, Barry Sanders and Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   But those guys are gone in the first few rounds. In fantasy
football, success depends on the lower picks, and then finding good
no-name guys during the season to replace all the players who break
important bones in Week Two (see Brad Johnson, Dorsey Levens and
Troy Aikman: yee-ouch!)
</P>
<P>
   And there's no better place to find replacements than on bad or
overachieving teams.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at Atlanta, San Diego and New Orleans. They're all
2-0, a tribute to luck, bad competition and a few good players who
want to win.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, before the season started, were you dying to draft
running back Jamal Anderson, wide receiver Bryan Still or
quarterback Danny Wuerffel? How about quarterback Chris Chandler,
tight-end Freddie Jones or receiver Sean Dawkins?
</P>
<P>
   If you were, stay out of my FFL league.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler and Anderson have carried the Falcons, Still and Jones
(not to mention 6-foot-5, 235-pound receiver Mikhael Ricks) have
loads of potential for San Diego and Dawkins and Wuerffel hooked up
for 110 yards and a touchdown Sunday for the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   And the teams don't have to be overachievers to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   On the Eagles, I'd take a look at running back Duce Staley, who
has done a good job filling in for oft-injured Charlie Garner. And
don't forget the ageless Irving Fryar, who is still catching balls
like he invented the forward pass.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, that's not true. Some other guy invented the forward
pass. Fryar just caught it.
</P>
<P>
   What about the much-maligned Chicago Bears? Quarterback Erik
Kramer doesn't quicken the pulse, but he has the brains to get rid
of the ball. He also has good receivers in Curtis Conway and Bobby
Engram.
</P>
<P>
   Quick quiz: How sorry do you think the Packers are that they let
Edgar Bennett slip away? Can you spell Travis Jervey?
</P>
<P>
   Nice try. &QL; 
Tip of the week
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting Jake Plummer gets back on track Sunday against the
Eagles at Sun Devil Stadium. Then again, I also bet that this whole
Monica Lewinsky business would blow over. Don't forget, the dreaded
bye weeks start Sunday. Atlanta, Carolina, New Orleans and San
Francisco are off. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins is a quality receiver who probably wasn't taken in your
draft. Cincinnati receiver Darnay Scott is flourishing with Neil
O'Donnell throwing to the right-colored jerseys. San Francisco
49ers tight-end Irv Smith should get plenty of action. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week it's running back Chuck Levy, 49ers. Levy's numbers
look good (eight rushes, 44 yards, one touchdown), but he did it
against a pathetic Washington defense that gave up in the second
half. &QL;

DROGE TAKES PRIDE IN BEING HUMBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Droge is not a musician who sits with his head buried in
the trade magazines, scanning the latest chart positions and record
sales while plotting his next commercial move. No, Droge is a
throwback to the days when musicians tried to be blissfully
ignorant of such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to keep reminding myself that the music is what's
important _ and appreciating the fact that I'm able to play,'' he
says. ``The numbers and the sales and all that don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Droge, who had a minor hit in 1994 with the lovably warped ``If
You Don't Love Me (I'll Kill Myself),'' has come into his own with
his latest album, ``Spacey and Shakin'.'' It's his third album, but
the first in which he has distanced himself from past comparisons
to Tom Petty and Bob Dylan. It brims with lyrical twists, hard-won
truths, and a heavier, uptempo rock pulse compared to the folk-rock
slant of his first two CDs.
</P>
<P>
   It was again produced by Brendan O'Brien, who has worked with
Pearl Jam, Dylan, Neil Young, Rage Against the Machine, and Matthew
Sweet. ``He pushed me to do things that are less stock,'' says
Droge. ``When I first hooked up with him, I wanted to make more
rootsy, standard-type records. But he's shown me there are more
interesting ways of doing things _ to change the spirit and
approach it from a fresh angle, rather than be predictable and
same-y.''
</P>
<P>
   Droge, who has been called ``Generation X's John Hiatt,'' has
also shown incredible fortitude in staying on the road to ply his
craft. He and his band, the Millionaires (formerly the Sinners),
have done various tours this year with Ben Harper, Edwin McCain,
and Cracker. They also have some upcoming dates with Marcy
Playground. It's all part of Droge's philosophy to get the music
out to the public, regardless of radio airplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a challenge to think that way,'' he says.
``You could think instead that if I had massive airplay, we could
sell more tickets and stay in nicer hotels. You start thinking of
job security. But I think these things are all traps. It's much
healthier to stay in the present and enjoy what you're doing at the
moment, rather than projecting into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to slip into the thought of `OK, how many (radio)
stations have added the record this week?' But I need to take the
power from that thought and put it back into performing for
people,'' adds Droge. ``As long as you love playing, that's going
to make it all worthwhile. Nowadays, the scale of success is so
bloated that in order for something to be considered a success, it
has to sell multimillions. But a career that is more humble is
often overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Droge, who formerly lived in Portland, Ore., and is now based in
Seattle, doesn't mind having that humble career. He takes pride in
it _ and is so dedicated to the concept that he even plans to show
up unannounced for guerrilla-style acoustic shows this fall, before
playing his nighttime club gigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be completely unplugged. We're just going to
show up on campus areas and start to play,'' he says. ``It's going
to make us tighter as a band.'' And then in the evening they'll
plug in and go electric.
</P>
<P>
   Droge &AMP; Co. will be around Boston this afternoon at some
as-yet-unspecified site, followed by tonight's Bill's Bar gig. Hey,
with this schedule, they don't have time to read the trade
magazines anyway.

   Bits and pieces: Reveille, a teen band from Harvard, Mass., has
signed a seven-figure deal with Elektra Records. The group's
attorney, Frank Cimler, describes Reveille as a cross between Korn

sleepy little town ... Johnny Adams, a New Orleans legend and
Boston favorite, died Monday at age 67 in Baton Rouge, La., after a
long bout with cancer. He recorded for Rounder Records and will be
missed.

DIGGING ROCK'S NUGGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garage-rock. Garage-punk. Garage-psychedelia. Call it what you
want, but the operative word was garage. It was music often
literally made in suburban garages during the '60s, in the wake of
the Beatles-led British Invasion. And it birthed a renaissance that
made instant heroes out of many regional bands that were rarely
heard from again, but which paved the way for the do-it-yourself
ethic of today's alternative-rock nation.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Beau Brummels from San Francisco, the Music Machine
from Los Angeles, Barry &AMP; the Remains from Boston, the Cryan Shames
from Chicago, the Amboy Dukes from Detroit, the Nazz from
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the bands represented on the new,
four-CD box, ``Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the Psychedelic
Era, 1965-1968,'' on Rhino Records. It's an expanded version of the
original ``Nuggets'' disk released in 1972, which spawned the
compilation/reissue craze so prevalent in retailing today.
</P>
<P>
   And, like so many trends, it all stemmed from the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of us were all trying to be like the Beatles,'' says
Sal Valentino, the Beau Brummels singer recently reached at his
home in the Bay Area. ``What was happening before that was Motown,
but it was not likely that you'd see Sal Valentino in that idiom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beau Brummels had a 1965 hit with ``Laugh, Laugh,'' which
was more polished than the usual garage fare, but still led to
``screaming girls chasing after us'' just like the Fab Four, he
says. The Brummels song _ and here's some little-known history _
was produced by Sly Stone and marketed at radio by an indie
promoter named Sonny Bono, who went on to Sonny &AMP; Cher fame.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mid-'60s ``Nuggets'' acts were eerily similar to the
Beatles, such as the New Jersey-based Knickerbockers, who had a hit
with ``Lies,'' which you'd swear had John Lennon and Paul McCartney
singing harmony on it.
</P>
<P>
   There was no shortage of American acts unashamedly jumping on
the Beatles bandwagon. ``In 1964, when the Beatles came out, I saw
exactly what was going to happen,'' says Sean Bonniwell, singer
with the Music Machine, which has two songs on the ``Nuggets'' box:
``Talk Talk'' and ``Double Yellow Line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Music Machine, however, became one of the most original
garage-rock groups of that time. The band rode the songwriting
genius of Bonniwell, who was ahead of his time in protest songs
like ``Eagle Never Hunts the Fly'' (about government hassling) and
``Mother Nature, Father Earth,'' about ecology. They also had the
technical genius of bassist Keith Olsen, who invented the
``fuzzbox,'' which created a trippy guitar sound that
revolutionized the genre. The group split up in 1969, but Olsen
later became a prominent producer whose chief credit was producing
Fleetwood Mac's mega-platinum ``Rumours'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Bonniwell, unfortunately, was not as lucky. Today, he lives in
an actual garage on an Arabian horse ranch where he works in the
small California town of Porterville (between Bakersfield and
Fresno). But the garage has no running water (he does have access
to the main ranch house for that) and he's still fighting legal
battles to recoup his songwriting royalties from the Music
Machine's record label, Original Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the euphoria of the mid-'60 has given way to a harsher
reality in his case. ``I'm just trying to survive,'' says
Bonniwell, who is finishing an autobiography, ``Beyond the
Garage,'' which he expects to put out by himself for Christmas.
(For more info, write to PO Box 409, Porterville, CA. 93258.)
</P>
<P>
   Bonniwell is now a born-again Christian who is still trying to
deal with his anger over his perceived mistreatment by his label.
``The Lord says I must forgive my enemies,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He still sounds full of life, though, and is still writing
songs. ``I never stopped writing,'' he notes, adding that he even
has three albums worth of unrecorded material from the Music
Machine days.
</P>
<P>
   And what heady days those were, he recalls. The Music Machine
once played 35 nights in a row. ``You just threw everything in your
VW bus and off you went,'' he says. ``We'd play almost anywhere,
any time, but our resources were never coordinated at all. That,
and the fact that we rarely got paid. You couldn't take a check
from a promoter back then, because it would bounce. So I'd have a
big brown shopping bag and take the cash from the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Music Machine had a druggy, psychedelic sound,
Bonniwell says he didn't do drugs and was ``as straight as an ice
cube tray.'' But the group was radical in other ways. In order to
stand out from the garage-rock pack, the Music Machine dressed all
in black, complete with dyed-black hair and black guitars, amps,
and drums. They even wore a black leather glove on one hand (this
was long before Michael Jackson's single-glove look), all of which
conspired to get them into trouble when touring backwater spots in,
say, the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into one place in the South and wanted to use the rest
room,'' Bonniwell relates. ``And this was still in the days when
there was segregation. The owner said, `The white rest room is
here, the black rest room is there, and you ain't got one.'''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the acts on the ``Nuggets'' box turned out to be
one-hit wonders, there's still a spirit that makes this one of the
most essential collections to any rock historian's library. The
suggested retail price is not cheap ($59.98), but it's a bargain
considering there are nearly 30 songs per CD.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this is the definitive mid-'60s, garage-rock
collection. And if names like the Strawberry Alarm Clock, the
Barbarians, Sir Douglas Quintet, and Paul Revere &AMP; the Raiders
don't mean anything to you, then give a listen to find out why
these acts are forerunners of the guitar-driven, garage-punk
movement that persists to this day.

RESCUING PROMETHEUS 
By Thomas P. Hughes 
Pantheon, 372 pp., illustrated, $28.50,  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston's ``Big Dig'' is in extraordinarily good company in
``Rescuing Prometheus,'' an account by historian Thomas P. Hughes,
emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a visiting
professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, of four
megaprojects of our time.
</P>
<P>
   The four all have neat names _ SAGE, Atlas, ARPANET, and CA/T _
and their stories all contain lessons about how humans accomplish
the arguably unaccomplishable. But CA/T _ the Big Dig, formally the
Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel project _ is unique here not
only because it is more recent than the others but also because it
is a concrete construction project, whereas the others were
defense-related systems heavy with computers and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these ambitious undertakings are part, as Hughes
believes, of ``a technogical transformation that can be seen as a
second creation; the first ... mythologized in the book of
Genesis'' I leave to other students of history. However, the
results of the four projects, and their valuable unexpected
consequences, certainly place the teams that worked on them in the
category of modern-day Heracleses. The hero Heracles in Greek
mythology (in Latin, he's Hercules) freed the imprisoned creator
Prometheus, who had stolen fire from heaven for use by humans.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes focuses on the Big Dig's relatively successful management
_ an overlay of private consultants on a small government-employee
group, and its postmodern ``open'' style, which allowed negotiation
and accommodation with a multitude of environmental and other
groups. He pays almost no attention to the cost of the consequent
appeasements, the one notable hole in the book.
</P>
<P>
   MIT plays a huge part in the book, none larger than in the SAGE
chapter. SAGE stands for Semiautomatic Ground Environment, an
air-defense system built in the 1950s. By the time it was turned on
in 1958, the bombers that SAGE was designed to defend against had
given way to missiles. ``Critics have called SAGE the best
peacetime air defense system ever deployed,'' Hughes notes. Though
the plug was pulled in the 1980s, it was deemed a central learning
experience in communications and management and pushed computers
over the hump from narrow problem-solving to broad information
processing.
</P>
<P>
   Atlas, the first successful intercontinental ballistic missile
project, might have seemed the most interesting of the projects in
the book, but it is the least, perhaps because Hughes's focus is on
management systems, a dry topic. It was, Hughes writes, ``the
largest and most costly military-funded research and development
program in history _ the Manhattan Project notwithstanding.'' Atlas
ushered in big thinking. As Simon Ramo (the ``R'' in TRW Inc.) put
it, ``Systems engineering is the design of the whole as distinct
from the design of the parts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is ARPANET, the presursor to the Internet, begun
(of course) for defense purposes so warrior-commanders could better
coordinate their weapons. Talk about unintended consequences. This
project, begun by linking up a few nerds' computers at universities
here and there, was a fraction of the size of Atlas. (All
computer-related projects funded by the Advanced Research Projects
Agency in the late 1960s amounted to $30 million annually _ just
the price of one good Big Dig ramp.) Yet, as one MIT computer guru
said, ``what the military needs is what the businessman needs is
what the scientist needs.'' Hughes reports, ``As early as 1973,
e-mail constituted three-quarters of ARPANET traffic,'' most of
them personal _ and this wasn't even intended to be a message
system.
</P>
<P>
   This book is decidedly not light entertainment. Hughes writes,
``... the ceramicist slightly varied the material composition of
the cores, seeking a combination with the magnetic characteristics,
including a square hysteresis curve, that would provide
lightning-fast magnetization and demagnetization.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's about bright, young, energetic, successful people, and
it contains a readable telling of the Big Dig, a chapter aptly
titled ``Coping With Complexity.'' The bottom line here, if that
isn't too sensitive a term for a $10.8 billion project, is that
this largest of urban transportation projects in the nation _
``messier'' than the others chronicled in the book _ was planned
and has functioned in the open, and has survived.
</P>
<P>
   As with ARPANET, there was a counterculture influence among the
Big Dig thinkers and managers _ the process was designed to appease
angry opponents and those affected by the project, while still
going forward, if at inflated cost. And perhaps _ in contrast to
SAGE _ the new Central Artery won't be obsolete on the day it
opens.

MOTOROLA PINS HOPES ON HIGH-TECH UNIT IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Motorola Inc. is best-known for its cellular phones, pagers, and
semiconductors _ businesses that have all stumbled in the past year
_ but the success of its Massachusetts-based Internet and
networking division may be one of the company's best-kept secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a painful corporate restructuring that included the loss of
15,000 Motorola jobs, or 10 percent of the company's total work
force, the Mansfield, Mass.-based Internet group has emerged as a
technology leader in the converging worlds of voice and data
communications.
</P>
<P>
   And that cutting-edge technology could very well help lead
Motorola out of its current troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola has suffered a triple whammy lately. In addition to a
worldwide slump in the demand for semiconductors, Motorola's
wireless phone and paging businesses have been hurt by tougher
competition and weak sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet &UR;  &LR; division, already a leader in networking equipment
such as frame relay access devices and cable modems, is a pioneer
in the transmission of voice, data, and video over a single
communications network.
</P>
<P>
   While this technology has important cost-saving implications for
businesses, Motorola also expects to extend it to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Through the creation of ``personal networks,'' Motorola
envisions a world where people can access the information they need
_ be it in voice or text form _ through the use of personal devices
such as cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs),
computers, and pagers, whether they're at the office, at home, or
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world of telecommunications is on the precipice of
violent change,'' said senior vice president Randy Battat, general
manager of the $600 million business.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the Internet, for instance, has not only changed
the way people get their information and their entertainment, it
has fundamentally changed the way companies do business.
Deregulation and the replacement of analog networks by digital
networks are also driving change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the changes that occurred in the computing
industry over the last couple of decades and their effect on Route
128, then the changes in telecommunications are going to make those
look like child's play.''
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing these changes on the horizon _ and the failure of an
earlier turnaround strategy _ Motorola last July overhauled its
business yet again, creating the Internet and networking group as a
critical unit within its new Communications Enterprise division.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and networking unit combines new and previously
segmented technologies under one umbrella organization headed by
Battat, a former Apple Computer Inc. executive who joined
Motorola's paging business in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The unit's presence in Mansfield dates back to Motorola's
acquisition of Codex Corp., a maker of modems for mainframe
computers, in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   As mainframes gave way to minicomputers and, ultimately, to the
era of personal desktop computers, the modem business was gradually
replaced by other types of networking equipment that allow
geographically dispersed computers to talk to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Though Motorola is now a major supplier of computer networking
equipment _ competing with giants such as Cisco Systems Inc. and
Northern Telecom Inc. _ the Schaumberg, Ill.-based company has
maintained a low profile in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks of Motorola for wireless phones, pagers, and
computer chips,'' said Erin Dunne, senior analyst at Vertical
Systems Group, a research firm in Dedham. ``But industry people
know they're a data networking access company and they do it very
well. They have a breadth of product nobody else can touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, in fact, is the leading provider of frame relay access
devices, with more than 22 percent of the $600 million market. Its
closest competitor, Cisco, has 15.5 percent, according to Vertical
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Motorola apart from its rivals, however, is its
technology that allows both voice and data to travel on the same
network, which is especially attractive to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of businesses want to save on long-distance phone bills
by riding voice on the back of data,'' said Ladan Mestchian, a
senior analyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues from all of Motorola's corporate networking products,
including routers, were nearly $500 million in 1997, Battat said.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's unit, which has about 1,600 employees, is also a
major supplier of high-speed cable modems, which are becoming
popular as cable television providers also begin offering Internet
and telephone access to consumers. Motorola sold about $100 million
worth of cable modems last year, Battat said.

DESPITE FINANCIAL STRAITS, STICK WITH RETIREMENT SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 42-year-old divorced male with an annual salary of
$44,000. After paying child support, child care, wage-garnished
attorney's fees, and taxes, my take home pay is only $423 a week.
Due to my divorce, I've recently gone through a bankruptcy
proceeding. My only remaining assets of any value are my two 401(k)
plans. I have approximately $2,000 in my present employer's plan _
I've only been on this job for six months, and I am no longer
contributing to the plan. I have $55,000 in another plan, 30
percent of which is invested in Vanguard Index 500, 40 percent in
Vanguard Primecap, and 30 percent in Vanguard Windsor. I'd like to
buy another house and could possibly qualify for a mortgage,
despite the bankruptcy, with a very large down payment and a low
selling price. I am thinking of cashing out the Vanguard holdings
to come up with the down payment. I have been relying on the
benevolence of friends for housing for the past eight months, and
I'm about ready to take the heavy tax and penalty hits just to get
started again. And I might be able to avoid some of the tax and
penalty hits just by buying a house. Any advice?
</P>
<P>
   L.D., El Cajon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I applaud your desire to get yourself back on the track
toward financial security. But I also think you're probably trying
to move too fast, and in the process you're likely to take yet
another giant step backward. As you say, you have emerged from your
divorce and the bankruptcy proceedings with little save your two
retirement accounts. A sum of $57,000 is not an overwhelming amount
for a 42-year-old to have amassed toward retirement, but it's a
whole lot better than nothing. Especially given your current
financial situation, you should hold on tenaciously to what you
have. It seems to me more critical at this point to bootstrap
yourself up into a situation in which you can resume contributions
to the 401(k) plan at work.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some math: If you were to leave that $55,000 as
invested _ and you've built a portfolio of solid funds (although I
suggest you switch from Windsor to Windsor II if you can) _ the
pool should amount to $492,486 by the time you're 65. That
calculation presumes average annual portfolio growth of 10 percent,
but no ongoing contributions. To replace such a sum over the same
period would require monthly contributions of $493 _ clearly
something you won't be able to afford for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   But let's approach this from a more pragmatic point of view: Is
your plan likely to work? I doubt it. Were you to cash out the
401(k), the odds are that you'd realize only about $35,000 after
paying the taxes and penalties. Would such a sum represent a
sufficient down payment to offset a lender's reluctance to deal
with a person who has recently emerged from bankruptcy proceedings?
Would a lender deem your weekly take- home pay sufficient to enable
you to handle not only the mortgage payments, but also insurance,
maintenance and taxes? I suspect the answer to both questions would
be no.
</P>
<P>
   And bear in mind, if you are able to find a lender who will
accept you, the odds are overwhelming the institution would quash
its reluctance to deal with you only by charging a whopping
interest rate. The chances are that if you were able to do this,
the cost would be something close to half your current take home
pay, putting you in a financial situation that would substantially
preclude any substantial effort to rebuild your retirement savings.
</P>
<P>
   But I'd rather see you stay with your retirement savings for a
different reason _ that you decide that continuing to work toward a
secure retirement is more important than jump-starting your
immediate return to financial comfort.
</P>
<P>
   For all of those reasons, I suggest you check out the rental
market. Certainly if you can find a house that you might be able to
buy in your current financial situation, you also should be able to
find a rental that will serve your purposes until you work your way
into a more solid financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently read a column you wrote dealing with the finances
of a person in a nursing home. I have an 84-year-old uncle in an
assisted living facility in Florida. He is in good health. His
present finances include $300,000 in AARP GNMA and US Treasury
fund. We will need about $1,700 from this fund to combine with his
$1,300 retirement checks, for a total of $3,000 monthly. I have
very little knowledge of stocks. Do we have a safe investment, or
should we be doing something better? What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Ellsworth, Maine
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should have no problem in getting the income stream you
need from this account.
</P>
<P>
   You would require a 6.8 percent yield from your uncle's
investment to supply that $1,700 a month with no decline in
principal. As this is written, the yield on the AARP GNMA and U.S.
Treasury fund is 5.84 percent. Is that discrepancy enough to worry
about? No. The interest rate is close enough to the required yield
that you can simply ignore the fact that the principal is slowly
eroding. For example, if the interest rate held steady and if you
simply maintained the pace of $1,700 monthly withdrawals, it would
take nearly 32 years for the account to be depleted.
</P>
<P>
   As for the fund itself, it's exactly the kind of thing for a
person in your uncle's situation.
</P>
<P>
   It typically holds about 80 percent of its assets in
government-guaranteed mortgages and the balance in long-term US
Treasury securities. It is therefore a bond fund, with no
participation in the stock market. The effect of combining Treasury
notes with GNMA holdings is that the fund's yield is usually a
little lower than that of all-GNMA funds, but it is also a bit less
risky than they are. Its 10-year record shows 7.73 percent average
annual total returns, a figure which compares to a 7.13 percent
peer average for the short-term government bond sector. But
counterbalancing that slightly lower return is less volatility in
the market. The current bellwether year for considering what
happens to a bond fund in a bad market is 1994. During that year,
AARP GNMA and U.S. Treasury lost 1.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That year the average intermediate-term bond fund _ the category
that includes most all- GNMA funds _ lost 4.15 percent. Morningstar
Mutual Funds ranks the fund above average, with average grades for
performance and below-average grades for risk. It's absolutely
appropriate for a person in your uncle's situation.

MASSACHUSETTS COMPANIES RUSH TO DO STOCK BUYBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   State Street Corp. made plans Thursday to buy back 2 million of
its own shares, a total that exceeds the entire amount of its stock
that changes hands in an average week.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's not very big news.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have been tripping over themselves to launch stock
buybacks ever since the market started to tumble. Nearly two dozen
Massachusetts companies have authorized about $860 million in stock
repurchases since the market peak on July 17, according to
Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that's been sweeping the entire stock market. There
were 283 stock repurchase plans announced nationwide last month
alone, second only to the 551 plans launched in October 1987, the
month of the stock market crash. There have already been 223 more
buybacks announced this month and September could finish with the
new record.
</P>
<P>
   Repurchase plans are usually greeted warmly on Wall Street, a
signal managers are confident in their company's business. Also,
the company becomes another buyer in the market for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But buybacks have their limits, certainly when it comes to
propping up the price of a stock that has been hammered in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buying power of the corporation purchasing its own shares
is relatively insignificant compared to the overall volume,'' said
Syl Marquardt, director of equity research at John Hancock Mutual
Funds.
</P>
<P>
   And board authorization to buy a large number of shares isn't
the same thing as actually purchasing the stock. Many repurchase
plans only buy a fraction of the authorized amount of stock and a
few end up not acquiring any shares at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some financial executives also think that their ability to wink
at investors, suggesting good times ahead by announcing buybacks,
is diluted because the strategy has become so widely adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago it had more signalling effect because it was a less
commonly used tool,'' said one executive at a company which has
launched a recent buyback. ``They really had to make a case to the
board that the fundamentals justified it. Now, it's so common.''
</P>
<P>
   But many investors still smile when one of their hard-hit
companies announces a buyback. Brooke Cobb, the Boston-based co-
manager of Neuberger &AMP; Berman's Manhattan fund, is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb pointed to a buyback announced Tuesday at Suiza Foods
Corp., a Texas dairy company and one of the stocks in his Manhattan
portfolio. Suiza's stock price had been cut in half since July, but
actually gained ground in Thursday's declining stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was a signal and it was calming to the market,''
said Cobb. ``It gave the investor some comfort and I think that's a
positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies repurchasing stock sometimes retire the shares, making
those still in circulation a bit more valuable. But many
corporations use the repurchases to buy shares that will fullfill
employee stock options and awards, sometimes at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   The plan announced by State Street Corp. Thursday was actually
the latest extension of a repurchase plan that bought its first
share four years ago. It has bought millions of shares since then
and used the securities for everything from employee options to
stock-swap acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   State Street bought 280,000 shares in the first quarter of this
year and 210,000 more in the second quarter. The announcement
Thursday suggested the company has already purchased 800,000 shares
in the third quarter, when the price of State Street stock plunged
from 70 to as low as 49 1/2. It finished Thursday at 52 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   State Street still had authorization to buy back more than 1
million shares as of Thursday. Did the latest extension suggest the
company wanted to aggressively accumulate more stock while the
price is low?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to have the flexiblity,'' said Steven Arst, a senior
vice president at State Street, who declined to comment on the
company's buyback plans.
</P>
<P>
   Marquardt at John Hancock said the spate of corporate repurchase
plans points to a strategy that has less to do with investor
hand-holding and a much closer connection to financial basics.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between interest rates and the prices of stock
make this one of the best times in the last 20 years to spend free
cash or even borrowed money on share buyback programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Low interest rates makes money cheap and lower stock prices mean
a buyer gets more value. For many companies, a buyback is the best
use of money available at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see large numbers of companies do (buybacks) it
reflects this relationship,'' he said. ``It's not as much
confidence building as it is the right financial maneuver for the
corporate officers, so I think it's a good sign,'' he said.

NAKHID A REVOLUTION SCAPEGOAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When David Nakhid joined the Revolution, he was
described as an All-Star player by coach Thomas Rongen. And in the
preseason, Nakhid demonstrated an ability to be among the team's
most influential players.
</P>
<P>
   After Rongen was replaced with the Revolution in last place in
Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference, he blamed unnamed players
for creating many of the team's problems. Under the new coach,
Walter Zenga, Nakhid was not on the traveling squad for the first
game and left on the bench for the next two, implying that he was
among those accused by Rongen.
</P>
<P>
   The benching and possible blaming of Nakhid is not a simple case
of a disenchanted individual or of someone with inferior abilities.
Nor does it seem plausible that one player could cause a team to be
unsuccessful. And if such were the case, that player surely would
have been discarded long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nakhid's situation is symptomatic of a team that had been
fractured for many weeks. Nakhid had been involved in both the
team's most impressive performances, which became rare after a
decent start, and in its worst games. The discord among the players
became apparent during a nine-game losing streak and devastating
losses to Columbus (6-1) and Los Angeles (5-1) last month.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has taken steps to remedy the situation, and the
Revolution will take a two-game winning streak into tomorrow's game
against Tampa Bay. He has inherited problems that will not be
easily solved. But for now, his ability to organize the defense and
inspire the team has been sufficient to salvage playoff chances and
provide hope for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first day here was Aug. 27, and I knew five players on the
team,'' Zenga said Thursday. ``Everyone had a chance to show what
they could do. I had no problems with anybody and I don't want to
know about the past. We have many offensive players, and
unfortunately, I can only play 11 players. We need to balance the
team. And we've won two games in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution probably could have used Nakhid, at least in a
reserve role, during a 3-2 loss to Miami in Zenga's first game Aug.
30. That defeat was likely the fatal blow to their playoff hopes _
they trail the Fusion by 6 points with three matches remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga has kept Nakhid in reserve in the last two games, 2-0
victories over the MetroStars and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone was looking for a scapegoat, and maybe they found
one,'' Nakhid said. ``But my concern is winning games and
satisfying the fans, who are the best in the league. As long as the
team wins and the fans are happy, I have no problem. I will keep
training every day and I look forward to playing.

   ``Nothing can keep me down. I'm not the first to be scapegoated
and I won't be the last.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakhid became the center of a small controversy when he
requested permission to play for the Caribbean All-Star team
against Jamaica in New York before the World Cup. He correctly
pointed out the perception of a double standard _ if a Revolution
player had been chosen to perform for a European All-Star side, he
would have been exalted by the team instead of encountering
resistance. As captain of the Trinidad and Tobago national team,
Nakhid felt obligated to participate in what became a highly
successful promotion, and he was named among the outstanding
performers in the match.
</P>
<P>
   Though Nakhid missed only one Revolution game, this incident
raised questions about the perception and treatment of Caribbean
players. They are certainly the lowest-paid group in MLS, with a
combined salary of less than $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any other place in America,'' Nakhid said. ``We are
seen as cheap labor. There is no way we will be paid as much as
Europeans, even if they don't have comparable technical skills or
production. It's something I disagree with. And if I deem a
situation unfair, I will say it is unfair, no matter the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign players are usually the first to receive the blame if a
team is failing, and that has been the case with the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Nakhid, 33, an international relations major at American
University, played for 10 seasons in Europe and the Middle East
under highly respected coaches such as Leo Beenhakker and Ottmar
Hitzfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on teams that had more diversity than this team,''
he said. ``Here we needed someone with the character and philosophy
to put the team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the (coaching) change was made, I went along with it. I
gave my opinion about the decision to fire Thomas Rongen during a
player-management meeting. I went along with the program. I had no
problem with the change. I expected a fair chance, or least an
explanation. But before the Miami game, there is no way you can
tell me that I shouldn't be playing. That had to come from a higher
authority.''

THE PLEASURES OF `GROSS INDECENCY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
GROSS INDECENCY: THE THREE TRIALS OF OSCAR WILDE 
Play in two acts by Moises Kaufman. 
Directed by Michael Bloom. Set, Robert N. Schmidt. Lighting, Nancy
Schertler. Costumes, David Murin. Produced by Huntington Theatre
Company. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He lied under oath about having an adulterous affair. He was
then hounded by hypocritical lawmakers who had done much the same
thing themselves, and a press hungry for salacious details of his
private life.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be the only person thinking about Bill Clinton while
taking in ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde.'' And
by all means you should take in ``Gross Indecency,'' not only for
its uncanny and depressing parallels to what Alan Dershowitz has
called today's sexual McCarthyism. Had we never heard the Monica
moniker, the Huntington Theatre's first-class production of Moises
Kaufman's imaginative and provocative play about the dandiest dandy
of them all would still be, well, dandy. And don't succumb to Wilde
fatigue if you saw last year's one-man show in Boston or ``The
Judas Kiss'' with Liam Neeson in New York or London. ``Gross
Indecency'' is something Wilder, and in many ways the Huntington
production is preferable to the highly acclaimed off-Broadway
original.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bloom, who directed ``The Day Room'' and ``The Writing
Game'' for the American Repertory Theatre, hasn't taken that many
liberties with the staging, in which five actors stick primarily to
the roles of Wilde; his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas; Douglas's
father, the Marquess of Queensbury, whom Wilde sued for libel; and
the lawyers for both sides. Additionally, there's a quartet of
gray-suited wags playing a variety of roles (and musical
instruments) from George Bernard Shaw to Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of the more horizontal Beardsley-like set that
Kaufman used in New York, Bloom has given the play more room to
breathe. The action is juxtaposed against set designer Robert N.
Schmidt's backdrop of two chalkboards, one of which is Wilde's
glowing prose about art and society; the other an arid,
antihomosexual legal definition of gross indecency, set next to a
large, morose picture of Victoria. By the second act, Big Brother _
or Super Sister _ will have obliterated Wilde. The scenic effect,
combined with Nancy Schertler's often eerie lighting design, is to
downplay the more carnival atmosphere of the New York production
without impinging on Kaufman's creative way of addressing the
aesthetic and political issues concerning Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Those issues come bounding onto the stage in the first act when
the Irish genius _ buoyed by his popularity in West End theaters,
his creed that twinned love of art with the love of young men _
decided to sue Douglas's father for publicly calling him a
``somdomite'' (sic). How Wilde thought he could win a libel case
without speaking the name of the love that dared not speak its name
is left a mystery here. Wilde is usually depicted rushing into the
trap at the instigation of his petulant and spoiled lover, but
Kaufman treats Douglas much more sympathetically than do most other
playwrights and biographers, particularly Richard Ellmann.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, whose play is more impressive than on first viewing,
draws on other sources. These will be cited in a mockumentary way
by the gray suits throughout the play, to show the puritanical
walls closing in on Wilde, whose free spirit is represented by the
clever ways in which Kaufman inserts his writings and bon mots
throughout the play. Unfortunately, Donald Carrier's delivery is
not equal to other aspects of the production. He doesn't have the
outsized carriage (and ego) that we have come to expect from actors
like Liam Neeson and Stephen Fry, who so brilliantly captured him
in the recent movie. The issue isn't that Carrier is too breathy or
not foppish enough, but _ worst sin of all when it comes to playing
Wilde _ that he is too bland. The rest of the cast is up to par,
except for James Waterston in a variety of roles, mostly all of
which are performed with the same adolescent whine that was more
appropriate to last season's ``Ah, Wilderness!'' Kelly Groves, on
the other hand, is a standout.
</P>
<P>
   Carrier is by no means a bad actor and his lack of charisma
doesn't really detract from the play. Wilde has much to say about
the artless prudes of any age, but given the moralism of today's
media and congressional spokesmen, this production of ``Gross
Indecency'' is unmissable.

FERRARO WANTS TO MAKE HIS POINTS WITH THE BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After a roller-coaster ride through the 1997-98 season
_ one that included getting claimed on waivers by Pittsburgh from
the New York Rangers, reclaimed by New York in midseason and
assigned to Hartford of the American Hockey League for the duration
_ former University of Maine star Peter Ferraro hopes to land
square on his skates with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old forward from Port Jefferson, N.Y., who played
for Tabor Academy in Marion and was a key in Maine's run to the
1993 NCAA title, was signed as a free agent by Boston in late July.
His stint with Hartford, during which he scored 17 goals and added
23 assists in 36 games and was part of the power-play and
penalty-killing units, has helped him prepare for one more shot at
an NHL job as a more complete player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have a good end to the season in Hartford. We had
a decent run at the Calder Cup and fell short, and after the season
was over, I was an unrestricted free agent,'' said Ferraro, the
first New York native selected in the first round of the NHL draft
(1992). ``Boston was after me pretty much the whole summer, and I
knew growing up as a hockey player it was a fun place to play. It's
a young, hardworking team, and that helped make the decision for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The former US Olympian, who bagged six goals in eight games in
Lillehammer in 1994, has never had a problem scoring goals while
climbing the hockey ladder. He had 48 three seasons ago with the
Rangers' AHL affiliate in Binghamton and 38 the next season. But
his call-ups to the Rangers were always brief: Seven games with New
York from 1994-97 produced just one assist, but it was a memorable
one _ it helped set up twin brother Chris's first NHL goal. That
was during the 1995-96 season when Ferraro, after being sent down
again, wound up setting the AHL record for power-play goals with
27.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferraro brothers played together in the USHL Junior League,
at Maine, and with the US national team (Chris was one of the last
cuts before the Olympics), Atlanta of the International League, and
Binghamton for two seasons. Both were claimed by Pittsburgh last
October, and when Peter came back to New York, it marked the first
time they had been separated in a hockey rink, counting their days
growing up on Long Island. Chris has signed with Edmonton, and,
said Peter, ``he's having a good camp. I hope we both get the
chance to play against each other up here.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong skater and stickhandler, Ferraro isn't the biggest kid
on the block (5 feet 10 inches, 185 pounds) but relies on quckness,
puckhandling, and scrappiness.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, who set an AHL record for shots on goal in a season two
years ago, began last season with the Penguins and had three goals
and seven assists in 29 games. He played one game with the Rangers,
then was sent packing to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York was a tough organization to be part of,'' he said.
``They tended to go with their older players, and speaking on
behalf of myself and my brother, we had some great numbers in the
minors. But unfortunately, we didn't get much of an opportunity at
the next level. But in Pittsburgh, we both learned a lot, even
though it was a brief stint. When we arrived there, they had pretty
much established their lines, so we kind of got worked in and out
of the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which can increase the pressure to do well, to make an
impression, when that limited ice time presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about that,'' said Ferraro. ``You always
want to make the best of minimal time. But any opportunity you have
in the National Hockey League is a positive experience, and I'm
just hoping to make it on a full-time basis.''
</P>
<P>
   At Maine, his teammates included current NHL regulars like Paul
Kariya, Garth Snow, and Mike Dunham. ``I learned a lot about the
game in college,'' said Ferraro, ``and I've also learned that
timing is everything _ and I hope I've come to Boston at the right
time. In the minor leagues, all they wanted me to do was score
goals. I learned a lot more about the other part of the game after
I got to Pittsburgh. That time really helped me.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Bruin, he said, ``all I can do is work as hard as I can, on
and off the ice. I've known the frustration of not being put in a
situation where I could prove myself in the NHL. But you have to
realize that it's never too late. Players make it when they're 27
or 28 and have made a name for themselves. You could say this is
the opportunity I've been waiting for.''

<P>
   The day that Kenneth Starr dumped his report on Congress, the
governor of Texas sat in his office, striving valiantly to keep the
conversation on his re-election race. It was a losing battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr report has wreaked havoc among Democrats, boosting
Republican prospects in the next presidential election; and, for
the moment, the favorite for the Republican nomination is the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, son of the president before Bill Clinton, has a
good chance of being the next president.
</P>
<P>
   But there is the fishing problem. ``If I was the president of
the United States,'' Bush says earnestly, ``I would not be able to
go out and buy a lure by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A little while spent with the governor is enough to demonstrate
that this is not a trivial point. Bush loves running Texas; he is
good at it; he is relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, he can saunter across the road from his mansion to
his office in the spectacular state capitol and enjoy gazing at the
collection of 200 autographed baseballs lined up on his shelves (In
his view, his investment in the Texas Rangers and the building of
their new ballpark are the two best things he has done for Texas).
</P>
<P>
   The state legislature meets for only 140 days every two years,
and the rest of the time there is no legislation to work on. So the
governor conducts a little foreign policy with Mexico, keeps his
administration ticking and gets out on the road to campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He is an accomplished roadster, and his appeal seems to grow
with the news of scandals in distant Washington. His approval
rating stands at 74 percent; his re-election to the governorship in
November seems a foregone conclusion; even the Democratic
lieutenant governor, who is a family friend of Bush's challenger,
has endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Kilgore, an east Texas town where the oil
pumps nod gently in the background, a visitor wandered through the
crowd that awaited the governor, asking people if they had
reservations about him. It was hard to elicit any criticism, aside
from one mock-serious grumble about his marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Would Bush run for president? Sure he would! Would he win? Of
course!
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrives, and one solid part of the reason for his
popularity is immediately obvious. Rather than make for the podium,
he plunges into the crowd, slapping backs and squeezing shoulders,
posing with cheerleaders, signing autographs on admirers' shirts.
</P>
<P>
   With some politicians, you can sense the gritted teeth behind
the cheesy grin on such occasions. But Bush seems to take a real
delight in mixing with the voters, and the effect is disarming.
</P>
<P>
   A gnarled and bearded man in cowboy boots reels back from the
reception line, as though recovering from a brush with royalty.
Fumbling for words, he mutters, ``I really like the man ... He has
a personality that feels real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Up on the podium, the Bush magic fades a little. He speaks
competently, and gets a laugh for his promise to abolish a tax on
diapers; he talks at length about his passion for education, and
gets a respectful hearing. He wants a tax exemption for small
businesses and a tax break for property owners: boilerplate
Republican stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes his favorite theme, personal responsibility: ``I
worry about a culture that says, 'If it feels good do it, and if
you have a problem, blame someone else.''' Criminals should know
that they will serve long sentences in prison. Absentee fathers
should know that they will be obliged to pay child support.
Teenagers should know that ``there is honor, not shame, in
abstaining from sex until you are married.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush makes up his mind to run for president -- if he commits
himself to living ``in the bubble,'' as he calls it -- this talk of
personal responsibility will be at the center of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Few subjects get him so worked up; and, given Clinton's woes,
few seem so politically opportune.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-boom generation, as Bush sees it, has stained America
with moral laxity: with a foolish tolerance for casual sex and
drugs. The challenge for baby-boomers, he continues, is to devote
their mature years to reversing this error.
</P>
<P>
   And who better to lead the change than a man who speaks boldly
from the bully pulpit? In his stump speech Bush pledges ``to
elevate the spirit of Texans.'' Perhaps, a year from now, he will
be promising to do the same for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this transition will be perilous. So long as he stays in
Texas, Bush can preach without fear of challenge: His popularity
protects him from hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   If he runs for president, this is less certain. People may ask
why teenagers should heed advice that the governor himself did not
live by: though Bush is now a teetotaller and devoted family man,
he freely concedes that his youth was not like that. He admits to
``drinking and carousing.'' He did not abstain from sex before
marriage. He may well have inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   How will Bush deal with rude attacks on his background? The
governor is utterly unfazed by this question: ``I'll tell them I
grew up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And then he launches into a speech that makes his own switch to
married responsibility seem like a metaphor for the country. ``The
question for baby-boomers is, did you learn from your mistakes? I
know how I behaved as a child; I readily concede it was childish
behavior. But, as governor, I have upheld the dignity of my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Bush wants to pose as the anti-1960s candidate, and so
succeed a president whose sexual license seems to reek of that
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans, sick of Clinton's self-indulgence, may warm to
this message. But more may conclude, as they contemplate the
smiling governor of Texas, that the sixties were not so bad after
all: that it is possible to make hay as a youngster and to become a
fine adult.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's stump speech urges sexual abstinence; the
governor's life sends a more muddled signal. Bush needs to search
harder for a message before he forsakes the laid-back rhythms of
his home state.

</P>
<P>
   Then comes his favorite theme, personal responsibility: ``I
worry about a culture that says, 'If it feels good do it, and if
you have a problem, blame someone else.''' Criminals should know
that they will serve long sentences in prison. Absentee fathers
should know that they will be obliged to pay child support.
Teenagers should know that ``there is honor, not shame, in
abstaining from sex until you are married.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush makes up his mind to run for president -- if he commits
himself to living ``in the bubble,'' as he calls it -- this talk of
personal responsibility will be at the center of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Few subjects get him so worked up; and, given Clinton's woes,
few seem so politically opportune.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-boom generation, as Bush sees it, has stained America
with moral laxity: with a foolish tolerance for casual sex and
drugs. The challenge for baby-boomers, he continues, is to devote
their mature years to reversing this error.
</P>
<P>
   And who better to lead the change than a man who speaks boldly
from the bully pulpit? In his stump speech Bush pledges ``to
elevate the spirit of Texans.'' Perhaps, a year from now, he will
be promising to do the same for all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this transition will be perilous. So long as he stays in
Texas, Bush can preach without fear of challenge: His popularity
protects him from hard questions.
</P>
<P>
   If he runs for president, this is less certain. People may ask
why teenagers should heed advice that the governor himself did not
live by: though Bush is now a teetotaller and devoted family man,
he freely concedes that his youth was not like that. He admits to
``drinking and carousing.'' He did not abstain from sex before
marriage. He may well have inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   How will Bush deal with rude attacks on his background? The
governor is utterly unfazed by this question: ``I'll tell them I
grew up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And then he launches into a speech that makes his own switch to
married responsibility seem like a metaphor for the country. ``The
question for baby-boomers is, did you learn from your mistakes? I
know how I behaved as a child; I readily concede it was childish
behavior. But, as governor, I have upheld the dignity of my
office.''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, Bush wants to pose as the anti-1960s candidate, and so
succeed a president whose sexual license seems to reek of that
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans, sick of Clinton's self-indulgence, may warm to
this message. But more may conclude, as they contemplate the
smiling governor of Texas, that the sixties were not so bad after
all: that it is possible to make hay as a youngster and to become a
fine adult.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's stump speech urges sexual abstinence; the
governor's life sends a more muddled signal. Bush needs to search
harder for a message before he forsakes the laid-back rhythms of
his home state.

A SURVIVOR'S STORY PLAYS OUT ON STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This much we know: The narrator of Paula Vogel's Pulitzer
Prize-winning drama, ``How I Learned to Drive,'' is a survivor of
child abuse. We know it from the first line of the play, when she
announces that she is going to teach us a lesson and tell us a
secret. That confidence, it turns out, concerns the seven years
that she was sexually abused by her uncle. The play becomes a
process of remembering, of sifting through the fragments of a
shady, stealthy past not only to create a cohesive narrative but
also to put mind and body back together again.
</P>
<P>
   The play, a production starring Debra Winger and Arliss Howard,
takes us on this journey of recovery without ever introducing the
trite stage device of a therapist taking notes. Vogel gives the
audience the comfort of knowing that the little girl grows up to
find safety, but she doesn't tell us how she gets there. ``I never
answer that question, and I'm not being elusive,'' Vogel says. ``I
ask the actors to fill in that story. I've always thought there
would be therapy or AA in her future. I would like to envision that
she finds other people through support networks or friendships or
religious counseling. There are also ways of working it out through
the body, like martial arts or meditation or yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other actors who have tackled the role, Winger is
approaching the play as a kind of dramatic therapy: By reliving her
memories, her character can find a way to move on. Her past comes
to life in a series of nonlinear jolts, snippets of voices and
images that do battle in her mind. And that is precisely the way
most victims of child abuse recall their experiences, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that characterizes a traumatic experience is
that people don't have a frame to put it in,'' says Judith Lewis
Herman, associate clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School and the author of the pioneering 1993 treatise,
``Trauma and Recovery.'' ``People who you thought you loved and
trusted turn out to be exploitative and manipulative, and that is a
shocker for a little kid who needs the care and affection of
adults. So yes, typically people don't have a linear, logical
chronology of what happened. They have little fragments, and they
can only focus on it a little bit at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The narrator's name, by the way, is L'il Bit. Her memories are
dwarfed, along with her self-image.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel read Herman's book about post-traumatic stress disorder
before writing the play, and director David Wheeler is using it as
a guidepost for his production at ART. The play, which experts say
is psychologically accurate, places us directly in the mind of the
victim, where notes of a certain song on the radio or the smell of
a particular aftershave can trigger visceral reactions. It's like
we're flipping through the channels of a young girl's memory bank:
We see the matriarchs of her dysfunctional family lecturing about
the perils of sex and offering absurd advice about alcohol
consumption. We see the youngsters at school and the old folks at
home, taunting and teasing a self-conscious child. And we see the
only person who seems to understand the young. That would be Peck,
the seemingly sensitive and funny uncle who is married to the
sister of L'il Bit's mother. He does the dishes. He listens. He
comforts. He gives driving lessons. He also crosses the line.
</P>
<P>
   The play offers a complex psychological portrait of Peck, who
isn't cast as a dastardly demon with a waxed mustache and an evil
snarl. Instead, there are hints that he may be suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder himself, since he is a veteran of
World War II who came home scarred in some ambiguous way. This
compassionate portrayal is not unusual, says Iris Shuey, assistant
clinical professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown
University who has seen ``Drive'' twice and plans to see it again
at ART in Cambridge. ``We'd like to have a pure villain, where you
flash the light and you can see it,'' she says. ``But that's what
makes these relationships so difficult for young women. There is a
part of the relationship that is quite honest and quite caring,
which makes for a very complicated view.'' She pauses, then adds,
``There are things that make this guy appealing, but perpetrators
do such horrible damage. You can never reclaim those years that are
lost. You can't erase what's happened. You can't become a blank
tablet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the play, L'il Bit is drawn to the twisted relationship with
her uncle, no matter how secretive, no matter how potentially
destructive. That doesn't surprise Herman, who has spent 20 years
working with trauma victims. ``Oh sure, these are human beings, you
know,'' Herman explains. ``Often, it's a relationship where the
perpetrator is paying a lot of attention to the victim, which is
something kids want and crave and need and appreciate. What's
unfortunate is that kids learn there is a price you have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   That price, of course, is the abuse itself and the scars it
etches on both the body and the mind. Some victims, like L'il Bit,
turn to alcohol to numb the pain and obliterate the memory. Often
they experience what is clinically referred to as dissociation, a
separation of the body and the mind that enables them to disconnect
from the experience. In the play, Peck observes that his niece has
a ``fire in her head'' rather than a ``fire in her belly,'' but he
fails to note that she might be healthier with a more integrated
sense of self. In ``Trauma and Recovery,'' a patient describes what
happened to her after being raped by her father: ``I unscrew my
head from my body as if it were the lid of a pickle jar. From then
on I would have two selves _ the child who knows, with guilty body
possessed by Daddy, and the child who dares not know any longer,
with innocent head attuned to Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   So how do you put those two splintered selves together again?
How does Vogel's character get from a fractured childhood to the
place where she is able to remember her story and thus remember
herself?
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Herman offers this cautionary advice: ``No one can
face trauma alone.'' She outlines steps for recovery, which include
finding a safe place, reconstructing the event and then
reconnecting with life. The process requires a grounding influence,
be it therapy, a support group, or a nurturing friend.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the arduous stuff of psychotherapy isn't always the
stuff of great drama, and Vogel leaves that stuff offstage. We're
not giving away any secrets by saying that her character displays a
wistful yearning to go back to that time before it all went wrong,
to return to a childhood that was taken away too soon. In the first
scene, she asks us to imagine a bucolic landscape ``before the
malls took over,'' a place where ``the smell of sleeping farm
animals is thick on the air'' and ``the smells of clover and hay
mix in with the smells of leather dashboard.''
</P>
<P>
   We're also not giving away too much to say that many of the
scenes in the play occur in a car, as Peck teaches his young niece
the rules of defensive driving. A disembodied offstage voice offers
pithy instructions from a driver's manual, reciting chapter
headings like ``Idling in Neutral,'' or ``Vehicle Failure,'' or
``Implied Consent.'' And this is precisely the metaphor the experts
use when they talk about recovery. ``There is a very general
roadmap I try to lay out in trauma and recover,'' Herman explains.
``Each individual finds her own way, and it's something that people
come to bit by bit, with a lot of detours and false starts.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear what path L'il Bit follows, but for experts like
Herman, the journey is essential, not just for individuals but for
society. Her pioneering work has been criticized ever since her
book was first published in 1993, and in some ways, she is
heartened that a play about the subject could receive critical and
audience acclaim as well as the Pulitzer Prize. ``The artists are
always the ones who lead the way because they really do convey the
complexity of human dilemmas,'' Herman says. ``The artists make it
possible for us to make that leap of compassion, and we in the
mental health profession follow behind and make it more systematic
... We're dealing with a situation of massive human rights
violations of sexual and domestic violence. These violations have
been condoned, accepted, rationalized, excused, and considered an
entitlement, and so it causes enormous amounts of conflict and
social disruption when people accustomed to abusing their power all
of a sudden find themselves exposed, criticized, and held to
account for something they thought was not only their right but
part of the natural order of things.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman takes a breath here, then extends the metaphor one final
time. ``There are a lot of different roads to understanding. Some
are convinced by art, some by social science, some by biological
data. But some people don't see it until it happens to someone they
care about.'' And it happens onstage in ``How I Learned to Drive.''
Yes, it happens to L'il Bit: That much we know.

MONET'S GRAND FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The glorious Monet show now at the Museum of Fine Arts
reads like the final chapters in an absorbing autobiography _ even
though there's not a single person in any of these paintings.
They're all landscapes. But so closely did Claude Monet ally
himself with the natural world, and so personal was his translation
of it onto canvas, that these pictures tell you far more about how
he felt than about how his lily pond looked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Monet in the 20th Century'' _ which opens to the public on
Sunday _ is a triumph on several counts. It deserves to break the
MFA's previous attendance record, which was set by the same curator
and same artist: Paul Hayes Tucker, organizer of ``Monet in the
'90s,'' the 1990 show that drew over 537,000 visitors. Tucker's
``Monet in the 20th Century'' is not only sequel but culmination.
</P>
<P>
   This largest-ever look at the late Monet includes some paintings
never seen in public before and others that Monet's heirs kept
hidden for decades after his death, thinking them so radical they'd
besmirch the great man's reputation. Through these works, Tucker
tells the story of an artist indelibly identified with the 19th
century and with the Impressionist movement that took its name from
one of his paintings, and how that artist not only survived through
the first quarter of the 20th century but redefined painting while
he was at it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a perfect show, but it comes close. There were loans
Tucker couldn't get because of competition from another late Monet
show now touring America. A different selection of the monumental
waterlily murals in the show's final room could have packed an even
greater emotional punch. And it's sad _ especially with this show,
which stands to be a major money-maker anyway _ that the MFA has
resorted to the shabby, if now standard, practice of a mandatory
walk at the show's exit through an auxiliary gift shop filled with
Monet tchotchkes.
</P>
<P>
   Your path through the show is tightly choreographed. It's
chronological: You start with the birth of the century and end with
the artist's death, in 1926, at age 86. Each room has a unifying
theme; the layout is blessedly lucid. The labels entertain you with
asides about the painting Monet may have traded for a car, or the
one he donated to a charity auction to aid soldiers wounded in the
First World War. And they tell you that Monet is not only Boston's
favorite painter but possibly the world's: Loans have come from all
over Western Europe and America, as well as Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But so compelling are these canvases that I'll bet even people
who would generally rather read than look will give only brief
attention to the labels and wall texts _ which are themselves brief
_ and dare to lose themselves in the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   They're ravishing. Thank goodness Tucker took a visual route
rather than a theoretical one, that he didn't do ``Monet in
Context.'' As it stands, the show is a pleasurable lesson in
looking, great training for the eye. Try to count the kinds of
brushstrokes Monet used, or the numbers of colors. You can't.
</P>
<P>
   You can track his progress, though, as he challenged himself
through travel and struggled mightily to keep his painting fresh.
His journey echoed the pyramidal structure of classical drama, with
turmoil at the peak and resolution at the end. Along the way, his
brushwork became violent, his scale, heroic; his imagery, all but
submerged in abstraction. The toughest works in this show go far
beyond the pallid ``Impressionists'' who followed Monet and persist
to the present day: They tend to imitate his earlier, sweeter
style. Look at the late pictures, though, and you think of such
sturm und drang paint-pushers as Pollock and de Kooning.
</P>
<P>
   The leap in Monet's 20th-century work is the painterly
equivalent of Debussy and Stravinsky rolled into one. To underscore
that shift, the MFA installation starts in the stateliness of the
Evans Wing _ a place of herringbone parquet floors, wainscoting,
and marble-lined doorways _ and ends in the spare white anonymity
of the Gund Gallery. You enter between two cloth banners, each
printed with part of a Japanese bridge. The large room beyond is
dominated by an outsize black-and-white photograph of the great man
himself, standing in the center of the very same bridge, wearing a
broad-brimmed hat, a gardener-monarch engulfed by vegetation: You
can almost feel the humidity.
</P>
<P>
   After this pulse-racing intro, you pass through a bare-walled
room that cleanses your eye and into another that's sparsely hung
with five paintings of the garden at Giverny. It was a subject
Monet didn't stay with long; perhaps, compared to the waterlily
pond that would soon obsess him, it was too conventional. One work
here that does point to the future is the 1902 ``Path at Giverny,''
dominated by a dramatic palette of dried-blood red and grayed-out
purple. Here is nature at her most abundant; you get the sense
there's not room for a single petal more on this canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Monet's 20th-century travels included excursions to London and
Venice. He made them look quite similar because his true subjects
weren't cities and architecture, but water and light. He traveled
to pit himself against other painters, past and present. In London,
he competed against Turner and Whistler, also masters of
atmosphere; in Venice, against La Serenissima's pantheon of
painters, Bellini to Titian to Canaletto, and also against
contemporaries including Sargent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it,'' says
Malcolm of Cawdor in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bill Clinton's case, nothing in his presidency condemns him
like his failure to leave it. He has broken his trust and disgraced
his office, but he clings on.
</P>
<P>
   Saving his skin at all costs, against the odds, has become the
theme of his political career. Each escape is notched up as a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But every time he wriggles through -- grubbier, slicker,
trailing longer festoons of contrition -- he does more damage to
his country.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week it was as if nothing had happened.
``Business as usual'' was the phrase. His wife was smiling at him
again. Cabinet members were applauding. The Dow was rallying.
</P>
<P>
   At the party fund-raisers the president attended, not a seat was
empty. Clinton spoke of the huge financial challenges facing the
world, and of America's obligation to lead it ``in a way that is
consistent with our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like this are meant to show that he is in charge, and some
will hear them that way. But there is nothing behind them. What can
``consistent with our values'' possibly mean, when the overwhelming
majority of Americans think Clinton's values have little to do with
theirs?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why Clinton is fighting. He has
everything to lose and, in his view, no good reason to lose it. The
report into his misconduct by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, has played into his hands. Its 445 pages fail to deliver a
knockout blow. There is strong evidence of perjury before a grand
jury, which is a serious crime: but in the public's mind it is just
more lies about sex, and that is deemed a forgivable sort of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest -- witness-tampering, obstruction of justice, abuse
of power-- the evidence is less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether it is a tale of the tawdry emotional difficulties of
two people, Bill and Monica, caught out in something they knew they
should stop.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has piled on the sexual details, to excess; but the
details of anyone's sex life, presented to an outside audience,
could look similarly comic and dirty. Above all, whatever happened
to Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and the rest?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton senses, correctly, that the report has caused a backlash
against Starr. The independent counsel has always been unpopular.
Now he appears both prurient and unfair. The long-term effect of
this extraordinary inquiry may well be that no future Kenneth Starr
is let loose against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to the opinion polls, most Americans are
content -- eager would be too strong a word -- that Clinton should
stay. No impeachment, no resignation; perhaps a simple vote of
censure by Congress, a mere slap on the wrist, and swiftly back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't do. Perjury before a grand jury, as exhaustively
described by Starr, is worthy of impeachment. And even if it is not
deemed impeachable, that does not mean it should be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Those in authority are rightly held to certain standards. In any
other walk of public life, Clinton's flagrant lying (to say nothing
of the sexual dalliance) would have him out on his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Is the leader of the world's most powerful country to be allowed
a lower standard of behavior just because he sits in the White
House? The reverse should be true; precisely because he sits in the
White House, the perceived exemplar and guardian of his country, he
should be prepared to leave if he cannot behave.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Starr's report are two inescapable facts.
Clinton held his office cheap, and held lies dear. There is no
reason to think this will change. Since mid-August he has
apologized so many times that, if contrition were taxed, he would
be bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But if he is so sorry, why the full-throttle legal defense
against Starr's accusations? At the famous prayer breakfast on
Sept. 11, at which he spoke of his sin and his ``broken spirit,''
the cameras caught him peeping round in the middle of his prayers,
as if to check that everyone was watching. This is a consummate
politician who knows exactly what strings, including heartstrings,
he must pull to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   That skill is the reason Americans think he should stay. That
moral bankruptcy is why he must go.
</P>
<P>
   All Clinton's considerable energies are now turned in only one
direction: his political survival. This means fighting, at full
stretch, all charges already made and still to come. And there are
certainly more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may yet have something to report on the other scandals,
including Whitewater; he is said to have found nothing impeachable,
but plenty that reinforces the pervading aura of sleaze. Meanwhile,
other sexual skeletons may continue to tumble out of closets. All
will be ridiculed, denied, resisted, rebutted, for as long as it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   America and the world at large have already suffered many months
of this. They are crying out for the president's concentrated
attention. People may not care that he is a philanderer, but they
cannot afford his distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legislative ambitions have long been consigned to the
sidelines. His foreign-policy initiatives -- attempting to revive
the Middle East's hope of peace, fighting newly-resurgent
terrorism, coping with collapsing Russia -- are in desperate need
of new commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who still respect this president, a dwindling band,
no longer have any expectations of him. He has severed the trust
and thrown away the moral suasion that make presidents effective.
He may well stay in office for another two years, but consumed with
his own image and continuously on the defensive. No country can
afford that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has a chance to do the decent thing. He has primed
Al Gore, his vice president, to carry on his New Democrat agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Now, since Clinton is no longer a credible standard-bearer
himself, he should give Gore his chance. The vice president is not
free of legal questions, but his impeccable private life makes him
the man for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would rally to him, the public would sympathize; he
would be able to lead and govern and, at least for a time, turn the
country to a fresh page.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will not happen. Clinton, the Comeback Kid, has
seen enough glints of light to persuade him to stay. This is a man
who supposes that even after congressional censure he could bounce
back grinning. Perhaps he could.
</P>
<P>
   But the spectacle has become too painful, too empty and too
wearying to contemplate. Don't bounce. Just go.

   At ESPN, Jaffe is, plain and simple, The Man, and he has the
resumes and videotaped auditions to prove it. On average, he
receives 900 job applications per year _ just for production
assistant jobs. People have followed him into bathrooms at job
fairs. Some have sent their resumes attached to baseball bats. For
every 100 of those who get interviews, only 20 make it into ESPN's
seven-month program. Maybe seven out of 10 are eventually hired
full-time. And still the resumes come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being the admissions director at Harvard,'' Jaffe
said. ``We get to choose from the best and the brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just for the entry-level positions. Jaffe receives an
additional 500 or so videotapes per year from talent. ``I could
start the Resume Channel,'' he once joked to USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe can't take credit for Chris Berman. He came with the
building. As did Bob Ley, Chris Fowler, and the late Tom Mees.
</P>
<P>
   But Keith Olbermann? Yup.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Eisen? Yup.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Scott? Yup.
</P>
<P>
   He can even take credit for NFL analyst Sterling Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Sharpe was not exactly media-friendly during
his playing days with the Green Bay Packers. When he retired,
ESPN's Andrea Kremer landed an interview with him. She was
extremely impressed, and her assessment eventually reached Jaffe.
She was right. ``Sharpe was articulate, smart, had a lot of
energy,'' Jaffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was brought to Bristol, Conn., soon after for an
audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can rememeber his interview as if it were just yesterday,''
Jaffe recalled. ``He was doing his audition and I was in the studio
booth with Bob Raschler. We both looked at each other and nodded.
He had it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'' is difficult to define. Jaffe has been defining it since
his days at Emerson College, when he did critiques of on-air talent
at a Boston radio station for the station's owner, his roommate's
father. At the time, he worked for Emerson's radio station,
WERS-FM, and also for then-CBS affiliate Channel 5. When he
graduated in 1968, the TV station hired him full-time.
</P>
<P>
   He worked on the news side as a writer and producer. He left
after a few years and became news director at a San Jose televison
station. From there, he moved on to Sacramento, where he remained
for five years before joining ESPN in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, ESPN was expanding like crazy, adding programming
and outlets such as ESPN2 and ESPN Radio. When Jaffe arrived, ESPN
had only 10 production assistants. Now it has 110.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants are judged on creative talent, knowledge of sports,
and ability to fit into the ESPN system. The interviews are
probing. ``I'll ask the general background things at first but then
test their sports knowledge by asking about their favorite team and
asking them to assess their strengths and weaknesses,'' he said.
``I want to learn about their depth of knowldge.'' So far, six
production assistants have worked their way to becoming
coordinating producers, the most senior-level producer at ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   On-air talent is different. Those applicants must write a
mini-``SportsCenter'' show _ about 13 minutes worth of material _
in three hours and then deliver it on the air. Most have come from
local television stations and are accustomed to giving three-minute
sports reports for their newscasts. Because of the volume of
material and inherent pressure of anchoring ``SportsCenter,'' a
tape sent over the transom is usally not a suitable indicator of
the applicant's ability.
</P>
<P>
   Jaffe grew up in Pittsfield and has been a Boston sports fans
for years. ``When I worked in news, I hated receiving telephone
calls at night,'' he said. ``It was usually some disaster, some
fire where people had lost their lives or endured some tragedy. But
sports is much different. I was with a guy recently whose beeper
went off while we were at dinner. He told me that a University of
Texas coach had been fired. I went, `Oh that's great.' No one lost
their life.''

<P>
   ``Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it,'' says
Malcolm of Cawdor in ``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bill Clinton's case, nothing in his presidency condemns him
like his failure to leave it. He has broken his trust and disgraced
his office, but he clings on.
</P>
<P>
   Saving his skin at all costs, against the odds, has become the
theme of his political career. Each escape is notched up as a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But every time he wriggles through -- grubbier, slicker,
trailing longer festoons of contrition -- he does more damage to
his country.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week it was as if nothing had happened.
``Business as usual'' was the phrase. His wife was smiling at him
again. Cabinet members were applauding. The Dow was rallying.
</P>
<P>
   At the party fund-raisers the president attended, not a seat was
empty. Clinton spoke of the huge financial challenges facing the
world, and of America's obligation to lead it ``in a way that is
consistent with our values.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like this are meant to show that he is in charge, and some
will hear them that way. But there is nothing behind them. What can
``consistent with our values'' possibly mean, when the overwhelming
majority of Americans think Clinton's values have little to do with
theirs?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why Clinton is fighting. He has
everything to lose and, in his view, no good reason to lose it. The
report into his misconduct by the independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr, has played into his hands. Its 445 pages fail to deliver a
knockout blow. There is strong evidence of perjury before a grand
jury, which is a serious crime: but in the public's mind it is just
more lies about sex, and that is deemed a forgivable sort of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest -- witness-tampering, obstruction of justice, abuse
of power-- the evidence is less clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether it is a tale of the tawdry emotional difficulties of
two people, Bill and Monica, caught out in something they knew they
should stop.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has piled on the sexual details, to excess; but the
details of anyone's sex life, presented to an outside audience,
could look similarly comic and dirty. Above all, whatever happened
to Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and the rest?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton senses, correctly, that the report has caused a backlash
against Starr. The independent counsel has always been unpopular.
Now he appears both prurient and unfair. The long-term effect of
this extraordinary inquiry may well be that no future Kenneth Starr
is let loose against a sitting president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to the opinion polls, most Americans are
content -- eager would be too strong a word -- that Clinton should
stay. No impeachment, no resignation; perhaps a simple vote of
censure by Congress, a mere slap on the wrist, and swiftly back to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't do. Perjury before a grand jury, as exhaustively
described by Starr, is worthy of impeachment. And even if it is not
deemed impeachable, that does not mean it should be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Those in authority are rightly held to certain standards. In any
other walk of public life, Clinton's flagrant lying (to say nothing
of the sexual dalliance) would have him out on his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Is the leader of the world's most powerful country to be allowed
a lower standard of behavior just because he sits in the White
House? The reverse should be true; precisely because he sits in the
White House, the perceived exemplar and guardian of his country, he
should be prepared to leave if he cannot behave.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of Starr's report are two inescapable facts.
Clinton held his office cheap, and held lies dear. There is no
reason to think this will change. Since mid-August he has
apologized so many times that, if contrition were taxed, he would
be bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   But if he is so sorry, why the full-throttle legal defense
against Starr's accusations? At the famous prayer breakfast on
Sept. 11, at which he spoke of his sin and his ``broken spirit,''
the cameras caught him peeping round in the middle of his prayers,
as if to check that everyone was watching. This is a consummate
politician who knows exactly what strings, including heartstrings,
he must pull to stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   That skill is the reason Americans think he should stay. That
moral bankruptcy is why he must go.
</P>
<P>
   All Clinton's considerable energies are now turned in only one
direction: his political survival. This means fighting, at full
stretch, all charges already made and still to come. And there are
certainly more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may yet have something to report on the other scandals,
including Whitewater; he is said to have found nothing impeachable,
but plenty that reinforces the pervading aura of sleaze. Meanwhile,
other sexual skeletons may continue to tumble out of closets. All
will be ridiculed, denied, resisted, rebutted, for as long as it
takes.
</P>
<P>
   America and the world at large have already suffered many months
of this. They are crying out for the president's concentrated
attention. People may not care that he is a philanderer, but they
cannot afford his distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's legislative ambitions have long been consigned to the
sidelines. His foreign-policy initiatives -- attempting to revive
the Middle East's hope of peace, fighting newly-resurgent
terrorism, coping with collapsing Russia -- are in desperate need
of new commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who still respect this president, a dwindling band,
no longer have any expectations of him. He has severed the trust
and thrown away the moral suasion that make presidents effective.
He may well stay in office for another two years, but consumed with
his own image and continuously on the defensive. No country can
afford that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has a chance to do the decent thing. He has primed
Al Gore, his vice president, to carry on his New Democrat agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Now, since Clinton is no longer a credible standard-bearer
himself, he should give Gore his chance. The vice president is not
free of legal questions, but his impeccable private life makes him
the man for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would rally to him, the public would sympathize; he
would be able to lead and govern and, at least for a time, turn the
country to a fresh page.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it will not happen. Clinton, the Comeback Kid, has
seen enough glints of light to persuade him to stay. This is a man
who supposes that even after congressional censure he could bounce
back grinning. Perhaps he could.
</P>
<P>
   But the spectacle has become too painful, too empty and too
wearying to contemplate. Don't bounce. Just go.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- America is a model of political continuity: its
constitution has been in force for longer than any other written
constitution in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the history of American government is marked by
turning-points, times when the constitution's workings have shifted
in big ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War of 1861-65 strengthened the federal government at
the expense of the states; the New Deal strengthened the presidency
at the expense of the judiciary and Congress; Watergate weakened
the presidency again.
</P>
<P>
   For all its tawdry pathos, the crisis now engulfing Bill Clinton
may mark some kind of watershed. It may turn out to be, as Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan has proclaimed it, ``a crisis in the
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, how will the regime change? At first sight, the answer is
that the power of the presidency will be diminished, and therefore
that the prestige of rival branches of government will rise.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the previous big presidential scandal, Congress
passed a number of measures to limit presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened after the impeachment of Andrew
Johnson in 1868. Congress entered a period of successful
self-assertion, even claiming the right to veto the president's
dismissal of members of his own cabinet (which had been the ground
for Johnson's impeachment); and the next eight occupants of the
White House, spanning the period until the inauguration in 1901 of
the feisty Teddy Roosevelt, made little impression on the land.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, a repeat of this pattern seems likely, though for
reasons subtly different from those that mattered in the past. In
the late 19th century, the party barons who dominated Congress also
dominated the smoke-filled rooms in which presidential nominees
were selected, and so the run of weak characters in the White House
was no coincidence. In these days of primary elections, however,
there is no mechanism to ensure their weakness.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the favorites to succeed Clinton are more
competent than inspiring: on the Democratic side, the front-runner
remains the vice-president, Al Gore, though he has been weakened by
a campaign-finance scandal; on the Republican side, the line-up is
led by Governor George Bush of Texas, son and namesake of the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   But these are early days, and some powerful new figure may yet
emerge to join the fray.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the presidency was weakened because Congress
asserted itself. A repeat of this seems more likely than a run of
weak characters in the White House. Impeachment, or even just talk
of it, has a way of making Congress remember its constitutional
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past fortnight or so, Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat
who greatly added to the tide of opinion now running against
Clinton, has reminded the country of the moral force of a speech
delivered from the Senate floor. The House, now charged with
assessing Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's wrongdoings, may find
that this exercise brings back a lost sense of its importance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, a humbled president has been grovelling to
Congress for forgiveness; and congressmen have savored the gravity
of their responsibility, entrusted to them by the country's
founders, for deciding the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton's disgrace may lead to Republican gains in
November's mid-term elections. The party stands to pick up half a
dozen seats in the House, adding a margin of comfort to its present
21-vote majority. It will probably also do well in the Senate,
where it currently holds 55 seats out of 100; it may even gain the
five seats it needs to secure a filibuster-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by these gains, Republican leaders may be able to
spend less time worrying about party feuds that threaten their grip
on Congress, and more time on policy. This, along with the talk of
impeachment, may restore to Congress some of the initiative usually
held by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOURNALISTS GO TO WORK
</P>
<P>
   As well as the threat of an assertive Congress, the presidency
faces the challenge of an increasingly intrusive press. This is, to
a large extent, the creation of Watergate. Until that scandal,
press assaults on presidents were muted. Top journalists were often
friends of the president and his entourage, and did not want to
jeopardize this access: they knew of John Kennedy's affairs and
Lyndon Johnson's tantrums, but they kept the public in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   During Watergate, when the Washington Post published a series of
scoops discrediting Nixon, the newspaper was widely criticized. But
the scoops proved accurate, and Hollywood made heroes out of the
Post's reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the status of journalists, and their appetite for
felling presidents, swelled mightily. They were not only prepared
to publish embarrassing facts about public figures; they were
prepared to seek out such facts, including personal ones. In 1987
another Washington Post journalist demanded to know, in the middle
of a press conference, whether Gary Hart had committed adultery;
Hart's presidential candidacy was soon at an end.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lewinsky scandal, ``gotcha journalism'' has gone
electronic. A profusion of cable television stations have served up
relays of pundits who attack the president with all the force of
Bernstein and Woodward, but often with less research. The pressure
to be first on air with the news, or first on the Internet with it,
drives the attack onward. Matt Drudge, who runs an Internet tip
sheet, has, unlike the heroes of Watergate, no ``deep throat''
source inside the White House. He merely retails political gossip.
</P>
<P>
   But, because many of the salacious rumors about Clinton have now
been substantiated, the Drudge style of journalism has acquired
some respectability, much as Watergate made deep-throat journalism
acceptable. As a result of the Lewinsky scandal, the journalists'
assault on future presidents may conceivably be fiercer than any
America has yet seen.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Watergate and to Johnson's impeachment, however,
the biggest threat to the power of the presidency now comes from
the judicial branch. During the Watergate business, Nixon was able
to fire his prosecutor, Archibald Cox, at the cost of making
himself even more unpopular. This time, Clinton's accuser is
protected by the independent-counsel statute, passed in 1978 by
Congress as part of its post-Watergate efforts to constrain the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING STARRS
</P>
<P>
   Since that law was passed, a score of independent prosecutors
have been appointed to investigate presidents and cabinet
officials: seven under Ronald Reagan, four during George Bush's
single term in office, seven so far under Clinton, with the
imminent possibility of two more.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the appointment of all these prosecutors has created a
kind of ratchet effect. Each time one of them asserts his authority
by new legal expedients, he creates a precedent that may be
followed by whoever is appointed next.
</P>
<P>
   As he has delved into the Lewinsky scandal, Starr has done more
than any other independent prosecutor to tighten this ratchet. He
has insisted on the right to interrogate presidential advisers
under oath, considerably narrowing the president's zone of privacy.
In May, Starr won a court case securing the right to question
Sidney Blumenthal, a White House strategist, defeating White House
arguments that Blumenthal should be protected from Starr's
subpoenas because of ``executive privilege'' (meaning, in this
case, the president's right to have confidential conversations with
close aides).
</P>
<P>
   Next, Starr won a case in which he claimed the right to question
the president's legal advisers. The White House retorted that these
should be immune from Starr's subpoena because of ``attorney-client
privilege,'' which protects ordinary lawyers from being made to
testify against their clients; but the courts decided this
privilege did not apply to White House lawyers, who are on the
public payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And then Starr sought and won the right to interrogate the
Secret Service agents who guard the president from assassins.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of this may well outlast Clinton. Even the most
upstanding of chief executives is sometimes tempted by policies
whose legality is murky; he wants to ask advisers whether a given
course of action would survive a court challenge. In future, he may
hesitate, knowing that such consultations may be used against him
by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   David Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago,
goes so far as to suggest that White House aides may be reduced to
writing anonymous memos with no subject or date on the top; and
that ``anybody who takes notes during a meeting ought to have his
head examined.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of legal jeopardy (while often salutary) may also
reduce the efficiency of the White House, leaving it less well
equipped to outmanoeuvre political rivals in Congress and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAULA JONES EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   On top of these precedents, the Lewinsky scandal has weakened
the presidency by demonstrating its vulnerability to private
lawsuits. The scandal came to light because of a sexual-harassment
suit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones. The judge in this case
eventually dismissed the suit. But the political consequences of
the Jones suit, from the point of view of Clinton's enemies, turned
out to be boundless. It gave Mrs. Jones's legal team power to
compel testimony from other women about their relations with the
president: and one of these women was Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting damage to Clinton has been so spectacular that
future enemies of future presidents will doubtless do their utmost
to file suits against them too.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the more likely because, last year, the Supreme
Court affirmed the legitimacy of such suits. Fearing the political
distractions arising from the Jones suit, the White House argued
that it should be delayed until the president left office. But the
Supreme Court ruled that the Jones case should proceed immediately,
setting a precedent that clears the way for more such suits in
future.
</P>
<P>
   And the effectiveness of civil suits is greatly enhanced by the
existence of the independent counsel. Once a civil suit uncovers
the first signs of presidential wrongdoing, the heavy work of
following through with the investigation can be passed on to the
special prosecutor, armed with awesome powers to compel testimony
from the top man's friends.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be surprising, or even necessarily worrying, if the
presidency did indeed emerge weakened from the Lewinsky scandal.
The power of the office has waxed and waned since its founding.
</P>
<P>
   Wars and economic crises have expanded the appetite for firm
leadership. The Civil War created the circumstances for Lincoln's
strong presidency; the dislocation wrought by mass immigration and
rapid industrialization ushered in Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson; the Depression brought Franklin Roosevelt; the turmoil of
Vietnam and civil rights brought Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the appetite for a strong presidency has never become
permanent. After Lincoln, Congress reasserted itself by impeaching
Andrew Johnson. After Roosevelt and Wilson came Harding and
Coolidge and Hoover, forgettable figures every one.
</P>
<P>
   These cycles have done as much as scandals to affect the power
of the presidency. In the 1970s, it was not just the Watergate
burglary that ushered in a period of new constraints on the White
House. It was a feeling that the presidency had grown too imperial
anyway, and that it was time to rein it in. The independent-counsel
law was a direct response to Nixon's dismissal of his Watergate
prosecutor. But the passage of the War Powers Act, asserting that
Congress must approve a president's military adventures, was a
response to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, if the presidency is now weakened for a time, it will
be for reasons that reach beyond Clinton's sex life. In times of
peace and relative prosperity, Americans often profess indifference
toward presidential leadership. Journalists assail public figures
because they believe the public wants to know their dark secrets;
courts support Starr's penetration of presidential privacy because,
indirectly, they too reflect the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of crisis, both media and judiciary might behave
differently. During World War II, for example, the courts upheld
Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans, even though this was
later regarded as an egregious violation of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   It can even be argued that, in time of crisis, the Supreme
Court, sensitive to the danger of weakening the executive, might
have sided with the White House in the Paula Jones case, requiring
that her suit be shelved until the end of Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the court's decision, and despite the media
assault on the presidency, it is not clear that America really is
in a period of indifference to executive power. The Lewinsky
scandal may come to be seen, a few years from now, as a special
case. The extension of post-Watergate checks on the presidency --
new powers for the independent counsel, and journalism's new
electronic reach -- may produce a backlash, and a demand to limit
the activities of prosecutors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   TIDES DO TURN
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, if you look at the opinion polls, feel queasy
about the inquisitorial culture that unearthed the Lewinsky
scandal. They do not want their president to be above the law. But
they are conscious that few ordinary citizens would be subjected to
$40 million-worth of hostile scrutiny from an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   They feel dismay at the president's conduct, and at his efforts
to conceal it. But, until now at least, they do not agree with
Starr that these constitute grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week or so, the mood may swing against the
president, vindicating the labors of his inquisitors. But, if it
does not, the drive to curb future inquisitions may take several
forms.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's Paula Jones verdict could, in theory, be
overturned by act of Congress: the court's contention that the suit
could go ahead without distracting the president from the tasks of
government has proved manifestly false.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, the lower-court rulings requiring White House lawyers
and Secret Service agents to testify before Starr might be
overturned, either in Congress or on appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the likeliest kind of anti-inquisitorial backlash concerns
the independent counsel himself.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizing the appointment of independent counsels
expires next year, and the betting is that it will not be renewed
in its current form. Republicans have long disliked the law,
regarding it as an excessive check on the presidency; thanks to
Starr, Democrats too have come to dislike it.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides complain that independent counsels are appointed too
frequently and that, once appointed, they can expand their
investigations too easily -- as Starr did, ranging from obscure
Arkansas land deals to Oval Office sex.
</P>
<P>
   This has been so widely criticized that future presidential
prosecutors are likely to find their responsibilities more narrowly
delineated. They may be told to investigate a particular
allegation, rather than to embark on a general search for
information embarrassing to their target; their time and budget may
be limited.
</P>
<P>
   By defanging the main judicial challenge to the presidency, this
would make America's executive stronger than it was before the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It may even be possible, to some degree, to defang ``gotcha''
journalism. For all its competitive aggression, the press is
capable of restraint if it thinks the public (or even the White
House) demands it: there has been almost no coverage, for example,
of how the unfortunate Chelsea Clinton is handling her father's
behavior. And almost any journalist is sensitive to the possibility
that too much cynicism may cause him to lose touch with his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even if invasive journalism proves enduring -- and, given the
competitive pressure exerted by cable television and the Internet,
it may well do -- its impact on presidential power may wane.
Americans may continue to watch talk shows that air embarrassing
personal facts about their presidents; but they may be decreasingly
moved by them.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the Lewinsky scandal, journalists have
assailed the president, but their audiences have been reluctant to
pass judgment on him. It may turn out that the post-Watergate drive
to expose the truth about public figures has, after the first brave
hope that this would produce better leaders, simply deepened the
voters' tolerance of imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the Lewinsky scandal may indeed mark a watershed in
American politics, but not the one that seems most obvious now.
Rather than weakening the presidency, it may represent a softening
of the standards by which presidents are judged. Rather than
extending Watergate's inquisitorial culture, it may represent the
end of the idealism on which that culture was based.
</P>
<P>
   After Nixon's fall, Americans hoped that a vigilant press and a
determined prosecutor could prevent presidential wrongdoing, and
thereby ensure that the country would be blessed with virtuous
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no amount of vigilance and prosecutorial energy is
able to cleanse politics, and even Americans may give up hoping
that it can.

LEXUS LS400 _ NEARLY PERFECT, CAN'T QUITE FIND ITS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, September 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lexus LS400 is a luxury car that is boringly close to perfect
and quietly becoming the stuff of legend. In a world where the
words ``automobile'' and ``grief'' are virtually synonymous, Lexus,
the luxury arm of Toyota, has concentrated so diligently on
details, quality control, and customer service that the occasional
glitch in the flagship car is frequently remembered with pleasure _
when is the last time you enjoyed a visit to the service
department?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the pampering and peace of mind that come in the
Lexus LS400 wrapper have a price _ a steep price: $52,900 plus $495
delivery for a roomy four-door very well equipped. The flasgship
comes with virtually all the bells and whistles, everything from A
to W.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all. There is a short list of extras _ the XYZ, you
might say _ with some very lo-o-o-ong prices. The in-dash compact
disc changer, located just above the glove box, is another $1,050.
High-intensity discharge headlights are $500, and the lowly mats to
cover the fancy carpet, should you desire them, are $112 for the
floor, $65 for the trunk. But wait, there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Lexus find its own way home with the $2,250 navigation
system, and, while you're cruising there, listen to the $2,250
Nakamichi premium audio system while your passenger gazes through
the open $1,120 tilt/slide power moonroof. Heat the seats for $420;
splurge for the wood/leather steering wheel and shifter knob for
$330. The air-suspension system is $2,970, but it includes the
moonroof _ but you have to buy either that fancy radio or the
navigation system to get it. Lastly, put the whole shebang on fancy
chrome wheels for only $1,700 and protect them with the $48 wheel
locks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with everything, we're up to around $62,000 _ that base
price is beginning to look like an admission fee. The tested model
came with the navigation system and a respectable portion of the
rest of the list for a delivered price of $58,790 _ obviously, not
a car for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The LS400 is a car of comfort in the extreme, a car that appears
to pamper. Enter, sit, place the key in the ignition and the blank
void that is the instrument cluster suddenly lights up and the
steering wheel, recessed out of the way for ease of entry, now
glides closer for easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   The drivetrain is a 32-valve V-8 coupled with a 5-speed
automatic transmission, very smooth and sufficiently potent. The
transmission offers three modes for travel: economy, obviously for
the best fuel economy; snow, for those nasty winter days when
takeoff traction is problematical; power, which adjusts shift
points upward to allow maximum acceleration _ the columnist's
choice. In the economy mode, the LS400 is lively enough, but it is
so smooth, so quiet, as to be a bore. In the power mode, the car is
brighter, the driving more spirited, more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is very good. This is not a sports car for bending
around sharp corners, but this luxury boat is supple enough,
precise enough to be some fun on the country roads and nimble in
city traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Radio controls are convenient enough, and the air
conditioning/heater controls are very good; the Lexus maintained
fairly even temperatures within, despite some extreme changes
without. Interior room is generous, trunk space looks generous _
but, alas, would not accommodate boxed computer and VDT; one box
went into the back seat. The trunk is deep front to rear but
shallow top to bottom. And that was not the only imperfection in
this almost flawless car.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whoever programmed the navigation system has an excellent feel
for computers and a lousy sense of geography.
</P>
<P>
   First test: We want to go from the Globe parking lot to a
specific address in Lowell, about 30 mils from Boston, by the
shortest route. Lowell for the uninitiated, can be one tough town
to navigate, but I do know where I'm going and how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus navigator, however, isn't going my way. It knows some
short cuts _ shorter in distance, to be sure, but longer in time
most days because it eliminates a lot of interstate. Tonight it's
not such a problem _ in fact, thanks to the mindless little
calculator, I miss a traffic upset on Interstate 495. In Lowell,
directions become less clear; displays and the directions offered
up by the disembodied computer voice do not match what I'm looking
at. It is telling me to go through a traffic circle, but I'm not at
a circle, and the only thing resembling a circle is a block or two
to the left. I guess wrong; the computer goes into the ``disgust''
mode and begins recalculating.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it has recalculated, I've already made another
unprogrammed move, forcing still another recalculation. We set off
again, the microprocessor and I, and once more the maze of streets
before me does not match the computer imagery. I move into the
wrong street, reverse, turn, and enter the correct street. The
satellite-guided navigator now has an electronic headache. I wait
while it takes an electronic aspirin and recalculates.
</P>
<P>
   Underway once more, I am guided to my destination from the
opposite direction of my ususal approach, but the navigator puts me
right on the doorstep. Great!
</P>
<P>
   Business accomplished, I now solicit a route to Rochester, N.H.
The computer directs me to choose from among Rochester, N.Y. ,
Rochester, Minn., or Rochester, Mich. _ it knows no Rochester, N.H.
We argue; it wins. Above Portsmouth is Terra Incognita.
</P>
<P>
   This must be how those early navigators felt with their lousy
maps long on imagined dangers and short on geographical
information. Unlike them, however, I did know where I was going.
For a tourist figuring to explore New England, however, it could
pose a problem _ there is more to New England than Boston, Lowell,
and Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   The LS400, for all its pomp and power to romp, is still easy on
the fuel budget; EPA-rated 19 miles per gallon city, 25 highway,
the tested model delivered 21.63 miles per gallon overall in 900
miles of spirited driving over a variety of terrain. It's a lot of
car, but it's a lot of money.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- America is a model of political continuity: its
constitution has been in force for longer than any other written
constitution in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the history of American government is marked by
turning-points, times when the constitution's workings have shifted
in big ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War of 1861-65 strengthened the federal government at
the expense of the states; the New Deal strengthened the presidency
at the expense of the judiciary and Congress; Watergate weakened
the presidency again.
</P>
<P>
   For all its tawdry pathos, the crisis now engulfing Bill Clinton
may mark some kind of watershed. It may turn out to be, as Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan has proclaimed it, ``a crisis in the
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, how will the regime change? At first sight, the answer is
that the power of the presidency will be diminished, and therefore
that the prestige of rival branches of government will rise.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the previous big presidential scandal, Congress
passed a number of measures to limit presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened after the impeachment of Andrew
Johnson in 1868. Congress entered a period of successful
self-assertion, even claiming the right to veto the president's
dismissal of members of his own cabinet (which had been the ground
for Johnson's impeachment); and the next eight occupants of the
White House, spanning the period until the inauguration in 1901 of
the feisty Teddy Roosevelt, made little impression on the land.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, a repeat of this pattern seems likely, though for
reasons subtly different from those that mattered in the past. In
the late 19th century, the party barons who dominated Congress also
dominated the smoke-filled rooms in which presidential nominees
were selected, and so the run of weak characters in the White House
was no coincidence. In these days of primary elections, however,
there is no mechanism to ensure their weakness.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, the favorites to succeed Clinton are more
competent than inspiring: on the Democratic side, the front-runner
remains the vice-president, Al Gore, though he has been weakened by
a campaign-finance scandal; on the Republican side, the line-up is
led by Governor George Bush of Texas, son and namesake of the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   But these are early days, and some powerful new figure may yet
emerge to join the fray.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the presidency was weakened because Congress
asserted itself. A repeat of this seems more likely than a run of
weak characters in the White House. Impeachment, or even just talk
of it, has a way of making Congress remember its constitutional
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past fortnight or so, Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Democrat
who greatly added to the tide of opinion now running against
Clinton, has reminded the country of the moral force of a speech
delivered from the Senate floor. The House, now charged with
assessing Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's wrongdoings, may find
that this exercise brings back a lost sense of its importance.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, a humbled president has been grovelling to
Congress for forgiveness; and congressmen have savored the gravity
of their responsibility, entrusted to them by the country's
founders, for deciding the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton's disgrace may lead to Republican gains in
November's mid-term elections. The party stands to pick up half a
dozen seats in the House, adding a margin of comfort to its present
21-vote majority. It will probably also do well in the Senate,
where it currently holds 55 seats out of 100; it may even gain the
five seats it needs to secure a filibuster-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   Fortified by these gains, Republican leaders may be able to
spend less time worrying about party feuds that threaten their grip
on Congress, and more time on policy. This, along with the talk of
impeachment, may restore to Congress some of the initiative usually
held by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   THE JOURNALISTS GO TO WORK
</P>
<P>
   As well as the threat of an assertive Congress, the presidency
faces the challenge of an increasingly intrusive press. This is, to
a large extent, the creation of Watergate. Until that scandal,
press assaults on presidents were muted. Top journalists were often
friends of the president and his entourage, and did not want to
jeopardize this access: they knew of John Kennedy's affairs and
Lyndon Johnson's tantrums, but they kept the public in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   During Watergate, when the Washington Post published a series of
scoops discrediting Nixon, the newspaper was widely criticized. But
the scoops proved accurate, and Hollywood made heroes out of the
Post's reporters, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the status of journalists, and their appetite for
felling presidents, swelled mightily. They were not only prepared
to publish embarrassing facts about public figures; they were
prepared to seek out such facts, including personal ones. In 1987
another Washington Post journalist demanded to know, in the middle
of a press conference, whether Gary Hart had committed adultery;
Hart's presidential candidacy was soon at an end.
</P>
<P>
   With the Lewinsky scandal, ``gotcha journalism'' has gone
electronic. A profusion of cable television stations have served up
relays of pundits who attack the president with all the force of
Bernstein and Woodward, but often with less research. The pressure
to be first on air with the news, or first on the Internet with it,
drives the attack onward. Matt Drudge, who runs an Internet tip
sheet, has, unlike the heroes of Watergate, no ``deep throat''
source inside the White House. He merely retails political gossip.
</P>
<P>
   But, because many of the salacious rumors about Clinton have now
been substantiated, the Drudge style of journalism has acquired
some respectability, much as Watergate made deep-throat journalism
acceptable. As a result of the Lewinsky scandal, the journalists'
assault on future presidents may conceivably be fiercer than any
America has yet seen.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Watergate and to Johnson's impeachment, however,
the biggest threat to the power of the presidency now comes from
the judicial branch. During the Watergate business, Nixon was able
to fire his prosecutor, Archibald Cox, at the cost of making
himself even more unpopular. This time, Clinton's accuser is
protected by the independent-counsel statute, passed in 1978 by
Congress as part of its post-Watergate efforts to constrain the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING STARRS
</P>
<P>
   Since that law was passed, a score of independent prosecutors
have been appointed to investigate presidents and cabinet
officials: seven under Ronald Reagan, four during George Bush's
single term in office, seven so far under Clinton, with the
imminent possibility of two more.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the appointment of all these prosecutors has created a
kind of ratchet effect. Each time one of them asserts his authority
by new legal expedients, he creates a precedent that may be
followed by whoever is appointed next.
</P>
<P>
   As he has delved into the Lewinsky scandal, Starr has done more
than any other independent prosecutor to tighten this ratchet. He
has insisted on the right to interrogate presidential advisers
under oath, considerably narrowing the president's zone of privacy.
In May, Starr won a court case securing the right to question
Sidney Blumenthal, a White House strategist, defeating White House
arguments that Blumenthal should be protected from Starr's
subpoenas because of ``executive privilege'' (meaning, in this
case, the president's right to have confidential conversations with
close aides).
</P>
<P>
   Next, Starr won a case in which he claimed the right to question
the president's legal advisers. The White House retorted that these
should be immune from Starr's subpoena because of ``attorney-client
privilege,'' which protects ordinary lawyers from being made to
testify against their clients; but the courts decided this
privilege did not apply to White House lawyers, who are on the
public payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And then Starr sought and won the right to interrogate the
Secret Service agents who guard the president from assassins.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of this may well outlast Clinton. Even the most
upstanding of chief executives is sometimes tempted by policies
whose legality is murky; he wants to ask advisers whether a given
course of action would survive a court challenge. In future, he may
hesitate, knowing that such consultations may be used against him
by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   David Strauss, a law professor at the University of Chicago,
goes so far as to suggest that White House aides may be reduced to
writing anonymous memos with no subject or date on the top; and
that ``anybody who takes notes during a meeting ought to have his
head examined.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of legal jeopardy (while often salutary) may also
reduce the efficiency of the White House, leaving it less well
equipped to outmanoeuvre political rivals in Congress and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAULA JONES EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   On top of these precedents, the Lewinsky scandal has weakened
the presidency by demonstrating its vulnerability to private
lawsuits. The scandal came to light because of a sexual-harassment
suit filed against Clinton by Paula Jones. The judge in this case
eventually dismissed the suit. But the political consequences of
the Jones suit, from the point of view of Clinton's enemies, turned
out to be boundless. It gave Mrs. Jones's legal team power to
compel testimony from other women about their relations with the
president: and one of these women was Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting damage to Clinton has been so spectacular that
future enemies of future presidents will doubtless do their utmost
to file suits against them too.
</P>
<P>
   This is all the more likely because, last year, the Supreme
Court affirmed the legitimacy of such suits. Fearing the political
distractions arising from the Jones suit, the White House argued
that it should be delayed until the president left office. But the
Supreme Court ruled that the Jones case should proceed immediately,
setting a precedent that clears the way for more such suits in
future.
</P>
<P>
   And the effectiveness of civil suits is greatly enhanced by the
existence of the independent counsel. Once a civil suit uncovers
the first signs of presidential wrongdoing, the heavy work of
following through with the investigation can be passed on to the
special prosecutor, armed with awesome powers to compel testimony
from the top man's friends.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be surprising, or even necessarily worrying, if the
presidency did indeed emerge weakened from the Lewinsky scandal.
The power of the office has waxed and waned since its founding.
</P>
<P>
   Wars and economic crises have expanded the appetite for firm
leadership. The Civil War created the circumstances for Lincoln's
strong presidency; the dislocation wrought by mass immigration and
rapid industrialization ushered in Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson; the Depression brought Franklin Roosevelt; the turmoil of
Vietnam and civil rights brought Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the appetite for a strong presidency has never become
permanent. After Lincoln, Congress reasserted itself by impeaching
Andrew Johnson. After Roosevelt and Wilson came Harding and
Coolidge and Hoover, forgettable figures every one.
</P>
<P>
   These cycles have done as much as scandals to affect the power
of the presidency. In the 1970s, it was not just the Watergate
burglary that ushered in a period of new constraints on the White
House. It was a feeling that the presidency had grown too imperial
anyway, and that it was time to rein it in. The independent-counsel
law was a direct response to Nixon's dismissal of his Watergate
prosecutor. But the passage of the War Powers Act, asserting that
Congress must approve a president's military adventures, was a
response to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, if the presidency is now weakened for a time, it will
be for reasons that reach beyond Clinton's sex life. In times of
peace and relative prosperity, Americans often profess indifference
toward presidential leadership. Journalists assail public figures
because they believe the public wants to know their dark secrets;
courts support Starr's penetration of presidential privacy because,
indirectly, they too reflect the national mood.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of crisis, both media and judiciary might behave
differently. During World War II, for example, the courts upheld
Roosevelt's internment of Japanese-Americans, even though this was
later regarded as an egregious violation of civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   It can even be argued that, in time of crisis, the Supreme
Court, sensitive to the danger of weakening the executive, might
have sided with the White House in the Paula Jones case, requiring
that her suit be shelved until the end of Clinton's term.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite the court's decision, and despite the media
assault on the presidency, it is not clear that America really is
in a period of indifference to executive power. The Lewinsky
scandal may come to be seen, a few years from now, as a special
case. The extension of post-Watergate checks on the presidency --
new powers for the independent counsel, and journalism's new
electronic reach -- may produce a backlash, and a demand to limit
the activities of prosecutors and journalists.
</P>
<P>
   TIDES DO TURN
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans, if you look at the opinion polls, feel queasy
about the inquisitorial culture that unearthed the Lewinsky
scandal. They do not want their president to be above the law. But
they are conscious that few ordinary citizens would be subjected to
$40 million-worth of hostile scrutiny from an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   They feel dismay at the president's conduct, and at his efforts
to conceal it. But, until now at least, they do not agree with
Starr that these constitute grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next week or so, the mood may swing against the
president, vindicating the labors of his inquisitors. But, if it
does not, the drive to curb future inquisitions may take several
forms.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's Paula Jones verdict could, in theory, be
overturned by act of Congress: the court's contention that the suit
could go ahead without distracting the president from the tasks of
government has proved manifestly false.
</P>
<P>
   Equally, the lower-court rulings requiring White House lawyers
and Secret Service agents to testify before Starr might be
overturned, either in Congress or on appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the likeliest kind of anti-inquisitorial backlash concerns
the independent counsel himself.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizing the appointment of independent counsels
expires next year, and the betting is that it will not be renewed
in its current form. Republicans have long disliked the law,
regarding it as an excessive check on the presidency; thanks to
Starr, Democrats too have come to dislike it.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides complain that independent counsels are appointed too
frequently and that, once appointed, they can expand their
investigations too easily -- as Starr did, ranging from obscure
Arkansas land deals to Oval Office sex.
</P>
<P>
   This has been so widely criticized that future presidential
prosecutors are likely to find their responsibilities more narrowly
delineated. They may be told to investigate a particular
allegation, rather than to embark on a general search for
information embarrassing to their target; their time and budget may
be limited.
</P>
<P>
   By defanging the main judicial challenge to the presidency, this
would make America's executive stronger than it was before the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   It may even be possible, to some degree, to defang ``gotcha''
journalism. For all its competitive aggression, the press is
capable of restraint if it thinks the public (or even the White
House) demands it: there has been almost no coverage, for example,
of how the unfortunate Chelsea Clinton is handling her father's
behavior. And almost any journalist is sensitive to the possibility
that too much cynicism may cause him to lose touch with his
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Even if invasive journalism proves enduring -- and, given the
competitive pressure exerted by cable television and the Internet,
it may well do -- its impact on presidential power may wane.
Americans may continue to watch talk shows that air embarrassing
personal facts about their presidents; but they may be decreasingly
moved by them.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the Lewinsky scandal, journalists have
assailed the president, but their audiences have been reluctant to
pass judgment on him. It may turn out that the post-Watergate drive
to expose the truth about public figures has, after the first brave
hope that this would produce better leaders, simply deepened the
voters' tolerance of imperfection.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the Lewinsky scandal may indeed mark a watershed in
American politics, but not the one that seems most obvious now.
Rather than weakening the presidency, it may represent a softening
of the standards by which presidents are judged. Rather than
extending Watergate's inquisitorial culture, it may represent the
end of the idealism on which that culture was based.
</P>
<P>
   After Nixon's fall, Americans hoped that a vigilant press and a
determined prosecutor could prevent presidential wrongdoing, and
thereby ensure that the country would be blessed with virtuous
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps no amount of vigilance and prosecutorial energy is
able to cleanse politics, and even Americans may give up hoping
that it can.

votes to release the videotape of President Clinton's grand jury
testimony and an additional 2,800 pages of material from Kenneth
Starr's investigation. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CONGRESS-MOOD (Washington) _ A news analysis: The
Republican rush to put out the Clinton deposition and other
salacious material, which Rep. Barney Frank calls ``basically an
effort to discredit the president,'' creates a spectacle that makes
it look as if all restraint, caution and decorum has evaporated on
Capitol Hill. Some members ponder the larger meaning of this
shredding of the political culture and its consequent alienation of
the public. By Jill Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-GINGRICH (Washington) _ House Speaker Gingrich and
others address Christian Coalition meeting. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-BLACKS (Atlanta) _ In dozens of interviews this week,
black Americans ranging from the NAACP's chairman, Julian Bond, to
the comedian Chris Rock cited everything from Clinton's choice of
friends to his choice of woodwinds in explaining why he has
connected with minorities unlike any previous president, viscerally
as well as politically. And while blacks, like most Americans, are
deeply disturbed by Clinton's infidelity, recklessness and
dishonesty, they are not willing to jettison what they see as a
unique relationship in exchange for an uncertain and potentially
threatening future. By Kevin Sack.

</P>
<P>
   MARKET (New York) _ Today is a ``triple-witching'' day, with
stock and index options and futures contracts expiring, which could
make for even more volatility than usual. At 12:45 p.m., the
industrial average was down 10 points and the Nasdaq index was up 5
points. Overseas, prices gained 0.9 percent in Tokyo and fell 1.7
percent in Hong Kong. They fell 0.1 percent in Frankfurt and 1.2

   JAPAN-ECON (Tokyo) _ After weeks of wrangling, Japan's governing
Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition forge an agreement over
legislation that lets the Government take over or shut down
crippled banks. But the agreement is vague in many areas and leaves
important issues unresolved, in particular how much public money
will be used to cover banks' bad debt. To win opposition approval,
the Liberal Democrats agree that Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
will be placed under the Government's control, making it the first
bank to be dealt with under the proposed legislation. Originally,
the governing party wanted to bail out the bank using taxpayer
money. By Sheryl WuDunn.

FISH OR FOUL? PROTEST FOR WHEATIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so it comes down to the Wheaties box, America's billboard
for star athletes, now a battlefield for the anthropomorphic
conscience of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Sneaker-shod glitterati from Mary Lou Retton to Michael Jordan
have grinned at breakfast eaters from the orange cardboard box.
Olympic skaters, home run heroes (McGwire or Sosa on November's
box?), and tennis whackmeisters have all appeared on that icon of
healthy starts and daily nutritional pyramids.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with Denny Brauer?
</P>
<P>
   After all, isn't Brauer the best at what he does? A superstar
head and shoulders above the rest in his sport? A runaway money
winner?
</P>
<P>
   How about $1.35 million in prize money, for starters?
</P>
<P>
   How about the fact that Brauer, a 49-year-old pro from
Camdenton, Mo., is a consummate champion, a winner of his sport's
biggest tournament?
</P>
<P>
   So why the beef about his picture on the Wheaties box?
</P>
<P>
   ``Tricking small animals into impaling themselves on hooks and
ripping them from their homes _ from the comfort of an expensive
boat _ requires no athletic skill whatsoever,'' keens a letter of
protest about Brauer's appointment by General Mills to its most
pretigious marquee of sports superpowerdom.
</P>
<P>
   Brauer, you see, is a fisherman, an angler from the Ozarks, and
his promotion to the Wheaties box has driven the group People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals into howls of opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anglers have no place next to real sportsmen like Michael
Jordan and Tiger Woods, who better represent the breakfast of
champions,'' claimed PETA's president, Ingrid Newkirk, in her
organization's position statement.
</P>
<P>
   Brauer is not just a fisherman. Early in August, he won the BASS
Masters Classic championship in High Rock, N.C., a feat that made
him the biggest money winner in the history of the Bass Anglers
Sporstman Sociey. And lest anyone try to belittle the feat,
Brauer's $1.35 million in earnings are a reminder of just how big
the bass fishing craze has grown in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But another growth trend is in that small but very aggressive
group of anti-hunters who have now spilled over from bullets to
hooks and try to thwart fishing as a cruel and barbaric treatment
of our fellow creatures on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, high-profile fishing tournaments, favorable publicity
showing fishing as a wholesome family outdoor sport, and such
world-class promotions as the Wheaties box fisherman have all
become the targets of PETA, one of the most radical
anti-hook-'n'-bullet groups around.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to General Mills chairman Charles Gaillard,
Newkirk put together the following argument: ``In June, Wheaties
snubbed Sen. John Glenn, astronaut and American hero, denying him
the box front on the basis that he is not an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishing, Newkirk sniffed, ``requires no athletic skill
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   However, General Mills politely rebuffed PETA _ and dealt it one
more blow. Starting with October's box depicting a pro bass
fisherman, the huge food manufacturer intends to feature fishermen
once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``We just looked around,'' said Jack Sheehan, spokesman for
General Mills, ``and we saw 45 million-50 million people fishing in
this country. There's such a growing popularity, it just seemed to
make sense for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheehan has searched company archives to come up with about 60
pages of material on Wheaties boxes dating back to 1935, when the
practice of featuring an athlete on the front began. Not long after
the start, the first nontraditional athlete was featured: polar
explorer Robert Bartlett. Next to be featured on the box were the
Flying Wallendas.
</P>
<P>
   Sports, says Sheehan, have been broadening past the traditional
athlete. ``There are all kinds of sports that haven't yet been
represented on a Wheaties box,'' he said. ``But this box (Brauer)
is a way of showing that we want to be part of the expanding of
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishing, added Sheehan, is a sport whose time has apparently
come. He would not divulge company plans in detail but said
Wheaties boxes will feature many more nontraditional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, PETA remains steadfast in its opposition to fishing
``in any form.'' Said Newkirk in a phone interview, ``All animals
feel pain. They must biologically. So when they get hooked and
ripped up out of the water, that is cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   Brauer regrets the controversy, saying he would like a chance to
meet with the PETA folks. He says he and his 26-year-old son spent
countless hours fishing together before Denny turned pro 20 years
ago. ``It is one of the most wholesome ways a family can all be
together outdoors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Never, it seems, will the twain meet, nor is either side giving
in. But starting next month, anglers can begin their day by
munching their breakfast while having something familiar to stare
at at the table.

LEXUS LS400 _ NEARLY PERFECT, CAN'T QUITE FIND ITS WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, September 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lexus LS400 is a luxury car that is boringly close to perfect
and quietly becoming the stuff of legend. In a world where the
words ``automobile'' and ``grief'' are virtually synonymous, Lexus,
the luxury arm of Toyota, has concentrated so diligently on
details, quality control, and customer service that the occasional
glitch in the flagship car is frequently remembered with pleasure _
when is the last time you enjoyed a visit to the service
department?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the pampering and peace of mind that come in the
Lexus LS400 wrapper have a price _ a steep price: $52,900 plus $495
delivery for a roomy four-door very well equipped. The flasgship
comes with virtually all the bells and whistles, everything from A
to W.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all. There is a short list of extras _ the XYZ, you
might say _ with some very lo-o-o-ong prices. The in-dash compact
disc changer, located just above the glove box, is another $1,050.
High-intensity discharge headlights are $500, and the lowly mats to
cover the fancy carpet, should you desire them, are $112 for the
floor, $65 for the trunk. But wait, there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Lexus find its own way home with the $2,250 navigation
system, and, while you're cruising there, listen to the $2,250
Nakamichi premium audio system while your passenger gazes through
the open $1,120 tilt/slide power moonroof. Heat the seats for $420;
splurge for the wood/leather steering wheel and shifter knob for
$330. The air-suspension system is $2,970, but it includes the
moonroof _ but you have to buy either that fancy radio or the
navigation system to get it. Lastly, put the whole shebang on fancy
chrome wheels for only $1,700 and protect them with the $48 wheel
locks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with everything, we're up to around $62,000 _ that base
price is beginning to look like an admission fee. The tested model
came with the navigation system and a respectable portion of the
rest of the list for a delivered price of $58,790 _ obviously, not
a car for the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The LS400 is a car of comfort in the extreme, a car that appears
to pamper. Enter, sit, place the key in the ignition and the blank
void that is the instrument cluster suddenly lights up and the
steering wheel, recessed out of the way for ease of entry, now
glides closer for easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   The drivetrain is a 32-valve V-8 coupled with a 5-speed
automatic transmission, very smooth and sufficiently potent. The
transmission offers three modes for travel: economy, obviously for
the best fuel economy; snow, for those nasty winter days when
takeoff traction is problematical; power, which adjusts shift
points upward to allow maximum acceleration _ the columnist's
choice. In the economy mode, the LS400 is lively enough, but it is
so smooth, so quiet, as to be a bore. In the power mode, the car is
brighter, the driving more spirited, more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Handling is very good. This is not a sports car for bending
around sharp corners, but this luxury boat is supple enough,
precise enough to be some fun on the country roads and nimble in
city traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Radio controls are convenient enough, and the air
conditioning/heater controls are very good; the Lexus maintained
fairly even temperatures within, despite some extreme changes
without. Interior room is generous, trunk space looks generous _
but, alas, would not accommodate boxed computer and VDT; one box
went into the back seat. The trunk is deep front to rear but
shallow top to bottom. And that was not the only imperfection in
this almost flawless car.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whoever programmed the navigation system has an excellent feel
for computers and a lousy sense of geography.
</P>
<P>
   First test: We want to go from the Globe parking lot to a
specific address in Lowell, about 30 mils from Boston, by the
shortest route. Lowell for the uninitiated, can be one tough town
to navigate, but I do know where I'm going and how to get there.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus navigator, however, isn't going my way. It knows some
short cuts _ shorter in distance, to be sure, but longer in time
most days because it eliminates a lot of interstate. Tonight it's
not such a problem _ in fact, thanks to the mindless little
calculator, I miss a traffic upset on Interstate 495. In Lowell,
directions become less clear; displays and the directions offered
up by the disembodied computer voice do not match what I'm looking
at. It is telling me to go through a traffic circle, but I'm not at
a circle, and the only thing resembling a circle is a block or two
to the left. I guess wrong; the computer goes into the ``disgust''
mode and begins recalculating.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it has recalculated, I've already made another
unprogrammed move, forcing still another recalculation. We set off
again, the microprocessor and I, and once more the maze of streets
before me does not match the computer imagery. I move into the
wrong street, reverse, turn, and enter the correct street. The
satellite-guided navigator now has an electronic headache. I wait
while it takes an electronic aspirin and recalculates.
</P>
<P>
   Underway once more, I am guided to my destination from the
opposite direction of my ususal approach, but the navigator puts me
right on the doorstep. Great!
</P>
<P>
   Business accomplished, I now solicit a route to Rochester, N.H.
The computer directs me to choose from among Rochester, N.Y. ,
Rochester, Minn., or Rochester, Mich. _ it knows no Rochester, N.H.
We argue; it wins. Above Portsmouth is Terra Incognita.
</P>
<P>
   This must be how those early navigators felt with their lousy
maps long on imagined dangers and short on geographical
information. Unlike them, however, I did know where I was going.
For a tourist figuring to explore New England, however, it could
pose a problem _ there is more to New England than Boston, Lowell,
and Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   The LS400, for all its pomp and power to romp, is still easy on
the fuel budget; EPA-rated 19 miles per gallon city, 25 highway,
the tested model delivered 21.63 miles per gallon overall in 900
miles of spirited driving over a variety of terrain. It's a lot of
car, but it's a lot of money.

INTERNET IS BIGGER THAN STARR REPORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's epic report on the
dalliances between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky was
released last week, it was a contest as to which drew more
attention from media pundits _ the lurid details in the report or
the fact that it was available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with discussions of the president's bleak political
future were golly-gosh-whiz pronouncements that, bygum, the
Internet has finally arrived! Welcome to the real world, Netboy,
and have a cigar!
</P>
<P>
   Phrases like ``defining moment'' and ``the Web's finally
mainstream'' were tossed around.
</P>
<P>
   And, they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The posting of a government-sanctioned work of pornography is
not how the Internet is going to be defined. Making that document
available on the Web for millions to read doesn't mean the Net is
now ``mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, the Web arrived a long time ago. And on the other
hand, the Web is far from being ``mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two arguments are not as contradictory as they appear on
the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the traditional media continue to insist on
overlaying a different model on top of the Internet, and usually
that model is TV. But it's not like print, radio or television,
though it has elements of all these.
</P>
<P>
   That's why efforts to present the Net as television fail
miserably. Witness, for example, the Microsoft Network's creation
of ``channels'' for organizing Web-based content on its service.
Subscribers found it confusing and clumsy, a classic case of
jamming the square peg into the round hole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REAL DEFINING MOMENTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Net is not like television because it's far more personal,
even in its one-to-many transmission mode. That's why a single,
grand event cannot define the Internet. Instead, the Net has
thousands of defining moments every day.
</P>
<P>
   When a wife e-mails her husband who's a thousand miles away on a
business trip that she's pregnant with their first child _ that's a
defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   When someone who's been laid off uses the Web to find and land a
new job _ that's a defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   When a shade-tree mechanic finally finds an online source for
that part he's been needing to rebuild an antique car _ that's a
defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   When a student gets a better grade because she used the Internet
to help with studying _ that's a defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   When a small, local company wins business from a customer on the
other side of the world after e-mail-based negotiations _ that's a
defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   When a teen-ager makes a friend in another country by competing
in an online multiplayer game _ that's a defining moment.
</P>
<P>
   The common thread in these examples is the Internet's use as a
tool, a way of getting things done. The release of Starr's report
also is an example of utility. Depending on your point of view,
members of Congress were getting vital information to the citizenry
as quickly as possible _ or delighting in the humiliation of a
president who doesn't fit their ideological ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Congress put the report on the Internet. In the
Information Age, what else were they going to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that there are not big events associated with
the Net. But I'd argue these big events are incidental; they are
not what the Net is all about.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THEN WHAT IS IT? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, the Internet is more like the telephone
than any mass medium. The telephone had no dramatic, defining
moment. It's daily, mundane, human communication that defines the
telephone _ and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Net is not yet a part of the mainstream. These
experiences do not happen to everyone. In fact, they don't happen
to a majority of people.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures from International Data Corp., the
Framingham, Mass., high-tech market research firm, about 45 percent
of the estimated 107 million U.S. homes have computers in them. Of
those, about 62 percnt are online in some way _ the vast majority
connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That means about 19 million homes have Internet access, or less
than 18 percent. And despite the popularity of sub-$1,000 PCs, most
Internet users are better educated and make more money than the
average American.
</P>
<P>
   Even taking into account people with Internet access at work,
the Net still is not mainstream. Someday, it will be. And it won't
because of the Starr Report, but rather because it's rapidly
becoming the most effective way for our species to communicate.

TO KEEP YOUR PC RUNNING `CLEAN', LIMIT UTILITIES, BACKGROUND
ACTION 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You list many utilities that are beneficial to keeping a
machine in good working order. I have just about all the utilities
that you've referred to. My problem is that I can't get them all
running at the same time without having system problems. I have
disabled the McAfee virus shield on your advice, and now use it
only to scan periodically. I have Cleansweep, but do not have the
monitoring activated. I also have Norton Utilities (although I have
not updated for Windows 98), and Oil Change, etc. ad nauseum. I
depend upon Act! 4.0 with the Act loader and with Sidekick running
on the side, have a spell checker running for my CompuServe mail,
Microsoft Office bar and a total of about a dozen programs that
show up on my Task Manager that I don't even know the functions of.
Where does one draw the line?
</P>
<P>
   A. Where you draw the line depends on your personal computing
comfort zone. At what point are you willing to sacrifice the
convenience of having all these bells and whistles running in the
background in order to have a more stable system? It's a decision
you have to make for yourself, based on the state of your PC and,
to a certain extent, your level of computing sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   I've evolved a bit in my thinking lately about computer
utilities. While I think some products are must-haves _ for
example, you need something to help with uninstalling programs,
something to scan for viruses and something to help recover from a
crash _ there is such a thing as having too many utilities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's no need to have both First Aid and Norton
Utilities on your system and, in fact, some of their components can
conflict with each other.
</P>
<P>
   I think you should run as few programs in the background as
possible. The ``cleaner'' your operating system, the better _ and
that goes for all platforms, including Windows, Macintosh and Unix.
</P>
<P>
   You mention in your question that you have Norton Utilities, but
not updated for Windows 98. If you are running Norton Utilities 3,
you should definitely use the LiveUpdate feature to apply the patch
that makes Norton more compatible with Windows 98. Not doing so is
asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using an older version of Norton Utilities, you
should upgrade at once to 3.0.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the speed of a 56K modem significant enough for me to make
the upgrade from a 28.8 modem? Is the difference noticeable? Or,
should I just stick to my old reliable 28.8 and hold out until
better technology arrives? Should I wait until the cable company
offers an Internet connection, free ISDN from the phone company or
some other cheap technology?
</P>
<P>
   A. At best, you can expect to get about 53K out of a 56K modem,
though most folks don't even get that. The average speed from most
56K modems seems to be in the 40K to 48K range _ though some folks
certainly get less.
</P>
<P>
   However, assuming your connection is average, that's about a 30
to 40 percent increase in your current speed, which would be a
noticeable improvement. When a 56K modem is working at its best,
you can classify the results as a dramatic improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Given that cable modem service for most consumers in Houston
won't happen until March at the earliest, and that a decent 56K
modem will cost about $100-$120, it might indeed be worth it if
you're feeling constrained.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath, by the way, waiting for the phone
company to offer free ISDN. Unfortunately, expansive bandwidth
doesn't come cheap.
</P>

KANSAS STATE SCENARIO IS NOT PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The formula seems simple: Win enough football games and you can
not only earn a bowl berth but contend for the national
championship. That, however, was before the advent of the Bowl
Championship Series, as NCAA planners call their new format to
determine who will play in this year's national championship game,
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   We're only two weeks into the season, and already we have
glimmerings of a problem with one school. In the parlance of people
who study the Weather Channel during hurricane season, it's just a
tropical wave at present. Nothing to worry about _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   The team we're talking about is Kansas State, which some people
think has a legitimate chance to win the national championship. Now
those of you with a sense of history should be doubled over with
laughter at seeing ``national championship'' and ``Kansas State''
mentioned in the same paragraph.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Kansas State was as far down the Division 1-A food
chain as you could go. From 1985-89, the Wildcats won four games.
During one particularly bleak strtech en route to an 0-10-1 record
in 1987, K-State lost three games by a combined 171-17.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, a coaching change occurred during that period,
with Stan Parish being replaced by Bill Snyder. But an arrival just
as important was that of Steve Miller as the athletic director.
</P>
<P>
   Miller had a new concept. Instead of overscheduling K-State, he
decided to underschedule. Nonconference opponents such as Iowa,
Tulane, and Arizona State disappeared from the schedule and were
replaced by teams such as Northern Illinois, Indiana State, and
Akron.
</P>
<P>
   The theory was simple. Winning any game, even against a 1-AA
opponent or a less-than-high-profile team, was better than getting
beaten by a Top 25 team.
</P>
<P>
   After three so-so years of testing this theory, Kansas State
broke into the bowl busines in 1993, going 9-2-1 and earning a trip
to the Copper Bowl, the Wildcats' first postseason bid in 11
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   K-State has been to a bowl game every year since, topped off by
last season's Fiesta Bowl win over Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   But critics _ and there are many _ charge that K-State, with top
facilities and a national reputation, has gone beyond simply
scheduling 1-AA and bottom-of-the-barrel 1-A opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State is off to a nice 2-0 start after romps over Indiana
State and Northern Illinois. The pollsters have the Wildcats in the
Top 10, although one voter says he has dropped them a spot each of
the last two weeks for piling on.
</P>
<P>
   K-State sees nothing wrong with its plan and no reason to change
it. It has provided the school with a sense of pride in its
program.Let the other teams beat each other up in the nonconference
part of their schedules. Next year will bring more of the same,
since Kansas State has Temple, Texas-El Paso, and mostly likely
Idaho scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the rub. Part of the BCS formula includes computer
rankings, which factor in strength of schedule. It is conceivable
that Kansas State could run the table with an 11-0 record and be
nudged out of a slot in the Fiesta Bowl by a team with one loss.
</P>
<P>
   Although wins are paramount, under the BCS formula, a team with
the same number of wins and one loss can pass an undefeated team if
it is 25 slots ahead of that team in strength of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Schools are aware of that formula and understand the importance
of scheduling. ``You don't want to overschedule yourself,'' said
Boston College coach Tom O'Brien. ``So you get a couple of games
you feel you should win, but you also schedule a couple of good
intersectional games that you have a chance to win and will also
give you some national exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's nonconference schedule includes Notre Dame, Georgia Tech,
and Navy this year and will feature teams such as Stanford and Wake
Forest in future years. Not suicidal, but not Cupcake U, either.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Kansas State is 20th in the Sagarin computer rankings,
which factors in strength of schedule. That is a far cry from the
Wildcats' No. 4 ranking in the ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll and
their No. 5 ranking in the Associated Press writers' poll.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this scenario: After the league championship games,
Ohio State and Kansas State are undefeated and ranked 1-2 in the
polls, but a surging Florida State, which has won 10 straight,
including a victory over previously undefeated Florida, is No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The FSU schedule, which also includes games against Miami as
well as Top 25 teams Texas A&AMP;M, Southern California, North
Carolina, and Virginia, would put the Seminoles more than 25 slots
ahead of Kansas State, boosting the Seminoles into the No. 2
position and into the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Kansas State will have no one but itself to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
At a loss to explain
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State is 0-2 and looking for reasons. As a starting
point, try 22 penalties for 210 yards in losses against Washington
and Brigham Young ... Speaking of BYU, there seems to have been a
change in philosophy for coach Lavell Edwards, who is running the
ball more than passing ... Oregon and Oregon State are a combined
4-0, stunning for Oregon State fans. The Beavers have had an
NCAA-record 27 straight losing seasons and have won only one
Pacific-10 game in the last three seasons ... Oregon coach Mike
Bellotti is 11-0 in nonconference games ... Nebraska has become
quite an attraction on the road. When the Huskers visited
California in Berkeley last week, they drew 67,000, the largest
Memorial Stadium crowd since Notre Dame came to town in 1959 ...
Florida State quarterback Chris Weinke threw six interceptions in
the Seminoles' 24-7 loss to North Carolina State, and he expects to
hear criticism until FSU wins again. ``There are people who want to
run me out of town _ I know that,'' said Weinke, who gets a chance
to redeem himself Saturday against Duke. ``But you aren't going to
run me out of this game.'' ... Who would have thought? After two
games, Duke (2-0) has a better record than Flordia State (1-1) ...
FSU is out of the Top 10 for the first time since Oct. 9, 1994. The
Seminoles have been out of the Top 10 for only one week since 1990
... Missouri fans are hoping their team can repeat last year's
performance against a No. 1 opponent when the Tigers meet
top-ranked Ohio State in Columbus Saturday. Last year the Tigers
came within a foot of upsetting No. 1 Nebraska, their bid falling
that far short on the game's final play ... Kansas band members are
irate after being pelted with whiskey bottles at halftime of last
week's Missouri game in Columbia. Mizzou officials are apologizing
all over the place ... Texas's defense is allowing an average of
535.7 yards per game ... Although Kansas State and Texas are in the
same conference, the teams have not met since 1942 ... When
Louisiana State faces Auburn Saturday, count on the game being
close. Since the series became a regular part of both teams'
schedules in 1991, the game has been decided by 6 or fewer points
five of the six times they have met ... Good news for Clemson,
which was shut out by Virginia Tech, 37-0, last week. The Tigers
are 8-0 in games they play on Sept. 19, the only date on which the
Tigers are perfect (in more than five games). That could be bad
news for Virginia, the Tigers' opponent Saturday ... Florida, which
has beaten Tennessee five straight times, has outscored the Vols,
59-6, in the first half the last two times the game has been played
at Neyland Stadium ... Michigan is not only not the best team in
the country right now, it's not even the best team in its county.
Eastern Michigan in Ypsilanti is 1-1, the Wolverines are 0-2 ...
Balance? Not at Utah State, which had 19 yards rushing but 338
passing in a 39-36 loss to New Mexico ... Battle of the
quarterbacks when Indiana meets Kentucky: The Wildcats' Tim Couch
is No. 2 in the country, trailing only Hoosier redshirt freshman
Antwaan Randle.

CLINTON SCANDAL SAPPING SENSITIVITY AT OFFICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas in 1991 forced employers to confront the reality of sexual
harassment in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Companies quickly put out statements explaining how employees
could make harassment complaints, hired experts to caution managers
of the perils of dating subordinates, and warned managers about
creating a hostile work environment to prevent their own Anita Hill
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers went so far as to tell employees they couldn't
comment on their co-workers' attire for fear the comments would be
taken the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   All that sensitivity about discussing sex and its overtones flew
out the window when the Starr Report was released last week on the
Internet and reprinted by many newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, employees huddled around the water cooler and talked
about the revelations that President Clinton allegedly had cigar
sex with Monica Lewinsky, whether oral sex constitutes a sexual
relationship and the morality of the president having a tawdry
affair with a young intern.
</P>
<P>
   The human resource director at one of Houston's biggest
companies said that conversations are popping up everywhere _
during meetings, during lunch and in the halls. People are talking
about the disgust they feel toward the president and how the
president could think the public would buy his argument that oral
sex isn't really sex, said the director, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with those kind of bawdy details usually have been
reserved for locker rooms or beer halls.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Majuk, publicity director for Amacom Books in New York
City, said she would never have talked about sex with her male
boss, but when details of the Starr Report came up at a recent
lunch the conversation was as normal as gardening.
</P>
<P>
   No one blinked an eye, said Majuk, remembering the salacious
details that were discussed. Obviously impeachment hangs on perjury
and how can you discuss that without knowing the details?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JOKES NOT BOTHERING MANY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Starr Report has spurred a lot of jokes, but even those
don't seem to bother people who might be annoyed by tasteless
sexual commentary at the workplace. After all, it has become one of
the most intense legal and ethical debates of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce King said the jokes she hears around the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers Local 4-227 in Houston don't bother her a bit. She's
worked with the same people for 20 years and everyone understands
the conversation is nothing more than discussing the political news
of the day, said King, a secretary.
</P>
<P>
   All this talk does raise an interesting question. When exactly
does the rehashing of cigar sex and hallway encounters rise to the
level of a hostile work environment? When does the conversation get
so offensive that an employee can claim harassment?
</P>
<P>
   That hinges on whether a reasonable person would find the
conversation offensive, said Gerald Holtzman, an employment lawyer
with Beirne Maynard and Parsons in Houston. There's no right to
talk offensively just because it's a &UR;  &LR; public issue.
</P>
<P>
   The remarks also would have to be pervasive enough to constitute
a hostile working environment, said Holtzman. An isolated comment
is not sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SPEAK UP IF YOU ARE OFFENDED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If someone is offended by the conversation, he should speak up,
said Kathy Butler, an employment lawyer with Butler and Harris in
Houston. Butler has a hard time imagining conversation about the
Lewinsky case rising to the level of harassment unless one employee
uses the case to torment another.
</P>
<P>
   And there would probably be other examples of abuse if one
employee is making cigar sex references to another employee, Butler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent laxity regarding sex talk at work, the rules
still haven't changed, said Dennis Powers, author of ``The Office
Romance: Playing with Fire without Getting Burned'' (Amacom Books).
If you don't know someone very well, it's better not to start
commenting on the nitty-gritty details in the report. Stick to
general questions: ``What do you think about Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   Powers said the Clinton scandal is having at least one positive
effect at work: It's raising the consciousness about sex, dating
and romance at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Sexually related issues will be easier to discuss because we're
talking about the Clinton affair in a way that doesn't cause
embarrassment, said Powers, who also is associate professor of
business law at Southern Oregon University in Ashland, Ore.

DAUNTE CULPEPPER: FAVORITE SON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The relatives came from all over the state.
Cousins, nephews, aunts, uncles, brothers, sisters. All for a
family reunion/end-of-summer party at a beach about two hours from
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I bet it was over 75 people,'' says Daunte Culpepper,
Central Florida's All-America quarterback. ``People talking about
the Heisman, doing this, beating that team. People telling me, `You
got to beat Auburn.'''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper smiled at the memory. All that attention. All those
expectations. All the expressions of faith in what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   Faith?
</P>
<P>
   His whole life had been based on faith, on people's belief in
making the impossible possible.
</P>
<P>
   Take his mother, Emma. It was faith that had brought Daunte and
Emma together 21 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Emma Culpepper was 62 years old, content in a life that
had unfolded around her and included 14 children.
</P>
<P>
   Emma had been a widow since 1956 and had never borne children.
But that didn't stop her from being a mother. After her brother
died, she raised his four children, a sister-in-law brought seven
other children into Emma's domain, and she adopted three more.
</P>
<P>
   One of the adoptees was Daunte, who arrived after another
desperate call for help. A prisoner at the Ocala, Fla.,
correctional institution had given birth and wanted to give the boy
away.
</P>
<P>
   This call was different. A stranger's call. But Emma's heart was
huge. She took in Daunte as her youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'd be without her,'' Daunte says of Emma,
who has slowed down some at 83 but still is sharp enough to follow
Daunte's career and offer advice.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Emma about Daunte and she will talk not about a football
player but a young man with an unlimited future. ``He was always
special,'' she says. ``He knows what he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her decision to become a mother again at 62, she
says, ``I never had any regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma Culpepper, approaching retirement with a house already full
of children, had faith that taking in an infant boy when it made no
sense to do so would work out all right.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It was also faith that brought Culpepper to Central Florida.
In high school, he was a hot shot at quarterback but not so hot in
the classroom, prompting most Division 1-A schools to back away
from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My academics weren't up to par,'' says Culpepper. ``It wasn't
that I wasn't able to do the work. It was just that I
procrastinated and did other things instead of going home and doing
my homework. It didn't hit me until after my junior yuear, when I
started getting serious about college. I said, `Man, my grades
aren't what they need to be.' A lot of schools backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Culpepper smiles, knowing how the story has turned out,
knowing that he is months away from being a millionaire as one of
the top picks in next spring's National Football League draft. He
knows that if he has a good season, the Culpepper bandwagon will
become crowded; a few good performances in key games can earn him
Heisman consideration. Such consideration would seem to have merit
after Culpepper began his season with two Heisman-like efforts,
including a six-touchdown (four passing, two running) effort in a
64-30 win over Louisiana Tech two weeks ago and a seven-touchdown
(four passing, three running) splurge in a 48-0 rout of Eastern
Illinois Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  This from a player who was largely unwanted by Division 1-A
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame them,'' says Culpepper, who will show his act on
national television tomorrow against Purdue. ``I probably would
have done the same thing if I were them. You don't make investments
in things you don't think you're going to get nothing out of. They
felt like they weren't going to get anything out of me, so they
stopped calling and writing and doing the things they do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Central Florida had faith. UCF, which was about to move up
to Division 1-A and had big-time ambitions, needed players.
Then-coach Gene McDowell and his staff decided to look beyond
grades.
</P>
<P>
   When their interest turned to Culpepper, they sent offensive
coordinator Paul Lounsberry to check things out. ``I talked to his
teachers and coaches,'' says Lounsberry with a big smile, standing
in the qaud of the sprawling Central Florida campus. ``It wasn't
that he didn't know things. He just wasn't working as hard as he
should have.''
</P>
<P>
   Lounsberry and Ocala Vanguard High School coach Phil Yancey came
up with a plan in which Culpepper would take some classes over, so
he could earn a diploma and become eligible to play football.
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida was making Culpepper a project as much as a
recruit. If it took a year, two years, the coaches figured, it
would be worth it. Anyone who had seen the 6-foot-5-inch, 245-pound
quarterback throw for more than 3,000 yards and 31 touchdowns in
his senior season knew that.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCF came to me and said they were going to offer me a
scholarship no matter what happened,'' says Culpepper. ``I thought
about it for a minute and said, `This school is going Division 1 in
my sophomore year. It's in Orlando. It's something new.' I wanted
to be a part of something new, up-and-coming. And I thought, `I
could be a diamond in the rough.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Culpepper took the classes over. Turned some D's into B's. He
not only graduated but became immediately eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Once he became eligible for athletics, Culpepper was seen as a
big-time prospect, not only in football but also in baseball, a
sport in which he was good enough to be drafted by the Yankees as a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Too late. Culpepper remained loyal to Central Florida, enrolling
in a school whose football program offered no guarantees of
on-field success.
</P>
<P>
   By last season, he had become a star who was rising and taking
an entire program with him.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper and UCF went into Lincoln to take on defending
national champion Nebraska, and they matched the Cornhuskers
touchdown for touchdown for more than a half, taking a 17-14 lead
into intermission before losing, 38-24.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper completed 24 of 35 passes for 318 yards for a
seven-touchdown underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans even started booing them,'' says Culpepper, relishing
the memory. ``We went into the game with the mind-set we were going
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida took the same approach against the other
high-profile Division 1-A schools it faced, barely losing to
Mississippi and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, Culpepper completed 62.5 percent of his passes
for 3,086 yards and 25 touchdowns. He surpassed 300 passing yards
in five of 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Had he decided to turn pro last spring, some people told
Culpepper, he would have been almost as desirable a quarterback
prospect as Tennessee's Peyton Manning and Washington State's Ryan
Leaf, who went 1-2 in the draft. Manning signed a contract worth
$42.7 million and received a signing bonus of $11.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people came up to me and said, `Man, that could have
been you,''' says Culpepper. ``I'm like, `I got a season to look
forward to and I'm not going to worry about that now.'''
</P>
<P>
   He came back because of faith, perhaps wanting to prove himself
to be the best quarterback in college football before moving on to
the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Some people thought Culpepper was crazy to stay at Central
Florida. Others, including interim coach Mike Kruczek, who had an
offer from the Indianapolis Colts but chose not to leave when he
learned Culpepper was returning, were grateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tremendous prospect,'' says Kruczek, a former Boston
College quarterback who was Terry Bradshaw's backup with the
Pittsburgh Steelers for four seasons. ``He's not 6-6, but he's put
together, muscular sizewise, that he can be 285 and not be fat. I
think he brings more to the table than Ryan Leaf and Peyton Manning
as a football player at the next level. I make that statement and
people think I'm crazy. But I just think he's a can't-miss guy. If
he gets in the right system, someone is going to win with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Florida's system is the one Culpepper is currently
making work. A year ago, the Golden Knights lost four games in
which they were within 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   This year is different because people are now watching UCF, not
stunned at high-quality performances. But Culpepper and his
teammates want more than almosts. They want wins, enough to get
them to at least 7-4, which might bring a bowl invitation. Beating
Louisiana Tech was the first step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   If a bowl invitation comes _ and it's a huge if _ Culpepper
knows he will get recognition as well. He knows he could become a
legitimate Heisman contender with a superb performance against a
team such as Purdue, which the Golden Knights meet Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper says he gets pumped going into big stadiums and
feeling the breath of the crowd leave when he and Central Florida
make a quick strike, the way they did last year against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our attitude is that we respect everybody but we fear
nobody,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper knows what awaits him after this season if he stays
healthy. He's such a hot prospect that he has taken out a $5
million insurance policy on himself.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that his world will change again no matter what happens
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Daunte Culpepper says he is ready for the next phase of his
life, but his link with his past is strong. He has kept in touch
with his biological mother. He never knew his father. But he is not
without family.
</P>
<P>
   There are all those brothers and sisters, nieces and nephews.
And there is Emma. Daunte says one of the first things he will do
when he does get a contract is move Emma into a mansion, a house
with lots of rooms for all the relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not going to think about that now,'' he says. ``I got
to worry about what's here at UCF right now. What happens after
that happens.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Annals of leaking
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You rarely see Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in the news these days
without it being mentioned on the authority of the writer that he
is widely respected and wise. There are some things you must take
on faith. Hyde is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
usually called powerful, since it seems ready to swing Bill Clinton
from the highest limb.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is notable for his distinguished appearance and his
statesmanlike oratory, a central c asting prototype of a 1930s
congressman. His name has been plastered all over the media the
past few days since someone leaked a humiliating story to Salon,
the Internet magazine. Hyde admitted he had an affair with a
married woman 30 years ago. As a journalistic enterprise, it was
enough to make sleaze cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's stately response, however, may be savored. ``The statute
of limitations,'' he said with what one assumes is characteristic
largeness of spirit, ``has long since passed on my youthful
indiscretions.'' That one's a real keeper. If you do the math, as
several reporters did, Hyde's youthful indiscretion occurred when
he was a lad of 41.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde leak predictably inflamed Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, the
famously irritable impeachment buff, who perceived in this yet
another criminal charge against Bill Clinton. If the source was the
WhiteHouse, he said, the leak would be a felony obstruction of
Congress. Nice idea. If we want to get efficient, maybe we can
charge everyone with felony obstruction of everything and not sweat
the details.

BC FACES PROBLEMS WITH TENNESSEE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's not as if Boston College's defense has never faced
an option-oriented offense. Army runs it. So does Navy. And Georgia
Tech, in its 41-31 loss to BC, sprinkled in the option.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Eagles host Temple Saturday at Alumni Stadium,
their defense will be uniquely challenged by an Owl offense that
ranks fourth in the nation in rushing, averaging almost 298.5 yards
per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls run the option on almost every down, save for the
occasional play-action pass by multitalented quarterback Kevin
Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, our offense is fairly simple,'' said first-year
coach Bobby Wallace, whose team will arrive at Chestnut Hill
seeking its first victory after two losses. ``But it just isolates
people on the field, and we do have some athletes who, when the
ball is in their hands, can do some good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason it's so hard to defend is that you have to be so
disciplined to play dive, quarterback, and pitch. It keeps the
defense from being able to pursue the ball quite as much because of
the responsibilities they have before running to the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the crux of the battle for BC's defense: Stop the
option at the point of attack. Rather, the Eagles must contain the
option, because as defensive coordinator Tim Rose pointed out, ``If
you make a mistake on the first part, then you're destined for
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have used the term `assignment football,' but that's
exactly what it is,'' said Rose, whose defense is ranked third in
the Big East, allowing 331.5 yards per game (109 rushing).
``Everyone has to know their assignments. One guy has to tackle the
dive. One guy has to tackle the quarterback. One guy has to tackle
the pitch. You have to be disciplined on every play because the
attack is across such a broad front.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why it will involve more than just BC's front seven.
Junior strong safety George White and junior free safety Pedro
Cirino are expected to play critical roles in run support. Wallace
singled out Cirino as a player ``who's going to be extremely active
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free safety is a guy generally utilized to run inside and
out on the football and make a lot of tackles on the quarterback
and the quarterback to pitch,'' Wallace said. ``He's a great
player, and that's going to be a matchup we've got to try and
control in some forms, whether it's throwing the football or by
trying to block him. But that'll be an interesting matchup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be,'' agreed Cirino. ``I played against Kevin Harvey
in high school in the North-South Game, and he put it on us real
bad, too. He's a great athlete and good quarterback, so it's going
to be a good challenge for me and the whole defense to try and
contain him. But it's not just him. They've got a lot of weapons on
the offense. Guys like Stacey Mack and the rest of their backs are
pretty damn good.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it the most demanding offense a defensive back can face?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's the most demanding, but you just got to
know your assignments,'' said White, BC's No. 2 tackler (14). ``If
you know your assignments, you stop their offense. Their depth at
their skill positions is going to put a lot of stress on me and
Pedro to make a lot of tackles, so it's something we've got to do.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why there can be no deviation from the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy has the dive, one guy has the pitch, one guy has the
quarterback _ every play,'' said junior nose guard Chris Hovan,
BC's top tackler (16), who earned Big East Co-Defensive Player of
the Week honors after recording eight tackles (six solo), two for
losses of 11 yards, and one quarterback sack in last week's 41-14
victory over Rutgers. ``It can never be like, `Oh, I forgot, I
thought I had him.' On every play, you should know who you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The assignments?
</P>
<P>
   White: ``It depends on the defense. It's either dive,
quarterback, or pitch. Simple as that. It just depends on the
defense; I'll take whatever I have in that defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirino: ``It varies. I'll have the pitch on some coverages and
the quarterback on others. But rarely dive. I'll probably be just
helping more than anything on the dives.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan: ``I just got the dive. I try to make sure I clog up the
middle and make sure the quarterback doesn't pull it when he
pitches. It doesn't mean I'll make lot of plays. It's not sexy,
it's not glamorous, but it's doing your job. And that's what
everybody is going to have to do.''

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ The White House criticizes the decision
to release more Starr materials as partisan and unfair. President
Clinton appears this afternoon at a meeting of his race advisory
board. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   Cox photos are available to illustrate this story.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-TAPES _ WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee is
trying again to approve release of more information on President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky following furious
arguments over whether to make available phone sex conversations
and other graphic material. As the committee resumed its closed
deliberations, Republican congressional leaders appeared before a
meeting of the Christian Coalition and told the conservative group
they would press ahead with their investigation of the president.
(Carr/Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-BIPARTISAN _ WASHINGTON _ Sharp partisan exchanges
between members of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday showed
that Congress is far from the kind of bipartisan consensus that
must precede the forced removal of a president. (Mollison, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JURY _ WASHINGTON _ Why is grand jury testimony,
normally secret, being released in the Clinton case? Should
ordinary citizens subpoenaed before a grand jury have reason to
fear their testimony will become public? (Harlan, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REDACTIONS _ WASHINGTON _ The Judiciary Committee voted
to leave scores of items out of the released material, mostly for
privacy reasons, and those redactions won broad support. About 20
items, though, were disputed, as Republicans insisted on keeping in
graphic sexual material. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HASTINGS _ WASHINGTON _ Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., who
himself was removed from a federal judgeship through impeachment,
called Friday for impeachment proceedings against Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. (Lipman, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN _ WASHINGTON _ The heads of the Senate
Democratic and Republican campaign commitees Friday joined their
House counterparts in vowing to cut off financial support to any
candidate who launches a personal attack on an opponent. The
bipartisanship and abhorrence of sexual topics comes as a sharp
contrast to the process enveloping President Clinton. (Shepard, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-TOUR _ WASHINGTON _ What people touring the White House
Friday are saying about President Clinton's problems. (Monroe, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION _ WASHINGTON _ The Senate fell three votes short today
of overriding President Clinton's veto of a ban on certain
late-term abortions. The 64-36 vote followed emotional arguments
over why Congress should take the rare step of enacting legislation
over a president's objections. Four Republicans joined 32 Democrats
to sustain the veto, while 13 Democrats and 51 Republicans voted
for the override. The vote means Clinton's veto will stand _ at
least until a new Congress convenes in January. Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.), who was under intense pressure to vote for the override,
voted no. Coverdell (R-Ga.) voted yes. (Foskett, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ The high-tech industry has a
legislative wish list for the waning weeks of the 105th Congress.
What are its prospects in a distracted capital? (Regan, Cox News
Service 1000).
</P>
<P>
   MOVED Thursday in advance in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   GLENN _ Ohio State and Sen. Glenn make official announcement of
the $20 million endowment to the new Glenn Institute for Public
Policy. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News).
</P>
<P>
   QUAYLE _ GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Former Vice President Dan Quayle
campaigns for GOP gubernatorial Guy Millner on Friday as Millner
continues to bring in a string of national luminaries to help
bolster his bid against Democrat Roy Barnes. Quayle, who is a
potential presidential contender in 2000, will likely talk about
national politics in general, and Bill Clinton in particular, as
much as he will about the Georgia governor's race. (Pruitt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). ETA: 9 p.m. EDT
</P>
<P>
   SLAVEWALK _ Before the nation embarked on its initiative on
race, a group of about 60 people from the United States, Bulgaria,
Japan, Cuba, Chile, Peru and other parts of the world, called the
Interfaith Pilgrimage of the Middle Passage, launched a pilgrimage
from Massachusetts to South Africa with the goal of healing the
history of racism. The group began their journey in May and expects
to complete it in May 1999. The group is holding rallies around
metro Atlant and has one scheduled at the MLK Center. (PScott,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   CARIBBEAN-HANGINGS _ Barbados _ Gallows unused for 10 years will
soon return to active duty in Jamaica when the country hangs
Neville Lewis for murdering a motorist who asked for directions
later this month. St. Kitts and Nevis had its first hanging in 13
years last month. Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago have hangings
planned later this year. Governments in many countries unofficially
stopped hangings and floggings in the 1980s in response to protests
from international human rights groups. But rising crime has
brought about calls to resume hangings and floggings, a vestige of
British colonial rule in the region. A number of governments in the
Caribbean have even undertaken controversial steps to change their
justice systems and constitutions and sever ties with international
appeals bodies to make it easier to carry out executions.
Proponents of capital punishment contend that those condemned to
death have been using appeals to stall their fates for years at a
time. Countries like Barbados want to cut tie with the British
Privy Council, a supreme court for former British colonies, and
establish a Caribbean Court of Justice by next year. (Emling, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   With HANGINGS-BOX _ Barbados _ Information on executions and
number of people on death row in Caribbean countries. (Emling, Cox
News Service).

LAWYERS SAY CLINTON SHOULD STOP MINCING WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Leading lawyers have this advice for President
Clinton: Make sure your lawyers don't act like lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The public is tired of hyper-technical, legalistic and semantic
arguments about the definitions of sexual relations and perjury,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing a lawyer can do for Bill Clinton at this
point,'' said Juanita Brooks, a San Diego defense lawyer who has
handled several high-profile cases. ``His best friend would be a
plumber to get in there and try to plug some of these holes and
keep the ship afloat.''
</P>
<P>
   To cut loose from the tangle of sex, lies and videotape, the
president's advocates must move past the sordid details, portray
his affair with Monica Lewinsky and his efforts to hide it as
personal failings not worthy of impeachment, and present the attack
on him as partisan, according to several criminal defense experts
interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   This hurdle could be raised higher if Clinton appears to be
overly defensive or equivocating on the videotape of his grand jury
testimony, which the House Judiciary Committee voted Friday to make
public.
</P>
<P>
   So his advocates _ led by Gregory B. Craig, a State Department
official _ must make a human appeal not to the courthouse but to
the public and Congress, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, his biggest problem is political, so I'm not sure a
lawyer should be doing it all,'' said Stephen Gillers, a New York
University professor of legal ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must show the public he has assumed moral culpability
and convince members of Congress they face public backlash if they
impeach him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are not things you learn in law practice or law
school,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco lawyer James Brosnahan, Clinton's advocates must
realize his political survival depends on reaching three key
audiences: the American public; the House Judiciary Committee,
which will decide whether to issue articles of impeachment on which
he would be tried in the Senate, and about 15 middle-of-the-road
senators who could block the Senate from getting the two-thirds
vote necessary to convict the president should he be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Clinton must drop the technical arguments about whether
he committed perjury in his deposition in the Paula Jones civil
suit and in his testimony before independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Such technical arguments alienate the public, make the president
look evasive and invite counter-arguments oozing with graphic
sexual description, Brosnahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clinton's representatives might best try to negotiate
an agreement under which he would be censured in exchange for not
holding impeachment hearings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar Goodman of Las Vegas is one of the few lawyers in the
country to have defended an impeached official, former U.S.
District Judge Harry Claiborne. The judge was first convicted of
tax evasion, and in 1986 the Senate convicted Claiborne for the
same crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's between a rock and a hard place,'' Goodman said of
Clinton. While Clinton wants to be as contrite as possible, any
admission that he perjured himself could prove fatal in a
subsequent criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's best shot now is to ``do an awful lot of lobbying,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would stop talking like a lawyer and start talking like a
politician, and try to arrange an agreement that everyone could
live with. He's very popular with the public, and that means a lot
with politicians,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would remind all the Republicans that if they get rid of
President Clinton, they might end up with President Gore, and he
would be a strong incumbent'' in the next election, said Goodman, a
past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman also would argue that an impeachment hearing ``won't do
any good. He's already been publicly humiliated. He's going to go
down in history not as creating this great prosperity but for a
stain on a dress. He's been punished enough.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Osterhoudt, a San Francisco defense lawyer who has
defended government officials, agreed that Clinton should stop
acting like the lawyer he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense has to get away from trying to split hairs and say
he told the truth when he denied having an affair with her,'' he
said. ``That doesn't go down well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders should drive home the idea that the perjury
allegations against Clinton _ even if true _ are weak, Osterhoudt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Had Paula Jones' lawyers gone to any district attorney's office
seeking prosecution of a witness for lying in a deposition, they'd
have been ``laughed right out of the office,'' he said. ``No one
ever gets prosecuted for lying in a civil deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's true,'' he added, ``how can it be such a crime to
remove this elected official? That's why Congress shouldn't take
that seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should cast the charges as the product of a Republican
effort to undo a duly elected leader and ``play up that most people
think he's doing a good job'' of running the country.

UNDATED: not surprising. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, addressing a group of industry chief executives in
June, urged his colleagues to emphasize creativity, not market
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at a computer. You can't look at focus groups.
... I trust my instincts,'' Lauren said in a report in Women's Wear
Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including the chief executive for publicly traded Liz
Claiborne, said they depend heavily on research. But Lauren blasted
``depressing'' department stores for relying on too many
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a business about passion,'' said Lauren, who is chief
executive officer as well as designer. ``It's not a business about
numbers. If you're going to be in the numbers business, get out.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy may inspire designers, but it doesn't exactly
reassure investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That opinion might be offensive to people who've lost a lot of
money,'' says Kathy Oher, research director for Southwest
Securities in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months following Lauren's speech, his company's
stock fell 23 percent, three times the drop of the market during
the same period. Since going public in June '97, Polo Ralph Lauren
Corp. has declined more than 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Liz and Ralph and Donna Karan, and I'd buy any of their
products,'' says Leon Hall, creative director for the Dallas
Apparel Mart and a fashion commentator on cable's E! network. ``But
I don't buy their fashion stocks. I've done it before, and I've
never made any money.''
</P>
<P>
   That's easy to believe. The stock prices for many of the
best-known fashion plays have held their value about as long as
last-season's garments.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan stock, for example, has never returned to its
opening day price. Mossimo and Gucci have been on roller-coaster
rides, climbing huge peaks in a few months and plummeting just as
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Such swings may be attractive for short-term traders, who buy on
the cheap and dump the stock before it peaks. But long-term
investors, who prefer to buy a stock and hold it for years, should
realize what they're getting into, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these companies should never go public,'' Cabell
suggests. ``The designers really want to run them like a private
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein, in contrast, has never tapped the IPO market _
``we're happy to be private,'' said spokesman Robert Triefus. Nor
have many small garment manufacturers. Giorgio Armani and Gianni
Versace also have remained private, although some expect both to
tap the public markets soon.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few high-profile fashion plays that investors can
applaud. Take Tommy Hilfiger and the Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Tommy's 1992 IPO have seen their stock rise from
$7.50 (adjusted for stock splits) to more than $40 a share. Tommy,
which began as a menswear maker, is now called a ``lifestyle
brand'' because it expanded successfully into women's and
children's clothes, home furnishings, fragrances, athletic shoes
and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that diversification makes Tommy less vulnerable to
fashion cycles, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gap _ the nation's No. 3 retailer that wants to be the
clothing supermarket to the world _ the secret is great retailing
and solid design. Its clever TV spots, the first in five years, and
its saturation advertising on buses and billboards have drawn in
customers. Its simple, straightforward designs have kept profit
margins high.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Navy division, offering low-priced goods with an
attitude, topped $1 billion in sales three years after it was
launched. Last month, the Gap reported that second-quarter profits
almost doubled.
</P>
<P>
   How much does Wall Street like those numbers? Before the
market's recent sell off, the Gap's stock price had doubled in the
past year, and it's still up sharply.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens to companies that fall short? They get
hammered.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, St. John Knits announced that quarterly earnings
would be shy of analysts' projections for the second quarter in a
row. The stock price plunged 30 percent in a single day, and it's
down 60 percent since late May.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzooks, the teen retailer that operates more than 300 stores
nationwide, has been alternately boosted and blasted by investors.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzooks is not a clothing manufacturer, but much of its
business is tied to fashion. When it anticipates a hot teen trend,
as it did with the ``South Park'' phenomenon last holiday season,
sales soar and the stock price follows.
</P>
<P>
   But it suffers when it guesses wrong: Last year, Gadzooks bet on
beige retro-wear only to see the schoolgirl look take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzooks' stock went public at $14 a share in 1995, and within
six months hit $60. This summer, when the company warned investors
that profits would be lower than projected, the stock plunged 40
percent in a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're hot, the market makes you hotter than you should
be,'' says Gerry Szczepanski, the company's chief executive. ``When
you're not, they beat you down unmercifully.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Wall Street valued Gadzooks at $280 million, he
says. Five weeks later, the market value had dropped to $54
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a business, we really hadn't changed,'' Szczepanski says.

YOUR FALL FASHION PORTFOLIO: THE LOOKS, THE STOCKS AND THE BOTTOM
LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fashion business has always been about the ``in'' look. The
cool factor. The style of the stars.
</P>
<P>
   But the hottest fashion craze of the '90s may be the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Tommy Hilfiger, Mossimo, St. John
Knits, Guess?, Gucci. These trend-setting fashion companies usually
don't agree on hem lengths or fall colors, but all seem to concur
about cashing in on Wall Street. In recent years, they've used
stock sales to attract millions of dollars to expand their
businesses, pad their pocketbooks and tout their names around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, going public has worked for them. The question is:
What's in it for you?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer: Some thrills, some spills, some heartache.
</P>
<P>
   With designer clothes, what you see is pretty much what you get.
With designer stocks, the trick is to cut through the style to the
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a stock as a bet on an entire company. The price is
affected by the industry, the economy and conditions around the
world. Buying a fashion stock is not just a gamble on Ralph's
favorite skirt or your ability to pick suits that sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they're buying a brand or a designer, but they're
really buying the whole way the business is run,'' said John
Cabell, who picks stocks for USAA's $680 million aggressive growth
mutual fund. ``It's like looking out over the ocean and thinking
you know what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of the action is beneath the surface. Fish are
eating fish, shipwrecks are decomposing, the world is tumultuous
down there. And you can't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabell has bought _ and sold _ plenty of fashion-related stocks,
including Ralph Lauren, Mossimo, St. John Knits and Gadzooks, a
teen retailer based in Carrollton. His mutual fund still holds
shares of Tommy Hilfiger and Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, but he doesn't
recommend fashion companies for most people.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Kurt Barnard, who makes his living by following the
latest styles.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks have a major disadvantage: They're in the fashion
business,'' said Barnard, who publishes Barnard's Retail Trend
Report in New York. ``And everything that's in fashion also goes
out of fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes famous names lose their cachet, in part because
they're so popular. That alone shows how treacherous the fashion
business can be.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, once the favorite of the youth market, has faced a
backlash for months, especially among teen-agers in Japan. Mossimo,
whose ``sore-eyes'' T-shirt was so popular a few years back that
stores couldn't keep it in stock, is barely moving now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 17 and your 14-year-old brother walks in wearing
the same shirt, you won't put it on again,'' says Kathy Karagin,
marketing director for Gadzooks.
</P>
<P>
   Cabell has other concerns about the rag trade. Many companies
grew up around New York's flashy runway life, so they tend to spend
lavishly on parties and perks. They love edgy, expensive
advertising campaigns, and they often stretch too far to expand
their business.
</P>
<P>
   They may also lag competitors in technology. Some national
retailers, such as J.C. Penney, use electronic controls to monitor
sales and instantly adjust inventory levels. Many artsy designers
still bet on their instincts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the management issue. Many fashion companies are
run by designers or family members, rather than professional
managers. The huge egos that make designers so influential with
consumers can hamstring a company on the business side.
</P>
<P>
   Mossimo Giannulli was the driving force behind Mossimo's
meteoric rise. He designed the popular urban look and orchestrated
the firm's rapid expansion. When sales slowed, costs soared and the
stock slid from $50 a share to less than $5, Giannulli was the fall
guy. He stepped down as chief executive this year, and the company
named John Brincko, a former Barneys executive, to the top post.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan International made a similar move last year. Saddled
with disappointing profits and stock prices, the company removed
Donna Karan as CEO so she could focus on the creative side. It
installed John Idol, a former Ralph Lauren executive, as top
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are sort of like rock stars,'' Cabell says of the
big-name designers. ``They're artists who focus well on building
their name and market share. But generally, there aren't too many
rock stars who can also run the record company.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street and Seventh Avenue are not exactly a natural fit.
The stock market is obsessed with financial numbers and profit
projections. Designers, who are seen as artists, tend to focus on
emotions and passion. That the two worlds would collide is not
surprising.

 &HT;    FACED WITH RISING CRIME, CARIBBEAN TURNS TO HANGINGS AS
DETERRENT
 &HT;    With HANGINGS-BOX-$ADV19.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Sept. 19 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados _ Caribbean governments have a message for
the 250 or so inmates sitting on death row in the region: Hangings
are coming back, and with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Officials stopped hangings in the 1980s in response to protests
from human rights groups. But judges have started to impose the
punishment again, seeing it as a deterrent to rising crime _ much
of it drug-related.
</P>
<P>
   To make it easier to carry out hangings, governments are taking
controversial steps. They're changing their justice systems and
constitutions, and breaking long-standing ties with international
appeals bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once somebody has been found guilty of a really bad murder, I
feel that that person should go down,'' said Barbados Attorney
General David Simmons, a strong proponent of hangings. ``We don't
want to hang people all the time, but we do want to use it for the
worst types of murders.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbados, a country of 266,000 people, generally experiences
only nine or 10 murders a year. But calls to impose hangings have
grown louder in the wake of the shooting deaths of four men in
August that allegedly occurred as gangs jostled over a missing
supply of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in parts of the Caribbean, floggings also have been
revived as a form of punishment after years of being discounted due
to an outcry from human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Floggings are performed with the cat-o'-nine tails, which
consists of nine knotted cords attached to a handle designed to
tear an offender's back to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, for example, a judge in Jamaica sentenced Noel Samuda,
30, to 12 strokes and 15 years in jail for rape and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a feeling that crime is up and that something must be
done about it,'' Simmons said. ``You'll find judges in many
countries imposing tougher sentences on criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International and other groups estimate that there are
nearly 250 prisoners on death row in the English-speaking Caribbean
out of a population of five million _ one of the highest rates in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Kitts and Nevis, the first hanging since 1985 took place
in July when David Wilson was hanged for beating a man to death in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hangings also are imminent in Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago, and
in other Caribbean countries following the hearing of last-ditch
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Neville Lewis, 32, was scheduled to be executed on Sept. 4 in
Jamaica, where the gallows have been idle for 10 years. But Lewis
has appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights,
which may hear the case as early as Sept. 28. Lewis was convicted
in 1994 of robbing and strangling a businessman who asked him for
directions.
</P>
<P>
   In Jamaica, where there were a record-breaking 1,038 murders
last year, support for the death penalty has become widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were killed in shooting incidents in Jamaica last
weekend, bringing this year's total number of murders to 659.
</P>
<P>
   ``If hanging is the penalty, as it is in Jamaica, then those who
ought to hang, ought to be hanged,'' said Jamaica National Security
Minister K.D. Knight. ``Otherwise, the law will become a laughing
stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, there were nearly twice as many people on
death row in the Caribbean as there are today.
</P>
<P>
   But the sentences of many prisoners were commuted to life terms
following a 1993 ruling by Britain's Privy Council _ the region's
final legal arbiter _ that deemed it inhumane to hang inmates who
are on death row longer than five years.
</P>
<P>
   This ruling virtually eliminated hangings since appeals often
drag on for anywhere from five to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Britain banned hangings in 1991 in its five Caribbean
possessions, but they remain on the books in all 12 former British
colonies in the Caribbean, including Barbados and Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Britain has pressured these former colonies to
abolish the death penalty, which the European Union has long
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Privy Council's ruling has so frustrated Caribbean
governments that many have decided to change their constitutions to
free themselves of the council. They hope to replace the council
with a Caribbean Court of Justice _ to be headquartered in Trinidad
and Tobago _ as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ending ties with the council would break a colonial link
stretching back 165 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are re-evaluating our relationship with Britain, and one
reason is because we want to resume hangings,'' said Barbados Sen.
Phillip Goddard. ``There have been some brutal crimes here and the
people here want the government to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean governments also are severing relations with
international appeals bodies that officials say are used by death
row inmates to stall their fates for years.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad and Tobago partially withdrew from the U.N.
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights this year and
pulled completely out of the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica, too, plans to drop out of that commission.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups vehemently oppose the push to revive both
hangings and floggings, saying there is no evidence that they deter
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad trend that is taking shape across the region and
we're watching it closely,'' said Sarah DeCosse, an expert on the
Caribbean for Human Rights Watch in Washington, D.C. ``We are
worried that some due process protections are being taken away from
the prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   But most residents in the Caribbean support harsher punishments,
emphasizing that the relatively small size of the region means
everyone shares the impact of even the slightest increase in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a really bad crime, everyone knows about it, and
everyone feels it,'' said Jeff Cowen, a taxi driver. ``If someone
takes a life, well, we don't believe that person has a right to
live.''

ANTI-LOGGING ACTIVIST KILLED DURING PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An environmental activist from Texas has become
the first fatality in the long struggle between environmentalists
and the timber industry over logging old growth redwoods in
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   David ``Gypsy'' Chain, 24, of Austin was struck in the head and
killed by a falling redwood shortly after noon Thursday near the
town of Fortuna.
</P>
<P>
   Chain, a member of the Earth First environmental group, ``was
out there running through the woods, trying to talk to loggers,
telling them not to fell the trees'' when a falling tree cracked
open his skull, said Darryl Cherney, a local Earth First leader.
</P>
<P>
   The death occurred in a grove being logged by Pacific Lumber
Co., owner of the Headwaters Forest and the focal point of
anti-logging demonstrations. Chain's body was removed by a
California Department of Forestry helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gypsy was the first person ever killed at an Earth First
protest,'' Cherney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Humboldt County Sheriff's Department was investigating the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Lumber President John Campbell said the logging crew did
not see anybody in the area and had no idea Chain was standing
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felled a tree and apparently heard some yelling, and then
the feller was cutting the tree into segments when the body was
found under a limb,'' Campbell said. He added that sheriff's
investigators said Chain's death was ``an unfortunate accident,''
and that the company would conduct its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Earth First spokesman Josh Brown said the organization was ``not
assigning blame to the feller or Pacific Lumber Company or anybody.
It's just a complete tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earth First activists have been protesting what they contend is
illegal logging near Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park for more
than a week. They contend that Pacific Lumber has committed
multiple violations of state law and is destroying the habitat of
the endangered marbled murrelet, a bird that nests in the tops of
old growth redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   Eight activists were arrested for trespassing on Pacific
Lumber's Grizzly Creek logging operation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzly Creek grove where Pacific Lumber is logging is near
but not within the Headwaters Forest and adjoining acreage that is
being purchased by California and the federal government from
Maxxam Inc., Pacific Lumber's parent company, for $495 million.

VIETNAM VETERANS SUE CNN, TIME OVER NERVE GAS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGAME, Calif. _ Unappeased by the retractions and apologies
offered by Cable News Network and Time Inc., 11 combat veterans are
suing both, charging that reports alleging military use of nerve
gas in Vietnam defamed them.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and
intentional infliction of emotional distress was filed Thursday in
federal court at San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   It accuses Time and CNN of intentionally twisting the facts and
sensationalizing reporting in the program titled ``Valley of
Death,'' broadcast June 7 and 14 and published as an article in
Time on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest in a series of problems that have dogged CNN
and Time since the story came out. The news organizations have
already retracted the story and apologized for ``serious faults''
in the reporting. Subsequently, the report's executive producer
resigned, and two staff members involved in reporting the story
were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Neither CNN nor Time responded to requests for comment on the
suit, which is the latest of several filed by a total of 25
veterans involved in _ or linked by the reports to _ ``Operation
Tailwind.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the plaintiffs _ an Air Force pilot, a Marine
helicopter pilot and an Special Forces sergeant _ appeared at a
news conference at their attorney's office to denounce the
reporting and scoff at the apology.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Bishop, 65, a former Air Force major who flew an A-1
Skyraider on Operation Tailwind and dropped concentrated tear gas
on enemy troops, called the program, ``A media My Lai ... a
farce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called retraction wasn't one at all, it was only a
press release,'' said Bishop, who insisted that he had made it
emphatically clear to CNN producer April Oliver and reporter Peter
Arnett that he had dropped concentrated tear gas, not nerve gas, to
assist in the removal of U.S. troops and their allies from the
field. ``What I got was nerve gas questions, and I gave her tear
gas answers.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint alleges that CNN and Time knew or should have
known that the representations made in the program were false in
fact and that its conclusions were reached in the face of
overwhelming contradictory evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy is that the true story is a better story, and
nobody has told it,'' said Joseph Driscoll, 51, of Monterey,
Calif., who flew a Marine Cobra gunship during the four-day
operation in Laos in September 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN-Time retractions were ``as bad as the original story,''
said Michael Sheppard, 60, of Albuquerque, N.M. Sheppard was a
Special Forces staff sergeant who participated in more than 30
cross-border operations in Laos and Cambodia but was not on the
ground in Tailwind, although his photo was shown and his words were
used. ``There was a complete breakdown of responsibility in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   All three men said the lawsuit was not financially motivated: If
they recover money damages, they said, the award would be put into
a charitable trust to aid U.S. casualties of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN program was intended to be an expose of a secret the
military had allegedly kept since the Vietnam War: that U.S.
servicemen used lethal sarin gas in Laos to kill American defectors
and may also have killed innocent Laotian women and children.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sheppard said, the 16 Special Forces troops, along with
about 100 Montagnards (indigenous forces assisting U.S. troops),
were sent to Laos to block the Ho Chi Minh Trail and were given
heavy air cover by the Marines and Air Force to do the job. They
held off or diverted 2,000 North Vietnamese troops, obtained
valuable code books and other intelligence and were extracted from
the field by helicopter with just three Montagnard casualties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon review of Operation Tailwind found no evidence to
support the conclusion that the United States had used nerve gas
during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon investigation, the substance used in
the four-day operation was concentrated but non-fatal tear gas. The
mission's purpose was to gather intelligence and to distract North
Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops from a secret CIA mission that was
under way simultaneously.

THE STARR REPORT FOR KIDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're a parent, the words ``Starr Report'' might make you
blanch in fear. Lucky for you, Cynthia Leacock, a counselor and
children's author, has decided to filter it for fifth-graders.
Leacock, the owner of Novel Writing Publishers, has written ``Ken
Starr's Report for Kids,'' a vastly condensed and considerably
bowdlerized version of the report. It's available on the Internet
at www.novelwriting.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the parents told me is that kids are talking about it in
dirty language on the playground,'' says Leacock, who aimed the
report at fifth- and fourth-graders. ``They don't understand all of
what's going on. Parents want to be armed with information like
this, to help explain it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than read the whole Starr Report, Leacock anticipated the
questions it would create, then answered them in a primer format.
For instance: ``What did President Clinton do wrong?'' and ``What
is impeachment?''
</P>
<P>
   We know, you want to know how she deals with _ well, with that
Bill-and-Monica thing. She sort of dances around it, explaining
that some sorts of extramarital physical contact _ hugs, kisses on
the cheek, platonic kisses on the lips _ are OK, but that the types
that Clinton and Monica Lewinsky engaged in are not.
</P>
<P>
   More typical is the answer to ``Can Congress decide Clinton is
just in trouble?'':
</P>
<P>
   ``They may decide the president only needs a censure,'' Leacock
writes. ``A censure is like when your teacher puts your name on the
board for talking in class; you are in trouble, but you are not
kicked out of school. President Clinton might get in some trouble
for what he did, but will still be president.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have Internet access, call Leacock at (800)
480-9984, and she'll get you a copy of the report. Or fax a request
to (734) 761-8540.

<P>
   &UR; By JIM CASTELLI &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders often talk about a teachable moment -- a time
when events focus public attention on a moral question in an
unprecedented way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the months leading up to the Gulf War,
Americans conducted an extensive discussion about the nature of a
just war.
</P>
<P>
   The eight months since the Monica Lewinsky scandal emerged has
been a painful time for all Americans. But it has also been a
teachable moment -- a time when the public's attention has been
focused on core moral and ethical issues, including the nature of
sin, forgiveness, and trust; professional ethics, and the
connection between private and public morality.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this moment has been squandered. The tone of
moral debate has been set by the tabloids -- a category that now
includes just about all of the media.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some improvement now that the Starr Report is out.
The president himself has said he hassinned and commmitted to
working out his personal problems with an accountability circle of
three ministers.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the only religious leaders who have spoken
out are those who hate President Clinton no matter what he does and
those who love him no matter what he does. Most religious leaders
are extremely reluctant to talk about public controversy involving
sex or partisan politics, and this controversy involves both.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to speak out in a situation that demands cool
heads, nuance and moral perspective is a dereliction of duty on the
part of America's religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be surprising at a time when the professions of
politics, law and media have generally disgraced themselves. But we
expect more from religious leaders, if only because they tell us we
should.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are some of the things that religious leaders, and
anyone concerned about morality and ethics, should be saying:
</P>
<P>
   --It is always wrong to spread false or malicious stories.
</P>
<P>
   --Everyone sins. The American Heritage Dictionary defines sin as
``a transgression of a religious or moral law, especially when
deliberate. Someone once called original sin -- the belief that
every human being sins at some time or other -- the most
empirically verifiable religious belief. Jesus came to the defense
of an adulteress woman by telling a crowd, ``Let he who is without
sin cast the first stone.Lots of people who mistakenly believe they
are without sin are throwing a lot of stones today. No one alive
could go through $40 million of federal investigation and not have
a sin or two turn up.
</P>
<P>
   --All sins are not equal. Sins differ in both their nature and
their context. Stealing a pizza is wrong and so is murder, but the
offenses are far from equal. And stealing a pizza for fun, stealing
it to trade for drugs, and stealing it to feed a starving family
are also very different offenses.
</P>
<P>
   --When someone asks for forgiveness, he or she must also do
penance and take steps to show that he or she will not repeat the
offense. Most of those at the Prayer Breakfast believe the
president is sincere in his efforts to repent and change his ways.
Itis far less clear what the president would have to do to repent
in his public life, partly because the public continues to believe
he's doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   --The test of your commitment to ethical standards is your
willingness to stick to them when it's not convenient. If grand
jury testimony is supposed to be secret, it's supposed to be secret
even when leaking it would give you an advantage. If reporters are
supposed to verify stories before they report them, they have to
verify them even when skipping that stage would give them a scoop.
If we throw out ethical standards to seek a temporary advantage,
then our commitment to those standards is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   --We must evaluate people by the sum of their actions. About 20
years ago I mused to a wizened editor that good people sometimes do
bad things and bad people sometimes do good things. He replied,
``And there are very few good people or bad people.'' We should
practice humility when we attempt to judge people.
</P>
<P>
   --What we think of someone today can change dramatically
depending on what they do tomorrow, or what new facts emerge
tomorrow. We evaluate people in different ways in different
circumstances; we may stop considering someone a friend, but still
admire his or her talents. When George Wallace died recently, he
was remembered as a symbol of racism in the 1960s and early 70s,
but also as a symbol of racial reconciliation since then.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always lived with ambiguous attitudes toward
their presidents. Did John F. Kennedy risk his presidency with his
reckless private life? Did Lyndon Johnson do more good with the
Great Society than he did harm with the Vietnam War? Even many
liberals who detested Richard Nixon when he was in office look back
on many of his domestic policies as surprisingly liberal by today's
standards. Many people who stand by Clinton today believe, for
example, that some of the tough provisions in the 1996 welfare law
he signed were immoral, but still support him for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   --We should evaluate public officials primarily on the basis of
their public responsibilities to advance the common good. Private
action is not irrelevant, but it must be seen in perspective.
Several clerics at the White House breakfast argued that Clinton's
personal failings, which they described as adultery,sexual sin and
broken marriage vows, must be seen in the context of his record as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Morality is often a matter of proportionality. The just-war
theory argues that to be morally justified, the good that a war
achieves must outweigh the evil that it causes.
</P>
<P>
   That's a daunting standard -- one that should apply to every
major public undertaking.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I don't care about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
 &HT;    For months, preachers and pundits have chided the unconcerned
masses -- in whose ranks I find myself -- about our laissez-faire
attitude regarding morality.
 &HT;    Surely, these critics scold, America is morally bankrupt. Does
anyone care that the president cheated on his wife and lied about
it?
 &HT;    Although I can't speak for my fellow citizens, I know why this
scandal fails to engender my moral outrage. I have been overwhelmed
with family matters and have little energy to expend worrying about
who did what with whom.
 &HT;    This summer, as Clinton's troubles multiplied, my father
struggled with lung cancer. For nearly two years, he had fought the
disease with dignity -- using his own small victories to cheer
others fighting cancer.
 &HT;    As the months passed, however, his pain increased and his breath
shortened. Three weeks ago, his lungs collapsed and he died in my
mother's and sister's arms.
 &HT;    Within a few days, my mother, overcome by stress, suffered a
heart attack.
 &HT;    For my family, the nightly news mattered little -- background
noise as we planned my father's funeral; something to watch while
waiting outside the emergency room.
 &HT;    Bill and Monica? Kenneth Starr? Perjury? Those were not our
questions.
 &HT;    Rather, we puzzled over an open casket, an appropriate memorial,
and the funeral sermon. And, the most immediate concern, would mom
make it?
 &HT;    My parents -- not famous, rich, or well-educated -- were always
profoundly decent people. Like everyone, they made mistakes and did
not always make wise choices. They were not perfect parents.
 &HT;    However, they lived with the quiet dignity of many Americans who
try to be good and do the right things. Their world centered on
children and church, monthly bills and the mortgage.
 &HT;    This summer, my father's illness and death pulled me away from
``big issues,'' writing projects, and scholarly research. My
parents needed me. They needed to talk about their fears and needed
to spend time with my daughter. They needed to share memories and
make new ones while there was still time. They needed hands held as
they walked through the journey to death.
 &HT;    My parents' gallant sojourn taught me -- as I have never known
before -- that life's simplest joys are its richest. A dying man
crying as his wife holds him. Pleasure over seeing one's
granddaughter in a pink ruffled party dress. Recalling birthdays,
anniversaries, and family vacations. Telling stories of military
service and old flames.
 &HT;    When I was a bit younger, such things seemed boring and dull.
Now I understand that memories and family stories, common joys and
sorrows weave together lives and generations in what Christian
tradition calls ``the communion of saints.''
 &HT;    My parents persisted in faith in the face of pain and fear to
the end. My father's courage and my mother's compassion (stressful
though it was) have become part of the journey -- for them, for me,
for their grandchildren.
 &HT;    Their struggle was heroic. But it remained hidden to most of the
world. This passion played itself out in the confines of their
family, neighborhood, church, and jobs.
 &HT;    It is on such small stages that most of us enact our own dramas.
In terms of what ``counts'' as fame or influence, my parents --
like most of us -- were not candidates for the nightly news.
 &HT;    Yet these dramas, shape us and enrich our lives. In life's
common places, we face tragedy and triumph, become heroes of our
own epics, and find the mysteries of the universe revealed. In
small ways, faith, hope, and love confront us with powers beyond
our ken. We meet grace. We find God in the journey.
 &HT;    So, columnists and preachers, I do not care about Bill and
Monica because I am busy with the mystery and sadness of death and
helping my mother recover and pay her bills.
 &HT;    I do, however, care about fidelity and truth-telling; I care
about how such things played out for my parents and me. From our
struggles, I know about moral leadership, sin, forgiveness, grace
and mercy. I know -- and care -- about such things.
 &HT;    But I couldn't care less about your political agendas telling me
who, what, and how to forgive.
 &HT;    My parents quietly embodied the courage of a 40-year marriage --
of love, companionship, forgiveness, of birth and death. American
moral decline? My parents? The millions like them?
 &HT;    We care, but we're too busy raising children and paying bills to
obsess about presidential scandal. Sure, we're disappointed, but we
know Bill and Monica are human, too. Their mistakes happen to be on
a bigger stage than ours.
 &HT;    And that's their tragedy. Most of us have the grace of quiet
lives.

WHAT KIND OF KINDNESS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: The first day of Rosh Hashana is Monday, Sept. 21)  
 (For release Monday, 9/21)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By  ? 
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is Rosh Hashana, the first day of the Jewish year 5759, and I
am thinking about a message I keep spotting on bumper stickers and
T-shirts: ``Practice random kindness and senseless acts of
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it seems a warm, uplifting sentiment. In a
world filled with random cruelty, what could be more welcome than
some unexpected kindness? With all the senseless violence human
beings inflict on each other, we can all use a little more beauty
in our lives. Who wouldn't welcome anything that can inspire us to
deeds of kindness and beauty -- even if only an expression on a
bumper sticker?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the more I see this expression, the more it bothers me. The
words are sweet. But taken literally, they convey a troubling
message.
</P>
<P>
   For what our society needs more of is not random kindness, but
sustained and dependable kindess; not senseless acts of beauty, but
beautiful behavior that is deliberately cultivated. Of course a
random kindness is better than no kindness at all. But it is the
ethical equivalent of sitting down at the piano to bang out
``Chopsticks'': quick, easy, and not very serious.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning that lurks in the interstices of ``Practice random
kindness'' is that treating others with compassion and decency is
something to be done as a lark. That is not a philosophy that
promotes kindness as an essential element of good character. It is
a philosophy that promotes kindness as a fun activity for a slow
weekend. This attitude suffuses the recent spate of ``kindness''
books. ``Guerrilla Kindness,'' for example, recommends burying
nickels in sandboxes for children to find when they play. ``Random
Acts of Kindness'' suggests buying coffee for strangers in a diner
or secretly washing a neighbor's car. Something called The Kindness
Society offers this on its Web site:
</P>
<P>
   ``Random acts of kindess are those sweet or lovely things we do
for no reason except that, momentarily, the best of our humanity
has sprung into full bloom. When you spontaneously give an old
woman the bouquet of red carnations you had meant to take home to
your own dinner table, when you give your lunch to the
guitar-playing homeless person who makes music at the corner ...,
when you anonymously put coins in someone else's parking meter ...,
you are doing not what life requires of you, but what the best of
your human soul invites you to do.''
</P>
<P>
   I am all for spontaneously giving bouquets to old women. Any
good deed is to be encouraged, even if it is only done on a whim.
But if kindness is merely spur-of-the-moment gestures, if it is
``not what life requires of you,'' why bother? Because it feels
good? Then what happens when it doesn't feel good? What happens
when it takes a real effort of will -- or a financial sacrifice --
or a significant commitment of time -- to treat someone with
kindness and charity?
</P>
<P>
   How different is the understanding of kindness conveyed by the
Rosh Hashana liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   Today and tomorrow, Jews will revisit the story of Abraham, the
father of the Jewish nation. Each of the three Biblical patriarchs
is regarded as the exemplar of a particular trait, and Abraham is
remembered above all for his acts of loving-kindness. (Isaac's
trait is self-sacrifice; Jacob is the paradigm of scholarliness.)
</P>
<P>
   The Bible portrays Abraham as a man intensely concerned with the
comfort and well-being of others. He leaves his sickbed when he
sees strangers in the distance, ignoring his pain in order to show
them hospitality. He pleads with God to spare the cruel sinners of
Sodom and Gomorrah. So thoroughly does he inculcate the habit of
kindness in the members of his household that when his servant
Eliezer journeys to find a wife for Isaac, the litmus test he
applies is one of compassion: He looks for a girl who is willing
not only to offer him a drink of water, but to draw water for his
camels as well -- a backbreaking chore.
</P>
<P>
   This is kindness of a far higher order than dropping nickels in
a playground or handing out carnations in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jews are the compassionate children of compassionate
parents,'' the Talmud teaches. ``One who is merciless toward his
fellow creatures is no descendant of our father Abraham.'' Jewish
tradition teaches that kindness (ital) is (unital) what life
requires of you -- and even that it is required for life. On Rosh
Hashana, God sits in judgment, deciding who will live and who will
die, whose days will be peaceful, whose tormented. But His
decisions are not unalterable. At the climactic moment of the
service, in the famous prayer of Rabbi Amnon, Jews remind
themselves that ``repentance, prayer, and (ital) acts of charity
(unital) can dissolve a bitter decree.''
</P>
<P>
   The sages taught that God Himself is the original model of
kindness: He clothed Adam and Eve when they were naked, visited
Abraham when he was sick, comforted Isaac in his grief, buried
Moses after he died. We, who are commanded to follow in God's ways
(Deuteronomy 13:5), must likewise clothe the naked, visit the sick,
comfort the bereaved, bury the dead. We pray on Rosh Hashana for
God to treat us with charity and kindness --  &UR; (ital)  &LR; asei imanu
tzedaka va'chesed (unital) -- not randomly but daily, not on a whim
but constantly. He wants the same from us. ``For I desire kindness,
not sacrifices,'' said the prophet Hosea 2,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   My resolution for the coming year is to practice consistent
kindness and thoughtful acts of beauty. May 5759 be for all of us a
year of compassion, charity, and goodwill.

NEW ISSUES DON'T MEAN EASY PICKINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 20)  
(JT) 
 By MARK HULBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Initial public offerings are viewed by many investors as the
ultimate no-brainer. Virtually no homework is required in order to
win. All you have to do is buy a company's stock on the day it goes
public and realize huge one-day profits.
</P>
<P>
   The coming IPO of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. is feeding into this
perception. Like schoolboys flipping through an issue of Playboy,
investors reading the preliminary prospectus are titillated by the
huge sums that the firm's partners stand to gain if, as expected,
the firm goes public this November. Investors want part of the
action.
</P>
<P>
   All but lost is a more important question: Should investors be
drawn to Goldman's IPO simply because it is a new issue?
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to understand why investors think they should.
Imprinted on their memories are IPO success stories like the saga
of Netscape Communications, which soared to more than $75 from $28
on its initial offering day in 1995. IPO's are just so much money
in the bank, they figure.
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing has happened, however, on the way to the bank.
Consider the performance of two newsletters that focus on IPO's:
New Issues, published by the Institute for Econometric Research in
Deerfield Beach, Fla., and Emerging and Special Situations, from
Standard &AMP; Poor's. If returns like Netscape's were readily
achievable, these newsletters should have easily beaten the market.
But I calculate that they lagged behind the return of the Wilshire
5000 by 5.2 and 7.3 percentage points a year, respectively, from
1983 through July 1998. The Wilshire, made up of about 7,600
companies, is used as a proxy for the entire stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the experience of these newsletters unique. Academic
studies have consistently found that the average IPO lags
significantly behind the market in the five years after going
public.
</P>
<P>
   How could the public's perception become so distorted? Memories,
it seems, are selective: Investors far more readily recall the
Netscapes than the laggards.
</P>
<P>
   If this were the end of the story, my advice would be to avoid
the Goldman offering. But it's not, thanks to a recently published
study by two professors, Alon Brav of the University of Chicago and
Paul Gompers of Harvard. They discovered a peculiarity of previous
studies that made the performance of IPO's appear to be worse than
it was.
</P>
<P>
   Here is why: Most companies that go public are of the ``small
cap growth'' variety; they have small market capitalizations and
relatively high price-to-book ratios. Historically, such companies
have underperformed the broad market. When previous studies found
that IPO's underperformed, all they were really reporting was the
pattern of small-cap growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, such studies are not particularly relevant to the
IPO of a business like Goldman, which is certainly not a small-cap
company and may or may not qualify as a growth stock depending on
the price it brings. To correct for this, the professors studied
IPO's after adjusting for market capitalization and price-to-book
ratios. They found that the average IPO matched the market's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is that the investment value of a company going
public has nothing to do with the fact that it is a new issue.
While you shouldn't automatically avoid IPO's, neither should you
reflexively buy them.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one more cautionary note to the findings: More
companies go public near market tops than near bottoms. A company
typically doesn't go public when it thinks the market will
undervalue it.
</P>
<P>
   Where are we now? The Institute for Econometric Research
compares weekly IPO dollar volume with gross domestic product on an
annualized basis. Lower readings are more bullish. This ratio,
which normally fluctuates between zero and 0.5 percent, soared to
2.53 percent in mid-July, when volume was extremely high. Even
though volume has fallen, the current reading is a still-bearish
1.68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that there is no reason to expect that the
Goldman offering will fare better or worse than the market over
all. But the recent pace of IPO's casts doubt on the health of the
market itself.

THOSE TOPSY-TURVY BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 20) 
(JT) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These are strange times in bond land.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, investors in fixed-income securities spend their time
fretting about inflation, which erodes the value of their
investment. But last month the world was tipped upside down.
Worries about too much prosperity evaporated in the face of events
that suggested recession, or even depression, in some parts of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation, it seems, is no longer the issue. The danger now is
deflation, or falling prices.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation late last week, Jack Malvey, chief global
fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers, talked about how
investors might profit from these developments.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A lot of people lost a lot of money in bonds in August. Just
how bad was it?
</P>
<P>
   A. Any way you slice it, August was the very worst month for all
bonds, excluding Treasuries, since January 1973, when we began
keeping our global family of bond indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A. The big event was the Russian splash, the devaluation and
default. But developments in Japan and Washington didn't help. Last
month was a triple punch to the gut.
</P>
<P>
   Those things led to this extraordinary rally in Treasuries, and
left the rest of the sectors sadly lagging, most acutely in the
market for emerging-markets bonds, but everywhere else as well.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much have the Treasury markets improved?
</P>
<P>
   A. At the beginning of the year, the 30-year bond was yielding
5.92 percent. Here we are almost two-thirds of the way through
September, and the yield is down to 5.18 percent. About
three-quarters of that improvement happened in August. Except for
1987, when the equity market cracked, the Fed flooded the system
with liquidity and rates plummeted, there has never been another
period like this.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the volatility behind us now?
</P>
<P>
   A. If you are a short-term investor trying to outperform the
indexes between now and the end of the year, we cannot say that
this is the time to jump in. The uncertainties in the marketplace
will not go away that fast.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about the Fed?
</P>
<P>
   A. We think there is a very high likelihood the Fed will lower
rates, but that it would prefer to have additional confirming
evidence of an economic slowdown before they move.
</P>
<P>
   We think that by November they will have that evidence, and will
begin the process of bringing rates down. Over the course of the
next 12 months, we think short rates could fall by as much as a
full percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At the moment, short rates are much higher than bond yields.
If your forecast pans out, and the Fed does cut short rates by that
amount, where does that put bond yields in a year's time?
</P>
<P>
   A. We see bond yields declining, but in the interim we don't
think they will come down as quickly as short-term rates. We think
bond yields will fall below 5 percent, and perhaps as low as 4.75
percent as a preliminary target. But at this point that is not a
bold prediction.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does it make sense for an individual investor to buy a
30-year bond that yields less than 5 percent?
</P>
<P>
   A. Equity investors probably have better track records when they
use a buy-and-hold strategy. Bonds require more management. If my
father asked if he should buy a 30-year bond at this point, I would
probably say no, buy something that matures in 5 years to 10 years.
Intermediate maturities always make sense.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sort of a time horizon should an investor have?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd say about two years. There is probably a case to be made
in being more nimble and actively involved in fixed-income
investments these days. At some point, and I don't know when it
will be, there will be clear evidence that inflation is back.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How should an individual investor allocate $100,000 in the
bond market?
</P>
<P>
   A. It would probably make sense to put about 40 to 50 percent of
the money in Treasury securities with maturities from one year to
30 years. I would put about $20,000 in a high-quality,
short-duration corporate bond fund, another $20,000 in a short-term
mortgage-backed securities fund. And I would not give up on the
high-yield market. I would have at least 10 percent in good
old-fashioned high-yield bonds. For the tax-conscious investor, put
10 percent of the money in municipal bonds, which are priced at
their most attractive levels relative to Treasuries in about a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what is your economic outlook?
</P>
<P>
   A. We think there will be a growth recession next year, with the
gross domestic product expanding at about a 1.8 percent rate. But
like everyone else we think there is a big potential for error in
that forecast. And there is a scenario where it is possible in
three or four quarters the United States could be on the precipice
of its first recession since 1990. But we are not looking for
financial Armageddon.

COLOR OF MONEY CAN'T HIDE THE DECAY IN ATLANTIC CITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ The tourism and convention crowd likes to
promote Atlantic City as ``America's Favorite Playground.'' A new,
$268 million convention center is marketed as ``America's New
Northeast Business Address.''
</P>
<P>
   At the old convention center, the historic Boardwalk hall that
still hosts the Miss America Pageant, a table in the media room is
strewn with press kits touting everything from hotel/casino
expansion to housing redevelopment projects. If the brochures are
accurate, the gambling business is pouring money into the community
as relentlessly as the tourists are cranking their hard-earned
quarters into slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   And if all this is true _ well, better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   Casino gambling came to Atlantic City in 1978, bringing hope for
economic rebirth in a city that had fallen on hard times after a
long and proud history as one of the Atlantic Coast's great resort
towns.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when cities and states looked upon gambling as a
criminal activity rather than an easy route to souped-up tax
receipts, tourists flocked to Atlantic City in the summertime to
enjoy the simple pleasures of white sand beaches and Boardwalk
amusements. The Miss America Pageant, in fact, was concocted in
1921 as a gimmick to entice out-of-towners to stay past Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   But as vacationers began to seek out destinations that offered
more scintillating pursuits than soaking up sun and strolling six
miles of oceanside Boardwalk, Atlantic City fell prey to the urban
blight that has assaulted so many American cities.
</P>
<P>
   The developers and politicians arrived with an easy solution for
the complicated problems confronting a failing municipality:
Casinos would bring the tourists back to Atlantic City and would
keep them here, not just for an extra week or two in September but
all year round.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected that even the avalanche of cash touched off by
casinos would rescue an entire city _ not overnight, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The developers and casino operators weren't setting up shop on
the South Jersey Shore to engage in philanthropy, after all. Their
purpose was to make money _ as much as they could, as fast as they
could. If some of the money spilled onto the streets of Atlantic
City, good for Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such thing as a quick fix for urban decay.
</P>
<P>
   But who could have guessed that so many residents of Atlantic
City would still be waiting for the casino money to trickle in
their direction? Who could have guessed that now, 20 years after
the first coin plopped into a slot machine, you could look out an
eighth-floor window in one of Donald Trump's hotels and see a slum?
</P>
<P>
   Who could have guessed that in 1998 the eruption of cash from
the Boardwalk would not have reached Pacific Avenue, just one block
away from the glitter of the casino/hotels where money flows as
freely as the complimentary drinks that are served to thirsty
gamblers?
</P>
<P>
   Step out of the massive Trump hotel-casino complex that
surrounds Convention Hall, walk up Florida Avenue to Pacific, and
you are suddenly awash in urban blight. Away from the blinking neon
of the Boardwalk, you suddenly see nothing but rundown buildings
occupied by cheesy cash-for-gold shops and nude go-go joints.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City may be America's Favorite Playground, but it is
also America's Capital of Dichotomy, America's Mecca of
Incongruity. You'd be hard-pressed to find a place where
eye-popping wealth and abject poverty coexist in more intimate
proximity _ or in more apparent obliviousness to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all this is about to change. The Atlantic City Convention
&AMP; Visitors Authority is heralding a ``multibillion-dollar
renaissance'' that will change the face of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority is talking up a
housing program that will encourage home ownership and engender
revitalization of Atlantic City's neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   If all this is true, it's better late than never. If it's all
nothing but empty promises _ well, that's a crying shame.

IS THE PRESIDENT IMPOTENT? 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pragmatist's case against President Clinton--as opposed to
the moralist's--is premised on the notion that he's powerless, so
disgraced and mistrusted that his presidency is finished
politically if not chronologically.
</P>
<P>
   But a peculiar little side drama on Capitol Hill suggests that
this conclusion is not as certain as it seems. It offers evidence
that Clinton's Flytrap weakness can be, in at least one small case,
a perverse source of strength.
</P>
<P>
   The drama concerns one of Washington, D.C.'s dreariest annual
rituals, the appropriations process. Every September, Congress
squabbles over the 13 annual spending bills needed to keep the
government operating. Every year, House Republicans strip funding
from favorite Clinton programs and lard the bills with
anti-abortion and anti-environmental riders. As the end of each
fiscal year looms with no agreement between Congress and the
president, conflict escalates, and the president threatens vetoes.
And every year, a last minute continuing resolution prevents
shutdown (or not, as in 1995-96), both sides make cosmetic
concessions, the bills move, and everyone goes home.
</P>
<P>
   Same story this September. The fiscal year ends in two weeks.
Only one of 13 bills has passed, and Clinton is threatening to veto
seven of the unfinished ones. He objects that the Republicans would
defund education, the International Monetary Fund, summer jobs and
literacy programs and that they have attached unacceptable language
about abortion, the census, and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   It is now an article of faith among conservatives that Clinton
wants another shutdown, that he will gin up a spending fight to
provoke one. Republicans fear that if he picks his issues
carefully--education or the environment, not the IMF (too
foreign)--vetoes some of the spending bills, and blocks a
continuing resolution, he could galvanize disaffected Democrats in
Congress and distract voters from Flytrap.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Times op-ed piece last week called this Clinton's
``domestic ... Wag the Dog strategy.'' Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott and House Speaker Newt Gingrich have repeatedly hinted that
Americans should not be suckered by a Clinton-induced shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   The result, weirdly, is a no-lose for Clinton. If conservative
Republicans are reckless enough to provoke an appropriations
showdown, Clinton will probably win the public relations war,
revive Democrats and ward off Flytrap, exactly what Republicans
fear most. If the GOP doesn't provoke him, he'll be able to extract
concessions in the appropriations bills.
</P>
<P>
   A backdoor appropriations victory is not exactly the
strong-arming triumph a chief executive is supposed to win over
Congress. But for the Flytrapped president, it's better than
nothing.

THINK PINK FOR SPRING, DESIGNERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Do you look pretty in pink? It's a question we're all
going to have to ponder this spring (even men) because that's a
dominant color we'll be seeing in stores.
</P>
<P>
   During this fashion week, a number of designers presented pink _
both hot and soft _ as a top new color for spring. (While most
designers showed their women's spring collections, Helmut Lang
draped male and female models in the hue.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from this fall's conservative gray. Certainly, it
won't be recommended for work. But after seasons of black,
chocolate brown, and now gray and winter white, why not wear a
splash of bright color?
</P>
<P>
   Designers were full of fresh ideas _ perhaps because they knew a
lot was at stake. This week represented the first time in fashion
history that New York-based designers unveiled their collections
prior to the European design houses such as Chanel and Versace.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Americans show comes weeks after those of
designers in London, Milan, and Paris. By showing last on the
fashion calendar, Americans have always faced accusations of
copying _ right off the runway _ the innovations of their European
counterparts. Many believe that by showing first this season New
York-based designers had a chance to prove their creativity (and
score orders from retailers who haven't seen spring clothes
anywhere else yet).
</P>
<P>
   Well, creative they were. Helmut Lang presented lots of
contrasts in his collection, such as cotton-crepe skirts that were
smooth in the front and pleated in the back. Many of his dresses
were sheer organza (in nude or hot pink colors) and were worn over
cotton T-shirts and skirts, creating an interesting layered
dressy-casual effect.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his trousers were decorated with holster-style pouches
(for money or keys, for example) attached at the hip and wrapped
around one leg. And in a true contradiction, model Alek Wek
strutted past the audience in an elegant black silk skirt, sheer
cotton-crepe tank top, and _ go figure _ athletic-looking black arm
pouches worn above her elbows. (They looked like elbow pads.)
</P>
<P>
   Donna Karan presented interesting skirts. Some, made of
parchment taffeta, were of doubled-up fabric twisted around the
models to give a feeling of motion. (They seemed to twirl around
the models' bodies.) Other skirts consisted of long strips of
layered fabrics such as chiffon and organza (like a hula-skirt).
Many of Karan's accompanying sweaters and shirts were oversized,
giving a feeling of comfort and relaxed luxury.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest news in Karan's collection was all the
color. Karan has always embraced black and white as fundamental for
women's wardrobes. This season, however, the designer _ inspired,
she said in her program notes, by the ``beauty of nature'' _
selected soft pink, green, blue, and yellow as some of her colors.
Gray and white were present too. But, in a major shift, there was
no black in the show (although retailers can order any item in
black, the company says).
</P>
<P>
   The designer Jussara Lee opened her show with a live performance
by an accordion player, a signal of what was to come: clothes from
old Europe. Many outfits were peasant-like, with floral fabrics,
empire waistlines, gathered sleeves with ties, embroidered designs,
and hems with ruffles.
</P>
<P>
   Other outfits had apron accessories _ embroidered aprons worn
over dresses and pants. While it was an interesting touch, the
question one has to ask is: Do modern women want to wear aprons on
the street? They certainly can't wear them to work, unless they
work in a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Jussara's collection had some modern elements too, including a
miniskirt (a rarity these days), sparkling and iridescent fabrics,
and trendy drawstring pants.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more interesting designers to show this week was the
up-and-coming German Thomas Steinbruck _ who has worked for
Gianfranco Ferre at Christian Dior and Geoffrey Beene. Two of the
inspirations for his collection (which was displayed in a showroom,
not on a runway) are the ocean and the beach. They're reflected in
his quirky embroideries (lobsters on sheer tops) and his soft
colors (ocean blue and sand-like cream). He also used crinkled
iridescent fabric to create texture in jackets and dresses (like a
rippling ocean) and asymmetrical hemlines to give skirts and
dresses an edge (like a sand dune). His silk-cashmere cardigans
were presented with miniature shells or pearls stitched around the
collar and sleeve cuffs. Taken together, it was a striking look.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 New York-based designers presented collections this
week, including Nicole Miller, Mark Eisen, and Han Feng. But about
40 others _ including Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, and Ralph
Lauren _ are waiting to show during the traditional, official New
York fashion week Nov. 2 to Nov. 6, after the European shows.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these designers aren't opposed to showing before Europe
in theory. But since this week's shows were organized on short
notice over the summer, many of them weren't able to shorten their
production schedules to participate.

   Say goodbye to Buick Riviera. Once again, having perfected a
car, General Motors will kill it. If it's anything the General
can't stand, it would seem to be class.
</P>
<P>
   With the '99 model year, Riviera enters the realm of collectible
_ well maybe the name is already there, at least when it's on a
ragtop. Although Buick has turned out more than a million cars
bearing the Riviera badge since the Riviera first showed up as a
``concept'' in 1963, only 3,000 convertibles were built spanning
1982-1985.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the front-drive, full-size coupe is scheduled to
wind down with a limited-edition 1999 Riviera Silver Arrow _ the
name Silver Arrow is taken from that first concept Riviera still
owned by the Sloan Museum in Flint, Mich. Only 200 of the '99
Silver Arrows are to be produced before the line shuts down for
good Nov. 25 at the Orion, Mich., assembly plant. Only 2,000
Rivieras total are to be turned out for the '99 model year.
</P>
<P>
   The current model, a strikingly handsome exercise in aerodynamic
design, was introduced in model year 1995 to high praise and
general acclaim. The new swoopy Riviera is a far cry from some of
the early editions, as different from that first Silver Arrow as
Boeing jetliners are from biplanes. The Riviera is a study in
style, a delight on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The name goes back to 1949 and the Roadmaster Riviera hardtop,
but the name became a model line in 1963; in 1979, it went
front-drive, sharing a platform with Olds Toronado. It started out
as a $4,333 coupe with a 401-cubic-inch, 325-horsepower V-8. Since
then it's been praised, downsized, a test bed of technology,
upsized, and finally passes from view as a $32,500 exercise in
technical sophistication and style.
</P>
<P>
   So, Riviera joins another front-drive paragon of excellence, the
Buick Reatta, a sporty little coupe/convertible that had been built
in a state-of-the-art modern assembly plant, Buick City, until it,
too, was consigned to the ranks of the collectible _ where it is
prized by the knowledgeable today.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Pontiac Fiero, a revolutionary, plastic-skinned,
two-seater concept that had a painful evolution into a worthy
little car _ dropped as soon as the problems were solved.
</P>
<P>
   And who can forget Cadillac Allante, a two-seater made expensive
by squandering resources on fancy transport and Italian assembly,
made silly with a jukebox dashboard, made history as soon as it
became a really smart little roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Riviera have slumped in recent years, even as the
economy surged. GM would have us believe that the fault lies
somewhere in a market that shuns two-doors, even two-doors with
exceptional styling and a virtually flawless 240-horsepower
turbocharged engine. So how does that explain sales of Japanese
two-doors?
</P>
<P>
   But, let us not rush to blame GM's marketing. After all, the
company has combed the nation to find the best and the brightest in
diaper, cookie, and notions sellers. Riviera, unfortunately, was a
child of car guys.

APHIDS, SCOURGE OF THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 20)  
(JT) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first sign of trouble is an oddly shaped leaf. It's twisted,
and puckered like seersucker, and I know before lifting it to check
the underside what I'm going to find there. Aphids.
</P>
<P>
   Among the insects that plague a garden, the aphid has no equal.
Old-timers call them plant lice, an appropriate sobriquet. A
gardener's life would be easier, nay, blissful, if it weren't for
the lousy aphids.
</P>
<P>
   Aphids suck the life out of plants. They feed on the sap, and
the penetrating mouthparts of a cluster of aphids are what cause
the leaves to become distorted. They can transmit viral diseases
from one plant to another. They excrete sugars from the plant
fluids, which encourage sooty mold, causing the black residue that
often spots the leaves of an aphid-infested plant.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to avoid some insect pests simply by not growing
their favorite plants. I don't, for example, grow China asters
because I can't tolerate the black blister beetle. No such luck
with aphids. There are practically as many species of aphids as
there are plants for them to plague.
</P>
<P>
   The slate-blue aphids on nasturtiums are bean aphids, the
whitish-green ones on kale are cabbage aphids, and the pale green
ones on practically everything are green peach aphids.
Chrysanthemums have their own aphid species, fat and
chocolate-brown. The one that goes after crape myrtle will dine on
nothing else, but the one known as cotton or melon aphid will
attack a wide range of plants, from cucumbers to roses.
</P>
<P>
   They may be black, yellow, orange or rose-colored,
matte-finished or attractively iridescent, like mother-of-pearl.
But the only thing to admire, albeit grudgingly, about aphids is
their efficiency at being a scourge, a role for which they were
brilliantly designed by nature.
</P>
<P>
   Their soft bodies contain little other than a digestive system
and a reproductive system. They do nothing but eat and give birth.
They don't have muscles to speak of; they can barely walk. They
only develop wings if the population gets so overcrowded that they
need to fly off to a new food source.
</P>
<P>
   That can happen pretty quickly. From the time they appear in the
spring, and through most of the year, aphids are all female, and
they reproduce parthenogenetically _ that is, without benefit of
sex. Moreover, aphids bear their young live, rather than laying
eggs that might be vulnerable to predators. An adult aphid gives
birth every single day of its two- to three-week life span, and the
births are always multiple, triplets to sextuplets.
</P>
<P>
   The young are all female as well, of course. They emerge
ravenously hungry, and they start producing their own young in less
than a week. The embryos that will become a mother aphid's
daughters start to develop in her before she is even born, and
those embryos contain the developing embryos of her granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Aphids are fantastically, formidably fecund.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the late fall do male aphids appear, and then only
because the insect must lay eggs that will live over the winter to
become next season's aphid infestation. Thus, controlling aphids is
most critical in the fall. Every aphid sent to its reward in
September is a million aphids that won't be around to infest the
peppers next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, gardeners have allies in this crusade. An aphid's
simplified physical structure makes it easy prey for predators. The
aphid can't move very fast. It walks so slowly, in fact, that
simply washing aphids off with a garden hose each morning can kill
a good many of them. They starve to death before they can climb
back up.
</P>
<P>
   Insecticidal soaps, which clog the aphid's breathing apparatus
and smother it, are useful, but the spraying must be thorough.
You'll need to repeat the soap spray in a few days, too, because
the last act of a dying aphid is often giving birth.
</P>
<P>
   Among natural allies, ladybugs and lacewings are the best known
aphid-busters, and both can be purchased for release in the garden
if the native population isn't keeping up. Adult and larval
ladybugs both eat aphids, but only lacewings attack aphids, and
that is only when the lacewings are in the larval stage. If you
import adult lacewings, bear in mind that you won't see results
until the lacewings lay eggs and the eggs hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Aphids are so plentiful that they are dietary staples for many
other garden inhabitants as well, including spiders, ground
beetles, earwigs and crickets. While it is difficult for me to
regard an earwig as an ally, I am happy for its assistance in aphid
extermination.
</P>
<P>
   A less visible but highly effective destroyer of aphids is a
tiny native wasp, Aphidius matricariae. You're not likely to spot
this insect in your garden. It's only an eighth of an inch long.
It's related to mud wasps, hornets, yellow jackets and other such
insects that are best steered clear of, but it does not sting
gardeners, only aphids.
</P>
<P>
   The wasp lays eggs in aphids. When an egg hatches, the young
wasp devours the aphid, leaving nothing but a papery husk of skin,
from which the wasp emerges to fly off in search of more aphids to
slay.
</P>
<P>
   You'll know you have this miniature benefactor working for you
if you turn over that puckered leaf and spot, among the living
aphids, what look like shiny brown seeds or eggs attached to the
leaf. Those are the mummified remains of aphids, and a sign of
trouble on its way out.

GM DROPPING THE RIVIERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   Say goodbye to Buick Riviera. Once again, having perfected a
car, General Motors will kill it. If it's anything the General
can't stand, it would seem to be class.
</P>
<P>
   With the '99 model year, Riviera enters the realm of collectible
_ well maybe the name is already there, at least when it's on a

bearing the Riviera badge since the Riviera first showed up as a
``concept'' in 1963, only 3,000 convertibles were built spanning
1982-1985.
</P>
<P>
   Production of the front-drive, full-size coupe is scheduled to
wind down with a limited-edition 1999 Riviera Silver Arrow _ the
name Silver Arrow is taken from that first concept Riviera still
owned by the Sloan Museum in Flint, Mich. Only 200 of the '99
Silver Arrows are to be produced before the line shuts down for
good Nov. 25 at the Orion, Mich., assembly plant. Only 2,000
Rivieras total are to be turned out for the '99 model year.
</P>
<P>
   The current model, a strikingly handsome exercise in aerodynamic
design, was introduced in model year 1995 to high praise and
general acclaim. The new swoopy Riviera is a far cry from some of
the early editions, as different from that first Silver Arrow as
Boeing jetliners are from biplanes. The Riviera is a study in
style, a delight on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The name goes back to 1949 and the Roadmaster Riviera hardtop,
but the name became a model line in 1963; in 1979, it went
front-drive, sharing a platform with Olds Toronado. It started out
as a $4,333 coupe with a 401-cubic-inch, 325-horsepower V-8. Since
then it's been praised, downsized, a test bed of technology,
upsized, and finally passes from view as a $32,500 exercise in
technical sophistication and style.
</P>
<P>
   So, Riviera joins another front-drive paragon of excellence, the
Buick Reatta, a sporty little coupe/convertible that had been built
in a state-of-the-art modern assembly plant, Buick City, until it,
too, was consigned to the ranks of the collectible _ where it is

<P>
   Then there was Pontiac Fiero, a revolutionary, plastic-skinned,

   And who can forget Cadillac Allante, a two-seater made expensive

SPRUCING UP FOR HOLIDAYS: IT'S A MITZVAH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 20) 
(JT) 
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   September is the month when my mailbox is jammed with fall
fashion catalogs and glatt kosher caterers have signs in their
windows urging, ``Place your holiday orders now.'' For me, the
coincidence of these two rituals inspires a single unifying drive _
to select a wardrobe for Rosh ha-Shanah and Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as I can remember, I have been gripped by a fashion
fever before the High Holy Days that begins in late August and
peaks in mid-September. This feeling of urgency, the need to buy
something new and special for the Jewish New Year, I believe, is a
lasting effect of growing up in Great Neck, N.Y., an affluent,
predominately Jewish suburb on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Great Neck is a place where I remember women wearing fur coats
over tennis dresses to the supermarket. Where the natural look was
shunned. Where grooming, like chicken soup, was the remedy for
everything.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I would return from summer camp as a girl, where the
electricity was faulty and a blow-dryer didn't always work, my
mother would whisk me off for a ``wash and blow'' at Peter's Place,
a hair salon formerly situated on Middle Neck Road in Great Neck,
and now known as Peter Coppola on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   I remember the exhilaration of passing through the smoked-glass
doors of Temple Beth-El of Great Neck, decked out in a spiffy wool
outfit purchased for the High Holidays. It never mattered that my
turtleneck sweater, midi skirt and opaque tights were too hot and
itchy for the Indian-summer weather that invariably hung over the
holidays. Oblivious to physical discomfort, I felt exalted by the
chance to flaunt something new and stylish before the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years have passed since I observed the holidays in Great
Neck. In Manhattan, at Central Synagogue, where I now attend
services, I can get away with wearing the same old thing year after
year because I'm just another dress in the crowd. But I miss the
communal primping that I remember preoccupying my hometown at this
time of year. So recently, I went back to see if anything had
changed, hoping to re-experience the sacral shopping and ablutions
of my youth.
</P>
<P>
   Coifing for the holidays _ Rosh ha-Shanah begins Sunday night _
it turned out to be just as frenzied as I recalled. ``The women
start the big work _ the highlights, hair straightening _ about a
week to a week and a half before the Jewish holidays,'' Michael
Mazzei, the owner of the Nubest Salon on Northern Boulevard in
Manhasset, told me. Thirty percent of his clients are from Great
Neck. ``The books have been filled up six weeks in advance for the
Sunday before the holiday,'' he said. ``The clients want the hair
and nails done. We will need an extra 10 cutters.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition to be well dressed is just as fierce as always.
The hunt for holiday attire begins early, in the dog days of
summer. Pity the congregant who puts off her shopping till the last
minute. By early September, the local clothing racks are likely to
be lined with nothing more than empty hangers.
</P>
<P>
   Right after Labor Day, Shari Kaynes, the owner of Shari's Place,
a Great Neck boutique selling high-fashion designers like Thierry
Mugler and Moschino, confirmed: ``We hardly have any skirt suits
left. We're waiting for a new shipment. The best selection is in
August and mid-September, if you can wait that long. But it's
cutting it close to the Jewish holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest you think all is vanity, only vanity, the fall fashion
sprees have a religious grounding. Wearing something new for a
festive occasion is a mitzvah, a commandment and good deed in
Jewish law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an expression of one's feeling of respect for the
occasion to dress up,'' said Jerome Davidson, the senior rabbi at
Temple Beth-El. ``The High Holy Days represent not only the
beginning of the year but a time of spiritual renewal, a sense of
cleansing and purity. To some, being nicely garbed would reflect,
in an outer way, the inner importance of renewal.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, I did not know that there was a rabbinical seal of
approval to shop. If I had, I might never have become a religion
school dropout by age 10. I still went to synagogue twice a year,
for the Jewish holidays, but I only lip-synced the Hebrew prayers.
Buying a new outfit was one of the few rites I could cling to. I'm
not sure whether the liturgical imperative meant lingering outside
temple, sizing up other congregants, but that's what we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``A holiday means something new,'' Ms. Kayne said. ``You don't
want to repeat last year's suit. This is a place where you see your
acquaintances, friends and family. If you're fashion-conscious, you
want to look right.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even pressure to buy not just one, but two new
outfits, the first for Rosh ha-Shanah, the New Year, and the second
for Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. For some, not having that
second outfit was close to sinning. ``You had to have two outfits,
because God forbid you'd be seen in the same outfit for Yom
Kippur,'' recalled Cindy Markowitz, 37, a childhood friend who now
lives in Hewlitt.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, much has changed in Great Neck. The
Orthodox are now more prominent, with additional synagogues and
meeting places. The Lubavitch Chabad, a Hasidic group, recently
established a religious center in the town. A large influx of
Middle Eastern Jews, particularly from Iran, has led to the
building of at least three Sephardic synagogues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the great majority of Jews in Great Neck are
non-Orthodox, and most businesses remain open on the Sabbath, there
are more kosher butchers now than when I lived there, as well as
new stores and markets catering to Persian tastes. Great Neck is no
longer the real-life version of Philip Roth's fictional world of
Jews who have assimilated.
</P>
<P>
   But thankfully, some things have stayed the same. ``I'm here 30
years _ it hasn't changed,'' said Shari Zelin, 36, of Great Neck.
``You go to temple, you wish everyone `Good yom tov' _ `Happy and
healthy New Year' _ you tell everyone they look beautiful, and
`Where did you get that outfit?'''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The turning point in the adultery code came at a press
conference on May 6, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald had staked out the Washington townhouse of
former Sen. Gary Hart, a leading Democratic presidential candidate,
and reported that it appeared he had spent the night with a woman
who was not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hart had been dogged by whispers of womanizing, but he had not
been terribly indiscreet and _ after the Herald went public with
its revelation _ his wife stood by him and accepted his pleas of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, if it doesn't bother me, I don't think it
ought to bother anyone else,'' Lee Hart told the press.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, that would have been all. But this time the
press would not drop the story. In The New Republic, then-editor
Michael Kinsley crowed: ``We are witnessing the breakdown, at long
last, of an anti-democratic conspiracy among the Washington elite
of journalists and politicians to keep information from voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart withdrew from the race. But before that, something more
important happened. At that press conference, Paul Taylor of The
Washington Post asked The Question. ``Have you ever committed
adultery?''
</P>
<P>
   That word ``ever'' obliterated the old rules. It declared that
any act of infidelity, never mind how discreet, was part of the
public picture for a public figure. The door was blown off the
closet, at least for politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, understandably baffled, stammered that he did not have to
answer the question _ the right answer, at least by the old rules,
although it did not save him.
</P>
<P>
   If what might be called a decent hypocrisy as to adultery no
longer affords protection to a man or woman, then what rules are we
playing by?
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing the band of possible behavior from, say, ``Be
discreet'' to ``Do nothing that might ever start a rumor'' _
because rumors will be investigated _ is unlikely to give us a
higher standard of morality among politicians and public figures.
(In any case saints make lousy leaders.)
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely that adultery will be flushed out into the
open more often. The closet will shrink or even disappear. What
then? Either exposed adulterers will be steadfastly condemned and
disgraced, even (sometimes) against common sense and the wishes of
the betrayed spouse. Or people will retreat from condemning so
human a sin and will decide to relax about it instead.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate these options, consider two fairly obvious
examples of figures caught up in high-profile adultery stories:
Kelly Flinn and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Air Force's Lt. Flinn, the first woman to
pilot a B-52, was threatened with court martial and forced out of
the service after authorities learned that she had been conducting
an affair with a civilian who was married (Flinn was single) to an
enlisted woman who served on Flinn's base.
</P>
<P>
   The armed services' rules against adultery used to be enforced
in the usual hypocritical way (wink wink). But there were good
reasons for punishing Flinn: She had lied to her superiors; she had
disobeyed an order to change her conduct; she had threatened morale
and order by her interference in the marriage of an enlisted
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to punish Flinn raised important questions.
What does consentual adultery have to do with flying a plane?
Should a bit of hanky-panky destroy a career into which the
government had put a great deal of energy and money?
</P>
<P>
   The military found itself in an absurd position. Without the
protection of hypocrisy they faced the possibility of a decimated
officer corps. The Flinn case led to the case of Army Maj. Gen.
John Longhouser who, despite a long and distinguished career, was
forced to retire after a telephone tip revealed that he had carried
on an affair while separated from his wife, five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff, was disqualified for the top job after it emerged that he
had carried on an affair 13 years earlier, although he too had been
separated from his wife at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a policy that was both consistent and committed,
the hapless generals set up a sexual misconduct hotline. But in the
wake of the Flinn affair, reports of adultery came in so thick and
fast that the Army shut down the hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officers expressed concern that minor transgressions were
ending the careers of distinguished officers. The story confirmed
what we already knew: no public, legalistic system of anti-adultery
rules can work.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the second alternative to hypocrisy is the one it seems _
at least in view of current post-Starr-report Clinton popularity
polls _ we're going to adopt: airing adultery in public and
shrugging about it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bill Clinton. This gnawing case shows that what is
happening now is the reverse of what ought to happen: adultery is
being condemned legally and excused morally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Gennifer Flowers went public with allegations that
Gov. Clinton had carried on an affair with her, this was rightly
seen as reflecting on the character and veracity of a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing we knew, Clinton was on television, with Hillary
Clinton at his side, doing what honesty demanded: confessing to
problems in their marriage, and that he'd admitted wrongdoing, and
showing they had patched it up and asked for the people's
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The people gave it _ as they should have done, in the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But step back, and what you see is this: In 1987 a bright young
presidential candidate got caught with his pants down and was
forced out of the race; in 1992 another bright young presidential
candidate got caught with his pants down and was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in 1992 the public, probably for the first time,
decided that it could live with an acknowledged adulterer as
president.
</P>
<P>
   What makes for uneasiness is not the adultery but the
combination of open inquiry, open acknowledgement and open
indifference. Thus, by the time Monica Lewinsky entered the
picture, Clinton had all but dropped the pretense of marital
fidelity, and the public had all but dropped the pretense of
caring.
</P>
<P>
   This made the aftermath of events all the more perverse. As part
of an officially unrelated investigation into sexual harassment,
Clinton was asked under oath whether he had had sex with Lewinsky.
He denied it.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky was taped, saying she and the president had had an
affair and that, with the White House's encouragement, she lied
about it, the matter became one of perjury: a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   On national television in 1992, during the Flowers affair,
Clinton had been asked The Question. Could he say that he had never
committed adultery? He replied: ``I'm not prepared tonight to say
that any married couple should ever discuss that with anybody but
themselves.'' Translate: don't make me lie.
</P>
<P>
   That was the right answer; it had been for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   By now, in 1998, the law gives no quarter to tradition; a
self-propelled legal process makes the traditional answer not just
hypocritical but illegal. The lawyers were going to ask and the
president would have to tell _ never mind that he, his wife and his
mistress all had agreed, for the protection of his presidency and
of their own families, to bury the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is the worst of all possible worlds. Lying about
adultery, even in the interests of all concerned, has been made
effectively illegal.
</P>
<P>
   When the adulterer's closet becomes a zone of legal peril,
adulterers will simply abandon it and take their chances with
openness. According to a Newsweek poll, adultery is already at the
bottom of the list of reasons for voting against a presidential
candidate. As people get used to hearing about this or that
prominent person's infidelities _ a U.S. president here, a British
foreign secretary there _ the taboo evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt that honesty has its good points. And yet, as with
illegitimacy, abortion and dependency, we have found that there is
a price for destigmatizing behaviours which should be discouraged
but are not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Today most people in the United States agree that adultery is
wrong, and only a few admit to engaging in it: Fewer than one in
four men, and about half as many women, report ever having been
unfaithful. Of course, people lie about adultery, so those figures
should be taken as lower bounds. But that is the point.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a society in which, say, 50 or 75 percent of adults
cheerfully admit to infidelity; people take adultery for granted; a
wife's threat to go public or a boss' threat to be shocked ceases
to be much of a deterrent, and it becomes harder to tell children,
with a straight face, that cheating is really, truly, wrong _ which
is still a fairly useful thing to be able to say.
</P>
<P>
   But a better rule than saying ``Who cares?'' _ effectively
shrugging at adultery _ is: If the adulterer takes all reasonable
steps to be discreet, if he (or she) performs his (or her) duties
as parent, spouse and citizen, and if his (or her) spouse chooses
to hang on, then nothing has happened. This is not covering up; it
is being grown-up.

<P>
   The turning point in the adultery code came at a press
conference on May 6, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald had staked out the Washington townhouse of
former Sen. Gary Hart, a leading Democratic presidential candidate,
and reported that it appeared he had spent the night with a woman
who was not his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Hart had been dogged by whispers of womanizing, but he had not
been terribly indiscreet and _ after the Herald went public with
its revelation _ his wife stood by him and accepted his pleas of
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, if it doesn't bother me, I don't think it
ought to bother anyone else,'' Lee Hart told the press.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, that would have been all. But this time the
press would not drop the story. In The New Republic, then-editor
Michael Kinsley crowed: ``We are witnessing the breakdown, at long
last, of an anti-democratic conspiracy among the Washington elite
of journalists and politicians to keep information from voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart withdrew from the race. But before that, something more
important happened. At that press conference, Paul Taylor of The
Washington Post asked The Question. ``Have you ever committed
adultery?''
</P>
<P>
   That word ``ever'' obliterated the old rules. It declared that
any act of infidelity, never mind how discreet, was part of the
public picture for a public figure. The door was blown off the
closet, at least for politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, understandably baffled, stammered that he did not have to
answer the question _ the right answer, at least by the old rules,
although it did not save him.
</P>
<P>
   If what might be called a decent hypocrisy as to adultery no
longer affords protection to a man or woman, then what rules are we
playing by?
</P>
<P>
   Narrowing the band of possible behavior from, say, ``Be
discreet'' to ``Do nothing that might ever start a rumor'' _
because rumors will be investigated _ is unlikely to give us a
higher standard of morality among politicians and public figures.
(In any case saints make lousy leaders.)
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely that adultery will be flushed out into the
open more often. The closet will shrink or even disappear. What
then? Either exposed adulterers will be steadfastly condemned and
disgraced, even (sometimes) against common sense and the wishes of
the betrayed spouse. Or people will retreat from condemning so
human a sin and will decide to relax about it instead.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate these options, consider two fairly obvious
examples of figures caught up in high-profile adultery stories:
Kelly Flinn and Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Air Force's Lt. Flinn, the first woman to
pilot a B-52, was threatened with court martial and forced out of
the service after authorities learned that she had been conducting
an affair with a civilian who was married (Flinn was single) to an
enlisted woman who served on Flinn's base.
</P>
<P>
   The armed services' rules against adultery used to be enforced
in the usual hypocritical way (wink wink). But there were good
reasons for punishing Flinn: She had lied to her superiors; she had
disobeyed an order to change her conduct; she had threatened morale
and order by her interference in the marriage of an enlisted
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to punish Flinn raised important questions.
What does consentual adultery have to do with flying a plane?
Should a bit of hanky-panky destroy a career into which the
government had put a great deal of energy and money?
</P>
<P>
   The military found itself in an absurd position. Without the
protection of hypocrisy they faced the possibility of a decimated
officer corps. The Flinn case led to the case of Army Maj. Gen.
John Longhouser who, despite a long and distinguished career, was
forced to retire after a telephone tip revealed that he had carried
on an affair while separated from his wife, five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff, was disqualified for the top job after it emerged that he
had carried on an affair 13 years earlier, although he too had been
separated from his wife at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for a policy that was both consistent and committed,
the hapless generals set up a sexual misconduct hotline. But in the
wake of the Flinn affair, reports of adultery came in so thick and
fast that the Army shut down the hotline.
</P>
<P>
   Senior officers expressed concern that minor transgressions were
ending the careers of distinguished officers. The story confirmed
what we already knew: no public, legalistic system of anti-adultery
rules can work.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the second alternative to hypocrisy is the one it seems _
at least in view of current post-Starr-report Clinton popularity
polls _ we're going to adopt: airing adultery in public and
shrugging about it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Bill Clinton. This gnawing case shows that what is
happening now is the reverse of what ought to happen: adultery is
being condemned legally and excused morally.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, when Gennifer Flowers went public with allegations that
Gov. Clinton had carried on an affair with her, this was rightly
seen as reflecting on the character and veracity of a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing we knew, Clinton was on television, with Hillary
Clinton at his side, doing what honesty demanded: confessing to
problems in their marriage, and that he'd admitted wrongdoing, and
showing they had patched it up and asked for the people's
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The people gave it _ as they should have done, in the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But step back, and what you see is this: In 1987 a bright young
presidential candidate got caught with his pants down and was
forced out of the race; in 1992 another bright young presidential
candidate got caught with his pants down and was elected president.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in 1992 the public, probably for the first time,
decided that it could live with an acknowledged adulterer as
president.
</P>
<P>
   What makes for uneasiness is not the adultery but the
combination of open inquiry, open acknowledgement and open
indifference. Thus, by the time Monica Lewinsky entered the
picture, Clinton had all but dropped the pretense of marital
fidelity, and the public had all but dropped the pretense of
caring.
</P>
<P>
   This made the aftermath of events all the more perverse. As part
of an officially unrelated investigation into sexual harassment,
Clinton was asked under oath whether he had had sex with Lewinsky.
He denied it.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky was taped, saying she and the president had had an
affair and that, with the White House's encouragement, she lied
about it, the matter became one of perjury: a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   On national television in 1992, during the Flowers affair,
Clinton had been asked The Question. Could he say that he had never
committed adultery? He replied: ``I'm not prepared tonight to say
that any married couple should ever discuss that with anybody but
themselves.'' Translate: don't make me lie.
</P>
<P>
   That was the right answer; it had been for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   By now, in 1998, the law gives no quarter to tradition; a
self-propelled legal process makes the traditional answer not just
hypocritical but illegal. The lawyers were going to ask and the
president would have to tell _ never mind that he, his wife and his
mistress all had agreed, for the protection of his presidency and
of their own families, to bury the affair.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is the worst of all possible worlds. Lying about
adultery, even in the interests of all concerned, has been made
effectively illegal.
</P>
<P>
   When the adulterer's closet becomes a zone of legal peril,
adulterers will simply abandon it and take their chances with
openness. According to a Newsweek poll, adultery is already at the
bottom of the list of reasons for voting against a presidential
candidate. As people get used to hearing about this or that
prominent person's infidelities _ a U.S. president here, a British
foreign secretary there _ the taboo evaporates.
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt that honesty has its good points. And yet, as with
illegitimacy, abortion and dependency, we have found that there is
a price for destigmatizing behaviours which should be discouraged
but are not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Today most people in the United States agree that adultery is
wrong, and only a few admit to engaging in it: Fewer than one in
four men, and about half as many women, report ever having been
unfaithful. Of course, people lie about adultery, so those figures
should be taken as lower bounds. But that is the point.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a society in which, say, 50 or 75 percent of adults
cheerfully admit to infidelity; people take adultery for granted; a
wife's threat to go public or a boss' threat to be shocked ceases
to be much of a deterrent, and it becomes harder to tell children,
with a straight face, that cheating is really, truly, wrong _ which
is still a fairly useful thing to be able to say.
</P>
<P>
   But a better rule than saying ``Who cares?'' _ effectively
shrugging at adultery _ is: If the adulterer takes all reasonable
steps to be discreet, if he (or she) performs his (or her) duties
as parent, spouse and citizen, and if his (or her) spouse chooses
to hang on, then nothing has happened. This is not covering up; it
is being grown-up.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Truman Show,'' Laura Linney plays Jim Carrey's wife, an
actress pretending to be a real person. In life, Ms. Linney is an
actress struggling to project a movie star, now that ``The Truman
Show'' has brought her the widest attention yet during a career
built on theater and television.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing to attend the Venice and Deauville Film Festivals,
where ``The Truman Show'' made its Italian and French premieres
recently, Ms. Linney faced a real-life star quandary: What, oh
what, to wear?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, for every Hollywood actress in distress there is a
designer eager to come to the rescue, happy to link the name of a
design house to that of a celebrity. Susan Sarandon has Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana. Nicole Kidman has John Galliano. Ms. Linney has Donald
Deal.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me?
</P>
<P>
   Deal, a smallish evening-wear designer popular with Vanessa
Williams, Toni Braxton, Lisa Kudrow, Kathie Lee Gifford and Barbara
Walters, caters to stars who care more about looking quietly
terrific than being current with the trends. That's perfect for Ms.
Linney, who is inching toward high fashion with baby steps. ``I
went to Cannes with `Absolute Power' when it closed the festival,
and that was overwhelming,'' she said, recalling the frenzy of
flashbulbs scrutinizing her _ and her outfit _ for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, she sat on a white sofa at the center of Deal's
living-room-like showroom, in the garment district. ``I need
help,'' she admitted.
</P>
<P>
   With her blond hair falling gently around her face and
shoulders, Ms. Linney comes across very much like Mary Ann
Singleton, the earnest Midwestern transplant she played in ``Tales
of the City,'' the television version of Armistead Maupin's
chronicles of San Francisco in the 1970s. Like her roles, Ms.
Linney is normal-seeming and approachable.
</P>
<P>
   Uma Thurman may have played a character named Poison Ivy in
``Batman Forever,'' but the down-to-earth Ms. Linney actually gets
the rash. As she made her preparations to jet off to Europe, her
wrists were streaked with it. ``Ugh _you should have seen it a week
ago, swollen out to there!'' she said, explaining how she
contracted poison ivy while planting blueberry bushes at her
Connecticut home. ``I was praying it wouldn't spread to my face.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier meetings with Deal, Ms. Linney had picked through his
collection for gowns and dresses suited to the two European
premieres, each with its sartorial challenges. ``The direction for
Venice was formal,'' Deal said. ``They're honoring Sophia Loren.
Deauville is seaside, less formal. There's a red carpet in Venice,
which makes it much more formal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time for final fittings. An assistant brought out the
Deauville gown, a low-cut sarong, composed of a sheer black outer
layer and a lace skirt beneath. The sophisticated sexiness of the
dress had unnerved Ms. Linney when she first tried it on. Her
instinct had been to change at once, but Deal persuaded her to take
a good look at herself in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little shy when it comes to fashion,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Given her upbringing, that's surprising. Contrary to her
farm-fresh image, Ms. Linney, 32, was born and reared on
Manhattan's Upper East Side, the daughter of a nurse and Romulus
Linney, the playwright. She majored in theater history at Brown
University, learned her craft at Juilliard and honed it on
Broadway, most recently in ``Honour.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal understands her skittishness about fashion. ``There's an
identity crisis when people have to dress up, and I don't think it
has to be that intimidating,'' he said. ``She comes up here, and we
play. We try on 15 different gowns. We put on long, we put on
short, we try sling-backs, we try pumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney returned from the dressing room in the Deauville
gown, teetering atop a pair of black suede Valentino pumps.
``Well?'' she asked, turning to display the full effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darling, you look fabulous,'' gushed Cindy Berger, her
publicity agent. It was Ms. Berger who had introduced Ms. Linney to
Deal in the first place, during a search for something to wear last
spring for ``Late Show With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship that has evolved between actress and designer
is typical of the love fest between Seventh Avenue and Hollywood _
a marriage of mutual promotion. Ms. Linney receives Deal's evening
gowns, which retail for $2,000 to $5,000, at a discount (the
designer would not say how much). In all, she went to Europe with
eight or nine Donald Deal dresses _ a well-made match between a
semifamous actress and a semifamous designer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Deauville dress, Ms. Linney looked transformed: the
plunging neckline and the hemline just above the knee showed off a
Barbie doll figure. Catching sight of herself in the mirror, she
looked innocently pleased. ``Who KNEW?'' she said, mimicking a
Brooklyn accent. ``Who woulda thought?''
</P>
<P>
   Deal said little, busily looking for flaws in the fit. The
direct attention of a designer is one reason Ms. Linney is devoted
to Deal. She could have sought out a more high-profile designer
(and indeed, Donna Karan outfitted her for daytime press junkets),
but Deal's more modest business allows him to personally dress Ms.
Linney, rather than delegating the job to a subordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney knows how rarefied her shopping experience is; she is
not yet blase about the perquisites of stardom. ``It's very easy to
take this type of relationship for granted, for any actress who's
being dressed and being offered clothes,'' she said. ``I'm really
learning from Donald.''
</P>
<P>
   She disappeared into the dressing room again, to try on the
dress for Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not fluff,'' Deal said in her absence. ``I feel I'm
represented well, not just because of her talent, but because she
carries herself well.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes pride in being somewhat distant from the fashions of
the moment. ``I'm not here to tease or shock or provoke, and that's
where fashion seems to be going right now,'' he said. Deal, 39,
credits his traditional interpretation of high glamour to an
apprenticeship with James Galanos, the master dressmaker, who was a
favorite of Nancy Reagan's. ``What's interesting is that the
clients don't want to be noticed when they dress up to go out,'' he
sighed. ``That's why they always go for black.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Linney made a second entrance, this time in the Venice
dress, a floor-length, loden-green halter dress with black satin
straps and diamante clips at the bust and waist. A slit in the
front opened to reveal legs as long as Cyd Charisse's. ``Feel
this,'' Ms. Linney said, holding up the green velvet of her skirt.
``This dress feels like it's been painted on _ in the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was formality that was to be the order of the night in
Venice, the dress delivered. Why, it even had a train. ``A lot of
women don't know how to walk with a train,'' Deal said, adding that
the hard part is executing a turn. ``They start walking, and they
walk down the dress, and soon they're walking on their knees,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unexpectedly, Ms. Linney demonstrated the way to do it. ``What
you do is turn, then kick the train out of the way and walk,'' she
said, gliding around the showroom. ``You can't always hold it, and
the only time you want to gather your dress is when you're walking
upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   But how had Ms. Linney, a self-described fashion neophyte,
learned such a maneuver? Had she been taking secret lessons in
high-gloss glamour?
</P>
<P>
   No, she said. ``I learned it from my theater training.''

IN SILICON VALLEY, TALENT IN RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)  
 (bl)  
 By VIVIENNE WALT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, Michael Bowles was skulking outside his office at
Hughes Electronics in El Segundo, Calif., whispering on public
telephones to potential investors and pleading for financing to
start his own cable modem company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty discouraging,'' he said. ``None of them knew me,
and they had a lot of trepidation about handing over a company to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowles, 49, finally pieced together the money to move to
California's Silicon Valley and start Com21 in Milpitas. In classic
Valley style, though, the thrill ended for him the moment the
company went public last January. But rather than return to the
phone booth, he became one of the high-technology industry's most
desired modern commodities: an entrepreneur in residence.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that for six months, Crosspoint Venture Partners in
Woodside, Calif., paid Bowles to scrutinize potential business
plans and pick which company he might want to run next _ ``quite a
contrast'' to his situation five years earlier, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just sat around and talked about, `Gee, wouldn't this be a
cool business?''' Bowles said. Three months ago, he founded iBeam
Broadcasting, an Internet satellite broadcasting company, with
financing from Crossport.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley's frantic hunt for the new, cool and profitable
has come to rely increasingly on executives like Bowles, who,
between jobs, set up shop in venture capital firms and plan their
next moves. Several venture capitalists say they regard the
arrangement not only as a successful strategy but also as a crucial
edge in the scramble for good investments.
</P>
<P>
   The concept isn't new. Since the early 1980s, larger venture
capital firms have brought in _ sometimes for as long as two years
_ managers they regard as candidates to run a company. The firms
introduce these entrepreneurs to potential investors, have them
evaluate business plans and draw up their own.
</P>
<P>
   Until two years ago, though, competition for such posts was so
fierce that they were unpaid. The opportunity alone, said John
Mumford, the managing director at Crosspoint, was something
entrepreneurs ``would just die to come do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They received no pay,'' he added, ``and, in fact, they would
have paid the VCs to sit there and find the next golden nugget.''
</P>
<P>
   But Silicon Valley's arithmetic has shifted the balance of
power. Awash in capital, many venture capital firms have more money
to invest than can readily be soaked up by new, sure-fire
companies. In one measure, Venture Economics, a research firm in
Manhattan, said venture capital firms raised $10 billion in 1997;
through just the first half of 1998, the firms raised $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And in the second quarter, venture capital investments in the
Valley alone were $1.24 billion, one-third of all venture funds
spent nationally, according to a survey of 721 companies by
PricewaterhouseCoopers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As capital has flooded in, the number of start-up deals has so
accelerated that venture capital firms have been left begging for
people to run the new companies.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, entrepreneurs in residence have become high-priced
chief executives in waiting. According to those interviewed, they
earn about $10,000 a month from the venture capital firms, a
princely rate that Mumford calls ``stupid'' but which is paid
partly to keep the entrepreneurs from going elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneurs face few rules or expectations. When they find
a business plan they like, they don't even have an obligation to
choose their sponsoring firm as an investment partner _ though
almost all do.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the goal is to breed a group of loyal entrepreneurs
who will return again and again to the venture capital firm to
build their next companies and thus undercut the executive
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent pool has been very, very heavily diluted because of
the amount of new companies being formed,'' said Steven Baloff,
general partner of Advance Technology Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif.
``Fifteen years ago, if your company failed, it was a black mark on
your resume. Now venture capital firms almost prefer it. You've got
your scars, and you've learned some hard lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Chris Risley announced last year that he was
resigning as chief executive of On Technology, a network management
software company in Cambridge, Mass., venture capitalists on both
coasts began calling him. He declined all offers, moved to Silicon
Valley and spent three months vacationing throughout California
with his wife, Susan, and son, Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he became an entrepreneur in residence at Bessemer
Venture Partners in Menlo Park, where he spent six months reading
``several deal pitches a week.'' Two weeks ago, Risley joined
Insite Innovations, a software start-up in Menlo Park, as its chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   His transition, he said, might have been trickier without the
entrepreneur-in-residence program. He said the most common mistake
entrepreneurs make ``is to send in a business plan in the hopes
that someone will get excited and call them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, that never turns into a deal,'' he said.
``You need a meeting to do a presentation, and for that, you need
someone to refer you to a venture capitalist.''
</P>
<P>
   That need gives the entrepreneurs in residence a huge advantage.
In turn, it also risks creating a fairly narrow circle of start-up
executives.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bowles, he could be set to become another of the Valley's
most highly prized commodities: a start-up addict. Mumford of
Crosspoint, who has backed both of Bowles' ventures, expects to see
him again. ``Mike will be back in our office starting a new company
a year from now,'' he said.

DETAILS OF HYDE AFFAIR CAME FROM TENNIS MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While powerful Republicans accuse the White
House of leaking the Henry Hyde infidelity story to an Internet
political magazine, a World War II veteran says the secret was
first revealed through an offhand remark at a tennis match six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a damn lie that I have any connections to the White
House,'' said retired salesman Norm Sommer, reached at his
Aventura, Fla., home. ``I'm a 72-year-old World War II vet who
doesn't want to see a bloodless coup at the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer says he was the moving force behind a story by Salon
magazine that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde had an
affair with a married woman in the 1960s. Salon broke the story
Wednesday, and the Illinois Republican admitted the affair. Hyde
was not a member of Congress at the time of the extramarital
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   David Weir, managing editor of Salon, insisted Thursday that
Sommer _ not the White House _ had tipped off Salon.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, absolutely no one from the White House, or connected
to the White House, had anything to do with the story,'' Weir said.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Republicans have openly accused the Clinton administration
of planting the story in an attempt to discredit or intimidate
Hyde, who as head of the Judiciary Committee is responsible for
investigating impeachment allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, asked the FBI Thursday
to determine whether the White House was the source of the story
about Hyde's affair. DeLay said he wanted to know whether
administration officials had tried to unlawfully intimidate a
congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt who it is,'' DeLay said. ``I just don't have
the evidence to prove it, and that's why we want the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer said he had heard of the affair six years ago while
changing sides during a doubles tennis match with Fred Snodgrass,
whose wife, Cherie, had the affair with Hyde. One of the players
mentioned that he used to make suits for Hyde, Sommer said, and
Snodgrass exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred stopped dead in his tracks and started shouting, `Henry
Hyde? That son of a bitch ruined my family,''' Sommer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Snodgrasses were divorced. Cherie Snodgrass, now Cheries
Soskin, lives in San Antonio and told the San Antonio Express-News
Wednesday that she had an affair with Hyde 30 years ago but did not
know at the time he was married.
</P>
<P>
   Weir said staff members of the San Francisco-based magazine had
been able to put the story together solely because of help from
Sommer and members of Snodgrass' family.

   FAWWARA, Lebanon _ Seven years after Lebanon's militias laid
down their arms to end a many-sided civil war, Rabih Elia is still
afraid to go home.
</P>
<P>
   A Maronite Catholic, Elia fled the Shouf Mountains in the 1980s
when fierce fighting broke out between religious factions. His
family's stone house, part of a string of communities built along a
ridge, has been deserted ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Elia, like other Maronites, feels safer living in Junieh, a
French-speaking Christian suburb north of Beirut. The Shouf, he
says in English with a slight French accent, is dominated by the
Druse, a breakaway sect of Islam whose militia battled the
Christians during the war, and by Syria's occupation army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have perfect security here and we are afraid of
fighting between the Christians and the Druse,'' said Elia on a
recent visit to Fawwara under government auspices.
</P>
<P>
   His sentiments are shared by most Maronites in Lebanon, whose
animosities with the Druse date back more than a century. Their
fear highlights what may be the biggest problem faced by Lebanon's
weak central government as it tries to resurrect itself from the
rubble of a civil war: how to get the country's 17 different sects
to live together once again in peace.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting turned the landscape upside down when terrified
civilians sought safety with their own factions. Sometimes, entire
communities traded places. By the time the 17-year war ended in
1991, the warring sides had carved Lebanon into a mosaic of
sectarian districts and displaced as many as 900,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lebanon is as divided along religious lines as ever, with
Christians, Druse, Shiite Muslims and Sunni Muslims, all of whom
fought each other at one time or another, dominating different
regions. While rebuilding has begun on a limited scale,
reconciliation among the country's religious factions remains
elusive, and Lebanon's wartime agonies endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war really changed the communal landscape of Lebanon,''
said Farid el-Khazen, a political scientist at the American
University of Beirut. ``People feel more comfortable living in
their own communal areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Resettlement is not the only difficulty Lebanon faces. The
country's big plans for reconstruction, so far concentrated almost
exclusively along Beirut's seafront, have plunged the government
into billions of dollars in debt. In the south, a costly guerrilla
war grinds on against Israel, which occupies a 10-mile-wide zone
next to its border.
</P>
<P>
   But many Lebanese worry that the ancient religious hatreds
lurking beneath a veneer of peace enforced by Syrian troops pose
the most dangerous threat to the country's long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a $700 million government effort to rebuild war-torn
villages, skeletons of concrete and brick dot the mountain sides
where Maronite and Druse villages once thrived, sometimes side by
side, before the war broke out in 1975. While some Druse have begun
to trickle back to their homes, most Maronites have not.
</P>
<P>
   Elia, now 24 and an accountant in Junieh, admits that it is
unlikely he will ever return to Fawwara to live. He did go back
recently to attend a government-sponsored camp aimed at healing the
sectarian hatreds unleashed by the war.
</P>
<P>
   But the camp did little to change the thinking of most
Maronites. Of the 150 Christian and Druse families who lived in
Fawwara before the war, only 30 have moved back. In Brih, a mixed
Christian-Druse village built on the next mountain ridge over, the
Christians have not returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really feel comfortable with the idea of living
here,'' said Elia. ``We are scared. The Syrians are with the Druse
now. The people are afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such fears, Lebanon's billionaire prime minister, Rafiq
Hariri, has pushed ahead with a $1.6 billion plan to reconstruct
Beirut's bombed-out Central District, where prolonged fighting
between Muslim and Christian militias turned luxury apartments into
crumbling slums.
</P>
<P>
   A wheeler-dealer who made his fortune in construction in Saudi
Arabia, Hariri has put up $125 million of his own money toward the
rebuilding, and so far the project to transform the gutted district
into chic residential areas and business parks is on track.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials hope the new buildings will help Beirut
recapture some of its prewar glory when the glittering Arab capital
was known as the Paris of the Middle East. ``Beirut will be one of
the most important cities in the region,'' predicted Hariri's
spokesman, Abdul Satar al-Laz.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the seafront district, little has changed. Thousands
of impoverished people remain crammed in bullet-riddled buildings.
Lebanese guerrillas are fighting the Israelis in southern Lebanon.
And, as Elia's visit to the Shouf Mountains indicates, it will take
much more than money to erase the scars left by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a lot of effort,'' said Narkiss Naoum, a
political scientist at the American University of Beirut. ``The
differences between the Lebanese religious communities are still
very big.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other people of the Middle East, the Lebanese have often
defined themselves more by their religious affiliation than by
their national identity. Religion, in turn, has shaped the
country's politics, particularly after it gained independence from
France in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Lebanon's constitution reserved the
presidency for the Maronites, who essentially ran the country,
concentrating their political power and wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution required the prime minister to be from the
Sunni Muslims, Islam's dominant sect, and the Sunnis shared in
power and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The Druse were not given a specific position in government, but
they nonetheless wielded great power. The constitution did require
that the speaker of Parliament come from the Shiite sect, Islam's
largest minority.
</P>
<P>
   The Shiite population, among the poorest, grew so rapidly in the
years after independence that they became the largest sect in the
country by the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Their ignored demands for increased power were one of the two
chief causes of the civil war in 1975. The other was the arrival of
Palestine Liberation Organization fighters in Beirut, following
their ouster from Jordan. The PLO and Muslim militias formed an
alliance and fought side-by-side in the early years of the war
against the Christian militias.
</P>
<P>
   The Taif Agreement, which helped bring the civil war to an end
in 1991, maintained those same sectarian divisions of government,
but stripped the presidency of most of its authority and gave the
Muslims more power.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lebanon's postwar governments have tried to play
down the country's religious differences, in part by promoting the
army as a unifying force. On the streets of Beirut, posters of
fatigue-garbed soldiers cover walls with the slogan, ``We are all
the army.''

<P>
   LEBANON: the army.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The drive seems to be working. When six soldiers were killed
earlier this year by Israeli troops in southern Lebanon, the local
media quickly pointed out that each belonged to a different sect.
``The incident really brought people together,'' said Firass
al-Amine, a journalist at the prestigious Arabic daily, An-Nahar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, some Lebanese say the presence of Syria's occupation force
is the main reason that the country's fragile peace is holding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (Syria), there is a potential for tensions to arise,''
said Georges Khoder, a Greek Orthodox bishop who writes a weekly
column on politics and ethics for An-Nahar.
</P>
<P>
   Radwan al-Sayyad, an Isamic studies professor at Lebanese
University in Beirut, agreed. ``If Syria left, we may not have
civil war but we will have political trouble. There definitely
would be troubles,'' he said. ``We still have sectarian tensions.''
</P>
<P>
   While others may disagree, one thing is certain: With 35,000
troops patrolling Lebanon and a feared intelligence network
operating in the shadows, Syria has become the real power broker
here.
</P>
<P>
   A postwar Treaty of Cooperation sealed Syria's grip, while
Syrian troops at checkpoints keep a jittery public under control.
Every year several Lebanese disappear at the hands of Syrian
operatives, according to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Syria's hold makes it unlikely that Lebanon will strike a
separate deal with Israel soon. Israel wants to reach an agreement
on security arrangements before it withdraws its 1,500 troops, who
have occupied the so-called ``security zone'' since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts say Syrian President Hafez Assad would
undermine an Israeli-Lebanese peace agreement because it would
leave him with little to pressure Israel into returning the Golan
Heights, a plateau of snow-white mountains and grassy ranches that
Syria lost in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Syria pulls out of Lebanon, it is unlikely that the
Christians, particularly the Maronites, would regain the privileges
they enjoyed before the war.
</P>
<P>
   President Elias Hrawi, hand-picked by Assad, is a Maronite, but
critics say he does not represent the majority of the country's
700,000 Maronites who despise the Syrians. ``They want to keep
their hegemony, but they can't. They do not have the means.'' said
Naoum, the political analyst at the American University of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   To Muslim, Druse and even Greek Orthodox Lebanese, the
Maronites' loss of power was long overdue and a just reward for
having allied with Israel during the civil war. When Israel
withdrew from Beirut in 1983, Druse revenge led to battles like the
one that drove Elia and his family from the Shouf Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christians have two choices,'' said Naoum, ``to be pro-Syrian
so that they can have protection for their community, or to
continue their struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second choice _ this means suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Since reconstruction began in 1994, some 10,000 mostly Syrian
workers have demolished 650 bombed-out buildings along Beirut's
seafront and picked up 5 million cubic meters of garbage to make
way for Prime Minister Hariri's Central District project. New
highways have been cut along the Mediterranean. Beirut's airport,
caught in the line of fire for much of the war, has been renovated
and reopened.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department has lifted a ban on Americans
traveling to Lebanon, and U.S. businessmen have started to return.
Later this fall, the country's first McDonald's is slated to open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lebanon is moving toward better days,'' said Jean Zoghzoghi,
the 30-year-old scion of a wealthy Lebanese family, who recently
acquired the McDonald's franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the air of optimism, Lebanon holds together like a
tattered patchwork quilt,
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian north, as many signs appear in French as in
Arabic. Young women wear miniskirts and high-heeled pumps.
Bikini-clad swimmers parade at exclusive beach clubs, and western
restaurants attract European tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern suburbs of Beirut, where the bearded Shiites of
Hezbollah rule the streets, the miniskirts disappear, and the clean
sandstone streets of the north give way to crowded, crumbling ones
in the city. Women don veils and long, shapeless coats, while
yellow-and-black Hezbollah flags flutter from telephone poles.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours' drive to the east, in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon's
primary agricultural area, the atmosphere changes again. There,
murals of Syrian President Assad and his late son, Basel, tower
over villages and farms, where Muslim workers pick tobacco under
the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Another two hours' to the south, murals of the late Iranian
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeni, greet the people. Women walk
outdoors garbed in black, head-to-toe chadors, which are also worn
by Iranian women.
</P>
<P>
   But at places like B018, a disco in Beirut where the children of
the rich, Muslim and Christians alike, gather to drink and dance on
black stone ``martyrs' graves'' all night, the country's sectarian
divisions are less evident.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even among those who pretend not to care, religion can
get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a Christian marries and looks for an apartment, he still
looks in east Beirut,'' said al-Amine, the An-Nahar journalist. ``A
Muslim, when he marries, looks for one in west Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Lebanese give no thought to crossing this barrier, said
al-Amine, the seeds of the civil war will finally have disappeared.
Then, the rebuilding and reconciliation can truly begin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Lebanese believe that the country's sectarian divisions
may be hard, if not impossible, to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a generation for people to go back to their
previous ways,'' said el-Khazen, the political scientist. ``Maybe
it will never happen.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Next week I have a job interview. I really want the job, but
I know there will be many other candidates. Some people seem to
glide effortlessly through interviews and get offers every time
they apply. But for me, the process is a stressful ordeal, and
though I am often told I've made the short list, I rarely get an
offer. How can I make myself stand out from the crowd this time?
</P>
<P>
   A. Be yourself. Take deep breaths. Maintain eye contact. Dress
conservatively. Ask questions. Blah, blah, blah. All of these
much-mouthed chestnuts are true, and not one will distinguish you
in a field of candidates, all of whom have also been practicing
firm handshakes and interested gazes. To seal the deal, you need to
transform your interview from a generic Q&AMP;A into a demonstration of
your abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't just sit there like a bump on a log,'' says Nick A.
Corcodilos, a longtime headhunter and author of ``Ask the
Headhunter'' (Plume, $14.95). ``Tell the interviewer that you'd
like to talk about what you see as some of the challenges of the
business, how you would address those challenges if hired and how
you could make the company more successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Get specific, he says. ``Suggest to the interviewer, `I'd like
you to lay out a hypothetical problem I'd be facing and let me roll
up my sleeves and try to solve it,''' he urged. ``It takes real
brass to do this, but if you don't feel you can at least attempt
it, you have no business in that interview.''
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the wisdom of the Boy Scout credo: Be
prepared. Do not walk into an interview without first doing your
homework. ``It is really, really key that someone comes in knowing
a lot'' about the company, said Margaret Ingate, a vice president
in charge of recruiting and selection at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, recruiters and hiring consultants recommend pulling
out the stops: Search the library and the Internet for news
articles about the company; gather information about top
competitors and clients, as well as industry trends; and, of
course, see if the company has a World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this requires more effort than working up pithy answers to
the top 10 interview questions. But a little legwork could be the
difference between ``Welcome aboard'' and ``We'll call you.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into an interview armed with information and ready to
discuss how you would do the job shows that you're motivated and
resourceful. It also takes the pressure off the interviewer to keep
things moving.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dirty little secret of interviewing, according to
Pierre Mornell, author of ``45 Effective Ways for Hiring Smart''
(Ten Speed Press, $24.95), is that most managers hate the process
more than candidates do. ``It can be so boring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By opening the door for your interviewer to discuss the business
_ and the ways you can contribute _ you turn the conversation
toward practical issues that she knows and cares about. You can
worry about that firm handshake later.

DIGITAL-COMPUTERS (Los Angeles) _ Sales of DVDs are up as more
people are buying players to watch good-looking movies with great
sound. Plus, the discs contain lots of extras like director
interviews and movie trailers, and can be conveniently stored. But
DVD-ROMs _ computer-oriented titles of games _ have been slower to
come to market. By David Bloom. 
. 
FALL-TV (Los Angeles) _ Television is the lagging indicator of
popular culture. In the movies we got ``Boogie Nights'' and ``54.''
Now TV's finally jumping on the bandwagon with a mess of '70s
shows: Last year ``Love Boat'' came back; this year it's ``Fantasy
Island.'' Even a revised ``Charlie's Angels'' is in the works. By
Keith Marder. 
. 
BESTWORST-TV (Los Angeles) _ Six networks, 36 new shows and _ if
you listen to the networks _ each one is either the next
``Seinfeld'' or the next ``ER.'' They are all liars. This was
another in a long line of poor network television development
years. All of the inventive stuff is popping up on cable as the
networks regurgitate old themes and poorly executed plots. By Keith
Marder.

CATEGORIES-TV (Los Angeles) _ Television has been copying itself

ECONOMIC VIEW: THE HAVE-NOTS, AT LEAST, ARE USED TO THIS WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)  
(lb) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Income inequality is taking on a new dimension these days. Not
only have people's weekly earnings grown more disparate than in the
past; what they possess _ their accumulated wealth _ has also grown
more unequal lately. The haves and the have-nots, or more precisely
those who have prospered and those who have stood still, are
becoming easier to tell apart. Now the have-nots might get a break.
</P>
<P>
   The haves in this race _ the hares, so to speak _ are the 25
percent to 30 percent of all U.S. households that in the 1990s have
become much wealthier than many ever anticipated. They are the
families earning north of $75,000 a year, often far north. And
while they own homes, they have invested most of their savings in
the stock market, which boomed fabulously until midsummer.
</P>
<P>
   Their net worth, adjusted for inflation, has grown by nearly 20
percent since 1989. The least wealthy among them are worth more
than $100,000, and the nest eggs go straight up from there.
</P>
<P>
   The have-nots _ the tortoises _ are the mass of families earning
less than $75,000 a year but more than $25,000, just enough to
afford a semblance of middle-class life in much of the country.
Their incomes, adjusted for inflation, have remained largely
unchanged, despite a brief rise in 1989 and another one now.
</P>
<P>
   These families' biggest investments are their homes, which rose
smartly in value in the 1970s and 1980s, often outpacing the stock
market, and family net worth grew in tandem. The 1990s have been an
entirely different experience for these families: For the first
time, their net worth shrank; it has made only a partial recovery
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is that the assets of these families, mainly
housing, were not the big winners of the 1990s,'' said Edward
Wolff, an economist at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   In the children's story of the tortoise and the hare, the steady
tortoise wins the footrace. But the odds of a tortoise victory in
the net-worth race are remote, although the tortoise has closed the
gap slightly.
</P>
<P>
   A victory would require that housing prices, employment and
earnings all hold up as the national economy slows or falls into a
recession brought on by the spreading Asian crisis. Stock prices
would have to fall simultaneously, far more than they already have.
By some estimates, the Dow Jones industrial average would have to
drop to 5,500 or below for the tortoise to edge out the hare.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, housing wealth has been more equally
distributed than stocks and most kinds of other financial wealth,''
said James Poterba, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``If house prices rise and stock prices fall, that
translates into more equalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new information on household wealth comes from
Wolff, who has analyzed data collected by the Federal Reserve Board
through 1995 and has calculated projections for 1996 and 1997. The
Economic Policy Institute has provided additional information.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists agree with Wolff's findings, although some
question his definition of wealth. Wolff, for example, includes
401(k) plans and similar retirement accounts, but he excludes
Social Security, most company-paid pension plans, and ``things'' _
the appliances, furniture and cars, for example, that families own.
Counting these would raise estimates of the wealth of the less
affluent.
</P>
<P>
   By Wolff's calculation, the median wealth in the United States
(the level at which half of all households have more, and half
less) rose to $54,600 in 1989, from $51,000 in 1983 and $36,200 in
1962. But it fell from the 1989 peak to $45,600 in 1995, and then
rebounded part way, to $49,900, last year. (All these figures are
adjusted to 1995 price levels.)
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the decline are clear enough: Home prices have
risen, particularly since 1996, but mortgage debt and home equity
loans have risen faster, diluting net worth.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending has risen faster than earnings, forcing
middle-level families to borrow or cut into liquid savings, which
they hold mostly in bank accounts. Many more Americans own stock
today than in the past, and this is billed as evidence that the
benefits of a rising stock market are spreading across the
population. But in fact, the vast majority of shareholders have
less than $10,000 in stock and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   So the tortoises have actually lost wealth during the economic
expansion of the 1990s, which is now perhaps ending. If wealth is a
buffer against job loss, the tortoises are less secure than they
were in 1989. And if political clout and campaign contributions are
linked, then the growing wealth of the upper 25 percent of hare
households has made them even more politically powerful .
</P>
<P>
   But there is a silver lining, or a gray one. ``If the market
continues to take a hit, that will demoralize wealthy Americans
more than the less affluent,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of
DYG, a polling firm. The latter ``are used to seeing their wealth
decrease, and won't feel as bad.''

SOME DVD MOVIES INCLUDE GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sales of DVDs are up as more people are buying
players to watch good-looking movies with great sound. Plus, the
discs contain lots of extras, like director interviews and movie
trailers, and can be conveniently stored.
</P>
<P>
   But DVD-ROM games for personal computers have been slower to
come to market. That's despite recent projections that as many as
40 million DVD-ROM drives will be sold for computers by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   New Line Cinema hopes to take advantage of that disparity with
its Oct. 6 release of what it's calling a ``hybrid'' DVD disc for
its movie ``Lost in Space.'' While the disc will contain the usual
things for television DVD players (the movie, etc.), computer users
will get more.
</P>
<P>
   A menu automatically pops up listing games and other options,
including reading the screenplay and jumping to corresponding
scenes while listening to the writer/director. For those with
Internet connections, the movie's Web site is a click away.
</P>
<P>
   Once at the site, they can use a Sim Earth-like program to
create their own planet, tweaking the atmosphere, oceans, land
masses, plant and animal life and can get feedback about the
planet's chances of thriving.
</P>
<P>
   One area is pitched to teen-age girls, others provide heavy
science background, more film information and a 3-D shooter game.
</P>
<P>
   Another intriguing area takes live audio feeds from giant
antennae monitoring the universe's transmission of radio waves at
various frequencies as part of the search for extraterrestrial
life. Those eerie sounds can then be sampled, mixed and combined to
create a true Music of the Spheres.
</P>
<P>
   New Line officials said the disk is a model for what they hope
to do with some other upcoming titles, including ``Blade'' and
``Rush Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Marc Randolph, president and CEO of NetFlix.com, which sells and
rents DVDs on the Internet, said he's bullish on the future of
``hybrid'' discs such as ``Lost in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   The DVD platform offers so many possibilities for the makers of
games and movies that it's just a matter of time before developers
begin truly exploiting the possibilities, Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   And DVD players are considered the future multimedia heart of
such entertainment platforms as Microsoft's WebTV and the next
generation of Sony's PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare what you get with `Lost in Space' on DVD vs.
what you get on a VHS tape, there's so much more,'' Randolph said.
``It's one of those things that's tremendously impressive compared
to what came before it but absolutely is only a first step toward
what will come in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   LET 'EM HEAR YOU: Whether it's a pothole down the street or the
presidential peccadillo of the week, there's finally a place
designed to help you exercise your right to petition the
government, or at least your (least) favorite politician.
</P>
<P>
   E-The People, a Web site at!bold!www.e-thepeople.com/, will help
you e-mail letters to any of an estimated 140,000 public officials
with 7,000 city, county, state and federal governments. If the
official doesn't have e-mail, the site will fax your letter
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people want to get involved,'' said the
site's founder, Alex Sheshunoff Jr., a 24-year-old Yale history
grad. ``But they don't want to spend three hours waiting in a
public meeting to speak for three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's best feature is that it helps figure out who you
should write to for a specific problem, such as that pothole that
just swallowed your car's front end, a common complaint, Sheshunoff
has found.
</P>
<P>
   You can choose from 28 general issues (including ``other''),
decide whether you want to send it to a national, state or local
politician, and give your ZIP code. The site comes back with a list
of who should be written to, and then shepherds you through the
rest of the process of sending the e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very large historical perspective,'' Sheshunoff said,
``it's plausible we can use technology to come back to
participatory democracy. When I first came up with this, I heard a
lot of people talking about the Internet and democracy, but not too
many people writing code (to do anything with it).''
</P>
<P>
   E-The People users also can create or sign petitions on a
variety of issues and determine who should get copies and who
should receive the final product. The site definitely is still in
beta mode, which means bugs have to be eliminated before it works
smoothly. For instance, though I was using Version 4.04 of Netscape
Navigator, the site wouldn't display the checkboxes you need to
click to choose who will receive your e-mail or petition.
</P>
<P>
   Sheshunoff said the bugs should be stomped out of the site by
early October. Once done, this site has real potential to increase
the flow of information between the governed and the governing, so
we the people can make ourselves heard.
</P>
<P>
   AD-ING LESS, NOT MORE: Much as the benefits of technology are
enjoyable, one of its most frustrating aspects is how much easier
it is for advertising and marketing to seep into every corner of
its existence.
</P>
<P>
   The latest sign of the end of civilization is word that pkWare,
a Wisconsin software company, will include advertising content in
some versions of its best-known product, the compression program
pkZip for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The content will only be included in the shareware version of
the program, and even then, the company will distribute a
nonadvertising-supported version. And registered users _ those who
have paid the fee _ get spared the ads also.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, this approach makes sense as a way for shareware
authors to actually generate enough money to keep creating cool,
cheap software. In that situation, it's not much different from
magazine or newspaper publishers using advertising revenues to
reduce or eliminate subscription charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the possibility of avoiding more ads would be incentive
enough to pay for an ad-less version of software. Hmm, maybe this
isn't such a bad idea after all.
</P>
<P>
   THE MARCH OF TECHNOLOGY: Now come two welcome bits of news from
the world of technology. First, Intel has announced price cuts of
as much as a third on its computer chips. That'll mean cheaper,
more powerful computers in the near future at a time when prices
are already dropping on everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Some off-brand, non-Intel-based computer systems are already
being advertised for as little as about $600. At this rate, it
could get ridiculous, but who's complaining?
</P>
<P>
   And the smart folks over at Lucent Technologies (which used to
be known as Bell Labs back when it was part of AT&AMP;T) have figured
out a way to make cell-phone batteries last a month between
rechargings. So you'll have one less useful excuse for hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   GAME THEORIES: The Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences is
sponsoring a series of seminars on video-game design at its Los
Angeles headquarters over the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   The first session is at 7 p.m. Oct. 8 and features George
Collins of Pandemic Studios talking about how to apply the lessons
of 1970s games to modern CD-ROM design. Collins designed
Activision's Battle Zone most recently.
</P>
<P>
   Other sessions will be held Oct. 22, Nov. 5 and 19, and Dec. 10.
The academy's offices are at 10635 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 180,
Century City. Call (310) 441-2280 for further information, or check
www.interactive.org on the Web.

FASHION SQUARE EXIBITS HALF-CENTURY OF STYLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Perky little hats, suits with long, narrow
skirts, gowns that look like slips and feature beadwork ...
</P>
<P>
   They're all part of our past. And our present.
</P>
<P>
   To see how they fit into our current fashion stance, take a
gander at the special exhibit from the Fashion Institute of Design
and Merchandising in Los Angeles that is currently on display at
Fashion Square mall in Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute to 50 years of fashion will be held on the lower
level of the mall, along with current designs from local retailers.
There's also a clothing drive at the mall to benefit the Discovery
Shops of the American Cancer Society in Toluca Lake. If you've got
something to donate, take it to the concierge desk in the center of
the mall and they'll give you some shopper's coupons as a thank
you.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're there, check out the Judith Leiber evening bag
exhibit at Bloomingdale's. They've got oldies on loan from
shoppers, as well as new designs on display through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still on mall patrol? There's a free fashion show sponsored by
the Acrylic Council at 12:30 and 2:30 p.m. today at the Glendale
Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   And at all Kmart or Sears stores, you can find Martha Stewart's
new house paint collection. The decorating maven has 256 colors
available, each packaged like an ice cream container. And just so
you won't commit a fashion faux pas, the paint chips feature
complementary shades on the back of each chip.
</P>
<P>
   LOST AND FOUND: You're off the beaten track, can't find your way
and refuse to ask somebody for directions. Miz Hot Tips knows all
about men who would rather take the scenic route than ask for help,
so she was thrilled to hear about two new auto navigation gadgets
that are quicker to read than a map. For the budget-conscious
there's Road Whiz, a small high-tech gadget for $29.95 with limited
directions. And for those who are direct descendants of Christopher
Columbus, there's UltraFinder, a hand-held electronic device with
mega-sized memory chips to give you complete directions,
turn-by-turn. It'll even calculate the nearest restaurant, hotel
and gas stations for you. For that kind of service, expect to pay
the price: $99.95.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S GOOD MANNERS: You've finally been invited to the boss's
house for dinner _ and there's that little fork at the top of the
plate (it's for dessert), plus two forks on the left. If only you'd
listened to the latest installment of the Instant Genius cassettes
by etiquette expert Letita Baldrige. It's a 60-minute tape to keep
you from making all kinds of social faux pas in the areas of table
manners, introductions, thank you notes, and even body language.
The cassette is $12 and the CD is $13 at Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders
Books &AMP; Music stores.
</P>
<P>
   STAR-STRUCK PRODUCTS: Miz Hot Tips wonders how many celebs who
endorse products actually use them. For instance, she's seen Jaclyn
Smith shopping at Neiman Marcus a couple of times, and she knows
the store does not sell her line of clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, for those who do follow the stars, Cybill Shepherd is
the newest Ultima II spokesperson and is now hawking Glowtion skin
brightening moisturizer on TV. You can find the moisturizer at J.C.
Penney and several upscale drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to appeal to those not yet worried about wrinkles or age
spots, Cover Girl cosmetics has hired pop icon Brandy as its
spokesgirl. And she's even singing the company's praises in
television commercials already airing.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jane Seymour is busy advertising do-it-yourself hair
color. It apparently improved her appearance, as the Dallas
International Apparel Mart is going to honor her on Oct. 16 with
its annual Personal Style Award.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks in part to Monica Lewinsky and the prez, Zegna ties
are now a household name. On Oct. 11, the Italian menswear company
will be in the spotlight again, but this time as the presenting
sponsor of the eighth annual Environmental Media Association
Awards. They'll be held at Will Rogers State Historic Park in
Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   ROMANTIC ONE-LINERS: So, you're in love and can't think of a
single romantic thing to say to him or her? You'll get plenty of
help from the new book ``Happily Ever After'' by Helene and Jim
McMullan ($16.95; Angel City Press). The authors, who have been
married 28 years, quote the best of the world's love lines, from
philosopher Nietzsche's comment that ``the best friend is likely to
acquire the best wife,'' to actress Jill Clayburgh's mother's
suggestion: ``Marry a man with good teeth and high arches.'' Think
of it for wedding and anniversary gifts.

FALL TV OFFERINGS LOOK QUITE FAMILIAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Don't like standing in line for movies?
</P>
<P>
   Think the stage is for snobs?
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a reader?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, because if anything is good in another medium,
television is bound to do its own treatment _ albeit a watered down
and homogenized version.
</P>
<P>
   Television, particularly network prime-time programming, has
lost its will to take risks. And with all the new shows based on
tired trends scheduled to air this season, which officially starts
Monday, television is quickly solidifying its status as the lagging
indicator of popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when a network would risk offending some
viewers and advertisers for the sake of quality with such shows as
``NYPD Blue.'' This year's raciest effort is ``Will &AMP; Grace,''
about a gay man and his female buddy. But take the homosexuality
away, and you have another ho-hum half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of television's position of being in the home, it has
a desire not to offend the mass audience,'' said Anna Everett,
assistant professor in film studies at the University of
California, Santa Barbara. ``They need to play it safe. And when
you play it safe, you don't tend to be a leader. You want to rely
on something that is a proven success. Television really wants to
shun controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   But by doing so, TV is also shunning viewers. Network ratings
are at an all-time low, and viewers are moving to cable programs
such as HBO's ``Oz'' and Comedy Central's ``South Park,'' which
take chances and break new ground. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Industry watchers say the viewer exodus to cable is largely
happening because networks are content to rehash old stories and
premises. True to form, the new fall schedule is more of the same,
with plenty of shows playing off themes already proven to be
popular.
</P>
<P>
   More than two years ago, platform shoes and hip huggers sneaked
back into teen fashions. Then those '70s images resurfaced to
mainstream consciousness with such theatrical releases as ``Boogie
Nights,'' ``54'' and ``The Ice Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Feature films already have moved on to the '80s with ``The Last
Days of Disco,'' ``The Wedding Singer'' and ``There's Something
About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   And, what does television do?
</P>
<P>
   It has launched ``That '70s Show'' (Fox). ``The Hughleys'' (ABC)
and ``Living in Captivity'' (Fox) are updates of ``The
Jeffersons.'' Syndicated game shows such as ``Hollywood Squares''
and ``Match Game'' are back. So is ``Fantasy Island'' (ABC) and
``Donny &AMP; Marie'' (in syndication).
</P>
<P>
   Even ``Charlie's Angels'' is rumored to be on its way back, and
Mary Tyler Moore and Rhoda Morgenstern will return as soon as they
get a script they like.
</P>
<P>
   Another new program, ``Buddy Faro'' (CBS), is about a guy who
has been out of circulation for 20 years and finds that not much
has changed. That description could almost stand for the new
television season. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``I think (the '70s) was a period of sheer entertainment and
escapism,'' said ``Buddy Faro'' executive producer Aaron Spelling
(responsible for the original ``Love Boat'' and ``Fantasy Island,''
and ``Charlie's Angels''), who remade ``The Love Boat'' last season
for UPN. ``In this country, with terrorism, the stock market going
down and kids getting killed in school, we need that. `Escapism,'
for the last eight years, was a dirty word on television.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, to please that all-important television demographic _
18-to-49-year olds, the group with the most disposable income _
television is feathering some hair, playing some disco and rolling
out the shag carpet to welcome audiences back to one of the most
recognizable decades of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Like smiley faces and revamped old series, the sudden presence
of Irish families or Irish neighborhoods in new television shows
this season is no accident.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, the public has responded to many things
that are Irish.
</P>
<P>
   First Michael Flatley pranced across the stage in ``Riverdance''
and later as ``The Lord of the Dance,'' firing up a national frenzy
over Irish clog dancing. Then ``Angela's Ashes,'' a memoir about an
author's life in Ireland and subsequent exodus to the United
States, climbed the best-seller list. Celtic music is dominating
world-music sales. Even the Titanic stopped in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The men and women behind television must have smelled a good
sell because, as luck would have it, the networks are launching
seven shows focusing on Irish families: ``Wind on Water'' (NBC),
``Trinity'' (NBC), ``Legacy'' (UPN), ``Hyperion Bay'' (The WB),
``Turks'' (in midseason on CBS), ``To Have and to Hold'' (CBS), and
``Costello'' (Fox), the latter two set in South Boston, home to hit
movie ``Good Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the hip quotient of being Irish in American
crested in the early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it had come and gone,'' said Pulitzer Prize-winning
author William Kennedy (``Ironweed''). ``We had the era of James
Cagney, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan, and it peaked when (John
F.) Kennedy was in the White House. What's happening now is the
return to the origin of those people. It's a very odd thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's fascination with his people stems from the struggles
they have had in their homeland. But those memories were too
painful for many early Irish immigrants, so much so that some tried
to hide their Irish roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The renaissance has to do with this new generation being far
enough removed from the hostility to their past (to be) interested
about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of ``Riverdance'' is clear evidence that the
Irish are proud to be Irish again, says UC Santa Barbara's Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Riverdance' phenomenon can't be underestimated,'' Everett
said. ``There is almost a kind of `me, too,' ethnicity in a kind of
otherness. There is a focus back to ethnicity within whiteness, an
attention to whiteness in a multicultural age.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sometimes a coincidence is just a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Joanne Waters, executive producer of ``To Have and to Hold,''
thinks any look into the Irish assault on prime time is
overanalysis. Her program, she says, is more of a throwback to the
romantic comedies of the '40s such as ``Adam's Rib'' and ``His Girl
Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not dancing jigs,'' she said of her characters. ``The
only reason these people are Irish is because I'm Irish. We did not
sit around with the network executives to come up with an Irish
show. People are just stereotyping it. It's not like we're gonna
sit around and have a major St. Patrick's Day parade.''
</P>
<P>
   But if parades suddenly become a national passion, if America
started doling out all kinds of money to see movies about parades,
buy books about the making of parades, listen to marching band
music from the country's biggest parades, don't be surprised if
television networks produce competing parade programs. ``Trinity,''
set cross-town from the location of New York's famous St. Patrick's
Day Parade would certainly have a very special episode to mark the
event. That is, if it's still on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Television is cannibalistic by nature, says Dr. Gary Burns,
associate professor of communication at Northern Illinois
University and president of the American Culture Association, a
group of about 1,000 academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most voracious medium,'' Burns said. ``It eats up
everything else and partially digests it and spits it back out.''

WHAT'S NEW, HWAT'S NOT FROM THE NETWORKS
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Six networks, 36 new shows and _ if you listen to
the networks _ each one is either the next ``Seinfeld'' (if it's a
comedy) or the next ``ER'' (if it's a drama).
</P>
<P>
   They are all liars.
</P>
<P>
   This was another in a long line of poor network television
development years. All of the inventive stuff is popping up on
cable as the networks regurgitate old themes and poorly executed
plots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollyweird'' was so bad it was bumped off the schedule before
it ever aired.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the best and worst that each of the six
broadcast networks has to offer in the upcoming season. And
remember, we warned you. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ABC BEST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   FANTASY ISLAND: Talk about old themes. This time-tested show _
which drives home the old adage ``Be careful what you wish for
...'' _ is a well-done update. It is darker with Malcolm McDowell
in the role of Mr. Roarke. &QL; 
ABC WORST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THE SECRET LIVES OF MEN: A bunch of guys golf and whine
together. This is a unique comedy in that it has no laughs. &QL; 
CBS BEST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   TO HAVE AND TO HOLD: A battle of the sexes that is packed with
wit and bite. Executive producer Joanne Waters comes to the show
with no television baggage and brings a freshness to an age-old
struggle. The romantic comedy has a likable cast and a distinctive
feel. &QL; 
CBS WORST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   MAGGIE WINTERS: Remember the movie ``Hope Floats''? You're
better off renting it. This is the same premise. The girl most
likely to succeed doesn't and comes back home. Series star Faith
Ford, though, is no Sandra Bullock. Maybe this sitcom won't be
around as long as the two-hour movie. &QL; 
FOX BEST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THAT '70s SHOW: A trippy look back at the era of disco and
southern rock; long hair and shag carpets; American cars and
American cheese. &QL; 
FOX WORST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   HOLDING THE BABY: The baby would be better off being dropped.
This smarmy sitcom has no basis in reality, and the opening episode
features a debate on what euphemism should be used for fecal
matter. They should try calling it ``Holding the Baby.'' &QL; 
NBC BEST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WILL &AMP; GRACE: This comedy is about a gay man and his best woman
friend. The cast is likable, but the show is not great. NBC has
just unleashed a bunch of comfort food on its prime-time schedule
and this is the tastiest of the weak bunch. &QL; 
NBC WORST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   WIND ON WATER: Take Bo Derek, add a bunch of hard-body extreme
athletes, put them on a cattle farm in Hawaii and what do you have?
A very bad show. &QL; 
UPN BEST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   SEVEN DAYS: A sci-fi thriller in which a genius with a gambling
problem is set free from a mental hospital to use a time machine to
prevent future crimes. The catch is the machine is only good for
seven days. &QL; 
UPN WORST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THE SECRET DIARY OF DESMOND PFEIFFER: Abraham Lincoln's head
servant is an African-American man from Britain. He has his own
servant. The jokes are crude and the show is so over-the-top, it's
on its way down. &QL; 
THE WB BEST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   FELICITY: It has been called ``Ally McBeal Goes to College.''
This show may even make a couple of 12- to 20-year-old females
forget about Dawson and his creek. Kerri Russell is an appealing
star who plays a woman who heads off to college, learning from her
wrong decisions along the way. &QL; 
THE WB WORST &QC;
</P>
<P>
   THE ARMY SHOW: Poor Phil Silvers must be rolling in his grave.
This lightweight version of his Sgt. Bilko-centered show has, among
others, Anthony Higgins, the heavyweight from ``Ellen.'' A court
marshal is in order.

SO FEW IDEAS, SO MANY NEW SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Television has been copying itself since its
early days, so this season's offerings of familiar scenarios will
come as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow in development meetings all around town, people seem to
be pitching the same stuff _ and networks are still buying it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some coincidences that are categorically
undeniable:
</P>
<P>
   Blond barmaids, who want to go to college despite protests from
men in their lives, in shows with one-name titles: NBC's ``Jesse''
starring Christina Applegate and Fox's ``Costello,'' starring Sue
Costello.
</P>
<P>
   Fat city: Since the days of Oliver Hardy, fat men have made
people laugh. This television schedule has more overweight guys
than an all-you-can-eat buffet. David Anthony Higgins on the WB's
``The Army Show,'' Kevin James on CBS' ``The King of Queens,''
Sammo Hung on CBS' ``Martial Law,'' Nathan Lane on NBC's ``Encore!
Encore!'' John DiResta on UPN's ``DiResta'' and Chi McBride on
UPN's ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Networks want their MTV (talent): The latest television genre _
shows featuring former MTV personalities. Jacinda Barrett is in
NBC's ``Wind on Water''; her boyfriend Chris Hardwick, who was the
sidekick to Jenny McCarthy and Carmen Electra on ``Singled Out,''
is in UPN's ``Guys Like Us''; and former host and VJ John Sencio is
in the WB's ``The Army Show.'' Another common thread: All of these
shows stink.
</P>
<P>
   Shows with lawyers, cops and private eyes: Television has a love
affair with anyone in any kind of legal profession. Want proof?
Read on. NBC: ``Will &AMP; Grace'' and ``Trinity.'' CBS: ``Buddy
Faro,'' ``To Have and to Hold'' and ``Martial Law.'' ABC:
``Vengeance Unlimited.'' Fox: ``Brimstone.'' UPN: ``DiResta'' and
``Seven Days.'' And those are just the !ital!new shows featuring
law enforcers.
</P>
<P>
   The luck of the Irish: Networks must be looking for that Irish
demographic because there seem to be more Irish families on
television than in Dublin: NBC: ``Wind on Water'' and ``Trinity.''
CBS: ``To Have and to Hold.'' Fox: ``Costello.'' The WB: ``Hyperion
Bay.'' UPN: ``Legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Women _ you can't live without 'em, except on TV: Single men and
the kids they bring up on the next ... ``Brother's Keeper'' and
``Two of a Kind'' on ABC, ``Holding the Baby'' on Fox and ``Guys
Like Us'' on UPN. Oh, and representing the single moms of the
world: NBC's ``Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Movin' on up: Two new shows try to update the ``Jeffersons''
theme of African-Americans moving to a dee-luxe white community:
``The Hughleys'' (ABC) and ``Living in Captivity'' (Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Hunting for ratings: ``Good Will Hunting'' did well at the box
office. It was set in South Boston. Hey, what a great place for a
show: ``To Have and to Hold'' (ABC) and ``Costello'' (Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Start spreading the news: New York, New York. They named it
twice because there are so many shows based there: CBS has ``The
King of Queens.'' NBC has ``Conrad Bloom,'' ``Will &AMP; Grace,''
Trinity'' and ``Jesse'' (OK, it's Buffalo, barely N.Y.). ABC has
``Sports Night'' and ``The Secret Lives of Men.'' The WB has
``Felicity.'' UPN has ``DiResta.''
</P>
<P>
   Aloha: Two shows _ ``Wind on Water'' (NBC) and ``Fantasy
Island'' (ABC) will be filmed in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Go west, young show: If it's not New York, it's probably going
to be California. In the Golden State, you'll find ABC's ``The
Hughleys'' and ``Brother's Keeper.'' On CBS, ``Buddy Faro,''
``Martial Law,'' ``The Brian Benben Show'' and ``L.A. Doctors.'' On
NBC, ``Encore! Encore!'' On Fox, ``Brimstone'' and ``Living in
Captivity.'' And The WB sets both ``Charmed'' and ``Hyperion Bay''
in California.
</P>
<P>
   The right to remain silent: Two television characters have
unusual name pronunciations. There is Darryl Hughley (pronounced
YOO-glee, where both H's are silent) and Desmond Pfeiffer
(pronounced PFIFE-fer, where the P is not silent.

NETWORKS GIVE BIRTH TO NEW SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Following is a list of thumbnail reviews for the
new fall network television shows: &QL; 
FOX &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Holding the Baby'' Premiered Aug. 23. Take two men, a nanny
and a baby. Add them together. What do you get? A very bad show.
Formulaic, implausible and scatological. And that's not the worst
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show'' Premiered Aug. 23. The culturally bankrupt
days of disco and feathered hair are back and funnier than ever. A
likable cast takes you through their days of teen angst, before
anyone ever heard of teen angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Costello'' Premiered Sept.  &UR; 15 &LR; . Stand-up comic Sue Costello
is unique all right. But she may actually be too unique. This
half-hour comedy set in a bar in South Boston is not as much about
good will as some bad will. The show, about blue-collar
Irish-Americans, is often too shrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in Captivity'' Premiered Sept. 11. One of two new
sitcoms about African-Americans moving into the suburbs. This one
proves the theory that the one premiering first is worst. Too much
of the humor comes from stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brimstone'' Premieres Oct. 27. A gritty hour drama. Peter
Horton (``thirtysomething'') plays a dead police officer who was
banished to hell. He gets a second chance for salvation after 113
of the most heinous criminals of all time break out of Hades, and
he is sent to Earth to stop them. The good news is the pilot was
interesting. The bad news is the show is on its third executive
producer. &QL; 
THE WB &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army Show'' Premiered Sept. 6. A missable sitcom about the
goings-on at a forgotten military base. Think of ``The Phil Silvers
Show'' without the laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyperion Bay'' Premieres Monday. Mark-Paul Gosselaar (``Saved
by the Bell'') is back on television as a computer geek who comes
back to his hometown to prove to everyone that he has made it.
Sibling rivalries abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' Premieres Sept. 29. The most anticipated show of
the new season, especially for the ``Dawson's Creek'' crowd. Kerri
Russell stars as Felicity, a lovely, intelligent young lady who
throws away everything to follow a boy to college in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charmed'' Premieres Oct. 7. Aaron's Angels are back. Shannen
Doherty, best-known for her role as Brenda Walsh on ``Beverly
Hills, 90210,'' is back in Camp Spelling, and Alyssa Milano, late
of ``Melrose Place,'' is also aboard. They play two of three
sisters who are good witches fighting the forces of evil. &QL; 
CBS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Brian Benben Show'' Premieres Monday. Brian Benben must
stretch to play Brian Benben, a news anchor who has been demoted to
human-interest reporter to make way for a younger, prettier anchor
in this uneven comedy. There are few things as ripe for lampooning
as local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Queens'' Premieres Monday. A big lout of a
blue-collar guy loses his TV room to his father-in-law, played by
Jerry Stiller in a very Frank Costanza-like way. Somehow this show
is almost exactly like ``That's Life,'' a failed midseason
replacement show, only better.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Doctors'' Premieres Monday. Four doctors, led by Ken Olin
(``thirtysomething''), try to bring a personal touch back to
medicine in the days of managed care. More than watchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buddy Faro'' Premieres Friday. One of the most interesting
shows of the season. Dennis Farina plays the title character, a
private eye who has been out of circulation since the '70s. He
teams up with Frank Whaley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martial Law'' Premieres Saturday. A high-concept show that
plays out like a Jackie Chan movie each week. Sammo Hung, a puffy
martial artist, uses his cunning and kicking to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maggie Winters'' Premieres Sept. 30. Faith Ford (``Murphy
Brown'') plays a Midwestern girl who goes out on her own. She fails
both on a professional and personal level and is forced to move
back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Have and to Hold'' Premieres Sept. 30. An hourlong romantic
comedy from meteoric producer Joanne Waters. He (Jason Beghe) is a
cop and she (Moira Kelly) is a defense attorney who disagree on
nearly everything.
</P>
<P>
   ABC &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' Premieres Tuesday. The other
African-Americans-move-to-the-suburb show, but this one is one of
the best of the batch. Based on the life of comedian D.L. Hughley,
it plays real as well as really funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' Premieres Tuesday. A Larry-Sanders-type look at
ESPN's ``SportsCenter.'' The problem is that while ``Sanders'' was
funnier than any of the other late-night shows with the addition of
the behind-the-scenes insight, ``SportsCenter'' is more
entertaining than ``Sports Night'' almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother's Keeper'' Premieres Friday. Very similar to ``Holding
the Baby.'' A stuffy English professor is raising his 8-year-old
son. Then his wacky brother, a professional football player, moves
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two of a Kind'' Premieres Friday. The Olsen twins are back and
almost teen-agers. They play the daughters of a single father. One
is a tomboy, the other wears lipstick. Who said Fridays would never
be the same?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cupid'' Premieres Saturday. A modern-day Cupid, portrayed by
Jeremy Piven, was banished from Mount Olympus. He has no wings or
arrow and must put 100 couples together to get back home. This show
has a chance to stick around long enough for him to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasy Island'' Premieres Saturday. A darker version of the
'70s classic. Malcolm McDowell replaces Ricardo Montalban, black
suits replace white ones, and a big guy from the Bronx replaces
Tattoo. The other major change is that the show will have two
fantasies instead of three per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance Unlimited'' Premieres Sept. 29. Michael Madsen is
Mr. Chapel, a man who likes to see justice done. The modern-day
vigilante fights against those who use their money and power to
manipulate the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Lives of Men'' Premieres Sept. 30. A pretty grim
comedy. A bunch of guys play golf together and don't say many funny
things. &QL; 
NBC &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Conrad Bloom'' Premieres Monday. A great catch is looking for
Ms. Right. Mark Feuerstein plays an honest, up-and-coming ad
executive who has many women in his life, just not a future wife.
No ground is broken with this one, but you won't break your remote
trying to change the channel, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace'' Premieres Monday. Remember when it was shocking
to have a television show with a gay lead character? Well, a year
and a half later, a show about Will (a gay man) and his straight
woman friend (Grace) doesn't cause many waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' Premieres Tuesday. Nathan Lane plays a
womanizing opera singer in a show that has been totally retooled
since its initial pilot. Lane's character is a temperamental singer
with a failing voice who must move in with his feisty mom at the
family's Napa Valley winery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse'' Premieres Thursday. Christina Applegate (``Married ...
With Children'') plays a single mother who works at her father's
bar. The show gets a great time slot (between ``Friends'' and
``Frasier'') and the creative team of Bright, Kauffman and Crane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trinity'' Premieres Oct. 16. John Wells, one of the brains
behind ``ER,'' is back with his second show. This is one of several
series focusing on large Irish broods, this batch living in
Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen. There is the priest, the junkie, the
union boss, the nurse, the stock broker and, of course, the cop in
this slow-moving drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wind on Water'' Premieres Oct. 17. Bo Derek and two studly,
extreme-sports-playing sons try to save the family's cattle ranch
on the big island of Hawaii from a mean man played by Lee Horsley.
Nice to look at, not as good to watch. &QL; 
UPN &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``DiResta'' Premieres Oct. 5. The comic true-life story of a New
York transit cop starring John DiResta, the now-retired transit cop
in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys Like Us'' Premieres Oct. 5. A 6-year-old (played by the
cuter than possible Maestro Harris) moves in with his brother and
the brother's roommate, a clueless type played by Chris Hardwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer'' Premieres Oct. 5. The
real brains behind the Lincoln White House was African-American
Desmond Pfeiffer (the P is not silent), and the show is about as
awkward as the pronunciation. Lincoln is portrayed as a
philandering lush, and Mary Todd Lincoln is horny a lot of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercy Point'' Premieres Oct. 6. Three words: ``ER'' in space.
It's the 23rd century in a clinic at the far end of explored outer
space. Aliens and humans share the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven Days'' Premieres Oct. 7. Jonathan LaPaglia plays a CIA
agent turned mental patient who is picked for a high-risk
assignment in a time machine, giving him the power to change the
present by altering the past in a slick-looking drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legacy'' Premieres Oct. 9. Another show about an Irish family,
this one in post-Civil War Kentucky. The Logan family runs a horse
farm in a well-done drama. This is a beautiful show to look at but
could prove to be a tough sell.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: Given all of the strong shifts in the stock market recently,
how many dollars are gained or lost in stocks for every 100-point
move in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?
</P>
<P>
   A: In terms of dollars lost, investors took their worst hit ever
this past Aug. 31, when the value of all U.S. stocks dropped by
roughly $630 billion, said Myrone Greene, Georgia State University
business professor emeritus and publisher of the Mutual Fund Timing
Guide. On that day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 512
points, so 100 points was equivalent to about $123 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently watched a series on TV about the Holocaust. I'm
confused about the SS and the Gestapo. What do the letters SS stand
for? How does one relate to the other? Of the two, which was the
worst?
</P>
<P>
   A: SS is an abbreviation of Schutzstaffel, meaning ``protective
echelon'' in German. The Gestapo, an abbreviation of Geheime
Staats-Polizei (meaning ``secret state police''), was part of it.
Both had similar aims and overlapping functions.
</P>
<P>
   The SS, the black-uniformed elite corps of the Nazi Party, was
founded by Adolf Hitler in1925 as a small, personal bodyguard. By
the time the Nazis came to power in 1933, it had grown under
Heinrich Himmler to more than 50,000 members; by 1939, it was a
massive and labyrinthian bureaucracy numbering 250,000. The SS was
divided mainly into two groups, the Allgemeine-SS (General SS) and
the Waffen-SS (Armed SS). The most important division within the
General SS was the Reich Security Central Office, made up of the
Order Police and the Security Police. In turn, the Security Police
was divided into the Criminal Police and the Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   The Gestapo's ruthless methods of capture, torture and
extermination; the fact that it was responsible for all
concentration camps; and its exemption from any control by the
courts made it a symbol for brutal, sadistic repression. After the
defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies, the SS and the Gestapo were
formally declared criminal organizations by the Allied Tribunal in
Nuremberg in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Both the SS and the Gestapo were powerful, deadly and much
dreaded, so it's hard to say which was the more evil. A case could
be made for either one.
</P>
<P>
   Q: While shopping at a department store recently, a woman, upon
payment of her purchases, presented the clerk with what she called
a ``tax-exempt card.'' Who issues these cards, and who qualifies
for them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tax-exempt identification cards are issued by the State
Department to foreign consulates and eligible foreign diplomats.
The tax exemption is granted as a part of several foreign treaties
and extends to all types of tax, not just sales tax. U.S. diplomats
and consulates enjoy the same exemption in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan'' depicting the D-Day
invasion at Omaha Beach actually were filmed in Ireland. But were
the opening and closing scenes at a cemetery filmed in Normandy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, at the Normandy American Cemetery on a cliff overlooking
Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the video version of ``Titanic'' doing in sales and
rentals?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's sinking all competitors, just like it did on the big
screen for so long. ``Titanic'' has been out on video only since
Sept. 1. A spokeswoman at VideoScan in Los Angeles estimated that
as of Sept. 6, ``Titanic'' video sales at more than 15 million
copies, based on sales of 6 million alone tracked by VideoScan,
which represents about 40 percent of the total market. A spokesman
at the Video Software Dealers Association in Los Angeles said
nationwide rentals for the period ending Sept. 6 totaled about
$8.46 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read about a $10,000 Federal Reserve note, but since I'm
never likely to see one, I am curious: Whose picture was on it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Salmon P. Chase (Treasury secretary, 1861-64).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, it was reported that scientists aboard an
aircraft were experimenting with releasing chemicals into the
center of a hurricane to see if it could cause the storm to
disperse. Whatever became of that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're referring to Operation Stormfury. Scientists conducted
experiments seeding clouds with silver iodine crystals, said Frank
Lepore of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. The experiments
were done with hurricanes Esther (1961), Beulah (1963), Debbie
(1969) and Ginger (1971) when they were over the Atlantic far from
land.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists targeted convective clouds just outside the eye
wall in an attempt to form a new ring of clouds that, it was hoped,
would compete with the natural circulation of the storm and weaken
it. That didn't happen, for reasons that weren't confirmed until
the 1980s, Lepore said. For cloud seeding to be successful, the
clouds must contain supercool water, colder than freezing, but not
yet ice. Most hurricanes don't have enough such cold water, so the
experiments were termed a failure.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Science has since concluded that more
complete understanding of the physical processes of a hurricane is
needed before undertaking any more ``modification experiments,'' so
Operation Stormfury and any other such projects were discontinued
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When will the next total eclipse occur?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be a solar eclipse on Aug. 11, 1999, and will be
visible in Europe, the Middle East and India.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that a luxury ship is under construction, and
the cabins will be sold like condominiums. It will sail all over
the world. Do you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: A company registered in the Bahamas is proposing such a
concept. At the moment, the vessel, to be called The World of
ResidenSea, exists only as a brass model, glossy brochures and a
video, but ResidenSea Ltd. officials claim to have sold 62 units
worth almost $120 million, according to Business Week. Brochures
say the 86,000-ton, 958-foot-long ship will be composed of units
costing between $1.5 million and $6.6 million. Annual maintenance
fees also will be high: $61,500 for a 1,105-square-foot unit,
$271,800 for a 2,436-square-foot version.
</P>
<P>
   ResidenSea is the brainchild of Knut Kloster Jr., whose father
founded Norwegian Caribbean Line, which later became Norwegian
Cruise Line.
</P>
<P>
   While the concept resembles a floating condo, residents won't
really own their homes like condo owners do, Business Week said.
The company structured documents to resemble condo agreements, but
residents actually would be buying a 50-year lease. In addition to
the leased units, ResidenSea will rent out 183 guest suites on the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have read that a player in the Negro Baseball Leagues hit
more than 80 home runs in one season. Can you discuss his
accomplishments?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're probably thinking about Josh Gibson, dubbed by some
``the black Babe Ruth.'' According to the book A Who's Who of
Sports Champions, the Negro Leagues didn't keep accurate records,
but it goes on to say Gibson was credited with ``as many as 84 home
runs in a season, which might include as many as 200 games, and he
is believed to have hit nearly 800 home runs in his 17 seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Encyclopedia lists Gibson as having hit a total of
146 home runs in 17 years; the most it lists for him in a single
year is 17, in 1939. A spokesman at the National Baseball Hall of
Fame explained the discrepancy by saying the Baseball Encyclopedia
prints statistics only for the games it could find statistics for,
and might include very few games out of the larger number of games
that actually took place in any one season.
</P>
<P>
   Several Internet sites dealing with Gibson also vary in the
details. One says he hit ``about 800 home runs in the 17 years he
played, including 75 in the 1931 season.'' Another, Sports
Illustrated's SIonline, credits Gibson with 962 home runs in his
17-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was born in Buena Vista, Ga., in 1911 and died in 1947,
the year Jackie Robinson became the first black player in the major
leagues. Gibson, who played with the Pittsburgh Homestead Grays and
the Pittsburgh Crawfords, was inducted into the National Baseball
Hall of Fame in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the publicity about the Titanic, I'm reminded of the
Lusitania, which was sunk by a German U-boat, drawing the United
States into World War I. Was it ever determined that the Lusitania
was hauling munitions, as the Germans claimed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Lusitania, sunk by a German submarine May 7, 1915,
was carrying a cargo of about 173 tons of rifle ammunition and
shells. The Germans, who had circulated warnings that the ship
would be subject to being torpedoed, felt fully justified in
attacking a vessel that was furthering the war aims of their enemy.
The German government also felt that, in view of the vulnerability
of U-boats while on the surface and the British announcement of
intentions to arm merchant ships, prior warning of targets was
impractical.
</P>
<P>
   The British Admiralty had warned the Lusitania to avoid the area
off the south coast of Ireland amid reports of submarine activity
and the sinking of merchant ships. The ship's crew chose to ignore
those recommendations. Within 20 minutes of being struck, the
Lusitania sank and 1,198 people _ including 128 U.S. citizens _
lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States sent a note to Berlin on May 13, 1915,
expressing an indictment of the principles on which the submarine
war was being fought, but it and two other notes were the only
immediate reaction to the Lusitania sinking. Only in 1917 did the
United States cite German submarine warfare as a justification for
American entry into the war.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that President Clinton was nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize, yet I've seen nothing in the media about it. Is
it true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It was widely reported in late January when Clinton was
nominated by members of the Party of Progress, one of the largest
blocs in Norway's Parliament. The Norwegian lawmakers nominated him
for his efforts to protect world peace and promote democracy.
``Throughout his presidency, he has been a guarantor and friend of
peace,'' the lawmakers said in a statement. They praised Clinton
for helping end the war in Bosnia and for standing up to ``despots
who want to repress human rights and democracy's rules of fair
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Norway's national legislatures are among those with
Nobel nomination rights, and they often announce the name of their
candidates. The Oslo-based Nobel awards committee normally refuses
to release the names of nominees, usually in the range of 120-130
each year, or comment on candidates. The winner is announced in
Oslo, usually in mid-October, and the award is presented Dec. 10,
the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swede who endowed
the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Norwegian legislators, Vidar Kleppe, said the
decision to nominate Clinton was made last December, before
knowledge of Clinton's ``inappropriate relationship'' with Monica
Lewinsky became widespread.

 2-COX &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: I understand that President Clinton was nominated
for the Nobel Peace Prize, yet I've seen nothing in the media about
it. Is it true?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do the letters KLM stand for in the name of the Dutch
airline?
</P>
<P>
   A: Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij (Royal Airline Co.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Someone recently mentioned the ``harvest moon,'' but didn't
say when it would be, or where it gets that name. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. It generally
ushers in a period of several successive days when the moon rises
soon after sunset, giving farmers in temperate latitudes extra
hours of light in which to harvest their crops before frost and
winter come. The 1998 harvest moon has just occurred, said David
Dundee, astronomer at Fernbank Science Center. It was Sept. 6. The
next full moon, called the hunter's moon, will fall on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the harvest moon is larger than normal, Dundee
said, but it's an optical illusion occuring because the angle at
which the harvest moon rises from the horizon is at its most
oblique. The eye and brain, viewing and interpreting the moon in
the context of buildings and trees which are at a greater distance,
translate the image and see a moon that appears larger than usual.
But, of course, the harvest moon is the same size as any other full
moon.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard a broadcaster say recently that NASA scientists had
evidence that there was a second eye within Hurricane Bonnie,
indicating that it was, in essence, a ``pregnant hurricane.'' Is
that possible? I never heard of such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither has the National Hurricane Center in Miami. That
report most likely was hyperbole, said the center's Frank Lepore.
There are occasions when a hurricane has concentric eye walls, but
it's not a second eye, and it wouldn't cause a subsequent hurricane
to be spun off.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest part of a hurricane is an area right around the
eye, called the eye wall, Lepore explained. It's a warm core center
where the fastest winds are located. There are essentially bands of
thunderstorms wrapped around the eye, and if two such bands exist,
with a space between them, the hurricane would have a double eye
wall. But that couldn't be termed a second eye, and it wouldn't
make a hurricane ``pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've often heard of the 1940s blacklist of supposed
Communists in Hollywood. Were any of those people identified
publicly?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Nine writers and one director who refused to cooperate
with the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947 were
imprisoned for up to a year for being ``unfriendly witnesses.''
They were Alvah Bessie, Herbert Biberman, Lester Cole, Edward
Dmytryk, Ring Lardner Jr., John Howard Lawson, Albert Maltz, Samuel
Ornitz, Adrian Scott and Dalton Trumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the case of an airliner disabled over water, like the
Swissair MD-11that crashed recently, would it be possible for
pilots to glide it, or land it under power, on the ocean surface?
</P>
<P>
   A: In interviews after the Sept. 2 crash of Swissair Flight 111,
pilots have speculated that in attempting to ditch a plane, the
preferred method would be to keep the engines running and to
approach the water at speeds of about 150 miles an hour, with the
nose of the plane slightly higher than normal so the tail would
touch the surface first. With luck, they said, the plane would act
somewhat like a skipping stone before settling gently into the
water.
</P>
<P>
   But that is based on computer simulations and engineering
calculations. For obvious reasons, ditching can't be practiced, and
pilots who have spoken on the subject said it's not part of their
training on simulators.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent attempt of a pilot trying to land an airliner in
water occurred in November 1996 off the Comoros islands in the
Indian Ocean. A hijacked Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 767, which had
run out of fuel, apparently was attempting to come in for a
daylight landing on relatively calm seas when a wing-tip dipped,
caught the water, and the plane cartwheeled and broke into several
pieces. Of the 175 people on board, only 52 survived.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How old was Roger Maris when he when he died, and what was
the cause of death?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was 51 when he died Dec. 14, 1985, after a two-year battle
with lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Hillary Rodham Clinton helped write the
articles of impeachment to be used when President Richard Nixon was
facing possible impeachment?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's true. As has been widely reported for many years,
Hillary Rodham, who graduated from Yale Law School in 1973, joined
the impeachment inquiry staff of the House Judiciary Committee in
January 1974 as a low-level attorney. Her work with the committee
led to several prestigious job offers after Nixon's resignation,
but she decided to move later that same year to Fayetteville, Ark.,
to teach law at the University of Arkansas and to be near Bill
Clinton. They were married in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long has the company Gap been in business? What is the
origin of the name?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gap founder Don Fisher, a San Francisco real estate
developer, opened the first Gap store in 1969 on Ocean Avenue in
San Francisco. He had been trying to exchange a pair of jeans, and
after visiting store after store, noticed that jeans departments
were disorganized, poorly stocked and difficult to shop. So he and
his wife, Doris, created a jeans store neatly organized by size.
The store, which also sold records, was named after a cultural
phenomenon that was the talk of the times: the Generation Gap. As
the chain grew, it also began selling other merchandise, and in1974
began creating its own private-label clothing and accessories. In
1991, Gap announced that by year-end everything it sold would be
under the company's own label.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know about the bunker at the Greenbrier Hotel in West
Virginia built decades ago to protect goverment officials in case
of war, but I recently heard about another one somewhere else. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency's bunker inside Mount Weather near Berryville, Va., about 50
miles from Washington. It wasn't intended to house government
officials in case of an attack on Washington, like the secret,
fortified building at the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur
Springs, W.Va., built under orders by President Dwight Eisenhower.
Instead, what FEMA called its ``special facility'' is the hub for
much of the agency's classified communication. It's still in use,
but has been supplemented by Mobile Emergency Response Support
units, developed during President Ronald Reagan's administration
because of concerns that increasingly accurate and powerful nuclear
weapons could wipe out Mount Weather.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors also have it that a bunker to house government officials
has been constructed beneath a new FBI building at Clarksburg,
W.Va., but for obvious reasons, details are scant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell us about the famous Japanese home run king,
Mr. Oh? Is he still playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sadaharu Oh hit more home runs _ 868 _ than anyone else in
Japanese or American professional baseball history in the 22 years
before he retired from the Tokyo Yomiuri Giants in 1980. At the end
of his career, he also had recorded 2,786 hits; 2,170 runs batted
in; and a .301 batting average out of 9,250 at-bats in 2,831 games.
Oh, born in 1940 in Tokyo, still holds the record for more runs
batted in than any other batter in Japanese professional baseball.
Famous for his ``flamingo'' hitting form with one leg off the
ground, Oh was awarded Japan's first National Medal of Honor when
he surpassed Hank Aaron's home run record of 756 in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Oh credited several things for his success. He was known to
drink a secret blend of ginseng tea, a traditional Asian brew for
energy. And Hiroshi Arakawa, Oh's batting coach, and Oh spent three
years training with the founder of the martial art of aikido, where
the concept of extending one's spirit, called ki, is the source of
physical power.
</P>
<P>
   But there's an asterisk involved in comparing American baseball
to that played in Japan. Japanese fences are shorter, 300 feet down
the line. In the United States, the norm is a distance of 325 feet
or more down the foul lines to the fence and rounding out to 400
feet or more in straightaway center field. The Japanese also play
with a smaller ball.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When investigators recover flight data recorders from an
aircraft accident, such as TWA 800 and Swissair 111, they're put
into a cooler with water in it. Why is this done?
</P>
<P>
   A: After the recorders have been recovered from being in ocean
water, they're put into fresh water to wash the salts off, said
Preston Hicks of the National Transportation Safety Board. It's a
measure intended to preserve the recorders. The water also keeps
air away from them, inhibiting the onset of corrosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a live interview on CNN recently, and in a photo in the
newspaper, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi appeared to be seated in a
motorized wheelchair. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gadhafi's appearance in a mechanized wheelchair reignited
interest in reports that his motorcade had been shot at by an
Islamic group near the eastern Libya city of Beida a few months
ago, but in the Aug. 27 interview, he said he had broken his left
leg when he fell ``while taking part in sports.'' Other published
reports said he underwent hip surgery in July. The day after the
surgery, film of the operation was said to have been broadcast by
Libyan television.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi, 56, resumed normal work a few days later, and was
undergoing physical therapy, according to the Libyan news agency
JANA.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his wheelchair and his condition, Gadhafi told CNN
that he was feeling fine. He laughed, shifted in his chair _
apparently to show his flexibility _ and said the interview should
move on to more serious subjects. As he spoke, his left hand
tightly gripped a movable handle on the wheelchair, suggesting he
might have had to hold on in order to keep his hand from flailing
about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm confused. I often see airplane passengers using on-board
telephones, but Q&AMP;A said recently that cell phones are prohibited.
Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: The on-board public telephones, generally inset into the
seatback in front of a passenger, are of a type whose emissions
have been carefully evaluated and found not to be a threat to the
aircraft's navigational and electrical systems, said Delta
spokesman Bill Berry. The use of cell phones that a passenger
brings on board are banned because the phones might emit signals
that could cause interference problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Jerry Lewis compensated for his annual Labor Day telethon?
</P>
<P>
   A: He isn't paid. As he has done for many years, Lewis
volunteers his services for the Muscular Dystrophy Association
fund-raiser, which this year netted a record $51,577,023 in
pledges.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On the back of a $1 bill, there's a pyramid with an eye at
the top. What's the significance?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most accurate explanation of a pyramid on the Great Seal
of the United States is that it symbolizes strength and durability,
according to the State Department. The unfinished pyramid means
that the United States will always grow, improve and build. In
addition, the ``All-Seeing Eye'' above the pyramid suggests the
importance of divine guidance in favor of the American cause.

 &HT;    HISTORY, NOT SCANDAL, IS THE DRAW FOR WHITE HOUSE VISITORS
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For White House tourists, the richly decorated
walls of the Red Room, the glimmering candelabras in the State
Dining Room and the ornate chairs of the Blue Room seem far more
fascinating than the sex scandal haunting the residence.
</P>
<P>
   As they move through the Executive Mansion on self-guided tours,
few visitors ask questions about where President Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky was conducted, staff members say. Instead,
they are curious about what function each room serves, where the
president sits when he visits each room and who his guests are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about this building is, there is a whole lot of
history related to it,'' said Roger Gerwe of Cincinnati, who took
the tour Friday. ``The players come and go, but the history and
integrity of the office, those things remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerwe said he believed that while the public needs to know the
facts about Clinton's conduct in office, media attention to the
issue has been excessive.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Thompson of St. Croix in the Virgin Islands said what
impressed her most about the self-guided tour was being able to
view historic furniture and paintings, not the possibility of
sneaking a peek into the president's private life.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said she is a Clinton supporter, but lost respect for
him when the president admitted wrongdoing. ``I think they are
going this far to reprimand him and show him the error of his
ways,'' she said. ``It will show him that he can't take the
presidency and the American people for granted.''

   PAXNET _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ According to Bill Scott,
president of programming for PAX TV, better than expected ratings
won't mean the network will be going on the air more quickly with
more original programming. The network has 17 or 18 projects in the
works now _ some are specials like the ones we have mentioned
before _ but probably won't be introducing new ones in January. He
said, however, the network won't wait until fall premieres to
introduce new shows _ when they have them ready, they will go on
the air. At the same time, they want people to get used to the type
of programming they have now and don't want to change things too
quickly. (Plunkett, Palm Beach Post) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

   PAXNET _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ According to Bill Scott,
president of programming for PAX TV, better than expected ratings
won't mean the network will be going on the air more quickly with
more original programming. The network has 17 or 18 projects in the
works now _ some are specials like the ones we have mentioned
before _ but probably won't be introducing new ones in January. He
said, however, the network won't wait until fall premieres to
introduce new shows _ when they have them ready, they will go on
the air. At the same time, they want people to get used to the type
of programming they have now and don't want to change things too
quickly. (Plunkett, Palm Beach Post) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

 &HT;    EAST TEXAS RACISM SUBTLE BUT PERSISTANT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA _ Against steep odds, Hulbert Perkins made the big
score.
</P>
<P>
   He became a prosperous black businessman in a region of Texas
long known as Ku Klux Klan country, where entrenched racism has
been embodied in all-white towns, segregated churches, militia
camps, Confederate flags, cross-burnings and occasional brutality.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning of his effort _ 13 years ago _ that history
followed daily. He had difficulty getting a business loan and
leasing a building. When he finally opened his heavy equipment and
tool rental shop, he frequently was targeted by vandals.
</P>
<P>
   But as time passed, his company grew and he was accepted into
the business community and given a seat on the Chamber of Commerce
board of directors. By 1997, it seemed to Perkins that Mineola, 15
miles north of Tyler, had finally laid to rest the remnants of the
Old South for which East Texas is storied.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tried to buy a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I could afford a $150,000 house,'' he says. ``The
trouble was, all those houses were in the richest white
neighborhoods. Nobody would sell to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sellers threatened to call the police when he approached
them, but he persisted in shopping until an encounter with one
homeowner nearly ended in a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was crying and I was upset,'' he says. ``I decided the
best thing for me was to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 52, he left his son in charge of Perkins Rent-All
and moved to Shreveport, La., where he opened a branch of the
business and bought a $200,000 house in an integrated neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins seems not to have been embittered by the incident.
``There are just some things you have to deal with,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death by three
white men on a rural byway outside of Jasper, Texas, attention has
been focused on the savage face of the racism that has persevered
in East Texas since before the Civil War. But, to many blacks, the
lingering odor of the Old South is often more noxious in its
subtler forms.
</P>
<P>
   The manner of Byrd's slaying was loathsome. So was that of Loyal
Garner, beaten to death while in police custody in Hemphill in
1987. So was that of Kenneth Simpson, beaten to death while in
police custody in Cleveland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But the racism blacks ``have to deal with'' is more immediate
and persistent, shadowing their daily lives like an old hog dog.
The occasional violence, black leaders say, is the tip that proves
the presence of the larger iceberg, the presence of a climate in
which violence is easily spawned.
</P>
<P>
   Of Byrd's killing, Parisice Robinson, chairman of Texas
political activities for the NAACP, asked: ``What does this say
about the climate of Jasper? The climate, in some ways, has to
contribute to that.''
</P>
<P>
   A part of that ``climate'' followed Byrd to the grave. He was
buried in the section of the local cemetery where only blacks are
buried.
</P>
<P>
   The racial atmosphere of East Texas is not just about one town,
and certainly not just about Jasper, which, from outward clues, is
among the more enlightened and integrated communities in a region
with a history of stubborn resistance to cultural change. Whites
are a narrow majority, but blacks have held important positions _
mayor, police chief, hospital administrator, school superintendent
_ and most citizens will argue, on first meeting, that the town is
a rural microcosm of the New South ideal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the day that the KKK and the New Black Panthers
demonstrated in Jasper a week after Byrd's funeral, the NAACP held
an alternative community meeting for blacks and, Robinson says,
fragments of the iceberg surfaced. Death may have been a grim
backdrop, but those who attended talked about issues closer to home
_ lack of trust in the judicial system, wariness of law
enforcement, the discrimination by banks in granting credit and
setting interest rates (higher for blacks, they said).
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman said she tried to get a small business loan and the
collateral requirement was so high that she couldn't possibly meet
it. If she had that much collateral she wouldn't need the loan,''
Robinson says.
</P>
<P>
   Atrocities spark outrage and oratory, but the more commonplace
forms of bigotry often pass in silence, not from fear of violence,
but of other forms of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the Tyler chapter of the NAACP received a phone call
from a woman complaining about the treatment of blacks in Mineola.
To Ernest Deckard, the chapter president, the call was telling, and
not just for its content. Specifically, the caller grumbled about
an employer who refused to allow a black woman to take off work, on
her lunch hour, to attend the funeral of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog of grievances that reach Deckard's desk, it may
have been a minor entry, but he found it significant for another
reason: It was placed by a white woman because, he believes, the
victim was too intimidated to raise her own voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have that silence,'' he says. ``Blacks are still
scared to speak up.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to find blacks anywhere in East Texas who dispute
that.
</P>
<P>
   Says a retired schoolteacher in Center: ``Things aren't too bad
... as long as you stay in your place.''
</P>
<P>
   The range of consequences for leaving ``your place,'' they know,
is broad. James Byrd left his when he accepted a ride in the back
of the wrong pickup truck, just as Hulbert Perkins left his when he
went house-hunting in an expensive, white neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with daily nuances and subtleties of racism is
frustrating, some experts say, because the issues no longer concern
civil rights, but mere civility. Last week's tepid report of
President Clinton's race advisory board revealed the difficulty of
addressing racism in its present forms. After a year of study and
stormy dialogue, the panel proposed little in the way of new
initiatives. Changing attitudes is tougher than changing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, does the civil rights movement have a role in
solving those things?'' asks Mark Briskman, the Dallas regional
director of the Anti-Defamation League. ``Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   That movement brought legal change, but stalled out at the level
of reforming attitudes, of eradicating the notion of racial
inferiority that was the rationale for slavery and the century of
segregation that followed its abolition. Neither the government nor
the civil rights movement could deliver tolerance or acceptance,
Briskman says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unrealistic expectation from the start,'' he says.
``That is a job for community leadership and education. Business
leadership has to play a key role.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many small communities, civic and business leadership are
captives of economics, not sociology, and economies are often spare
enough to discourage activism.
</P>
<P>
   In Center, a poultry, timber and wood-processing town
(population 4,900) in Shelby County on the fringe of the Sabine
National Forest, the economics and culture are typical of the
region. More people are employed by the local Wal-Mart (135) than
by the county government (105). Blacks make up more than 30 percent
of the population and work mainly at unskilled and low-paying jobs
slaughtering chickens for Tyson/Holly Farms or processing timber
for Bruce Hardwood Floors.
</P>
<P>
   Except for two mortuaries, the only black-owned businesses are
barber shops, gas stations and beer joints. There are no black
doctors or lawyers in Center, and the local newspapers present
images of a virtually all-white community. (No blacks were shown in
full-page photo layouts of the local What-A-Melon Festival and the
Independence Day celebration this summer.)
</P>
<P>
   The town has not had a municipal swimming pool for many years
and efforts by private investors to operate one have failed. The
reasons may have been economic, but it is widely perceived in the
black community that whites didn't want an integrated pool in their
community. The last privately operated pool opened a few years ago
but stayed in business only a short time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The owner) was told that if he wanted to get along with the
white community, he would close that pool,'' says Gretchen McNealy,
a schoolteacher and one of Center's two black city council members.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a difficult perception to form in a town where
racial divisions extend to the grave.
</P>
<P>
   A call to City Hall to inquire about cemeteries drew this
response from a woman who answered the phone: ``We have two _ one
white one and one black one.'' Both are in the traditional black
section of town, just off Martin Luther King Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here 50 years and I don't guess I've ever been into
that cemetery,'' says Clyde Lister, a black mortician whose funeral
home, Hicks Mortuary, is three blocks from Fairview Cemetery, the
white one. ``I don't know that it's something that's enforced.
Maybe no blacks ever tried to get in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood integration has occurred with some resistance,
local residents say, and church leaders have attempted, with mixed
success, to erase deeply etched racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly white Central Baptist Church sends a bus through
black neighborhoods on Sunday mornings to deliver black children to
its services and when the black Bennett Baptist Church just outside
of town collapsed three years ago, white volunteers came to help
rebuild it and white businessmen gave money to help cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the Rev. Wilburt Martin, Bennett Baptist's pastor, it was
evidence of the progress the town had made in purging long-standing
bigotry. It also fortified his belief that it is the responsibility
of the church _ not the government or the schools or the civil
rights movement _ to sway hearts and minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden to stamp out hatred and malice rests in the
pulpit,'' he says. ``It's the only thing we've got left.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, he, like Hulbert Perkins, encountered the
racial undertow that tugs against the current of progress. However
well-meaning they are, ministers face limits in the presence of
their congregations.
</P>
<P>
   A white Baptist preacher in Center confided to him last year
that the subject of integrated worship came up recently at his
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me there was discussion of what they would do if a
black family showed up on Sunday morning,'' Martin says. ``The
consensus was that they would hold a benediction, turn out the
lights and all go home.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort at unity it is not uncommon for pastors of one race
to share their pulpits with ministers of the other. Martin received
such an invitation from a white minister last November and he
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to just conduct the same kind of service I would at
my church,'' he says. ``He called me back the next day and said he
had informed his deacons about the arrangements and they told him
he was out of his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear God, place the spirit of the Antichrist under the foot of
Jesus. Forgive the white church in Texas for its sins.''
</P>
<P>
   With that opening prayer at a Republican convention in Fort
Worth shortly after the slaying of James Byrd, the Rev. Charles
Burchett attracted widespread attention to himself, but it was the
continuation of a message he has been preaching throughout his
life.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, the white pastor has led the First Baptist Church
of Kirbyville in Jasper County, and his stands on racism have
occasionally alienated members of his congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, a black family began attending his church
regularly. After a few weeks, Burchett was visited by a man who
said he had been sent by a white family to deliver a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until it (integrated worship) stops, we are not coming back,''
the message said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Burchett said, ``give them this message for me: Never
set foot on our property again.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his church membership has dwindled from about
250 to 70 or fewer, but Burchett, a soft-spoken 49-year-old,
doesn't waffle on the subject of church bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many white men in churches have a subconscious, low-key racist
attitude in their hearts,'' he says. ``They don't express it like
they used to, in the '30s and '40s and '50s, but it is in their
hearts and God looks at the heart. The under-the-table racism is
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have remained in Burchett's church are supportive of
his position, but in his corner of the state, he and his followers
are a rarity.
</P>
<P>
   A month after Byrd's death, Burchett attended a fellowship
luncheon for pastors in Jasper and Newton counties. Informally, the
pastors swapped stories of how they had dealt with the incident in
their services the Sunday after the slaying, which occurred in
early June. Only Burchett had made it the topic of his sermon. Most
of the others mentioned it in passing and ``everyone got in trouble
to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   One minister said a man approached him as he was leaving the
sanctuary and said he agreed with the sentiment, ``but we don't
want any of them coming to our church.''
</P>
<P>
   One young pastor, Burchett said, touched on the killing lightly,
enough to acknowledge that it had occurred and to point out that
``God has shown that he desires justice in the legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That very day,'' Burchett says, ``a committee of church
members was formed. They went to the deacons and asked them to fire
the pastor.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it is less frightening than cross-burnings or parades of
hooded Klansmen _ neither of which has disappeared from the East
Texas landscape _ the ``under-the-table racism'' may be more
harmful, Burchett believes. The Klan is the ugly face of racism _
more and more the jester face. In the church, it hides behind
righteousness and respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have in East Texas is a contradiction in terms of the
races coming together,'' says William Hale, director of the Texas
Commission on Human Rights. ``Some are working hard to bring them
together and some are adamantly opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are six or seven white supremacist organizations in
Texas _ Klan, militia, Nazi, Skinheads, et cetera. They have 3,000
to 5,000 members and 20,000 to 30,000 sympathizers. Most of them
are in East Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits and prosecutions have taken a toll on many KKK
activities, but the fact that the Klan still finds a home in East
Texas is revealing to Hale and other monitors of hate crimes. The
organization's presence suggests an environment, he says, in which
whites are most likely to ``dehumanize blacks,'' a psychological
warp that justifies bigotry and makes violence easier.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants in the Byrd slaying, he says, are motivated
by hate and their own kind of fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are as poor as church mice. They have no respect. Their
opportunities are zero,'' Hale says. ``The only thing they've got
going for them is that they're white.''
</P>
<P>
   In their minds that makes them better than blacks, but they are
confronted daily with the economic reality that many blacks are
more successful and prosperous, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made them kill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By Hale's accounting, there could be as many as 30,000 others of
like mind _ anonymous Klan sympathizers who never don the robes or
parade in public _ living in East Texas. Rather than show
themselves with the grotesqueness of Byrd's killers, they keep the
Old South alive in furtive ways.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after Byrd was slain, some residents of Zavalla, 35
miles northeast of Jasper, awoke to find racial slurs painted on
the highway that runs through town. Painted by whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``The white supremacists,'' shrugs a local businessman. The
graffiti was quickly removed.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, farther up the highway in Poynor, a young man
walked into the General Store Cafe wearing a KKK T-shirt and
``smarting off'' about the Jasper crime, says Marie Wellesley, a
waitress. When he tried to go into the kitchen to harass a black
cook, the owner of the cafe ordered him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   He left the premises, but blacks in East Texas know something
that frightens them. They know he didn't go away. &QL;

POLL SHOWS CLINTON LOSING SOME SUPPORT IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ President Clinton's image has eroded among
Californians, according to a new poll, but he retains support in
the nation's most populous state and there appears to be no
groundswell of pressure for him to leave office.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 812 people likely to vote in the Nov. 3 election
showed that 52 percent thought Clinton was doing a ``good'' or
``excellent'' job as president, down from 60 percent in February.
The poll was of conducted for the San Francisco Examiner by
Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research of Columbia, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's job-performance rating has hovered around 52 percent
in most Mason-Dixon polls since 1993, then peaked in February.
``These findings have been pretty consistent everywhere,'' pollster
Del Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton said he still has the moral authority to
lead the country. But among Californians, a few red flags were
revealed in the poll:
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stands on shaky ground if there is proof he obstructed
justice in trying to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
Forty-eight percent said he should be removed from office if that
proves to be true, compared to 46 percent who said he should stay.
</P>
<P>
   And 56 percent of those surveyed said they thought Clinton
should not resign, but only 43 percent said they trusted him. Women
trust the president more than men, the poll found, and slightly
fewer women said they thought the president should resign.
</P>
<P>
   If the evidence shows that Clinton committed perjury in his
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, then he
should be removed from office, 44 percent of those surveyed said.
Women also gave Clinton more support than men when asked this
question, according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that the sordid details of Clinton's
extramarital fling may influence the U.S. Senate race in
California. State Treasurer Matt Fong, the Republican candidate, is
trying to unseat incumbent Barbara Boxer, the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how, if at all, their opinion of Clinton would
influence their vote in the U.S. Senate race, 18 percent said they
would vote for state Fong over Boxer, who was first elected to the
Senate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Although a convincing 70 percent said the Clinton scandal would
have no bearing on how they will vote, Ali said even a small margin
could influence the tight race. Recent polls have shown Boxer and
Fong in a virtual dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked this question in every state that has a Senate race
this year, and unless the candidates are in a close race, the
Clinton scandal doesn't amount to a hill of beans,'' said Ali,
senior vice president of Mason-Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now in California, this could be enough to swing it to Fong.
The other factor is turnout. It's essential for Boxer to energize
her base of Democratic voters. ... It doesn't help that she's
running against a moderate Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Results from Tuesday's primaries in Minnesota, New York,
Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington show that Democratic turnout
declined in every state but Massachusetts. But Republican turnout
declined as well.
</P>
<P>
   The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.

THE RIGHT THING: BETWEEN CONSENTING CO-WORKERS

Jeffrey L. Seglin is a visiting fellow at Harvard University's
Center for the Study of Values in Public Life. His column on
business ethics will appear on the third Sunday of each month.

<P>
   Not a day has gone by in the last month when I haven't read in
the paper, received an e-mail or heard in conversation that any
corporate chief executive who was caught having a consensual
relationship with a young intern or staff member would be given the
heave-ho.
</P>
<P>
   Hogwash.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the cases that I've been reading, that's just not so,''
said Carol Sanger, a professor of law at Columbia Law School, who
teaches courses on sex discrimination and family law.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, when sexual harassment does occur, more and more
companies are rightly taking a strong stance against the predator
in the relationship. But when it comes to ``inappropriate
relationships'' between consenting parties, the picture is far less
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies have no written policy on workplace romance. In a
January survey by the Society of Human Resource Management, 72
percent of human-resource professionals said their company had no
such policy, written or unwritten. And of those whose companies did
have a policy, more than half said it discouraged office romances
but did not forbid them. The most likely outcome of a workplace
romance, the professionals said, was marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical issue facing chief executives, boards, company
owners and managers should not be whether an executive who dates an
employee half his age ought to keep his job. It should be: ``What
effect does this behavior have on our company and, no less
important, on the rest of our employees?''
</P>
<P>
   Framed that way, the issue poses three main challenges:
</P>
<P>
   _ How can companies address workplace romances so that all
parties are dealt with humanely?
</P>
<P>
   _ How can companies ensure that any condoned behavior does not
jeopardize other people's professional careers?
</P>
<P>
   _ How can companies prevent employees from using rank and power
to trap others into relationships they do not want?
</P>
<P>
   Most companies, though, do not see the problem as an ethical
issue, but rather as a liability management problem. Specifically,
they focus on avoiding the sexual harassment lawsuits that can
spring from an office romance gone sour, or from other employees'
perception that they are discriminated against for failing to bed
the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in such a litigious society, where people are so
willing to make claims,'' said Nancy Pritikin, a partner in the San
Francisco office of Littler Mendelson, an employment law firm.
``And the claims are so expensive to deal with _ even when you win
them _ that companies are really struggling with ways to avoid the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Among companies whose policies permit relationships between
supervisors and subordinates, a recent development is insisting
that the supervisor report the relationship to the human resources
department. Then both parties are asked to sign a contract
acknowledging their consent to the relationship. These ``love
contracts'' may at first seem a ridiculous way to treat adults. But
they are a sign that some companies have at least begun to grapple
with a difficult issue.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with thoughtful policies about workplace romance is
not as clear-cut as writing policies against sexual harassment.
Most people can agree that sexual harassment is bad. When they
discuss the appropriateness of workplace romance, however, the
issue gets murkier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether our society is prepared to take the step
of saying you cannot date anyone you work with,'' Ms. Pritikin
said. ``But disclosure is one step in the right direction for the
manager, company and individual, so they can be sure that no one's
being taken advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're talking about pretty private behavior here,'' she
continued. ``But when you're a manager or a supervisor, you can't
expect that you can have a completely private relationship with a
person at work who reports to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger of Columbia observed: ``No one knows quite what to
do. But it's ridiculous to think that people at work aren't going
to fall in love.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. Companies must decide what role they will have in
letting them do so.

   NEW YORK _ A century ago, butlers often wore mismatched trousers
with their evening tail coats, to make sure no one ever mistook
them for dinner guests. Today, having a staff that's decked out as
stylishly as the guests is precisely the point for many hotels and
restaurants, which are hiring designers like Isaac Mizrahi and
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana to create uniforms. If the staff looks even sweller
than the patrons, so much the better in the age of hipper than
thou.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uniforms are pretty horrible, as a rule, and I don't like the
idea of them,'' maintains Todd Oldham, who outfitted the staff at
the renovated Tiffany Hotel, an Art Deco landmark in Miami Beach,
which will reopen next month. ``We wanted to make the staff feel
special in their uniforms.'' This did not mean black tie or
epaulettes. For bartenders, bellhops, pool attendants and maids,
Oldham created a colorful line of shirts and dresses in crush-dyed
cotton, the same fabrics as the sarongs and bathrobes provided for
Tiffany guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about who had the worst job, and who gets the least
credit, and it has to be the maid,'' Oldham said. ``So we really
turned her out. We did an easy shirtwaist dress in a blue and white
crush-dyed cotton with a smart little barbecue apron. I wanted her
to feel really tidy.'`
</P>
<P>
   At upscale hotels like the Allegro in Chicago (where Calvin
Klein designs are worn) and the Metropolitan in London (Donna Karan
garb), fashionable uniforms make the guests feel they're in good
hands. A concierge in a cashmere twin set is reassuring, like a
doctor in surgery scrubs. It lets guests know the wearer can get
the job done _ in the concierge's case, that she's hip enough to
get you into the right club.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to a uniform-supply house won't make it anymore, So
hoteliers and restaurateurs are turning to the same designers their
guests would wear. At Clementine that means Agnes B. and Daryl K;
at Chez Es Saada, Badgley Mischka; at Union Pacific, Donna Karan,
and at Gramercy Tavern, Armani. At the Mercer Hotel in SoHo, Andre
Balazs has asked Mizrahi to be the uniform ``conceptualizer and
curator,'' said Roman Alonso, Mizrahi's spokesman. ``Andre
expressed an interest in having his employees look as if they
belonged in the neighborhood.'' Balazs said that he wanted the
young staff to have ``the ability to go straight from the hotel to
a party without changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi attired the doormen in understated four-button,
charcoal-gray suits and the receptionists in shift dresses or
flat-front pants with baby-blue twin sets. The bellboys, houseboys
and engineers wear Nehru jackets, color-coded by job, in navy,
burgundy and dark green.
</P>
<P>
   In a hotel where even the guy carrying the suitcases must look
as chic as the guests, designer uniforms do not come cheap.
Although Mizrahi sells his clothes to the Mercer at wholesale, the
pieces are still expensive. (One of Mizrahi's pencil skirts, worn
by the receptionist, can retail for $180 to $900.)
</P>
<P>
   This summer, when the hotel expanded operations and opened the
Mercer Kitchen, Balazs planned to outfit the whole staff in
Mizrahi. But budget concerns made that impossible. So, said Balazs,
``We wound up using a lot of J. Crew and Banana Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason hoteliers are willing to pay a premium, even for
wholesale designer uniforms, and designers are willing to discount
their wares, is that they trade off each other's image for
publicity. Such arrangements can be traced back as far as 1948,
when Scandinavian Airlines System adopted Christian Dior's New Look
to demilitarize the appearance of steward-esses, who were
originally required to be registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Dior transformed their image. He put them in pleated skirts and
snug-fitting jackets, turning them into sexy air hostesses from
whom you'd want to order a scotch on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from Dior, Pucci, Valentino and even Calvin Klein
later supplied their versions of flight-attendant garb for Braniff
Airways, Trans World Airways and SAS, respectively. Of course, air
travel possessed more prestige back in the days before Tower Air.
</P>
<P>
   Such collaborations aren't always easy, as Mark Thomas Amadei
discovered this summer, when he was preparing to open Cafeteria, an
all-night restaurant in Chelsea. Amadei asked one of his partners,
Victor Alfaro, the designer behind the Iceberg label, to create
uniforms for the staff. Alfaro suggested that the waiters wear jump
suits with wide-flair legs _ perhaps inspired by the restaurant's
garage-style doors. But after the preliminary sketches, it was
decided, Amadei said, that Alfaro's uniforms were ``a little over
the top'' and impractical for a waiters working up a sweat over a
long shift.
</P>
<P>
   The design team of Dolce &AMP; Gabbana was brought in to dress the
staff in something easier to run around in. For the waitresses, the
designers pulled items from their fall collection _ a black
sleeveless crochet top, paired with a slim pencil skirt. For the
men, they chose white short-sleeve shirts and slim black pants made
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outfits have a very '50s feel about them, but at the same
time are very modern, keeping with the feeling of both Cafeteria
and D&AMP;G.'' Domenico Dolce said In addition, everyone wears a brown
apron with a none-too-suble Dolce &AMP; Gabbana logo.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only Helly Hansen would agree to supply dishwashers with
waterproof anoraks.

<P>
   PENNSYLVANIA -- ABORT. On an issue that Cardinal Anthony
Bevilacqua calls ``more important than the (Clinton-Lewinsky)
controversy'', the U.S. Senate failed Friday to secure enough votes
to outlaw a controversial late-term abortion procedure. While
Bevilacqua and other opponents of partial-birth abortion were

<TEXT>
<P>
   Do construction executives know something the rest of us don't?
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for thinking that the present boom in construction has
run its course are plentiful:
</P>
<P>
   _ So many professionals left the building trades during the last
recession _ and so few young people are opting for careers in
building now _ that builders find it hard to hire construction
engineers, let alone welders or bricklayers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cement and other building materials are in short supply, and
prices are rising.
</P>
<P>
   _ Economic turmoil in Asia and Russia is stifling overseas
demand, as project after project is halted or postponed, while the
resulting financial-market gyrations provoke caution among American
corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, across the country, construction executives are
clicking their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, some people are in trouble overseas, and some are facing
shortages, but by and large, this industry is in really good
shape,'' said Gary Tulacz, a senior editor at Engineering News
Record, a construction trades journal.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Tulacz may be right, but analysts are sounding
alarm bells about the not-too-distant future. ``Everyone is busy,
but materials and people are really being stretched thin,'' warned
Louis Taylor, senior real estate analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Murray, vice president of economic affairs for the F.W.
Dodge unit of the McGraw-Hill Construction Information Group,
predicted that total building activity would rise just 3 percent in
1998, compared with a 7 percent leap in 1997. ``The industry is at
cruising speed, but the strongest growth years are behind it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's woes, meanwhile, may prove to be a double whammy for the
American construction industry. The Fluor Daniel Inc. unit of Fluor
Corp., whose revenue from telecommunications work has stalled at
about $160 million a year because so many overseas projects are on
hold, worries that hungry Asian contractors will start competing in
the United States. ``They're already bidding for work in Latin
America,'' said Ron Oakley, president of Fluor Daniel's
Infrastructure Operating Co.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for cement, insulation and materials are inching up even
though manufacturers have been stepping up production. ``There's a
significant gap between supply and demand, and that's going to
continue for the foreseeable future,'' said Edward Pile, a
spokesman for Lafarge Corp., a large cement company.
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortage is also likely to persist, warned Louis
Coletti, chairman of the Building Trades Employers Association in
New York. ``The lack of a skilled work force has leaped out as the
single biggest issue facing the construction industry in this
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With so many alarm bells clanging so loudly, why are
construction executives feeling so good?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, many say their exposure to trouble overseas was
much smaller than a casual observer might suppose. Many projects
scuttled by economic meltdowns in Asia and Russia were being
handled by local contractors, while multinational companies like
Merck, Exxon and Hoechst continue to hire American companies to
design and build oil refineries, power stations and pharmaceutical
plants _ and pay for them in dollars. ``Our bookings are at an
all-time high,'' said Richard Swift, chairman of Foster Wheeler
Corp., which gets two-thirds of its revenue overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Another bright spot is an anticipated torrent of government
spending. Congress has authorized $217 billion for highway
construction in coming years, and localities are taking advantage
of low interest rates to float bonds that will pay for projects
like new schools. ``The government is going to be a huge source of
growth for us,'' said Bradley Jacobs, chairman of United Rentals,
which rents building equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a while before that money is disbursed, giving
builders time to prepare. ``Companies are already pulling kids out
of Burger Kings and training them in construction, just to be ready
for when the highway money hits,'' said Tobias Levkovich, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors are mitigating the labor and materials shortages.
Industry consolidation and modern communications have made it
easier to shift people, equipment and even work where they are
needed. United Rental has gobbled up local rental companies, adding
to its fleets of movable cranes, compactors and other equipment.
Fluor Daniel uses new engineering centers in New Delhi and Manila
for work on many American projects. ``If you don't have people
where the work is, you move the work to where the people are,''
said Ron Peterson, a Fluor Daniel group president.
</P>
<P>
   Some makers of building materials, like Owens-Corning, are
supplying U.S. projects from plants in China and Europe, while
others, like Lafarge and Certainteed, are building or opening new
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the industry was roaring like this was in the late
1980s, just before a recession brought new construction to a crawl.
No one expects another such crash, but cautious notes are being
sounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market, the overseas uncertainty, all of it has
caused a tremendous caution to well up in executives who were
positively ebullient a few months ago,'' said Thomas Falus,
president of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield New York, a real estate firm owned
by Mitsubishi Estate Co. ``They are not going to commit to a lot
more space right now. And that has got to mean a real damper on
construction.''

PRELUDES: BREATHE DEEPLY, AND START SAVING

 Abby Ellin is a New York writer. Her column on starting out in the
world of money will be filed for publication on the third Sunday of

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In ``Down and Out in Paris and London,'' George
Orwell wrote that ``poverty annihilates the future.'' In a way, he
was right. There is something liberating in being down to your last
centimes and surviving, especially if you're George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't Paris in the 1920s. This is New York on the cusp
of the 21st century, with $9 movie tickets, $75 theater tickets,
$300 for dinner for two at a four-star restaurant and $2,000
monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment. At times, it's enough to
make you long for a small town _ say, Ithaca, N.Y., where the
winters can be dreadful but where Stephanie Winston, 32 and
formerly of Manhattan, pays only $450 a month for a one-bedroom
apartment with free off-street parking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my car, I've got my job, and I don't stress trying to
make ends meet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the city, most people I know _ actors, writers, musicians,
doctors, lawyers, chefs, professors, even an M.B.A. candidate _ DO
stress. And that anxiety has forced them to get serious about their
fiscal prospects.
</P>
<P>
   They now engage in all sorts of new behavior: scanning stock
reports, lamenting the potential demise of Social Security,
investing in condos. Partly, this stems from the fact that many are
single women who have had to learn to take care of themselves. But
some have reached genuine turning points, minor existential crises
that propelled them into financial maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 31, I was robbed at gunpoint, and it made me start
thinking about my future,'' said Jill Diamond, now 33. ``I realized
I wanted security and stability, that I wanted to buy an apartment
in New York, have a house in the country, afford clothing, travel
and dining to my liking, and give my kids a similar upbringing as I
had _ safe, and full of opportunities that money lends itself
to.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So she educated herself, sitting down with accountants, lawyers
and family members and questioning them about her finances.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered the process: ``I asked my family about the
investments they already had in my name: What were they? How much
was invested? What kind of access did I have to them? I never knew
or really cared about any of that before.''
</P>
<P>
   She read books on money and self-esteem. And she abandoned her
early career aspirations, of becoming a singer, instead opening a
language school in Manhattan, which gave her a steady income and a
greater sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, she said, she found herself ``dishing out thousands
of dollars to musicians and making zilch on every gig, and teaching
at a university as an adjunct with no prospects of a full-time job
with benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't conducive to saving money,'' she noted. Almost two
years later, the school is successful and her bank account solid.
</P>
<P>
   Others took inventory after economic realities smacked them in
the face.
</P>
<P>
   Like many new college graduates, Amy Trapp moved into an
apartment in New York long before she could support herself. ``I
ended up charging way too much and got myself in deep credit-card
debt,'' recalled Ms. Trapp, now 38, of those days in the early
1980s. ``One day when I realized that I couldn't take a cash
advance on my Lord &AMP; Taylor card _ the only one that wasn't charged
to the max _ I decided to consolidate my debt and begin paying off
the balance each month. It took 18 months, but it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked so well that after she paid off her debts, she kept
making the same monthly payment to herself, putting the money into
a savings account. Once she acquired a critical mass of cash, she
moved up to a higher-interest, money-market account.
</P>
<P>
   And after she received her first raise in her job as a credit
analyst, she began setting aside half the after-tax amount. With
enough money for the minimum investment, she tried a mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I spent the money I'd saved and times
when my expenses got ahead of me, but I'd just go back and start
again,'' she said. ``Saving can be done in baby steps, and if it's
done in smaller and more frequent increments it hurts less.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it does _ much less than watching your ATM spit out a
notice of insufficient funds. And this is true even if you believe,
as Orwell did, that there is ``a great consolation in poverty,''
which he later described as ``a feeling of relief, almost of
pleasure, at knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You have talked so often of going to the dogs _ and
well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can
stand it. It takes off a lot of anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Orwell may have been on to something, and all the poets, actors
and artists of the world can take solace in it. But the rest of us
find solace in knowing ourselves genuinely secure. THAT takes off
the anxiety.

 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several years ago, Edward W. Said began writing a
memoir mostly about his childhood in Palestine in the years before
Israeli independence in 1948, before his family fled to Egypt,
before he landed at Columbia University, before he became one of
the most influential literary and cultural critics in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, something struck Said about his timing: The
writing of the memoir, which he is currently finishing, had
coincided exactly with his treatment for leukemia, which was
diagnosed after a routine cholesterol test in 1991 and which is
likely one day to end his life.
</P>
<P>
   The start of chemotherapy in 1994 had been a point of no return,
an acknowledgment that Said was entering what he calls a final
phase. The start of the memoir was the opposite, a going back, an
effort to rescue from oblivion a time and places that had all but
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   So they fell into a rhythm, the writing and the illness, each in
counterpoint to the other. For the first six months of last year,
Said was too sick to teach. He had various viruses, and then
pneumonia. The leukemia worsened. Unable to work, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the inverse of my illness,'' he said in an interview
recently. ``It's like a mirror, but from which all the actual
images have been effaced. There is nothing in the book about it.
And I found that very salutary, having something like that to go
back to.''
</P>
<P>
   Said, 62, is a man of many dimensions. He is one of the most
important literary critics alive, a professor of English and
comparative literature at Columbia, the author of 15 books, a music
critic, a scholar of opera, a pianist, a father of two grown
children and arguably the most eloquent spokesman for the
Palestinian cause in the West.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a major force in recreating the field of literary
studies over the past two decades. His work helped give form to
entire new scholarly areas, like postcolonial theory. His 1978
book, ``Orientalism,'' revolutionized the study of the Middle East
and has been argued over bitterly for years.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Said has done as much as anyone to raise the
profile of the Palestinian cause in American intellectual life. He
writes frequently on the subject. He was a member of the
Palestinian National Council until 1991 and recently made a film
about the Palestinians for the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   He is a relentless critic of Israeli policy on the Palestinians;
of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, and, in the last few
years, of Yasser Arafat and of the Oslo accords, calling the peace
agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization
``an instrument of Palestinian surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of admirers, Said is brilliant, charismatic,
passionate, funny, erudite, engaged. For some, he is also a
personal model, managing to combine a rigorous intellectual life
and impassioned political engagement.
</P>
<P>
   To those who dislike him, he is polemical, extremist,
conspiratorial, irresponsible, anti-American. They say he
attributes political motives to everyone but himself. Detractors
have called him a Nazi, a ``professor of terror,'' Arafat's
apologist. In 1985 his office was set on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a very unconventional brain,'' said Daniel Barenboim,
the Israeli pianist and conductor, who has known Said since 1992
and considers him one of his closest friends. ``I think he has
great intellectual courage.''
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon this summer, Said was in his office at Columbia
for the first time in weeks. He had been spending his days
commuting to Long Island to be hooked up to an intravenous tube as
part of a clinical trial of an experimental treatment for patients
like him for whom chemotherapy failed.
</P>
<P>
   Three afternoons a week, he found himself ``a Palestinian
patient in a Jewish hospital being taken care of by an Indian
doctor and Irish nurses,'' as he put it, pumped full of antidotes
to the therapy's side-effects like soaring fever and uncontrollable
shaking while fighting the urge to nod off.
</P>
<P>
   On a day off from treatment, his face looked drawn. Beneath the
broad shoulders of a dark blue sport coat, his frame seemed to
disappear. His arms had grown so thin he could barely hold a tennis
racket. In the BBC film, which he wrote and narrated, pneumonia had
weakened his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Said rises at 5 a.m. to work in the Riverside Drive
apartment where he lives with his wife, Mariam Cortas Said. He
travels frequently and has multiple books scheduled for publication
next year: a collection of lectures on opera; his political
columns, published twice monthly in the Arabic newspaper Al Hayat,
and his memoir, titled, with some resonance, ``Not Quite Right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've decided that it's possible to live with a sword of
Damocles hanging over you,'' he said, when asked how long he might
live (he prefers not to know). ``You can, by an act of will, not
think about it. That was, I think, the major victory that I won. I
don't think about death.''

 NEW YORK: about death.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Said was born in Jerusalem and spent the first 12 years of his
life there, the eldest child and only son of a successful
Palestinian Christian businessman. The family moved to Cairo,
Egypt, in late 1947, five months before war broke out between
Palestinian Arabs and Jews over plans to partition Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   His education was Anglocentric, as he has put it, mostly in
elite colonial schools. He also spent several years in a boarding
school in Massachusetts. He graduated from Princeton in 1957 and
got his Ph.D. in English literature from Harvard in 1964. Columbia
hired him in 1963 as an instructor in English, and then promoted
him rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   For years he lived in a state of some isolation from his own
language and background. That changed with the Arab-Israeli war in
1967. In the aftermath of the Arab defeat he found himself drawn
into the Palestinian resistance movement. Over the next few years,
he has said, he began for the first time to think and write as both
American and Arab.
</P>
<P>
   It was a statement by Golda Meir in 1969 _ ``There are no
Palestinians'' _ that set Said and others ``the slightly
preposterous challenge of disproving her,'' he said earlier this
year in a lecture at the New York Public Library that was printed
in The London Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inevitably, this led me to reconsider the notions of writing
and language,'' he recalled. ``What concerned me now was how a
subject was constituted, how a language could be formed _ writing
as a construction of realities that served one or another purpose
instrumentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembering a revelation that would shape much of his work, he
said, ``This was the world of power and representations, a world
that came into being as a series of decisions made by writers,
politicians, philosophers to adumbrate one reality and at the same
time efface others.''
</P>
<P>
   Unpopular Stand for an Academic
</P>
<P>
   The first product of that thinking was ``The Arab Portrayed,''
an essay Said published in 1968. The subject, the manipulation of
the image of the Arab in journalism and in some scholarship, was an
unusual and hardly fashionable one for a young academic at a major
U.S. university to take up.
</P>
<P>
   In that article can be found the seeds of ``Orientalism,''
published 10 years later, in which Said examined the ways in which
the power, scholarship and imagination of the 200-year-old
Orientalist tradition in Europe and the United States had viewed
the Middle East, Arabs and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   The Orient, Said argued, was ``almost a European invention.'' It
had helped define the West ``as its contrasting image, idea,
personality, experience.'' Orientalism was not only a style of
thought but also the ``corporate institution'' for dealing with
such regions as the Near, Middle and Far East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealing with it by making statements about it, authorizing
views of it, describing it, by teaching it, settling it, ruling
over it,'' Said wrote. ``In short, Orientalism was a Western style
for dominating, restructuring and having authority over the
Orient.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not the first scholar to attack Orientalism, but he had a
certain authority. He was a prominent critic at a respected
university, in touch with new currents in European thinking, like
the work of Michel Foucault, the French philosopher, on the
relationship between knowledge and power.
</P>
<P>
   The time also happened to be ripe. ``Orientalism'' appeared at a
moment of growing attention by scholars to the history of groups
like women and the oppressed, a time when many people seemed to
have become as interested in questions of representation as in the
reality itself.
</P>
<P>
   There was a restiveness, too, in the field of Middle East
Studies. Philip Khoury, a historian of the modern Middle East at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says the book surfaced
amid a growing feeling that ``some of the grand paradigms of
interpretation were no longer holding.''
</P>
<P>
   The war over ``Orientalism'' raged for years. In one
particularly acrimonious battle, Bernard Lewis of Princeton
University, the most prominent living Orientalist whom Said had
scorched, retaliated in a lengthy exchange in The New York Review
of Books in 1982.

   Thrust and Parry on Scholarship
</P>
<P>
   He accused Said of falsifying and rearranging history to support
his thesis, omitting entire countries, scholars and writers. He
said Said had displayed ``a disquieting lack of knowledge of what
scholars do,'' as well as ``astonishing blind spots'' and gaps in
his knowledge of Arabic and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Said countered, charging Lewis with distorting the truth and
criticizing the book with little more than ``a banal description of
a barony violated by a crude trespasser.'' He called Lewis ``a
passionate political partisan'' against Arab causes, a criticism
Lewis angrily rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Said seems to be unable to conceive that there may be
intellectual disagreements which are not political in origin or
purpose,'' Lewis fired back, ``and that these disagreements may be
discussed in anything other than emotional and violent language.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen books by Said have followed, including ``The
Question of Palestine,'' his case history of the struggle between
Palestinian Arabs and the Zionist movement, and ``Covering Islam,''
a critique of how the media and experts shape Western views of
Muslims, Islam and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   His book ``Culture and Imperialism,'' in which he examined among
other things the way the work of novelists like Jane Austen and
Charles Dickens not only reflected but also bolstered 19th-century
European imperialism, once again provoked a high-profile
contretemps with another respected scholar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central undercurrent of his work is that some of us are,
in virtue of our historic position, condemned to travesty others,''
the late Ernest Gellner, a social anthropologist and philosopher at
Cambridge University, wrote in The Times Literary Supplement in
1993. In fact, some colonialists ``got it right'' and some
anti-colonialists got it wrong, Gellner argued; truth is not linked
to political virtue.
</P>
<P>
   By many measures, Said's view has prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after its publication, ``Orientalism'' has been
translated into 26 languages. It is required reading in many
fields. When the Middle Eastern Studies Association of North
America organized a plenary session on the book's impact for its
upcoming annual meeting, it put no Orientalists on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   By making the case that one cannot understand modern Western
history, culture and politics without giving a central place to the
history of imperialism and colonialism, Said is said to have
indelibly marked fields ranging from English and history to
anthropology and cultural studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had as much impact as any scholar in the humanities in
the recent decades on American and Western scholarship more
broadly,'' said Timothy Mitchell, a professor of politics and
Middle Eastern studies and director of the Kervorkian Center for
Near Eastern Studies at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid Khalidi, a professor of Middle East history at the
University of Chicago, said, ``He has done this in spite of the
fact that one of the central things he stands for is viewed with
suspicion and deep anxiety and apprehension by an important segment
of the intellectual community _ the idea of Palestinian
self-determination and what that implies for Israel and Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   And his impact on that question?
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically speaking, none,'' said Eqbal Ahmad, a Pakistani
historian and close friend of Said. ``The refugees are still
refugees. Israel is still expanding. Palestinians are still losing
land. And, in fact, the PLO has thrown in the towel.''
</P>
<P>
   And how does that leave him feeling? Said was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, disappointed,'' he said. ``But I feel a sort of renewed
intransigence. In a certain way, I feel it becomes more important
to harp on these questions.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Said finds himself drawn to two topics, both of
which seem poignantly linked to the moment in which he finds
himself in his life. One is a book on so-called late style, in
which he is focusing not on those artists whose work becomes
increasingly harmonious as they age, but on those whose late work
is ``full of unresolved dissonances,'' people who ``go out with
more complexity and more energy than they came in.''
</P>
<P>
   The other is what he calls ``the ideology of remembering.''
While he worries about the effects of his treatment on his own
memory, he has become fascinated by what entire cultures choose to
remember and to forget. He is preparing a series of lectures on
amnesia and memory in American culture.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, in one of his political columns, he argued that
there can be no basis for coexistence between Palestinians and
Israeli Jews until two things happen: Arabs acknowledge and respect
the fact of the Holocaust and Jews do the same for the
dispossession of the Palestinians since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the most hostile mail I've ever gotten,'' all from
Arabs, Said recalled. ``That's impossible for people to understand
_ that there are irreconcilables and that it's the job of the
intellectual to show that they can be irreconcilable, but they
exist, unreconciled, next to each other.''

&HT;        WATERGATE FIGURE FEELING DEJA VU 
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- Charles Colson knows how difficult it is
to tell a president he needs to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   As special counsel to President Nixon during the Watergate
scandal, Colson said he confronted Nixon on two consecutive days,
only to be met with a stern rebuttal -- the same sort of rebuke, he
says, Clinton aides would face today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who tried to tell Nixon the truth got rebuked. No
president wants to hear the truth,'' said Colson, who served seven
months in federal prison for helping cover up the Watergate
break-in that triggered the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Colson was the only Watergate defendant not charged with
perjury, and he credits the scandal with forcing him to look at his
own moral character: he became a born-again Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Capitol Friday, where he attended the Senate vote on
the effort to ban partial-birth abortions with such religious
luminaries as Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Colson
said there are many parallels between the current scandal and
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   It's about a small crime -- in this case perjury -- that
mushroomed into a much larger crisis as the president refused to
come clean with the American public, he said. Most of all, Colson
said, the issue will be decided by whether or not the public trusts
its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issues are very similar. It's a question of the moral
authority of the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
tried to criticize Clinton at a cabinet meeting, but was chastised
by the president. In February 1973, Colson said he twice tried to
tell Nixon that his old friend and former attorney general, John
Mitchell, who also ran Nixon's 1972 re-election, oversaw a slush
fund that paid for the Watergate break-in and other misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell me I'm supposed to turn on John Mitchell,'' Nixon
replied, according to Colson. ``I'm not going to do that.''
</P>

   From his experience, Colson said he believes some of Clinton's
top aides are doing some serious soul searching, similar to his own
in the 1970s, and that very soon someone will step down, disgraced
with the scandal. ``I just have to believe someone's going to,'' he
said.

NON-MEXICAN DETAINEES RELEASED AS INS STRUGGLES TO FIND PLACE TO
PUT THEM 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN _ While illegal immigrants from Mexico caught by U.S.
Border Patrol agents are usually returned to their country the same
day, one in four non-Mexicans apprehended is set free in South
Texas, U.S. Border Patrol officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of mostly Central American immigrants allowed
to continue on to their destinations in the United States _ more
than 5,500 in the past two years _ has alarmed anti-immigration
groups and discouraged many rank-and-file Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get frustrated and say, ``Why are we going to mess with
them? They're going to cut them loose anyway,' '' said one Border
Patrol agent in Brownsville, who spoke on condition he would not be
identified. ``But by the same token, it's our job. We're here to
enforce the law, not to be immigration judges. It's aggravating,
but it's our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans entering this country illegally can easily be taken
back across an international bridge _ standard procedure for those
who have committed no crimes and agree to return voluntarily. But
noncriminal immigrants from other countries cannot be deported so
easily.
</P>
<P>
   If there is room to hold them in one of Texas' INS detention
facilities in Port Isabel or El Paso _ or in private facilities in
Houston or Laredo _ they are locked up until it can be confirmed
that they have a legal right to be here or until they can be
escorted back to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   Often these immigrants, particularly those traveling as
families, are freed and given a summons telling them when to show
up for a court hearing. They frequently disappear, never to be
heard from again.
</P>
<P>
   The reason they are freed is that the border detention centers
are full and are not equipped to house families together, the head
Border Patrol agent in South Texas confirmed last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we release somebody on their own recognizance, it's
because of a special situation, such as a mother with minor
children we cannot separate or place in jail,'' said Patrol Chief
Joe Garza, who is in charge of the McAllen Border Patrol sector,
which has apprehended more non-Mexican border crossers than any
other sector on the southern U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of these cases,'' Garza said, ``they already have
relatives here in the United States and these people are going to
join them.''
</P>
<P>
   Garza said other non-Mexican immigrants that his officers
release are &UR;  &LR; people with special needs, such as pregnant women and
injured or disabled immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers will only increase, Garza said. Despite intensive
border containment operations by the Border Patrol in South Texas
and El Paso, the number of non-Mexican immigrants being detained
along the Texas-Mexico border continues to rise. In the McAllen
sector alone, the number has tripled in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; However, Chief Garza emphasized that the non-Mexicans
immigrants still represent only 4 percent of the 246,000
undocumented immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol officers last
fiscal year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; South Texas historically has been a principal entry point for
undocumented immigrants from Latin American countries, as well as
Mexico, in part because it is the closest stretch of border to
Central and South America. But in recent years, international
smuggling organizations also have begun using the South Texas
corridor, guiding clients from China, India and Pakistan up from
Mexico and across the shallow Rio Grande into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, a Washington-based human rights group blasted INS
detention policies, noting that nearly 60 percent of immigrants
being held for immigration offenses nationwide are currently in
city or county jails because INS facilities are full.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded conditions at Texas' two INS detention centers, in Port
Isabel and El Paso, at times force Border Patrol agents to release
immigrants who cannot legally be returned to Mexico, officials
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Hollenbeck, a Border Patrol intelligence agent in the Marfa
sector, expects more non-Mexican immigrants to try to enter via the
Big Bend area because of stepped-up enforcement in the lower Rio
Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Marfa detains few non-Mexicans now, Hollenbeck said
there are times when no space is available at the nearest INS
detention center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The camp we send them to is in El Paso, if there is camp
space,'' said Hollenbeck. ``Otherwise, we have to release them on
their own recognizance and give them a court date at a later time,
through the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollenbeck said camp officials in El Paso won't turn away
immigrants who are criminals, in keeping with a new immigration law
mandating the detention and deportation of immigrants convicted of
felonies. But for noncriminals, he said, ``If they're full, they
say, ``Sorry, we can't accept anybody,' and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   The patrol chief in McAllen acknowledged that savvy immigrant
smugglers take advantage of the INS' humanitarian policies and
routinely coach their clients to falsely claim they are related to
each other if they are caught by the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugglers are very aware of what procedures we have,'' Garza
said. ``They're very aware we try and consider humanitarian reasons
so they try every which way to get their (smuggled
clients) &UR;  &LR; through. And that's the difficult part of our job. We
want to do the right thing, and people take advantage of the system
and the generosity of this country by trying to pass themselves off
as a family when they are not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the McAllen sector, the impact is considerable. In fiscal
year 1997, Border Patrol agents released 2,199 of the 8,573
undocumented non-Mexican immigrants they apprehended, or 26
percent. Roughly the same percentage of the 12,084 non-Mexican
immigrants caught during the first 11 months of this fiscal year
also have been released.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, advocacy groups seeking tighter controls on
immigration charge that the INS is not serious about enforcement or
detention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence they've made expanding detention space the
kind of priority they've devoted to naturalization (citizenship
programs),'' charged Dan Stein, executive director of the
Federation for American Immigration Reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important priority for the commissioner of
immigration must be to maintain adequate detention space, to detain
OTMs (Other Than Mexicans) until their court dates. Once detention
space is overcrowded and becomes overfilled, you lose your
deterrence value and illegals abuse the system,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Key players in the nation's immigration policy, such as U.S.
Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, are anxious to see results from historic
funding increases that have doubled the INS budget, including the
money to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents each year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who authored the 1996 Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act, which strengthened laws on the detention and
removal of immigration violators, has since worked to increase the
agency's funding, said spokesman Allen Kay.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 1996, the INS detention budget was $366.6
million, but was increased by Congress to $540 million in the 1997
budget year, and is $732.5 million for the current budget year. The
INS is asking for $771.4 million for next year's detention budget,
which includes $22.5 million to expand the Port Isabel detention
center. Another $12.6 million will be earmarked to upgrade older
facilities around the country and start design work for four new
detention centers to open in the year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (1996) Act calls for dramatically increasing the amount of
detention space, and it is in the process, but it is not happening
as quickly as the congressman would like,'' Kay said. ``It is a
problem, and it is a problem that needs to be worked out quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   As they wait for new facilities to be built, INS officials are
spending millions each week _ paying city and county jails an
average of $58 per day to house each illegal immigrant who cannot
be housed in an INS facility.
</P>
<P>
   That practice was strongly condemned earlier this month by Human
Rights Watch, which noted that the INS currently holds 9,000 of its
15,000 detainees in jails, including those seeking asylum. The lead
researcher for the organization said that in addition to being
mixed in with criminals, some of the detainees were being abused by
their jailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found instances of physical mistreatment by jail officers,
inadequate medical care, and their right to legal counsel is
undermined by being placed in local jails,'' said Jennifer Bailey,
a research associate with Human Rights Watch in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey said guards at the Jackson County Correctional Facility
in Florida in July allegedly used electric cattle prods to shock
immigration detainees who were tied up. At the Wharton County Jail
in Wharton, southwest of Houston, immigration detainees had not
been outside in over a year, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going on because the INS detention capacity is currently
overwhelmed. There are no more beds available in their own
processing centers,'' Bailey said, adding that the INS has
``essentially abdicated its responsibility for the well-being and
safety of its detainees.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, INS regional spokesman Tomas Zuniga said there are
5,503 people in detention, but existing INS facilities in the state
can hold only 2,140. The rest are being housed in 121 Texas jails
and out-of-state jails with which the INS has contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rio Grande Valley, immigration attorneys are no longer
surprised when told that a client has been abruptly transferred
from the INS detention center to a county jail somewhere upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Lang, a Harlingen attorney who, through the American Bar
Association, coordinates free legal services for immigrants seeking
asylum, said the transfer to a county jail often ends an asylum
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they get pressed (for space), they send people to the
county jails,'' Lang said of the local INS camp in Port Isabel.
``And those people who are sent to county jails, on average, accept
deportation in greater numbers than those people detained at INS
detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? No. 1, they are housed in harsh conditions, they lose
contact with lawyers, and are far more restricted in their ability
to communicate with family and friends.'' &QL;

 &HT;      SECURITIES INDUSTRY PREPARING FOR MILLENNIUM BUG
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ron Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 -- Utah Republican Bob Bennett, chairman of
the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000, compared the
technological glitches expected to come with the new MILLENNIUM to
a snow storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything might be shut down for a couple of days,'' Bennett
said during a hearing to examine the effect January 1, 2000 will
have on pensions and mutual funds. ``But snow melts of its own
accord. This problem won't melt. It will need to be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders in the securities industry told the committee not to
worry; they said they will have solutions for the Year 2000, or
Y2K, problem before the champagne bottles are uncorked.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said chose to focus on pensions and mutual funds
Thursday morning because more than one-third of American households
now own shares of mutual funds with assets of more than $5
trillion. In addition, nearly 84 million Americans participate in
pension plans which invest nearly $1.8 trillion dollars in
equities.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, he said, wanted to know whether fund managers
have enough information to make informed judgements and take the
correct precautions to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for investors to feel confident that the
managers of their pension funds and investment companies are taking
the necessary steps to secure their investments for the Year 200.
Without this confidence, investors will move available funds from
the stock market in anticipation of the century date change, and
that movement could have a dramatic impact on the world market and
the global economy,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   But Laura S. Unger, a commissioner of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said she is confident the crisis will be
averted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the mutual fund industry is well aware of the
potential problems that the Year 2000 presents, and is preparing to
meet this challenge in a timely manner,'' Unger testified. ``Funds
and advisers generally appear to be expending the effort and
resources necessary to ensure Year 2000 compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kittell, executive vice president of the Securities
Industry Association, shared the commissioners optimistic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year 2000 effort is the largest business and technology
effort the financial services industry has ever undertaken, with a
cost projected to range between $4 and $6 billion,'' Kittell said.
``The most important element of the project is a comprehensive
testing program ... We are strongly encouraged that Wall Street
will be ready when Year 2000 arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Averting Y2K problems are high priority for senior managers at
mutual fund firms, testified Investment Company Institute President
Matthew Fink. He said companies are working to identify internal
Y2K problems, while dedicating special staffs and special budgets
to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The one concern shared by senators on the committee and industry
insiders was the readiness of partners overseas, creating concern
over companies with international portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to get assurances that 'We're going to be O.K.' from
companies over here, but we seem unsure of foreign producers,
suppliers and partners,'' Bennett said.

 &HT;      SECURITIES INDUSTRY PREPARING FOR MILLENNIUM BUG
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Ron Eckstein  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 17 -- Utah Republican Bob Bennett, chairman of
the Senate Special Committee on the Year 2000, compared the
technological glitches expected to come with the new MILLENNIUM to
a snow storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything might be shut down for a couple of days,'' Bennett
said during a hearing to examine the effect January 1, 2000 will
have on pensions and mutual funds. ``But snow melts of its own
accord. This problem won't melt. It will need to be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   But leaders in the securities industry told the committee not to
worry; they said they will have solutions for the Year 2000, or
Y2K, problem before the champagne bottles are uncorked.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said chose to focus on pensions and mutual funds
Thursday morning because more than one-third of American households
now own shares of mutual funds with assets of more than $5
trillion. In addition, nearly 84 million Americans participate in
pension plans which invest nearly $1.8 trillion dollars in
equities.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, he said, wanted to know whether fund managers
have enough information to make informed judgements and take the
correct precautions to deal with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for investors to feel confident that the
managers of their pension funds and investment companies are taking
the necessary steps to secure their investments for the Year 200.
Without this confidence, investors will move available funds from
the stock market in anticipation of the century date change, and
that movement could have a dramatic impact on the world market and
the global economy,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   But Laura S. Unger, a commissioner of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said she is confident the crisis will be
averted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the mutual fund industry is well aware of the
potential problems that the Year 2000 presents, and is preparing to
meet this challenge in a timely manner,'' Unger testified. ``Funds
and advisers generally appear to be expending the effort and
resources necessary to ensure Year 2000 compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Kittell, executive vice president of the Securities
Industry Association, shared the commissioners optimistic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year 2000 effort is the largest business and technology
effort the financial services industry has ever undertaken, with a
cost projected to range between $4 and $6 billion,'' Kittell said.
``The most important element of the project is a comprehensive
testing program ... We are strongly encouraged that Wall Street
will be ready when Year 2000 arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Averting Y2K problems are high priority for senior managers at
mutual fund firms, testified Investment Company Institute President
Matthew Fink. He said companies are working to identify internal
Y2K problems, while dedicating special staffs and special budgets
to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The one concern shared by senators on the committee and industry
insiders was the readiness of partners overseas, creating concern
over companies with international portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``We seem to get assurances that 'We're going to be O.K.' from
companies over here, but we seem unsure of foreign producers,
suppliers and partners,'' Bennett said.

 &HT;    Fall's the ideal time for adding color to a graying landscape
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any day now, you'll glance out the window and wonder when you
moved to Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly that rainbow of summer-flowering annuals has shriveled
to a torched hedge of tumbleweed. The green carpet of lush lawn you
moaned about mowing has withered to a bad shade of brown shag.
That's the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that fall _ the best gardening season of all _
is the perfect time for infusing your garden with plants that will
provide color during the next three seasons until summer returns.
</P>
<P>
   Some color can be had now by incorporating plants that don't
begin flowering until late summer and fall. For an instant punch in
winter, the easiest color _ pansies, mums and ornamental vegetables
_ will come by setting out these annuals over the next few weeks.
And for that early-spring splash, when landscapes are still gray,
now's also the time to plant bulbs and perennials so that they will
become established over winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring color doesn't just happen in March. It happens in fall,
when you plan for it and plant it,'' said Sharon Roth, a
spokeswoman for Pike Family Nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   So why's fall so great for planting?
</P>
<P>
   -- Cooler temperatures make the soil soft and workable yet still
warm enough to encourage root growth. Less heat also means plants
lose less moisture through their leaves.
</P>
<P>
   -- Shorter days offer fewer hours of the stressful sun that
bakes plants in midsummer. Less daylight also slows plant growth,
enabling energy to be spent on establishing roots instead of
foliage, which makes the plant strong.
</P>
<P>
   -- Garden centers often offer better prices and selections on
plants in fall than in spring, when demand is highest.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to dig in? For the novice, here are some tried-and-true
plants _ and for the seasoned, some new varieties _ to consider for
fall, winter and spring color, all of which can be planted now.
</P>
<P>
   FALL
</P>
<P>
   -- Stretch the summer. Some summer annuals _ petunias, marigolds
and lantana _ can still be planted to prolong the season. Add
fall-blooming perennials, such as asters, goldenrod and ornamental
grasses (left) to the mix, and you can sustain color until frost.
</P>
<P>
   -- Color can be subtle. As sunlight grows weaker, warm colors
such as reds, oranges and yellows aren't as necessary for
enlivening the garden. Fall perennials such as Autumn Joy sedum,
whose flowers turn from whitish-green to pink to russet (above),
and Mexican sage, with its bluish-purple or white plumes, are good
choices.
</P>
<P>
   -- It's trailgating season. Those lush vines that enveloped your
arbor, fence or mailbox all summer don't have to meet a dead end in
cooler weather. Try Sweet Autumn clematis, with its fragrant white
flowers (left); Boston ivy, which turns red; and Clematis armandii
and Confederate jasmine, for year-round green.
</P>
<P>
   -- Azaleas in fall? Flowerwood Nursery introduced its Encore
series of repeat-blooming azaleas, ranging from lavender to red,
last year, and new colors, including Bravo (a rich red) and Monarch
(coral, above) are available at retailers such as Pike and Home
Depot. ``What's so great about them is they bloom in spring, again
in the summer and then in fall until frost,'' said Amy Coker of the
Florida company. For shrubs that offer foliage color, consider
barberry, oakleaf hydrangea, sweetshrub, nandina and fothergilla.
</P>
<P>
   WINTER
</P>
<P>
   -- Grass is a gas. Ornamental grasses are popular choices for
creating height in borders and containers. ``Most will turn brown
in winter, but their plumes add color and interest,'' said Sally
Alcock, an assistant manager of Hastings Nature &AMP; Garden Center.
Consider Morning Light miscanthus, Little Bunny pennisetum and
Japanese Blood Grass. For shrub interest, consider berry producers,
including beautyberry, tea viburnum and hollies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't hide your veggies. Color doesn't come only from
flowers; foliage can range from chartreuse to red to purple _
especially when you consider vegetables. Both edibles and
ornamentals no longer are relegated to a backyard patch. Herbs and
leafy vegetables, such as cabbages (above), make colorful landscape
and container plants, especially when complemented by pansies.
``People are getting more and more into lettuces, red mustard,
green mustard, Mizuna, Tatsoi, kale and parsley,'' said Denise
Smith, owner of GardenSmith Greenhouses in Jefferson. Among her new
offerings this season are a dark green Toscono kale and purple and
orange cauliflowers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mum's the word. Chrysanthemums, pansies and snapdragons are
old standbys. Instead of planting en masse, mix these low-growing
annuals in beds and containers with small evergreen shrubs;
perennials such as Maiden grass and salvias (for height) and golden
Creeping Jenny (for cascaders); or winter vegetables such as Red
Giant mustard, dinosaur kale or Swiss chard. The mix of annuals and
perennials will keep a container flourishing through the winter.
``People tend to think only fall or spring when planting, but
perennials can extend those seasons into winter,'' said Sally
Alcock of Hastings garden center.
</P>
<P>
   SPRING
</P>
<P>
   -- What's hot? Orange. Long the bane of gardeners, the color is
expected to be popular next spring, especially when paired with
purple. ``We're awash in requests for lists of orange flowers,
especially tulips,'' said Sally Ferguson of Netherlands Flower Bulb
Information Center in Brooklyn, N.Y. (In this area, wait until
November to plant tulips.) The Fosteriana tulip `Orange Emperor'
(above), a large salmon-orange bloomer, has gotten a big plug from
its biggest fan, Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mix 'n' match. Fall is an ideal time to mix bulbs with early
spring-blooming perennials, which also are best planted this
season. Consider planting tulips with hostas, purple hyacinth with
heather (above).
</P>
<P>
   -- Cheaper by the dozen. By planting some spring-flowering
perennials now, you can save money. A dozen 4-inch pots of
foxgloves are less expensive to plant now than several 10-gallon
containers of mature plants will be in spring, nursery owner Denise
Smith said. Yet those planted in fall typically perform better than
those planted in spring. Mail-order giant Wayside Gardens in
Hodges, S.C., is introducing a new foxglove, Digitalis purpurea
`Pam's Choice,' that sports white bells with maroon throats.
</P>
<P>
   -- Variety is the spice ... Some color can come from pattern,
like that of hostas' variegated foliage. New varieties are rampant.
Be among the first on your block to grow Wayside's `White
Christmas,' which has white leaves edged in green (above).

 &HT;    COLUMN: Hint of autumn awakens need to restore order
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I telephoned him at his Paulding County(Ga.) home recently,
John Yow, my editor at Longstreet Press, took awhile getting on the
line. Guessing _ I apologized for taking him from his gardening,
and we went on taking care of book matters.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, John was talking about what had driven him to
the garden that day. It wasn't to admire his corn, okra, hot banana
peppers, tomatoes or even his fabulous moonflower. ``I was pulling
weeds,'' he said. ``My garden had gotten overgrown. Weeds
everywhere. It looked awful. I had to weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardening always is a competition between order and disorder,
and disorder reigned. I couldn't stand it.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a chaotic garden can make you feel that all of life
is out of control. Rampaging weeds, overgrown shrubs, unpruned
trees, spent blooms, burnt out annuals and seedy perennials amount
to the horticultural equivalent of hamburger wrappers carelessly
tossed onto the sidewalk, soda cans plopped thoughtlessly along the
roadside _ amid the trashy butts of cigarettes. It is like a house
with filthy floors and piles of unwashed laundry and undone dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Like many this year, I understood all that intellectually, but
the fact is for several months I did little to bring order to my
garden. Keeping plants watered enough to keep most alive had been
as much as I'd had the will to do.
</P>
<P>
   As leaves hinted at autumn color and September's sharp-edged
light began shining upon us, pointing toward a change in the
weather, I felt a change of attitude. Let order begin.
</P>
<P>
   So motivated, I took to the garden of weeds. Yes, I struggled
into the task a good month or so behind John, but I don't have his
youthful stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, I gathered great emotional vigor, assailing the crab
grass and the tree and shrub seedlings, the dandelion, plantain and
a million others growing happily where they were not wanted.
</P>
<P>
   I felt good and righteous ridding my garden of these uninviteds
_ and in the process uncovering and showing to better advantage
what I had planted. The dwarf mondo no longer was obscured by
ordinary grass, and the lush barberry was rid of the skanky green
weeds that had thrust themselves down its burgundy throat.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled and dug and gouged away weeds, and I pruned and
groomed, too, gathering twigs that had fallen. I had begun working
my way out of the slough of disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what a revealing journey this turned out to be. Trying to
bring order to chaos is, in some ways, the flip side of planting;
they both can be obsessions. Just as I am given to sowing in the
rain and hoeing at midnight, I found myself weeding at dawn,
pulling grass invaders as the afternoon bulged to its hottest
point.
</P>
<P>
   Once I got chaos on the run, I couldn't stop. On the way to
anywhere, I had to pull something, dig up something. I had to
uncover just one more little piece of order.
</P>
<P>
   I know there is some point between chaos and the obsession to
create order _ the gardening equivalent of what politicians used to
call ``the sensible center.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, I know that middle point doesn't satisfy me. I want nothing
or everything. Let disorder reign or fight it to the death. Leave
it alone or be consumed by the need to destroy it. Give me chaos,
or give me obsession.

 &HT;    'The Wounded Healer'
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most religious leaders dispense wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Nouwen did more _ he gave his tears.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dutch Catholic priest died on Sept. 21, 1996, he left a
legacy that many compare to such spiritual giants as C.S. Lewis and
Thomas Merton.
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen proved that a spiritual mentor could be vulnerable. He
wrote some of the most moving and confessional passages in
Christian literature, including one searing book that detailed his
recovery from a midlife breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen was, as the title of one of his books suggested, ``The
Wounded Healer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was incomplete, yet he knew he was complete in God,'' said
the Rev. Charles Black, an associate pastor at Atlanta's First
Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
   As Nouwen fans gather this month at his grave in Toronto to mark
the second anniversary of his death, there are signs that his
popularity is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   -- Three major publishers have released a collection of Nouwen's
writings within the past year. One biography has been released and
another is upcoming.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sales of Nouwen's books have actually increased by about 10
percent since his death, his publishers report.
</P>
<P>
   -- In a poll cited by Christianity Today magazine, a majority of
North American pastors reported that Nouwen was their most
influential theologian.
</P>
<P>
   -- Three of Nouwen's books are currently on the Top Ten book
list for Catholic religious books, according to Publishers Weekly,
the trade magazine for the book industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Byrns, an editor with Crossroad Publishing, said Nouwen was
a bridge between Catholics and other religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a Catholic priest, but an evangelical Protestant deep
in the heart of Alabama would also be reading Henri Nouwen,'' Byrns
said.
</P>
<P>
   A restless mind
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen, 64 at his death, wrote about the big issues of the day:
poverty, violence, materialism. Yet his biggest gift was in helping
readers steer through their struggles with loneliness, anger and
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote with clarity but with so much wisdom,'' said Sherry
Nicholson, 46, an Atlanta public relations executive who stumbled
onto Nouwen during a period of depression. ``He was so human and so
willing to share his own feelings about where he was in different
circumstances of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen's 39 books (most are still in print) reveal a restless
mind that could draw spiritual lessons from unexpected places: a
billboard looming over a Los Angeles freeway, a trapeze act or a
Rembrandt painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the spiritual life accessible,'' said Chris Glaser,
47, an Atlanta writer and former Nouwen student. ``He had a feeling
for contemporary dilemmas, but he didn't use highfalutin language.
He spoke in a way that people could understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he was a priest, Nouwen did not simply contemplate God.
He lived the issues he wrote about. He participated in the civil
rights movement, became a peace activist, and served as a
missionary to the poor in Lima, Peru.
</P>
<P>
   People who knew Nouwen, however, recall his humility more than
his activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``His apartment door on campus was always left unlocked so that
students could come and see him if they wanted to see him,'' said
Glaser, who was a student of Nouwen's at Yale Divinity School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once when one of the students talked about all of the books in
his office library, he realized that his books seemed
intimidating,'' Glaser said. ``So he removed the book because he
didn't want anything to come between him and students.''
</P>
<P>
   Childlike fragility
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Nouwen also recall another quality _ his childlike
fragility. A priest who took on vows of celibacy, Nouwen struggled
with loneliness. Nouwen confessed in one of his later books (``The
Inner Voice of Love'') that his ``inexhaustible need for
affection'' became an addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really needed friends and people close to him,'' said
Sister Sue Mosteller, who befriended Nouwen at L'Arche Daybreak
community, a sanctuary for mentally disabled people near Toronto.
``When that didn't happen, it was tortuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, Nouwen and Mosteller had just finished lecturing at a
religious retreat in North Carolina. When Mosteller told Nouwen
that she felt they had not reached their audience, Nouwen burst
into tears, saying, ``Oh, I try so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen was born into a pious Catholic family in the Netherlands
in 1932. His father was a lawyer and his mother a bookkeeper. He
was ordained to the priesthood when he was 25.
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen's first success came in academia. After his ordination,
he held positions at the Menninger Clinic, Notre Dame, Yale and
Harvard universities. While teaching, Nouwen started writing,
publishing his first book, ``Intimacy: Pastoral Psychological
Essays,'' which attempted to answer the typical questions about God
he encountered from students.
</P>
<P>
   As Nouwen's book gained in popularity, he became a sought-after
speaker. Invitations literally poured in from the world. His
speaking style was dramatic. Nouwen didn't use notes and often
paced the floors, waving his large hands _ he was 6 feet 3 _ while
speaking in his Dutch-accented lisp.
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen developed a worldwide reputation, but he was exhausted by
the time he was 49. He resigned his tenured position at Yale and
eventually accepted an invitation to become the chaplain at
Daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here didn't know Henri from his books,'' Mosteller
said. ``Most can't read. His big lectures didn't impress them. But
they loved him. He knew he was loved for what he was, not for what
he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen was transformed by one resident in particular, Adam, a
severely retarded young man who was unable to talk, walk or dress
himself. Nouwen took two hours to clean and dress Adam each
morning.
</P>
<P>
   One visitor asked Nouwen whether his time could have been spent
better elsewhere, but Nouwen told him that Adam was his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my past life has been built around the idea that my
value depends on what I do,'' Nouwen wrote. ``I earned my degree
and awards and I made a career. ... But as I sit beside the slow
and heavily breathing Adam, I start seeing how violent that journey
was. So filled with desires to be better than others, so marked by
rivalry and competition, so pervaded with compulsions and
obsessions.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nouwen's neediness continued to cause him problems, even as
he searched for peace at Daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   'So vulnerable'
</P>
<P>
   He became attracted to another staff member, a younger man who
some said resembled Nouwen: sensitive and outgoing. Nouwen began to
talk to his friend every day, reaching him by phone when he was
traveling. ``He was putting more demands on the friendship,'' said
Wendy Greer, a friend of Nouwen's. ``He was almost suffocating the
other person.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the man told Nouwen that he could not carry the weight
of their friendship. Nouwen was devastated. He wrote later that ``I
could no longer sleep. I cried uncontrollably for hours. ... Within
me there was one long scream coming from a place I didn't know
existed, a place full of demons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen left Daybreak and entered a monastery for six months. A
friend told him that the celibate life wasn't meant for him because
he was so needy, but Nouwen decided that he would stick to his
vows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he was so sensitive he was also so vulnerable,'' said
Robert Durback, a former Trappist monk who edited an anthology of
Nouwen's works called ``Seeds of Hope'' (Doubleday, $11). ``I was
talking to him on the phone once when he said, `You know, I must
continually pursue a relationship with Jesus. If I didn't, I could
get into trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Nouwen got help. He sought psychological and pastoral
counseling while in seclusion. He wrote about his experiences in a
private journal that later became ``The Inner Voice of Love.''
Nouwen described his stay as ``a time of intense purification and a
new inner freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Reinvigorated, Nouwen returned to Daybreak. He even resumed his
friendship with the man he had become so attached to. He spent his
last years at Daybreak. On Sept. 21, 1996, he suffered a heart
attack in the Netherlands after flying there for an interview with
a film crew.
</P>
<P>
   Nouwen was honored with a state funeral by the Netherlands.
Mother Teresa attended. His coffin was decorated with colorful
drawings made by the disabled people of Daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his death, Nouwen's life still burns brightly as more
people discover his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every real encounter, every real meeting, every real intimacy
growing out of the divine love we carry within us is not ended or
stopped by death,'' Nouwen said during an interview with the
National Catholic Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen ... that some intimacies people have lived in
marriage, in friendship or in effective relationships, can continue
to bear fruit beyond the person's chronological life.''

 &HT;    Powerful rituals are common with the High Holy Days
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The water of baptism and mikvah, the wine of Seder and
communion, the colors of liturgy _ religion is full of symbols and
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   For Jews, some powerful rituals are connected with the High Holy
Days, which begin with Rosh Hashana at sundown Sunday and end Sept.
30 with Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life without ritual can be extremely empty,'' said Rabbi Mark
Kunis of the 830-family Shearith Israel, a traditional synagogue in
Atlanta. ``Ritual has the power to take our highest ideals and
manifest them in our daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis of the High Holy Days is that ``man is not doomed,
that man can change for the better and be reborn, that there is
always hope,'' said Kunis. ``These ideas are borne out in Jewish
rituals for the new year.''
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon before Rosh Hashana begins, many Jews go to a
natural body of water, recite prayers and drop bread crumbs into
the stream. The bread symbolizes sin and arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gather with our families as the sun sets over the water and
it is very beautiful,'' said Kunis. ``When the most important thing
in our lives is what television program is on that particular
evening, we live with the feeling that maybe we have wasted a lot
of the precious time God has given us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shofar
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the shofar is piercing, not sweet or mellifluous,
because it is meant as a wake-up call, says Rabbi Steven Lebow of
the 720-family Temple Kol Emeth in Cobb County. ``It's meant to
wake up your spirit right down to your soul,'' he said. ``It tells
you it's time to change, time to put away what is past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Torah gives no reason for blowing the shofar, or ram's horn,
on Rosh Hashana, but Jews connect the ritual with the story of
Abraham, who was asked by God to prepare his son Isaac to be
sacrificed. But when Abraham got to the altar, he found a ram
caught in the bushes nearby. God then told him to sacrifice the
ram, not his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe mystically that God looks down from heaven, sees us
blowing the ram's horn and is reminded of the tremendous faith of
our ancestor,'' Lebow said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kittel
</P>
<P>
   From a German word for smock, the kittel is a white garment that
is worn over other clothes. The Torah is also covered in white
throughout the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wearing of white represents purity,'' said Kunis. ``On
Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, we ask and are forgiven of our sins
and face the New Year with that sense of purity. Also, white seems
to be an allusion to the garb of the angels. With the forgiveness
of our sins, we achieve a level of purity comparable with that of
the angels.''
</P>
<P>
   But a kittel is also a burial shroud, and its use at this time
of year reminds Jews of their mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is on Rosh Hashana that our fate is decided for the coming
year, who shall live and who shall die,'' said Kunis. ``There is a
saying that repentance, prayer and charity can avert the evil
decree. In other words, if God has decreed against us for the
coming year _ death, disease or financial disaster _ these three
actions can change God's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Observant Jews are very generous this time of year, spend hours
praying in the synagogue, and ask forgiveness of God and of each
other, he said. ``God doesn't forgive on high unless we forgive
below.''
</P>
<P>
   The Priestly Blessing
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock on television's ``Star Trek''
raised his hand in a split-fingered salute, many Jews recognized it
as the sign of the Kohanim, or Jewish priestly class, for the
blessing of the congregation on Rosh Hashana. As part of the Rosh
Hashana service in many synagogues, the Kohanim remove their shoes,
have their hands ritually washed, then stand before the Ark.
</P>
<P>
   At the appropriate time, they cover their heads with their
prayer shawls and recite a benediction: ``Blessed art thou O Lord
our God, king of the universe, who hast hallowed us with the
sanctity of Aaron and commanded us to bless his people Israel in
love.'' They raise their hands to form ``windows'' through which
God can send blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Lebow's Reform synagogue still does the ritual. ``I think it's
very meaningful to feel that power of blessing that goes back
thousands of years,'' he said.

   WOMEN IN SPORTS:
</P>
<P>
   A SEVEN-PART SERIES FROM THE AJC
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution will begin a
seven-part series on the rapidly changing women's sports scene.
Unlike men's sports, which has been evolving for several decades,
even centuries, women's sports has advanced relatively overnight
from pick-up or intramural status to high-profile, organized events
that increasingly find their way way onto TV. As the women's sports
scene evolves, it is becoming more and more like the men's _ for
better or worse. The AJC series will summarize how far women's
sports has come and will address numerous issues that it is, or
will be, facing. The time hook is the 25th anniversary of Billie
Jean King's monumental win over Bobby Riggs in a tennis exhibition,
along with the implementation of Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   Stories for the Sunday's Part One will move on the Cox Wire
tonight. Photos and graphics for the series will be available
beginning Monday. Extensive budgets for each part of the series
will be included on the daily budgets. Sunday's Part One budget is
listed below.
</P>
<P>
   If you need more information about the series, contact Tom Oder
on the CoxNet desk in Atlanta at 404 526-5456.

   DAY ONE: OVERVIEW
</P>
<P>
   WOMEN-INSPORTS _ Twenty-five years ago, the Bobby Riggs-Billie
Jean King tennis match was one of the most talked-about sports
event -- but as a circus-like exhibition. From that farce, women's
sports have gotten serious. Now there are so many more
opportunities, with two pro basketball leagues, soccer and hockey
in the works and thousands of college scholarships available to
young women. They are getting on TV and in the print media. And
their stars are becoming role models as well as marketing tools.
Women's sports is at a crossroads, with several road bumps ahead.
This sweep story will look at how big women's sports has gotten,
what's driving it, who the big names are. Plenty of numbers, TV,
marketing. (Schultz/Fish, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 117. WITH

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While moving about his district here last weekend,
only days after the release of the independent counsel's report on
President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, Rep. John Lewis
was struck by the universality of support for Clinton that he found
among black Atlantans.
</P>
<P>
   He heard it at Bobby's Barber Shop. He heard it at a candidates'
forum at the Ben Hill Recreation Center. He heard it at a community
festival in Candler Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say, `Take care of the president, take care of my
man,''' said Lewis, a Democrat who is black. ``They don't want to
see him resign. They don't want to see him impeached. They just
want us to leave him alone because there's this deep feeling in the
black community that this president has been there for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After a week devoted to the assessment of public opinion about
the White House scandal, perhaps the most striking findings have
been the circle-the-wagons defense of Clinton by black Americans,
and the undeniable gap between the views of whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted after the release of Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's report show that blacks are far more likely than whites to
approve of Clinton's job performance, to regard him favorably, to
trust him to keep his word, to blame his enemies for his problems
and to oppose his resignation or impeachment. Even within the
president's own party, black Democrats are significantly more
supportive than their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of interviews this week, black Americans ranging from
NAACP chairman Julian Bond to comedian Chris Rock cited everything
from Clinton's choice of friends to his choice of woodwinds in
explaining that he has connected with minorities, both politically
and viscerally, in a manner never achieved by previous presidents.
</P>
<P>
   And while blacks, like most Americans, are deeply disturbed by
Clinton's infidelity and recklessness, they are not willing to
jettison what they see as a unique relationship in exchange for an
uncertain and potentially threatening future.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those interviewed remarked on the ease with which
Clinton moves in black circles, noting that he golfs with Vernon
Jordan, that he and his family seek spiritual counsel from the Rev.
Jesse Jackson and that he sings in black churches without the aid
of a hymnal. Many said that there seems to be a guiltless and
unpatronizing egalitarianism in Clinton's relationships with blacks
that reflects his standing as the first president to come of age
after the demise of legalized segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has been able to project unlike any other president in
recent memory is that he is completely and totally comfortable with
black Americans,'' said George Wolfe, producer of the Joseph Papp
Public Theater-New York Shakespeare Festival. ``It is not something
that had to be negotiated or learned.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph E. Lowery, the recently retired president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said he knew perfectly
well why black Americans were more forgiving of Clinton's
transgressions than white Americans. ``It's the saxophone,'' he
said, with an impish twinkle in his voice. ``The man has soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, most minorities clearly admire the president's
defense of affirmative action, his appointments of black
bureaucrats and judges and his eagerness to confront racism. But
their support for him is not simply a reflection of loyalty and
political self-interest. It is also the product of distinct
cultural traits born of the black experience in the United States,
including a broad distrust of prosecutors, an instinctive empathy
for the persecuted and a spiritual emphasis on forgiveness and
redemption, many African-Americans said.
</P>
<P>
   Rock, the hot young comedian, goes so far as to describe Clinton
as ``the first black president'' because, he said, his every move
is scrutinized. ``He got his hair cut for $200 and people lost
their minds,'' Rock said in his trademark screech. ``It's very
simple. Black people are used to being persecuted. Hence, they
relate to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Poussaint, a black professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School, said that some minorities were so aware of
Clinton's seeming affinity with black people that ``they circulate
rumors that he must have had black ancestry.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a poll last year, the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies found that Clinton was more popular among blacks
than either Jackson or Gen. Colin Powell, the former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, many of those interviewed said they not only
subscribed to Hillary Rodham Clinton's statement that a ``vast
right-wing conspiracy'' had targeted her husband, but also that
they believed the conspirators were motivated by a desire to
reverse the gains made by blacks during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't help but think that some of this is
race-based,'' said Bond. ``In civil rights terms, this guy's a
liberal and there's a part of the body politic that just can't
stand this. They have been determined to bring him down from the
very first.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is true, such attitudes provide yet another prism
through which to view the enduring racial divide in this country,
not unlike the polarized reactions to the not-guilty verdicts in
the 1995 murder trial of O.J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning of Clinton's national political career,
blacks have been among his most ardent supporters. He received an
estimated 83 percent of the black vote in the 1992 presidential
election (compared with 39 percent of white votes) and 84 percent
in 1996 (compared with 43 percent among whites).
</P>
<P>
   As with white Americans, the percentage of blacks who view
Clinton favorably has declined since the Lewinsky scandal emerged,
according to polls. But the affection for the president among
blacks remains remarkably high.
</P>
<P>
   In The New York Times/CBS News poll taken from Sept. 12 to Sept.
14, 86 percent of black respondents said they approved of the way
Clinton was handling his job and 69 percent said they viewed him
favorably, compared to 58 percent and 34 percent, respectively,
among whites. Only 10 percent of blacks said he should resign or be
impeached, compared to 44 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-five percent of blacks said that Clinton's enemies, as
opposed to the president himself, were most responsible for
creating his problems, compared with 32 percent of whites. And
while Starr has charged that Clinton perjured himself repeatedly,
86 percent of blacks said Clinton could still be trusted to keep
his word as president, compared to 44 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black people simply are more willing to judge him by his
stride than his stumble,'' said the Rev. Calvin Butts the pastor of
Abyssinian Baptist Church in New York's Harlem,
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, a significant factor behind the president's support
among blacks has been his record, particularly in the last four
years, when blacks have relied on him to fend off a
Republican-controlled Congress that they view as hostile to their
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks interviewed this week spoke of the economy's boost for
black employment and home ownership. They cited his numerous
appointments of blacks to significant jobs, a record 13 percent of
all political appointments, according to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   They also mentioned Clinton's approach to racial issues,
including his ``mend it, not end it'' prescription for affirmative
action, his creation of an advisory board on race and his trip this
year to Africa, where he expressed regret for America's role in
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   A number of blacks also said they have rallied around Clinton
because they believe that Starr's investigation follows the pattern
established by the FBI's inquiry into the activities of the Rev.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the 1960s, including the surveillance
of his sex life, and by the prosecution of black leaders like
Washington Mayor Marion Barry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of starting with the crime and looking for the man,
Kenneth Starr started with the man and looked for the crime,'' said
Bond. ``And we've just experienced this time and again with black
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said black Americans know persecution when they see it.
``We've drunk from the bitter cup of persecution and repression,
and if ever a president has been persecuted, William Jefferson
Clinton has been persecuted,'' he added. ``Now, I'll agree with you
that he has cooperated with his persecution by providing bullets
for Ken Starr's gun, but he's been persecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   As suggested by Lowery's comments, none of the black Americans
interviewed this week found Clinton faultless. Many were incensed
that the president had so foolishly placed his agenda, and theirs,
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of logic, blacks might be among those with the
most cause for anger about a squandered opportunity,'' said
Christopher Edley, a black professor at Harvard Law School and a
consultant to Clinton on race. ``But I think the faith in
redemption cuts the other way. When you have a whole history of
turning to the church for succor in the face of painful
circumstances, you have to believe that faith will not only heal
your wounds, but also reform the master.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachings of black churches about forgiveness and
redemption, nourished by the scriptural examples of Jesus and
David, came through in interview after interview. Many pointed to
this month's decision by the board of the National Baptist
Convention U.S.A. to forgive its president, the Rev. Henry Lyons,
who admitted having an ``improper relationship'' with a church
worker. They also spoke of the willingness of black voters in
Washington to re-elect Barry after he was convicted on drug
charges, and of black Alabamians to forgive former Gov. George
Wallace after he apologized for his staunch support of segregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans are largely a very religious people, and
forgiveness is part of the culture,'' said Gregory Jackson, a black
Detroit businessman who owns three automobile dealerships. ``It has
been a survival technique. We couldn't survive with all that
pent-up hatred, hostility and fear, so we've had to forgive and
move on.''

TEXANS ON JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON STARR
ALLEGATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The two Texans on the House Judiciary Committee
have vastly different views on the strength of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr's allegation that President Clinton committed
impeachable offenses related to his illicit relationship with
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disagreements, Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, and
Lamar Smith, R-San Antonio, both say they will be guided solely by
the evidence _ and not polls or party _ as they vote on how the
House should proceed with regard to the president's possible
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to vote an unpopular vote,'' Jackson Lee said, ``I
am prepared to do that.'' She added that the Constitution will
serve as her ``guiding force'' as she weighs the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Starr's allegations and Clinton's defenses must be
weighed objectively before a decision regarding impeachment can be
made. The San Antonio Republican said he will follow the law and
his duty as a member of Congress during the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, a staunch supporter of Clinton's policies, said the
American people should remember that Starr is a prosecutor
advocating the president's impeachment with a one-sided argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important to put Starr's case in context,''
Jackson Lee said, referring to the independent counsel's report to
Congress. ``It is a prosecutorial document. The American people and
Texans should perceive it just as that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Jackson Lee added that Clinton's defense has as great a
bias as the prosecutor's case. ``The president's position should be
equally subject to scrutiny,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a Clinton critic, believes the independent counsel
presents a strong case that Clinton lied under oath, obstructed
justice, tampered with witnesses and abused power to prevent public
disclosure of his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has made ``very, very serious allegations that I thought
were supported by credible evidence,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Judiciary Committee, a collection of 21
Republicans and 16 Democrats, have called on members to put party
aside in favor of the good of the nation as they consider whether
to begin formal impeachment proceedings against the president.
</P>
<P>
   However, the ideal of bipartisanship broke down this week as the
committee voted along party lines to release Clinton's videotaped
testimony before a grand jury examining the president's alleged
cover up of his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee opposed making the videotape public, saying ``due
process'' and ``fundamental fairness'' argued against releasing any
grand jury testimony _ even the president's _ because the jury's
proceedings are supposed to be conducted in private.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Smith, advocates a wide release of information to
ensure the American people are fully informed.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee said Clinton, although he is president, remains
entitled to the same constitutional and statutory protections as
anyone else who testifies before grand juries, including the
assurance that the testimony will remain sealed. ``The president is
neither above the law nor is he beneath the law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith countered that other strong interests come into play when
serious allegations are raised about the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people and Congress deserve to get the best and
most accurate information available,'' Smith said. ``We should fall
on the side of providing the most people with the most
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending the release of the tape, Smith said that ``hearing a
person's voice, watching them as they speak give a more accurate
picture than just reading their words on a piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith said information should be released because it is
relevant, not because it is titillating.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their vast differences, Smith and Lee agreed that the
committee should resist any partisan temptation to rush to
judgment. Instead, the panel should strive for consensus, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot proceed willy-nilly,'' Jackson Lee said, adding her
praise for Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde's, R-Ill.,
efforts to keep the panel's proceedings bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have faith and confidence in what I believe will be
reasoned deliberation,'' Jackson Lee said. ``I would not at this
point suggest that we cannot proceed in that (bipartisan) way.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, citing the seriousness of the allegations, said the
American people should not expect quick action from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an instance where we want to proceed cautiously,''
Smith said. ``This is going to take some days or even weeks. We
have a lot of material to assimilate and that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he expects the Judiciary Committee to vote to
recommend that the full House proceed with an impeachment inquiry.
But he declined to predict what would happen after that.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he his heartened by what he called ``emerging''
bipartisanship on the committee. ``I hope it will continue,'' he
added. &QL;

CELLUCCI, HARSHBARGER HIT THE GROUND RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 20, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The final stage of the race for governor in Massachusetts begins
with the two contenders starting just about dead even.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-week sprint that ends Nov. 3 will find the acting
governor, Paul Cellucci, enjoying advantages of incumbency and
campaign cash. Attorney General Scott Harshbarger commands the
loyalty of a re-energized union movement here and an advantage in
Democratic party voter totals that, while hard to tap, is
nevertheless substantial.
</P>
<P>
   If you agree that the real race begins when the primary winners
go before the TV cameras election night, the rivals had smooth
starts Tuesday. Both finished strongly against robust challenges,
and carry momentum into the runoff. Both their acceptance speeches
were well-delivered. Cellucci's was crafted more as an artful
attempt to box Harshbarger as a tax-and-spend Dukakis liberal who'd
tip over the Bay State economy.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, pegged for years as a humorless plodder and policy
wonk who'd indict his grandmother if she failed to dot her legal
''i's'' or cross her ethical ''t's,'' re-introduced himself on
primary night as more lively and passionate than his Democratic
critics ever conceded. Neither candidate has the technical
articulateness of a Dukakis, the stylishly-quirky odd-ballish humor
of a Weld, the jagged intellectual firepower of a Silber, the cool
acerbity of a Kerry, nor the bring-down-the-house brass section of
a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci read his speech better than he reads most of his
speeches, and despite a rather stumbling campaign which has raised
doubts about his staying power, he holds intact his reputation for
being a nice guy, even if his caliber is small-bore. Harshbarger is
riding a 16-year career as a prosecutor. eight as Middlesex DA,
eight as attorney general, and generally knows the law, knows the
facts, and can deliver on demand.
</P>
<P>
   But the AG has never been known for unleashing barnburners on
the stump. So his emergence Tuesday night as a highly-charged
fist-pumping microphone-seizer gave his speech the slight edge, in
my mind, over Cellucci's.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary grappling was a wash. Cellucci laid down the
foundation for his game plan, a replay of the
run-against-Dukakis-and-bad-memories-of-the-past strategy that
carried Weld to victory in the last governor's race over token
opposition. But the let's-run-against-Dukakis-again strategy proved
to be bankrupt in the Weld-Kerry fight that propelled Weld out of
elective office.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger did not get the mileage he'd hoped for in laying
down his primary night challenge to Cellucci to forswear negative
advertising. It is taken as a given in both camps that Cellucci
cannot win without going negative, early and often. But the papers
and TV glossed over Harshbarger's challenge, and Cellucci managed
to finesse it _ for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that becomes a core issue of this fight depends more on
the media than on the candidates _ and the media puts most of its
attention on the sex scandal gripping Washington.
</P>
<P>
   My hunch is that the Clinton turmoil will not tip the governor's
race much one way or another, unless there is a dramatic falloff in
Democratic turnout. Bill Clinton's stature has been diminished
substantially, even here in the state where he was arguably most
popular. But Hillary Clinton remains a very popular figure here,
and I find it hard to believe that her private hurts will prevent
her from delivering a riveting political speech toward the end of
October that will try to revive her demoralized party's turnout
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The reception given the battered President by the Democratic
establishment here Thursday night at the ``unity dinner'' was
different than previous love-ins featuring the same cast. The
applause was prolonged, but not so loud nor as intense as it would
have been in earlier days.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of interesting sub-plots, in addition to the
awkward Clinton scandal. Mayor Menino's oft-noted coolness toward
Harshbarger helps Cellucci. But Harshbarger shrewdly lavished
praise on Menino in his brief remarks, lauding the mayor for
reducing crime, taking on the school dilemma with vigor, boosting
economic development robustly.
</P>
<P>
   But like many establishment Democrats, Menino harbors grudges
against the attorney general. And in Boston, personal scores often
weigh more than party loyalty. Still, with organized labor solidly
behind him, Harshbarger can afford to make nice with the mayor,
despite the chill that is still apparent. Menino will need
organized labor in his corner down the road.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, after Cellucci staged an event at Doyle's with a
handful of defecting Democratic legislators, Harshbarger shrugged
it off. His aggressive stance against casino gambling has hurt him
with some pro-casino legislators, and rumors abound that Cellucci
is promising cabinet-level jobs to some defecting Democrats (Public
Safety is in play, apparently).
</P>
<P>
   Most visible among the Harshbarger-bashers on Beacon Hill is
House Speaker Tom Finneran, who questions whether his party's
standard-bearer will lurch to ``the loony left.'' This is
ludicrous, till you remember two things:
</P>
<P>
   First, Finneran was elected speaker off the votes of Republican
House members, and in the Weld-Cellucci days, enjoyed great
leverage against the liberals. Second, if Harshbarger wins,
Finneran's power shrinks, his clout diminishes, and, more
ominously, there is very likely going to emerge a liberal power
center to counter the speaker's iron grip on the House agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The liberals now in the House are leaderless and generally
feckless. But with a governor to give them cover and encouragement,
Finneran's survival as speaker could be in jeopardy. It's been ten
years since a governor was in position to dictate terms to the
House Speaker, because the last two years of Dukakis ('89-'90) were
a time of national recession and economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But put a strong Democrat in as governor, with powerful labor
backing, and Finneran is no longer the 800-lb. gorilla standing
astride the State House dome. So factor that in.

CLINTON VIDEOTAPE AVAILABLE ON INTERNET, BUT SPECIAL TECHNOLOGY
NEEDED TO VIEW IT

<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton's videotaped testimony in the Monica
Lewinsky sex scandal is made public on Monday, it will be available
for viewing at several sites on the Internet. But seeing it won't
be as easy as reading the text-only independent counsel's report.
</P>
<P>
   The sites will use a technology called ``streaming video'' to
show the 4-hour-plus testimony, and viewing it will require a
relatively fast Internet connection and special software.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users with up-to-date systems and the latest World Wide
Web browsers should have what's needed. Netscape Communications'
Communicator 4 and Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Explorer 4 both come
with the necessary software.
</P>
<P>
   Users of older Web browsers may or may not have the software
already. If not, they will need either RealNetworks' RealPlayer,
available at no charge for both Windows and Macintosh computers at
www.real.com, or Microsoft's free Media Player, available at
www.microsoft.com/windows/mediaplayer/download/default.asp.
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to view the testimony should have at least a
28,800 bits-per-second connection.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming video puts a heavy load on a computer that's
dispensing the feed, so expect an Internet traffic jam at those
sites offering it online.
</P>
<P>
   Among the news-related sites planning to offer the deposition
are CNN (www.cnn.com), MSNBC (www.msnbc.com), Broadcast.com
(www.broadcast.com), National Public Radio (www.npr.org), Fox News
(www.foxnews.com). HoustonChronicle.com will offer excerpts from
the deposition, and provide pointers to Web sites with the complete
video. &QL;

DID TAX LAW CAUSE RECENT STOCK DROP? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the capital gains tax high enough to keep the market from
plunging more than it has because it discourages selling by those
who don't want to pay taxes on their gains of recent years? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Or did the easing of the long-term cap gains qualification
restriction in July prompt the current sell-off that has caused
most stock prices to tank since the major indexes reached record
highs July 17? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first question was posed by a colleague who has decided, for
the time being at least, to endure his portfolio's paper losses
rather than take some profits and thereby incur a hefty tax
liability. The answer is that while tax considerations may have
discouraged some selling in recent weeks, the effect probably
hasn't been widespread enough to have made a significant
difference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, a lot of individual money these days is in
employer-sponsored 401(k) plans that allow investors to shift out
of stock mutual funds and into bond and money market funds without
any immediate tax consequences. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the conventional wisdom in investment circles is that
dread of a tax hit shouldn't affect decisions to get out of an
investment if cashing in looks like the intelligent thing to do.
This is easier said than done, however, and the ebb and flow of
capital gains tax revenues show how investors do react to taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When taxes on capital gains have been raised beyond what
investors consider a tolerable level, they will tend to resist
taxation by holding on. The practical result has been that cap gain
receipts have tended to rise after the rate was lowered and to
contract after cap gain tax increases. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon has led at least one observer to claim that the
tax law changes enacted in July retroactive to Jan. 1 are largely
responsible for the heavy selling of stocks since mid-July. The
primary element of that legislation reduced the holding period to
qualify for the lower long-term capital gains tax rate from 18
months to 12 months. That rate is 20 percent for most taxpayers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Dessauer recently told subscribers to his Investor's World
newsletter that the stock market's abrupt turn wasn't a response to
Asia's continuing turmoil or Russia's emerging problems. Rather, he
said, it was the positive influence of the newly legislated more
taxpayer-friendly cap gains treatment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time our government cuts the capital gains tax rate,''
he said, ``there is a wave of selling. In fact, when investors
sense that a capital gains tax cut is coming, they defer normal
selling until the cut is certain. Then comes a huge selling
wave.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Dessauer's line of logic, this is apparently what
began to happen after the July market peaks were reached. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Dessauer observation worth noting is his expectation of
Federal Reserve interest rate relief. The most interesting aspect
of his forecast is that the easing may come only after the Fed
learns its lesson the hard way by first raising rates. Even so, he
predicts, ``one way or another the Fed will cut interest rates (by)
a full 1 percent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dessauer expects that the ``slightest hint'' of Fed easing and
an end to the Asian crisis will cause markets ``to shoot back to
their former highs.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dessauer's case is convincing enough to lead to the conclusion
that, if anything, this summer's congressional effort to give
investors a tax break was a significant factor in the correction
that has since ensued. &QL;

A SILVER LINING IN ECONOMIC GLOOM: LOW MORTGAGE RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Steve Everly  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market is down, Russia's economy is crumbling and
consumer confidence is shaken. So with all these economic worries,
why are Julie and Scott McDonald so upbeat? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In less than two weeks, they will move into a new house in
Shawnee, Kan. It's the first home they've owned, and part of the
credit goes to the lowest mortgage rates in decades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very lucky,'' Julie McDonald said. ``This is a dream
come true for us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, turmoil in the stock market has a silver lining. Some
worried investors are fleeing stocks for the safety of U.S.
government bonds. The influx, in turn, is driving down the interest
rates on bonds. And because mortgage rates generally follow bonds,
they are going down as well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The result is a financial windfall for cul-de-sac America.
Freddie Mac, a company that buys mortgages from lenders, said
Thursday that rates for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages were at the
lowest level since it began collecting the data in 1971. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other groups that compile mortgage data say the news is even
better. Rates are hovering above 6.5 percent with the payment of
one point _ 1 percent of the loan balance _ they say. That's
considered the lowest since Lyndon Johnson was president in 1960s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only other time in the last three decades when rates came
near that level was in 1993. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great in '93, but this is a different type of great,''
said Chuck Rusnak, a mortgage loan officer for Hillcrest Bank in
Overland Park. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates are fickle. They were up Wednesday and down
Thursday, and they also vary among financial institutions and
brokers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, mortgage rates in the Kansas City area have
been beating the national average, with rates between 6.5 and 7
percent for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and the payment of no
points. Pay one point, and you can get them even cheaper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The recent declines in rates can even justify homeowners who
refinanced mortgages just two years ago to do it again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many homeowners with mortgages that were just recently
considered too low to refinance now have the opportunity to move
into even lower-rate loans,'' said Freddie Mac's chief economist,
Robert Van Order. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A quick lesson in Mortgage 101 shows why. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take a 30-year mortgage with a 8.5 percent rate, which was the
average rate two years ago. If a $100,000 loan was refinanced at 7
percent, the annual savings would be $1,200. Any closing costs
would typically be repaid in one to two years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even a 1 percent gap can produce savings. Consider, for example,
a mortgage in which the lender pays the closing costs in exchange
for a rate that is a half percent higher. Refinancing that 8.5
percent mortgage with a 7.5 percent loan gives you savings of more
than $800 a year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same economics, of course, are working in favor of people
buying homes now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Julie and Scott McDonald are able to buy a nicer home than they
normally could afford. Both are in their mid-20s and _ while the
stock market is important _ they have plenty of time to ride out
the downturn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a mortgage with a lower interest rate helps them to
achieve one of their main goals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have plenty of time for the stock market,'' said Julie
McDonald. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mounting benefits of lower rates are making themselves known
as news of the decline spreads. The Mortgage Bankers Association of
America says that applications rose more than 80 percent last
week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Palmer, who lives in Lenexa, Kan., this week closed on a
mortgage that refinanced an existing 10 percent mortgage with a
$75,000 balance. Because his house had appreciated in value, he was
also able to take out an additional $44,000 to remodel his home's
bathroom, install a new driveway and make other improvements. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although his loan balance increased more than 50 percent, his
monthly payment increased only $134 because of the lower rate. A
bonus was that the mortgage company paid the closing costs in
exchange for a slightly higher rate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he paid off other debts, which leaves him with
monthly expenses that are less than before the refinancing. That
has helped take the sting out of recent losses in his stock
portfolio because of the market downturn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As for my personal finances, I'm in a real good position
now,'' Palmer said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic decline in interest rates _ about a half
percent _ has occurred in the last couple of weeks. The question is
how much more of a decline, if any, is in store. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It depends. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nutter Jr., president of the James B. Nutter &AMP; Co. mortgage
company, said rates could decline further. But he's not making bold
predictions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business, when rates are at this level they generally
don't stay there all that long,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind the recent decline make mortgage rate
predictions even tougher. Instead of worries about the domestic
economy _ the typical reason for changes in interest rates _ the
concern has been about overseas economies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of President Clinton and possible
impeachment proceedings that could add to the jitters in financial
markets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keith Gumbinger, an analyst for HSH Associates in New Jersey,
which analyzes and compiles mortgage rates, said the mortgage
market generally follows the 10-year bond. Any flight to safety by
investors would bring the interest on the 10-year bond down, along
with mortgage rates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Typically, rates for 30-year mortgages are about 1.5 percent
higher than the bond. A 4.8 percent 10-year bond would typically
mean a 6.3 percent 30-year mortgage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But recently the gap has grown to about 1.9 percent, in part
because mortgages at these rates are being snapped up, Gumbinger
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even without further declines, consumers are enjoying rates that
seemed impossible a decade ago, when mortgages were above 10
percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at historic lows,'' Gumbinger said. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt across the upper Middle West on
Saturday as humid air flowing northward from the Gulf of Mexico is
lifted by an approaching cold front. A broken line of strong storms
over North Dakota on Saturday morning will move east and intensify
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   As descending air currents within the thunderstorms intercept a
zone of fast-moving air aloft, powerful downburst winds will occur,
producing damaging gusts in several locations.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cold front, unseasonably cool air will pour into the
northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest. Clouds and scattered
showers will accompany the chill, especially over the Cascades and
Bitterroot Mountains where the air is forced to ascend the higher
terrain. Some snow will occur at elevations above 9,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will plague much of
Florida and the Gulf Coast on Saturday. A weak tropical system over
the western Gulf of Mexico may bring a period of heavier showers to
the Texas and Louisiana coasts.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case for the last several days, some flooding
will occur, particularly in areas where heavy rain has already
fallen. Meanwhile, powerful Hurricane Georges will churn steadily
westward through the central Atlantic on Saturday afternoon,
possibly affecting the Lesser Antilles on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, breezes from the south will transport humid air into
the Great Lakes and northeastern states. Isolated afternoon
thunderstorms will form near the Ohio Valley and central
Appalachians as a weak jet-stream disturbance passes overhead.
Otherwise, partly sunny skies will prevail across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Strengthening Hurricane
</P>
<P>
   Winds in Hurricane Georges reached 100 mph on Friday as the
storm intensified over the eastern Atlantic. The surface pressure
in the eye decreased to 28.88 inches of mercury. The
intensification was a result, in part, of a high-pressure system
40,000 feet above the eye. The lofty high forced upper-level air to
flow away from the storm's center. Thus, like a chimney over a
fireplace, the high ventilated the hurricane, preventing rising,
turbulent air from piling up aloft. Such a pile-up would have
produced a weightiness that would have unfavorably increased
surface pressures in the eye.

   CLINTON-BLACKS (Atlanta) _ In dozens of interviews this week,
black Americans ranging from the NAACP's chairman, Julian Bond, to
the comedian Chris Rock cited everything from Clinton's choice of
friends to his choice of woodwinds in explaining why he has
connected with minorities unlike any previous president, viscerally
as well as politically. And while blacks, like most Americans, are

dishonesty, they are not willing to jettison what they see as a
unique relationship in exchange for an uncertain and potentially

&HT;       ENGLISH: CONGRESS SHOULD ALLOW WISHES TO COME TRUE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- Rep. Phil English, R-Penn., called on
Congress Friday to pass legislation allowing needy children with
life-threatening diseases to accept gifts from wish granting
foundations without risking the loss of supplemental income or
Medicaid benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, some kids with illnesses who accept cash
gifts for spending money or meals from the ``Make-A-Wish''
foundation and other tax-exempt foundations risk losing some of
their Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid benefits because
the gift is counted as income.
</P>
<P>
   English has introduced a measure, which is expected to be
considered next week by the House, that would exempt cash payments
under $2,000 from charitable foundations from being considered
income.
</P>
<P>
   English said his legislation ensures ``no children making a wish
will be punished for it ... sick children should not be punished by
the bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would help 500 to 1,000 children nationally, English
said.

BAY STATE UNEMPLOYMENT AT 3 PERCENT OF WORK FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts' unemployment rate, already at a historic
low, dipped even further in August. But Friday's state jobs report
pointed to a slowdown in employment, caused by turmoil in Asian
economies and on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   US workers to date have been largely insulated from the sharp
downturn over the past year in world economies from Japan and
Russia to, more recently, Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's unemployment rate has held at a low 4.5 percent for
three consecutive months, and the state's jobless rate dipped by
one-tenth of a point in August, to 3 percent, the Massachusetts
Division of Employment and Training reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the change, insignificant by statistical standards, masked a
worrisome turn in the jobs report: The number of Massachusetts
residents holding jobs declined by 1,800, to 3,210,600 in August
from 3,212,400 in July.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the apparent discrepancy is that the unemployment
rate is based on a survey of households, while a separate survey of
businesses is used to determine employment in specific industries.
The two surveys often conflict, especially in the midst of economic
transition. The business survey is viewed by economists as a more
reliable gauge of job activity.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Johnson, &UR;  &LR; chief regional economist for Standard &AMP; Poor's
DRI, said the report supported forecasts of a marked slowdown in
job growth next year by her Lexington research firm. Job growth,
which is likely to be 2.9 percent this year, could slow to 1
percent in 1999, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report suggests, at least in August, job growth stopped,
and we're seeing the influence of Asian and financial market
turmoil,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   While it's too early to say for certain whether August is the
beginning of a downturn or just an aberration, there are other
signs of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts exports by high technology and other important
industries doing business with Asia have declined this summer. At
the same time, a drop in the US and world stock markets is taking a
toll on the financial industry, a cornerstone of Boston business.
Consumer confidence, which propelled growth, has also flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing companies saw the biggest decline in their
payrolls _ 4,100 jobs were lost last month. The financial industry,
which had been red hot and hiring at a rapid pace, stagnated and
produced no new jobs last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the jobs report showed signs that there is still growth. In
August, there were 2,400 more jobs in Massachusetts than there were
in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A strong housing market and the Big Dig construction project
added 200 new construction jobs last month. The services industry,
which includes everything from dry cleaning to business consulting,
added 1,300 jobs. While high-tech manufacturing lost 200 jobs,
other high-tech companies added 800.
</P>
<P>
   A revised report by the US Department of Commerce found that the
average income of Massachusetts residents in 1997, at $31,207, was
the third-highest in the nation, following Connecticut and New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record low unemployment rate,'' acting Governor A. Paul
Cellucci, who is running for re-election, said in a statement,
``will help families across the Commonwealth share in the state's
economic good times.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cellucci's comments referred to data from a separate survey of
Massachusetts households that indicated August saw an ``all-time
high'' of 3,115,800 jobs, according to the Division of Employment
and Training. But that survey, which is the basis of the
unemployment rate, is widely viewed by economists as less reliable
than the survey of businesses, which showed the decline.

IMPEACHED MEMBER OF CONGRESS MOVES TO IMPEACH STARR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of all 435 members of the House of Representatives,
Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., has a unique claim to being an expert
on impeachment: He was impeached when he was a U.S. District Court
judge.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate convicted him and removed him from office in
1989, Hastings went back to Florida and successfully ran for a
House seat. Now, claiming he is ``the most experienced person
here'' on impeachment issues, Hastings took to the House floor
Friday to introduce his own impeachment resolution _ against
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr has violated his oath of office and committed high
crimes and misdemeanors against the Constitution,'' said Hastings,
a staunch defender of President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of the country, and the protection of the
Constitution and the rule of law, Mr. Starr must be called to
account and removed from his position.''
</P>
<P>
   As grounds for impeachment, Hastings cited leaks from Starr's
office, spending $40 million on ``an investigation that he knew
could not justify such extraordinary expenditures,'' and
embarrassing the United States ``before the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is in the air in Congress as the result of Starr's
charges that Clinton should be impeached for lying and obstruction
of justice in the cover-up of his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If the House Judiciary Committee recommends impeachment,
Hastings and the other House members would vote on whether to
impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he has not discussed impeachment with Clinton, nor
did he consult anyone in the White House before filing his
resolution that Starr should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think such a conversation will take place,'' he said.
Had one taken place last month, however, Hastings said he would
have advised Clinton not to appear before the Starr grand jury,
which he did Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are a high-profile person that may be charged with a crime
and you're going into a prosecutor's playhouse,'' Hastings said.
``I would have said that to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1989, then-U.S. District Judge Alcee Hastings of
Miami was removed from the bench by a 69-26 vote in the Senate. He
had been nominated for the judgeship by President Jimmy Carter in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   His Senate conviction came two months after the House voted to
impeach him on charges participating in a 1981 scheme to lighten
the sentences of two racketeers in exchange for $150,000. Hastings
denied wrongdoing and, in fact, was acquitted of bribery charges in
a 1983 criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   When he looks back on his own impeachment, he calls to mind the
late heavyweight champion, Joe Louis. After every fight, regardless
of outcome, he would tell interviewers, ``Tell my ma I'm glad I
won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my emotion,'' he said. ``I'm glad I won. Otherwise I
wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Hastings has cultivated a reputation as a careful,
thoughtful member who performs his duties without a trace of
bitterness toward the institution that expelled him from the bench.
``I'm a non-vengeful person,'' he told an interviewer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings has mended fences with Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a
34-year House veteran and senior Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee who spearheaded the House effort to have Hastings
impeached. After Hastings entered Congress, Conyers nominated him
to be second vice-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he hoped his Starr resolution would lead the House
to ``slow down a moment'' and make the impeachment .. I'm motivated
and driven by the fact that this process must be made to be fairer
than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'm not talking about whether Bill Clinton has done
anything good, bad or indifferent. That will be judged. He will
have his disgrace and humiliation. But I will not sit idly by, and
you better believe I will tilt some windmills.''

ROBERTSON URGES REPUBLICANS TO FORGE AHEAD WITH IMPEACHMENT
PROCEEDINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans should shed their
timidity and forge ahead with impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson told
his followers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching the office ennobled by Washington, Jefferson
and Lincoln become the playpen for the sexual freedom of the poster
child of the 1960s,'' Robertson told the gathering of the nation's
largest and arguably most influential group of conservative
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition, which has long been highly critical of
Clinton and the Democrats, has clearly been energized by the
president's problems, believing the scandal will push moral issues
to the forefront in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, mindful of polls showing fundamentalist Christians
more likely to vote, are paying attention to this constituency. A
number of top congressional leaders, including House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and House Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
addressed the Coalition but largely sidestepped the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson played directly to the group's visceral dislike of
the president, saying Clinton had ``mocked, demeaned, belittled,
and lied'' to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is not Little
Rock on the Potomac. This is the people's house. As landlord of our
house it is time to say his lease is expired,'' said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson said resignation was not a sufficient way to get
Clinton out of the White House. He said justice could only be
served if Congress went ahead with impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``While resignation might be easier for America, it's not better
for America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also chided some top congressional Republicans for not
being aggressive enough in moving against the president, accusing
them of ``sitting in the foxhole of political safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Robertson's scathing criticism was not enough for some
of those in attendance. He elicited scattered boos when he said
``we must be the first to forgive Bill Clinton the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Robertson compared Clinton unfavorably to predecessors
in the White House he did not mention that some of them had their
own scandals. Jefferson, whom Robertson said had ennobled the
presidency, was attacked during his tenure in office for having an
affair with his black slave.
</P>
<P>
   GOP congressional leaders maintained their policy of not
commenting directly about the president in regard to his affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lott urged members to defeat Democratic senators who had refused
to vote to override President Clinton's veto on a bill banning
late- term abortion. On Friday the Senate fell three votes short of
overriding that veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year that we can nail down a solid, pro-family,
pro-life majority in the United States Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich briefly referred to the scandal saying, ``We in the
House will do our duty. We won't do an inch more than our duty for
partisanship, and we won't do an an inch less than our duty out of
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican also defended House Judiciary Chairman
Henry Hyde, R-Ill, who this week acknowledged having an adulterous
affair 30 years ago after a liberal Internet magazine, Salon,
reported about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Henry's case, it's human and it's personal and he is a
decent, wonderful man and many of you have known him over the
years,'' said Gingrich, who urged the crowd to ``drop him a little
note and let him know that you share his pain and that you're sorry
that doing his duty leads to that kind of treatment by the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and other Republicans have accused the White House of
leaking information about Hyde's affair to news organization and
have asked the FBI to investigate. However, Salon editors have
denied that the White House supplied them with the information, and
Republicans have so far failed to come up with evidence linking the
Clinton administration to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who attended the meeting, seemed more willing to
forgive Hyde's affair than the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong is wrong. It doesn't matter who did it. But I don't
think what he (Hyde) did cost us millions of dollars,'' said Pam
Elimore of Kingston, N.C., referring to the cost of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is involved in a court battle with the
Federal Elections Commission who charges that the group violated
its tax exempt status by aiding the 1992 Bush presidential effort
and other campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition has denied it broke any laws. Coalition president
Randy Tate said that the group will be engaged in the upcoming
election by distributing 45 million voters' guides on Nov. 1, just
a few days before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Tate warned that any candidate who is on the wrong side of the
morals issue ``will have a big problem on election day.'' &QL;

   THE CLINTON CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ The White House criticizes the decision
to release more Starr materials as partisan and unfair. President
Clinton appears this afternoon at a meeting of his race advisory
board. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   Cox photos are available to illustrate this story.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-TAPES _ WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee is
trying again to approve release of more information on President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky following furious
arguments over whether to make available phone sex conversations
and other graphic material. As the committee resumed its closed
deliberations, Republican congressional leaders appeared before a
meeting of the Christian Coalition and told the conservative group
they would press ahead with their investigation of the president.
(Carr/Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-BIPARTISAN _ WASHINGTON _ Sharp partisan exchanges
between members of the House Judiciary Committee on Friday showed
that Congress is far from the kind of bipartisan consensus that
must precede the forced removal of a president. (Mollison, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JURY _ WASHINGTON _ Why is grand jury testimony,
normally secret, being released in the Clinton case? Should
ordinary citizens subpoenaed before a grand jury have reason to
fear their testimony will become public? (Harlan, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REDACTIONS _ WASHINGTON _ The Judiciary Committee voted
to leave scores of items out of the released material, mostly for
privacy reasons, and those redactions won broad support. About 20
items, though, were disputed, as Republicans insisted on keeping in
graphic sexual material. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HASTINGS _ WASHINGTON _ Impeachment. For Alcee Hastings,
it's been there, done that. Now the ousted federal judge talks
about Clinton's case from the vantage point of House member from
Florida. (Lipman, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   HASTINGS-STARR _ WASHINGTON _ Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla.,
called Friday for impeachment proceedings against Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr. (Lipman, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN _ WASHINGTON _ The heads of the Senate
Democratic and Republican campaign commitees Friday joined their
House counterparts in vowing to cut off financial support to any
candidate who launches a personal attack on an opponent. The
bipartisanship and abhorrence of sexual topics comes as a sharp
contrast to the process enveloping President Clinton. (Shepard, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-TOUR _ WASHINGTON _ What people touring the White House
Friday are saying about President Clinton's problems. (Monroe, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JOKES _ Hey, heard the one about the president and the
intern? Don't worry, you will. With the fate of the union at stake,
President Clinton's troubles are no laughing matter, except for
those in the business of mocking the high and mighty when they're
down and out.The White House scandal has provided a seemingly
boundless amount of material for TV comedians, joke writers and
political satirists lured to the story by the irresistible mix of
politics, sex, and a news media gone mad. New figures from Media
Center for Public Affairs show jokes about Clinton on late-night TV
have skyrocketed. (Harris, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-JOKESSIDE _ A sampling of printable jokes from
late-night TV comics, including Jay Leno, David Letterman, Bill
Maher, Chris Rock. 6. with photos. (Harris, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   RACE _ WASHINGTON _ Despite his shortcomings, President Clinton
still has the moral authority to help Americans confront the
country's history of white privilege, said John Hope Franklin,
chairman of the president's advisory board on race. His praise of
Clinton was generally reflected in black leaders' warm assessment
of the work of the president's race advisory board. Franklin's
comments came in an interview at the White House following the
president's acceptance of the board's report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION _ WASHINGTON _ The Senate fell three votes short today
of overriding President Clinton's veto of a ban on certain
late-term abortions. The 64-36 vote followed emotional arguments
over why Congress should take the rare step of enacting legislation
over a president's objections. Four Republicans joined 32 Democrats
to sustain the veto, while 13 Democrats and 51 Republicans voted
for the override. The vote means Clinton's veto will stand _ at
least until a new Congress convenes in January. Sen. Max Cleland
(D-Ga.), who was under intense pressure to vote for the override,
voted no. Coverdell (R-Ga.) voted yes. (Foskett, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   TECH-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ The high-tech industry has a
legislative wish list for the waning weeks of the 105th Congress.
What are its prospects in a distracted capital? (Regan, Cox News

   AIDS _ The latest AIDS drug to be approved sets new standards of
effectiveness and convenience in HIV/AIDS treatment. On Friday, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Sustiva, the first
once-a-day HIV medication. Sustiva was created by DuPont
Pharmaceuticals, based in Wilmington, Del. In combination with
other anti-HIV drugs, Sustiva, or efavirenz, excels at reducing the

</P>
<P>
   GEORGES _ Who ever heard of a hurricane named Georges? If you're
up to the G's why not George or Gus or Gary. According to the
National Weather Service, the name of the latest tropical menace is
George, only it's the French spelling and pronunciation. After all,
hurricanes aren't just for Americans. (Clemmons, Atlanta

   YAGER _ Bipin Shah amends his federal lawsuit against Fay Yeager
to include her husband Howard, charging that the couple's efforts
at hiding abused children and their mothers is a for-profit racket.
There is nothing startlingly new in Shah suit. Lawsuit makes RICO

soon return to active duty in Jamaica when the country hangs
Neville Lewis for murdering a motorist who asked for directions
later this month. St. Kitts and Nevis had its first hanging in 13
years last month. Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago have hangings
planned later this year. Governments in many countries unofficially
stopped hangings and floggings in the 1980s in response to protests
from international human rights groups. But rising crime has
brought about calls to resume hangings and floggings, a vestige of
British colonial rule in the region. A number of governments in the
Caribbean have even undertaken controversial steps to change their
justice systems and constitutions and sever ties with international
appeals bodies to make it easier to carry out executions.
Proponents of capital punishment contend that those condemned to
death have been using appeals to stall their fates for years at a
time. Countries like Barbados want to cut tie with the British
Privy Council, a supreme court for former British colonies, and
establish a Caribbean Court of Justice by next year. (Emling, Cox

ALL DEDICATED HACKERS, ARISE!

(EDS: Parenthetical material is by Dr. Bombay) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I appreciate the fact that you replied to
``oo'' like that. (Remember him, boys and girls? He was the barely
sentient slug who fancied himself a hacker. I'm still quaking in my
boots worrying about exactly when he'll make my speakers make rude
`ffwwaaaapppp!!' noises.) All over the place now, wannabe hackers
are replying in your aforementioned ``remedial English'' and
expecting some attention from it. (Actually, I think most of them
were too caught up fantasizing about Gillian Anderson to notice.)
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, there are sincere hackers out there. That group is
the youth and young adults of today. (I just wish you darned kids
would turn down that new-fangled record player.) I myself am a
sincere _ not wannabe _ hacker. Everything I know about hacking
I've taught myself. I didn't go to some Web site and have it all
spelled out for me. I didn't get a book with a packaged CD that has
all the hacking programs on it already. No. I, if you will, am a
geek. If I need to do something, I program it myself from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the exception: I, like my fellow hackers, have strict
codes, guidelines and rules just like the average person. It's what
we like to call the ``duh factor.'' We, as sincere hackers, are not
destructive without cause. (And who gets to pick the cause this
week? You? Zero Cool? Acid Burn? Lord Nikon?) Our sole purpose in
learning what we do, in perfecting the skills that we do, is a mere
defense. You and I both know that as time passes, our world becomes
more of a cyber-war than a gun war. I, along with my peers, am your
only defense in the act of an all-out attack on the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So to close, those of you out there who are the sincere hackers,
the ones that follow these codes and guidelines, thank you for your
dedication. However, the rest of you, and you know who you are,
please, PLEASE, go buy a book on machine code and talk to me again
when you do some sincere, nondestructive, true hacking. I pity the
disgrace you will feel when the whole world comes crashing in on
top of you. Go hackers!
</P>
<P>
   _ The Wizard
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WIZ: Don't waste your brain. The CIA already has that
cyber-war stuff taken care of. Go give Bill Gates a run for his
money instead. That's the ``real'' war. And lighten up while you're
at it. You're too young to be so cynical about the world. That's my
job.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: Proving that they can indeed maintain the
international lead in the increasingly vital field of time
waste-ology, Microsoft Excel 97 programmers labored tirelessly to
produce the following Easter egg, pausing only briefly to
capriciously change the Excel format, angering and disenfranchising
spreadsheet users the world over.
</P>
<P>
   Launch Excel 97 and press F5. Type in X97:L97 to jump to that
cell. Press Tab and let it go. Now, hold down Control and Shift
while left-clicking the Chart Wizard button on the toolbar (It's
the bar-chart-looking thingie to the left of the little globe).
</P>
<P>
   Surprise! A little flight simulator. Navigate with the mouse and
find the mountain on the edge of town with the scrolling list of
developers who have so much free time on their hands they won't see
the next generation of hackers coming.

IN CLINTON DEFENSE, A LEGAL MINDSET GETS PART OF THE BLAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(Also moved in ``e'' category.) 
(lb) 
David Margolick is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. 
 By DAVID MARGOLICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a cascade of contrition, President Clinton is almost greedily
accepting responsibility for his present predicament. But the
finger-pointing in the Monica Lewinsky matter also goes in another
direction: toward Clinton's lawyers, who are being blamed for
failing to anticipate his problems, and then for making them worse.
</P>
<P>
   Privilege shrouds all discussions between the president and his
lawyers, making second-guessing hazardous. But authorities on legal
ethics and culture _ that is, lawyers who monitor other lawyers _
say the president has clearly received bad legal advice, reflecting
weaknesses found today among even sophisticated practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   These weaknesses, experts say, are both as timeless as the
inherent tensions between lawyers and powerful clients and as new
as the deterioration in how lawyers are trained.
</P>
<P>
   There is little reason to think Clinton was initially any more
candid with his lawyers, notably Robert Bennett and David Kendall,
than he was with his closest associates, his Cabinet or his family.
And by training and temperament, lawyers don't always press their
clients for the truth or try to learn the truth themselves,
especially when the client is the president.
</P>
<P>
   That has always been the case. But to some experts the
president's highly legalistic defense, using a tortured definition
of sex that has earned him great ridicule, stems from something
new: the training that elite lawyers are now likely to get, which
can blind them to what matters most.
</P>
<P>
   While the best and brightest have always marched off to Wall
Street-style law firms, the firms themselves have changed, largely
as result of a vastly more competitive marketplace. Increasingly
profit-oriented, less likely to have long-term relations with
clients, less concerned with inculcating values into young
associates, these firms are producing lawyers who are more
parochial, with dulled ethical and political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyering business really has kind of shrunk from a
profession of general counselors and advisers to the notion of a
very narrow technical specialty in which what the lawyer does is
simply advise on the available legal strategy,'' said Robert
Gordon, a legal historian at Yale Law School. As a result, Gordon
said, lawyers are more likely to focus on minutiae than on the
larger issues usually involved in highly charged political cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get very little sense from Bennett or Kendall that what is
at issue is a president, his capacity to govern, his place in
history,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   To William Simon of Stanford Law School, the very lack of
perspective for which Clinton's lawyers have been faulted applies
even more strongly to the unrelenting independent counsel, Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put lawyers in charge of a moral crusade, you risk
that they'll handle it without any sense of proportionality,
largely because it's not part of their makeup,'' he said. ``We try
to teach lawyers to make value judgments, to weigh principles, but
the professional culture of technicality and literalism is even
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally speaking, it was Paula Jones who begat Monica Lewinsky;
perhaps the most fateful decision by Clinton and his lawyers was
not to settle Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment suit. Strictly as a
legal proposition, the case was extremely weak, and sure enough,
Bennett's elaborate, powerful arguments persuaded a federal judge
(and a Republican) to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   But in the unique context of presidential politics, what
mattered most was not the fate of Mrs. Jones' case but what her
lawyers learned along the way. Bennett's approach, like that of
many lawyers, reflected great faith in precedent, logic and the
primacy of winning in court _ safe assumptions in many cases but
not in so politically charged a suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal education and legal culture make victory in court the
only victory,'' said Stephen Gillers of New York University Law
School. ``But the Jones-Clinton case was only partly about what
will happen in court, and mostly about the survival and reputation
of the president. So it became dangerous to let lawyers control the
progress of the case. People unencumbered by legal training and
experience might have chosen differently.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Arthur Liman, in his memoir, ``Lawyer: A Life of Counsel and
Controversy'' (Public Affairs, 1998), makes a similar criticism of
Starr, comparing him to other prosecutors who have wrongly ``tried
to make criminal cases out of political offenses.'' Liman himself,
however, was faulted as being overly legalistic in the Iran-contra
hearings, letting Oliver North outmaneuver him in the court of
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Also endemic, arguably, was the way in which both Bennett and
Kendall apparently reacted to Clinton's lies about his relationship
to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That clients lie to their lawyers is nothing new. ``The first
reaction of every white-collar client is not to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,'' said Kenneth Mann, a law
professor at Tel Aviv University and author of a study on American
lawyers who represent white-collar criminal defendants.
</P>
<P>
   And lawyers are not ethically bound to ferret those lies out.
``I never ask a client whether he did it or not,'' Alan Dershowitz
of Harvard Law School once said. ``I don't want the client to feel
that he has to start his relationship with me by lying.''
</P>
<P>
   While the American Bar Association has condemned the practice of
avoiding knowledge, no lawyer has ever been sanctioned for doing
so. So lawyers can look the other way. But what is ethically
tolerable is not always tactically wise. ``About half of the
practice of a decent lawyer is telling would-be clients they are
damned fools and should stop,'' Elihu Root, a prominent New York
lawyer who went on to become secretary of state, once said.
</P>
<P>
   Tipped off by the Linda Tripp tapes, by questions from the Jones
lawyers and by Clinton's own evasiveness, Bennett and Kendall could
well have surmised that his denials were implausible. Had they any
doubts, a review of the very records Starr was poring over _ phone
logs, White House records, Secret Service documents _ could have
confirmed their suspicions. The lawyers then could have questioned
Clinton aggressively and perhaps persuaded him to change his
answers before perjury charges could attach.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took months to recant, suggesting that nothing of the
sort ever occurred. More likely, the lawyers questioned him, heard
him reiterate his denials, and then moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers too often submit to demanding and powerful clients,''
said Gillers, who examines Clinton's counsel in the coming issue of
American Lawyer magazine. ``To call the president a fool or to tell
him he's acting like an ass is no easy thing. But it's precisely
when you represent a president that you have to be tough and blunt
and shake him up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that Clinton's lawyers _ or today's crop of
lawyers _ are deficient. Monroe Freedman of Hofstra Law School, a
pioneer in the field of legal ethics, said Clinton's high-caliber
counsel surely pushed him as far as they could. Nor, he said, were
contemporary lawyers necessarily any less public-spirited and
worldly, or yesterday's lawyers any more enlightened, as Gordon
contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can he think that the lawyers who represented the robber
barons were not pulling hypertechnical stuff?'' Freedman asked.

<P>
   If investors think it may be time to test the stock market
again, they may be overlooking one issue: seasonality. September,
it seems, in the last half-century or so, has been the single worst
month for the stock market. According to The Wall Street Companion,
a New York-based market newsletter, the Dow Jones industrial
average has fallen in 30 of the 47 Septembers since 1950, by an
average of roughly 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, according to Matt Stichnoth, the newsletter's editor,
market performance was especially poor in those Septembers that
followed nasty Augusts. In seven years since 1950, the market fell
in August by 4 percent or more. In five of those cases the market
fell again in September, with the average drop 5.9 percent. (Last
month the market fell 14.5 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Stichnoth cited psychological reasons for the month's poor
performance. September, being the last month of the third quarter,
is ``that awful time of year when expectations for corporate
earnings have to be marked to reality once and for all,'' he said.
It is often the month in which analysts throw in the towel after
hoping for a second-half rally.
</P>
<P>
   Ground Floor, a newsletter based in Old Tappan, N.J., reports
another factoid. This September falls during a midterm election
year; in each of the past nine midterm Septembers, the market has
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Week's Stock and Bond Issues Fall to a Low for the Year
</P>
<P>
   It's tough trying to unload securities in these whipsawed times.
Even so, last week was especially dismal for new issues. Securities
Data Co., a Newark research firm, reported that debt and equity
issuance for the week fell to a spectacular low for the year, with
just over $14 billion of new securities sold, based on preliminary
totals. That is in contrast to $16 billion the previous week, and a
high of $56.5 billion during the week beginning March 15.
</P>
<P>
   For Yahoo, the Growth Mantra Goes On and On and On
</P>
<P>
   Investors searching for signs of life in the stock market, and
in the technology sector in particular, need look no further than
their Internet search engine. While thousands of stocks are trading
at 25 percent or more below their recent highs, shares of Yahoo,
which closed at $90.4375 on Friday, are up 430 percent from this
year's low and off just 12.8 percent from their high on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   There is more good news. On Thursday, at a conference sponsored
by Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, Yahoo's
management told portfolio managers that the company's operating
profit margin was likely to increase by more than one-third by this
time next year. That means that the 16 percent to 26 percent
operating margins that Yahoo said it expected when it went public
in mid-1996 should increase to a range of 30 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Yahoo delivered the same message to a conference
sponsored by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New York. That day,
Yahoo shares jumped nine points.

   Funds Watch: A Study Finds Problems In Converting Closed-End
Funds
</P>
<P>
   Investors who hope to make a tidy bundle if their closed-end
fund converts to open-end status may be in for a rude awakening,
according to a new study by CDA/Weisenberger, a fund tracking
service in Rockville, Md. The study, which looked at 10 closed-end
funds that became open in 1997 and 1998, concludes that long-term
investors in converted funds suffered, and for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, such funds were forced to sell to meet redemptions, the
study reported, thus realizing capital gains that resulted in
bigger tax liabilities for investors. Fund assets fell by an
average of 28.2 percent within six months of the conversion, the
study said. Because of the shrinking asset base, the average
expense ratio rose to 1.89 percent for the open-end funds from 1.33
percent for the closed-end versions.
</P>
<P>
   Because managers of open-end funds need more cash on hand to
meet redemptions, the amount held in converting funds' portfolios
rose sharply. On average, cash positions rose to 7.8 percent of
assets after the conversions, from 2.4 percent. And managers may be
pressured into adopting a more risk-adverse investing style to
avoid redemptions.  &QL;

<P>
   As gyrations in emerging markets _ from Asia to Latin America to
Russia _ cause sleepless nights for many investors, one group of
politically connected and well-heeled financiers with big bets in
these shaky regions can sleep better, thanks to the American
taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   These well-rested folks are among the investors who have poured
$3.2 billion into emerging-market funds sponsored by the Overseas
Private Investment Corp., a little-known government agency that
mixes private capital with government guarantees to promote U.S.
foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   OPIC's investment flag is now planted in 140 developing
countries _ from obscure spots like Moldova and Botswana to nations
at the center of today's global turmoil. No matter where it goes,
though, OPIC has used the promise of eye-popping returns and the
protection of government guarantees to attract American investors
to far-flung spots.
</P>
<P>
   As capitalism has spread, so has the program. With direct
foreign-aid dollars dropping in the last few years, OPIC's
investment funds have become a leading tool in the Clinton
administration's efforts to get fresh capital _ quickly _ to
emerging democracies. When President Clinton took office, there
were just two OPIC funds, one in Africa and one in Asia, with
combined capital of $100 million. Today, an assembly line of OPIC
funds is churning in Washington: At last count, the number has
risen to 26, with roughly two-thirds of the money coming from
government-guaranteed notes and the rest from institutional equity
investors. By year's end, the OPIC program should swell to $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The funds buy stakes in emerging-market businesses. They are
structured so that private investors _ typically large corporations
and pension funds _ can invest with limited exposure to downside
risk and, if their investments work out as expected, reap enormous
gains. On the other hand, should every investment in all 26 OPIC
funds fail, taxpayers would be on the hook for $3.3 billion in
interest and principal on the notes.
</P>
<P>
   OPIC has spread its largess to many people with government ties;
the ranks of the funds' managers include leading campaign
contributors and former government officials.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing chorus of critics say OPIC funds often replicate
what many in the private sector are already doing _ without
government protection _ and encourage excessive risks at taxpayer
peril.
</P>
<P>
   And to the frustration of many, OPIC runs its fund program
almost exclusively behind closed doors, seeing no need to make
financial details about the funds public, even though it is a
government agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPIC is gambling in Las Vegas with someone else's money,''
said James Sheehan, a researcher at the Competitive Enterprise
Institute, an economic research group in Washington. ``This is a
subsidy for risk-taking. If these investment funds were based on
the financial merits of the investments, you would not need
subsidies to make them happen.''
</P>
<P>
   OPIC's point of view is that it is guilty as charged and proud
of it. The whole point of the program _ which is modeled, very
roughly, after successful domestic venture funds like Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts _ is to encourage investors to go where they
otherwise fear to tread and to stimulate economic development on
unfamiliar turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPIC is trying to induce investors to do things they are not
willing to do on their own,'' said Robert D. Stillman, a private
investor who, until last April, headed the OPIC investment fund
program. ``If investors are not willing to put money into Eastern
Europe, we will make it attractive. We're encouraging capitalism
where the U.S. has a foreign-policy interest and getting investors
comfortable with these places.''
</P>
<P>
   OPIC funds are closed-end limited partnerships intended to build
on private-sector market discipline _ and capital. Each fund has
slightly different objectives and different investors. Each is
required to invest in companies overseas that either do not compete
directly with American businesses or that help American companies.
As in other venture capital funds, the money is invested for 5 to
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, all eyes are on Russia. OPIC funds have committed a
total of $1.5 billion to the former Soviet republics, nearly half
the program's investment kitty. Eleven OPIC funds are now in this
region, to the dismay of some. ``It is the wrong policy to be
channeling funds into those countries where their economic policies
are not correct,'' said Ian Vasquez, a director of economic policy
at the Cato Institute, a research group in Washington. ``We are
rewarding governments for not undertaking reforms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Peyton, manager of Agribusiness Partners
International, a $100 million OPIC fund with seven Russian
investments, said the OPIC guarantee is important to him _ now more
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got back from Russia, and we are in fundamentally sound
businesses,'' said Peyton, whose fund has invested in a soft-drink
bottler in Moscow, a sparkling-wine plant in Georgia, dairies in
Moldova and Ukraine, and Russian cheese and poultry plants. ``If
the politicians can hold the country, we'll be OK. Our investors
are glad OPIC is there. If the Russian economy survives, these
investments will turn out to be good. Today the OPIC guarantee is
more important than three months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Toy, vice president of OPIC's investment fund program,
said it was too early to assess any damage. Because OPIC funds have
long-term investing goals, the final reckoning is as much as a
decade away. Currently, Toy said, taxpayer exposure from OPIC's
Russian debt is about $400 million, because not all the money
raised for these funds has been invested yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a delicate situation,'' Toy said. ``The impact of the
market turbulence is that we will be more selective. Clearly, this
shows why OPIC is needed. If you want to continue to encourage
foreign direct investment as the vehicle for economic reform in any
particular country and there is perceived political risk, we have
to support and enhance returns to encourage private sector equity
to be put at play.''

<P>
   Remember the Saturday night Bill Clinton spent with actress
Sharon Stone and her friends in May 1993? Neither did I _ until I
looked back at a column I wrote about it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   I am reprinting it here, only slightly abridged, in the
conviction that it is a useful goad to meditation on the way in
which we got from there to here.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion of the column was the completion of Clinton's first
100 days in office.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It seems more clear with every passing day that there was no
mandate to the election, and that Clinton's go-for-broke strategy
has been a mistake. Ordinarily the president is a nimble and
inventive fellow, able to learn from his mistakes. But in the
matter here (his ambitious health care reform), he seems unlikely
to reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems to me, has to do with a deep-seated
tendency in Bill Clinton to overreach. Call it the Icarus Factor,
after the youth in Greek mythology who flew with wings of wax too
near the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Icarus Factor has to do with the most intimate questions of
Clinton's personal identity, who he is and why he does what he
does. Consider a series of events that are seemingly far removed
from the turmoil over health care, trade, and the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there is no more interesting marriage in America than
that of the Clintons. Their hectic life sometimes leads to striking
oppositions. As Hillary Rodham Clinton kept a vigil in Little Rock
over her dying father early last month, Bill Clinton traveled to
Vancouver to see Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   After an occasionally slapstick dinner at a fancy restaurant..._
Yeltsin became briefly furious because he thought Clinton was
delegating tasks to the Russian vice president, a bitter Yeltsin
rival, when in fact it was Al Gore that Clinton had in mind _ the
president ended his evening by having over to his hotel suite movie
actress Sharon Stone and a handful of other Hollywood nabobs for
coffee and dessert. (We know this thanks to an dispatch by The New
York Times' Maureen Dowd, a virtual exclusive, from which almost
all the following details are drawn.)
</P>
<P>
   Now Stone, a Grace Kelly look-alike, is the star of last year's
dirtiest hit movie, an ice pick murder-thriller called ``Basic
Instinct.'' She was fresh from the covers of both People magazine
and Vanity Fair. Her fiancee came along as well, as did their
friends, the actor Richard Gere and his wife, model Cindy Crawford.
Actor Richard Dreyfuss and producer Bud Yorkin were there as well;
all were in town making movies, or thinking about making movies.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his staff clearly enjoyed the badinage during
their couple of hours with the celebrities after days of talking
policy with the Russians. Asked to describe the atmosphere of the
meeting, White House communications director George Stephanopoulos
called it ``hot.'' ``It was hot in the room and we were all
sweating,'' said Stephanopoulos, a debonair bachelor. What was
Sharon Stone wearing? ``A blouse and slacks or something _ I'm not
sure,'' he said. ``I was too busy watching Cindy.''
</P>
<P>
   All this occurred Saturday night. Sunday, at midafternoon, Mrs.
Clinton ended the 16-day vigil that had begun when her 82-year-old
father suffered a stroke, and returned to Washington. The story
about Vancouver appeared in the Monday morning paper. Tuesday,
Clinton appeared with a long scratch upon his jaw and another below
his ear. Wednesday, reporters were asking questions about the
scratches. First Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary, said they were
shaving cuts. Later Clinton emerged to say he got them wrestling
with his daughter, Chelsea, ``rolling around like a child again.''
The same day Hugh Rodham died. And a couple of days later Clinton
delivered a moving, tough-minded eulogy of his late father-in-law
at funeral services in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Any busy person familiar with the lingering death of a parent
knows how interior and personal is the event, how many difficult
decisions must be made about when to stay and when to leave.
Perhaps not a single word passed between the Clintons about the
Vancouver nightcap upon their reunion at the White House. Perhaps
she hit him with a rolling pin. Who knows? Certainly the people who
know the Clintons best aren't talking. We know from leaks that the
staff is split about the presidential penchant for Hollywood's
stars. We know that it looks insensitive. We don't know much about
how the Clintons handle their private disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   These are questions you can't pursue very far in Washington,
because of the tight secrecy that surrounds the White House, and
the severe sanctions that attend attempts to violate it. The
Clintons have been reported to have threatened to fire the entire
Secret Service as their protectors over leaks by agents about their
private life _ including, in one Newsweek report, Mrs. Clinton
throwing objects at Mr. Clinton. It is thanks only to the supremely
brassy Maureen Dowd that we know about the Vancouver drop-by; a
number of reporters tried to pursue the etiology of the scratches
and got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps attempts to penetrate the privacy of the relationship
between Bill and Hillary Clinton are not very important after all.
Certainly in some circumstances they can be very damaging. You have
only to think of how tough the invasion of their privacy has been
on the British Royals, in the wake of their various indiscretions.
You must admire the extreme discipline the US press is displaying
in the face of a firestorm of rumor about the Clintons' private
lives in le tout Washington _ and it is a firestorm. The press will
apparently not go forward without new building blocks of
information, and with a little luck, these won't emerge. We already
know enough about the Clintons' marriage bond; it is strong,
durable, and complex.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these conjectures about risk taking have an obvious
relevance in a week when the administration has come to be seen as
being deeply divided about both its political tactics and goals.
Budget director Leon Panetta and House Speaker Thomas Foley sent
separate wake-up calls to the White House via public warnings.
Leaked stories appeared exploring significant rifts among
presidential advisers on trade and health care. Often these
divisions are reported to trace back to differences of opinion
between Hillary and Bill _ or at least Bill as others see him.''
... He is continually at war with himself, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Just maybe, however, the war includes his wife, and goes a good
deal deeper than the usual differences of opinion between Old
Democrats and New Democrats. A powerful ambivalence about just what
is possible in life at the core of their marriage would explain a
lot. Goodness knows that this is the most interesting and likeable
presidential marriage since Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt; but it
seems to work in a different way. The Clintons seemed to have
evolved a tolerance for each other's risk-taking. Taking
responsibility for restructuring one-sixth of gross domestic
product in a three-month blitz isn't a whole lot different from
having Sharon Stone to your hotel while your father-in-law is lying
on the edge of death (or some of the other drop-by-the-house
friendships with stars that Clinton maintains, for that matter). It
is the sort of thing that can seem well within your right one
moment and unnecessarily audacious the next. It's a fundamentally
incautious thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   In this analysis, then, the reason Clinton didn't low-ball his
administration's strategy from the beginning _ by seeking to co-opt
the Republican leadership by acknowledging some successes during
the last 12 years _ is simply that he likes a little danger. He
courts it. He tries the hardest thing. He flies too near the sun.
</P>
<P>
   In somewhat similar circumstances, Ulysses stuck wax in the ears
of his crew so they couldn't hear the sirens' call from Scylla and
Charybdis as they rowed between the islands. He left his own
earplugs out to hear the inexpressibly sweet song; by way of
self-control, he lashed himself to the mast. But then, that's
another myth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What has changed in the last five years? In the workaday world,
not much. The Dow Jones industrial average was 3450 then; today it
is around 7900. A very great deal is different in the political
world, and therefore in the financial realm as well _ the global
economy is tottering on the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And of course we know the Clintons far better than we did then.
</P>
<P>
   Two things in particular have changed: the advent of a special
prosecutor, and the willingness of the press to treat the
president's womanizing as a legitimate issue.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, I cannot help thinking that the press missed the
boat on both stories. If the best newspapers and magazines had been
a little more open and imaginative in writing about Bill Clinton's
womanizing _ a little less willing to take the family's denials at
face value, we might not have the mess we have today.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The White House staff might have been enabled to more fully
exercise vigilance against the president's self-destructive
tendencies in the face of a steady stream of temptation. Mrs.
Clinton might have been forced to change the rules of their game.
The president himself might have decided to stop horsing around.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if the press had born down a little more heavily on
the machinations in August 1994 of the three-judge panel known as
the Division for the Purpose of Appointing Independent Counsels,
history might have taken a different course.
</P>
<P>
   That was the summer when, just three months before the midterm
elections, presiding judge David Sentelle persuaded his fellow
justices to fire moderate Republican Robert Fiske (after only six
months on the job) and to hire Sentelle's friend and protege
Kenneth Starr to pursue the president more energetically.
</P>
<P>
   Sentelle, a North Carolinian who had been appointed to the
federal appeals court in Washington in 1987 by Ronald Reagan, had
been observed dining shortly before with Senators Jesse Helms and
Lauch Faircloth _ the two conservatives from North Carolina who had
been instrumental in securing his appointment to the bench. Both
were outspoken critics of Clinton _ and of independent counsel
Fiske.
</P>
<P>
   That was the summer of the Republican Party's ``Contract With
America'' _ another story whose significance was slow to dawn. Had
editors and reporters inquired a little more deeply into the
significance of the more active hand that David Sentelle ten took
in overseeing the investigation of the president, the outcome might
have been very different.

   Those assurances emboldened the managers of Allied Capital
International Small Business, at $20 million the smallest OPIC
fund. It has put money into small businesses including a pasta
plant and a cannery in rural Hungary and a paging company in
Brazil. If all goes according to plan, the big payoff for its
investors will come in 7 to 10 years, when the businesses are sold
or taken public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do business overseas, but we didn't want to bet
the bank on it,'' said Cabell Williams, president of Allied
Capital, a Washington-based private equity firm with $650 million
in assets under management. ``Our investments so far have been
terrific. We will have a phenomenal return. We'll make a bloody
fortune. Private capital won't go to some of these places; it's too
risky. Who is going to go to Botswana and invest money? You clearly
need a 50 percent return to go there.''
</P>
<P>
   While OPIC doesn't promise 50 percent returns, it readily
suggests that investors can expect 25 to 35 percent annual returns;
such boasts can be made because the funds are not registered
securities. A recent solicitation memorandum issued by the U.S.
Embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia, for a Caucasus region fund talked of
returns in the range of ``25 percent plus.''
</P>
<P>
   For every dollar of equity raised from investors _ a group that
has included Archer Daniels Midland, Coca-Cola Export Corp.,
Citicorp and Continental Casualty _ OPIC typically provides a match
of $2 in government-guaranteed notes, backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States. Some OPIC notes are bought by the
funds' equity investors as a way of hedging their bets; any losses
on their equity investment can be cushioned by gains on their OPIC
notes. (Of course, some equity investors buy no OPIC debt at all.)
Other buyers of OPIC notes are banks and insurance companies that
are simply interested in owning government agency debt.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation of the note buyers, OPIC debt serves
another important purpose: to bolster returns to the equity
investors. In, say, a $300 million fund made up of $100 million in
equity from institutional investors and $200 million in OPIC notes,
nearly all the fund's earning power goes to the equity investors.
This means that their returns are far greater than what $100
million alone could have earned. Only a small portion of the
profits is used to pay interest on the notes _ which generally
carry a coupon rate that is about 50 basis points, or hundredths of
a percentage point, above that of Treasury notes.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the OPIC guarantee is a powerful lure. ``There
is no chance we would have thought about any of these investment
funds without an OPIC guarantee,'' said Stanley Zax, chairman of
Zenith Insurance Co. in Woodland Hills, Calif. Zenith has invested
in OPIC funds in Poland, Southeast Asia and Israel. ``The fact of
the matter is you have OPIC protecting the debt, which is
two-thirds of the fund, and then you are getting the extra venture
capital leverage of that debt. Without it, there was too much
volatility in those markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics course through OPIC's fund program, traceable not only
in the selections of countries to receive investment funds but,
often, in links to the fund managers receiving lucrative contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The enthusiasm with which the administration has embraced the
program is evidenced by the high visibility given to it by
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore: a West Bank fund
announced at a 1996 White House meeting with Yasser Arafat; $750
million pledged for two sub-Saharan Africa funds during the
president's highly publicized tour in Africa this year, and a $120
million South Africa fund announced in a White House meeting in
1996 between Gore and South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   But domestic politics gets OPIC's attention, too. Critics say
there is a disturbing relationship between OPIC and major
Democratic Party donors, often people who attended White House
coffees or slept in the Lincoln Bedroom. Six funds valued at $585
million were approved in the election year of 1996 shortly after
sponsors of four of them had attended White House coffees.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program exploded just after the Clinton administration
came into office,'' said Paul Hendrie, communications director of
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group in
Washington. ``And a large percentage of them are going to people
with strong political connections or who made big contributions to
Democrats in the last election.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those are David Bonderman, a Texas investor with stakes in
two OPIC funds who gave $140,000 to the Democrats in 1996. His
business partner, Richard Blum, is a leading Democratic fund-raiser
and the husband of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bonderman's investment firm was also named manager of the $300
million Aqua International Partners fund, which has hired William
Reilly, director of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Bush
administration, as its hands-on manager. Like all OPIC fund
managers, Bonderman's firm will get a management fee equal to 2.5
percent of the fund's assets and 20 percent of the ultimate
profits, which can run into the tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   The big contributors also included New York investor Dirk Ziff,
who, with his brother, gave $400,000 to the Democrats in 1996 and
manages the $150 million South Asia Capital fund. Alan Patricof, a
New York venture capitalist who gave $140,000 to the Democrats in
1996 and raised $600,000 more, is manager of OPIC's $40 million
Israel Growth fund. And Maurice Greenberg, a leading Democratic
donor, is chairman of the AIG Group, an insurance company that gave
Democrats $245,000 and $213,000 to Republicans in 1996. That year,
AIG was named manager of the $300 million AIG Brunswick Millennium
fund, which has $30 million of AIG money in it.
</P>
<P>
   Toy, the OPIC vice president, said politics plays no role in the
selection of fund managers, who are picked by OPIC after a
solicitation and competitive review. ``OPIC fund managers have to
be sophisticated world players,'' he said. ``Therefore, it comes as
no surprise that many OPIC managers have acquaintances with people
in government. But our final decisions are economic. No
institutional investor puts $10 million to $12 million in a fund on
the basis of who the fund manager knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all its government ties, OPIC is loath to disclose
financial information to anyone but fund investors. It will not
identify to outsiders the funds' investments or institutional
investors, the rates of return or any fund's current net asset
value. This CIA-like secrecy has frustrated even members of
Congress.

   ``Getting information from them is like pulling teeth,'' said
Shawn C. McBurney, special assistant to Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif.,
chairman of the OPIC oversight committee. ``They dodge a lot and
are not forthcoming. We can't get any information about this little
agency that exposes the American taxpayer to enormous risk off in a
corner of government.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, OPIC prides itself on being more like a private company
than the government agency it is. ``As a public agency, we are
charged with transparency,'' said Stillman, the former OPIC fund
director. ``But we have to attract private capital, and private
investors don't want to disclose what they are investing in.''
</P>
<P>
   The shards of information available, however, from interviews
and some sites on the World Wide Web, show that some OPIC funds do
what private investors are already doing _ sometimes with the same
fund managers. And this raises questions of why an OPIC guarantee
is even needed.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Newbridge Andean Partners, a $160 million OPIC fund
investing in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. To
date, the fund has invested in a cable television venture and a gas
distribution network in Venezuela. But it has also put $6 million
into bonds of a financially troubled Argentine maker of Nike and
Converse shoes, which is being restructured by a non-OPIC sister
fund, Newbridge Latin America, owner of $80 million of its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Investor interest was so strong in a $180 million OPIC fund,
South America Private Equity Growth, that the fund's manager set up
a second, $37 million fund to make the same investments, but
without OPIC guarantees. And when OPIC set up its Russian ventures,
at least 28 other venture capital funds were also putting money
there.
</P>
<P>
   While some had ties to other United States and European
government agencies, several were out-and-out private ventures,
including those run by AT&AMP;T and General Motors pension funds.
Junction Investors, a Boston-based group managing the $92 million
Caucasus Fund, has had funds in the Caucasus and Russia going back
to the early 1990s. And New Century Holdings, which has a $250
million Russian OPIC fund, also has three other venture funds in
the region with more than $400 million invested and a track record
there dating to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Even some OPIC fund managers question whether OPIC guarantees
are needed. ``We're delighted not to have OPIC in our new fund,''
said one OPIC fund manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``If you have the ability to raise money any other way, OPIC is not
the best use of money for the taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   On that score, OPIC agrees. The agency, for instance, probably
will not set up another Poland or Latin America fund, said
Stillman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to work ourselves out of business,'' he said. ``If
we can get people comfortable with these places, they will come in
and do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of OPIC's institutional investors have a business agenda
beyond receiving an attractive rate of return on their money. At
least two investors in the $25 million Africa Growth fund,
Coca-Cola Export and Dresser Industries, benefited from its
investments, which include aa Kenyan bottling plant for Coca-Cola
and a transportation company used by Dresser.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel Growth fund has taken stakes in the country's
burgeoning software business _ including investments in two
companies that later went public in the United States. The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an investor in the fund,
said it wanted to learn more about the high-technology business in
Israel, where companies like IBM, Motorola and Intel have set up
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics of OPIC ask if all this business frenzy,
especially with American taxpayers shouldering the risk, is a
proper function of government. ``If these are such good
investments, then private money should go in and have all the risks
and the benefits,'' said Douglas Bandow, a senior fellow at the
Cato Institute. ``If private enterprises want to do this, let
them.''

BRITISH PETROLEUM SETS TARGET FOR REDUCING GREENHOUSE GASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Setting a figure for the first time on its planned
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, British Petroleum Co.
announced Friday a ``firm overall target'' to cut emissions by 10
percent of their 1990 levels by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the company in London, Roddy Kennedy, said the
1990 level of emissions was 40 million tons _ a figure that would
have risen by 18 million tons over the next 12 years if no measures
were taken to reduce them.
</P>
<P>
   The target reduction was announced in a speech to the Yale
School of Management in New Haven, Conn., by Sir John Browne,
British Petroleum's chief executive, who said the promised cuts
went deeper than those promised by industrialized countries last
year. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide and other pollutants
that many think cause global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, 160 countries agreed in Kyoto, Japan, to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries by 5 percent
between 2008 and 2012. But, according to environmentalists, the
agreement has met with strong resistance from oil and other
companies and has not been ratified. Many people in the United
States energy sector argue that global warming is unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking ranks with other oil producers, however, Browne's first
called for action to limit greenhouse gases last year, pledging to
set a target for reductions. He said Friday the company would
undertake the cuts ``in transparent ways so the reduction can be
measured and verified by outside observers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the oil and gas industry, the dominant issues of public
policy is climate change,'' Browne said, according to a text of his
address made available here. ``Of course, the science of climate
change is not proven. The science is provisional and perhaps always
will be. But there is mounting evidence that the concentration of
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising and the temperature of
the earth's surface is increasing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Accordingly, he said, BP has initiated an internal program
enabling units within the company to trade emission rights _ a
system developed in conjunction with the Environmental Defense
Fund, a nonprofit advocacy group in the United States, and also
urged by the Kyoto conference.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in emission rights enables companies or countries to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions either by outright cuts or by
trading in excess reductions made by others. In a separate
statement, BP said a pilot trading program would link 12 of its 90
internal units accounting for about a quarter of the company's
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Kennedy, the spokesman, declined to comment on how
Friday's pledge would affect BP's planned merger with Amoco,
announced last August and still awaiting regulatory approval. Amoco
has differed with BP on global warming, but Browne said Friday that
``as our business grows, we will incorporate new activities into
the base line of our calculation and into the target.''
</P>
<P>
   One way BP has begun to reduce emissions, he said, was by
cutting the number of pumping stations on the Trans-Alaska pipeline
and by reducing flaring _ the burning-off of waste gas _ by
two-thirds. He said future reductions would come from technological
advances, more efficient energy use and less flaring.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Krupp, the executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund, which cooperated with BP in setting up its emission-trading
system, called Friday's announcement ``a really magnificent example
of a corporation acting responsibly.''
</P>
<P>
   While BP's emissions represented a small percentage of global
emissions, he said, BP had ``set up a whole new level of
expectations for other corporations within the oil and gas
industry'' and had committed itself to ``do more than the Kyoto
protocol requires independently of whether it ever goes into
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's small in percentage terms. It's more significant because
of its signal,'' Krupp said in a telephone interview. ``I believe
this changes the whole ball game.''

LURED TO ENROLL, LEFT TO SQUIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)  
(js) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With colleges facing persistent cost increases and a smaller
applicant pool, what was once a gentlemanly competition for
students has in many cases degenerated into a grim battle for
survival _ in which scholarships are negotiated as crassly, and
about as reliably, as the sale of used cars.
</P>
<P>
   Taking many forms _ a scholarship, discounted tuition or some
other benefit _ financial-aid packages can be dangled before
prospective freshmen, and are often key in winning over applicants
who might have opted to enroll elsewhere. But what incoming
students do not always realize is that these packages can shrink or
disappear once a ``sale'' is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bait and switch often happens once they enroll; there's no
question about it,'' said Norman Smith, president of Wagner College
on Staten Island, which he said guarantees its aid in writing for
four years.
</P>
<P>
   There are no statistics on how many students have suffered
financial-aid shocks. But college administrators and financial aid
specialists alike say that in the competition among private
colleges and universities for applicants, games are often played
with financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   To help recruit the best students _ or the students in the best
position to pay most of their costs _ colleges often extend
attractive packages of financial aid. But once a desired applicant
enrolls, it is not at all unusual for that aid to wither, with
those making the most successful transition to college _ and thus
less likely to transfer _ among the chief targets.
</P>
<P>
   In general, parents and students are advised to examine closely
a school's aid documents. The papers should specify how long aid
will continue and, if for less than for four years, the terms for
renewal. Cuts in aid can be appealed, but there is seldom full
restoration unless the student has an outstanding record or has
other leverage, like a connection with wealthy alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Most student aid is based on financial need, as determined by a
federal questionnaire that each institution interprets for itself.
And aid can be reduced legitimately for various reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is a significant improvement in parental financial
circumstances, perhaps resulting from a job promotion, a remarriage
or the graduation from college of a student's older sibling. Aid
can also be cut off after a college catches up with parental
misrepresentation or egregious hiding of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Other legitimate reasons for cutbacks include adverse
developments on the student's side: poor grades, slow progress
toward a degree, alcohol abuse or other bad conduct. In cases
involving athletic scholarships, a disabling injury can end the
aid.
</P>
<P>
   Some institutions, intentionally or carelessly offering more
financial help than they can deliver, find pretexts to curtail it _
for example, by invoking fine print in the contract that requires
achieving unrealistically high grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``One `D' in your first semester, and you lose your financial
aid'' is a frequent ploy, said Patricia Ewers, president of Pace
University and the chairwoman this year of the National Association
of Independent Colleges and Universities.
</P>
<P>
   Another, according to Dr. Ewers, is withdrawing a scholarship
when a student changes academic direction _ when a science major,
say, decides to become an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   She said Pace guaranteed scholarships, but noted that it and
other schools generally did not protect against inflation's effects
on awards with fixed-dollar amounts.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some recipients do not fully understand the terms of
their aid packages, which are often tailored to rely progressively
less on grants and more on loans as students' ability to borrow
improves.
</P>
<P>
   But competitive recruiting also causes such ``over-awarding''
that a school, well intentioned or not, chooses to back away from
some of its obligations. Some colleges have almost gone under
because their financial aid offices have cut prices too much for
too many.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, many institutions have revived scholarships and
other aid based on merit, rather than need, as they try to lure a
cadre of top-ranking students.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Loewith, a private counselor to students and their
families in Fairfield, Conn., says she has begun advising them to
try to negotiate improved deals when more than one school seems
strongly interested. ``It's never a done deal,'' Ms. Loewith,
president of the Independent Educational Consultants Association,
said she tells them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A common tactic, according to Smith of Wagner, is for a school
to suddenly ``find'' some aid over the summer for students who have
not yet accepted admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unsavory things are going on,'' he said, with many struggling
institutions ``turning themselves into used-car dealerships.''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected disappearance of financial aid, it is widely
agreed, is confined mainly to second- and third-tier private
institutions, including some relatively expensive schools
concentrated in the Northeast that compete ferociously for
students.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy League schools, by contrast, are richly endowed and
suffer no shortage of top applicants, while state universities
enjoy an increasing flood of applicants who see them as such
bargains that further financial inducement is ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the lesser institutions that are doing this, that are
baiting and switching,'' said Leonard Krivy, an educational
consultant in Cherry Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, according to David Crockett, senior vice
president at USA Group Noel Levitz, a consultant, colleges
dispensed financial aid haphazardly without enough regard to
budgetary consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's becoming more integrated, tied more closely to
recruiting,'' Crockett said _ a process that has led some
institutions, which he declined to identify, to offer prospective
students aid that is openly acknowledged as one-time-only.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really opposed to these first-year scholarships,'' he
said. ``It seems like enticing them in with it.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Eager for an invitation to a private party at Le
Cirque 2000?
</P>
<P>
   Need dinner reservations for eight at Bond Street in two hours?
</P>
<P>
   Think it might be fun to fly to London for the night, stay at
the Lanesborough hotel, even though it's already booked up, and
bring six friends to Nobu London because it is your birthday?
</P>
<P>
   If so, then you might want to consider becoming a client of Bill
Fischer, a travel agent extraordinary, who specializes in getting
people into sold-out hotels, onto overbooked flights and into
restaurants with unlisted phone numbers. He satisfied all three
requests during a typical day last Monday, for clients who pay
$10,000 solely to get him to answer their calls.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the package tours Fischer leads for the rich
and social to resorts that are hot, hot, hot _ sort of Carnival
Cruises for the Forbes 400.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, during the Cannes Film Festival, he escorted four
clients to the Hotel du Cap in Cap d'Antibes, where they could rub
elbows with Winona Ryder, Johnny Depp, Harvey Weinstein and other
Hollywood folk who made the cash-only, super-private hotel their
base.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, he chartered a private jet to St. Bart's for 70
people, including the art dealer Mary Boone and the family of
Michael Lynne, the head of New Line Cinema. He arranged rooms for
14 days in the Isle de France hotel, which normally sells out a
year in advance. During the day, Fischer could be seen on the beach
behind the hotel, asking about hot parties to which he could escort
members of his group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boone, who could probably get into any party she cared to on
her own, thank you, said that the real value of Fischer Travel,
Fischer's 18-person agency, is its ability to handle last-minute
reservations and travel emergencies. ``They can get you on a seat
on a flight to St. Bart's when you decide on Dec. 10 you want to go
for Christmas,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a week before her son, Max, 11, was supposed to go
to Venice, Ms. Boone realized that his passport had expired. Max
was at sleep-away camp in Beckett, Mass. Fischer Travel arranged
for a camp counselor to drive Max to Lenox, Mass., pose for a
passport picture, have the photo sent by Federal Express to New
York and, through contacts at the passport office, have a new
passport issued in 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The cost? ``I don't know,'' Ms. Boone said. That's the attitude
Fischer likes. With a client list of 400 and with what he says is a
waiting list to join it, Fischer decided a year and a half ago to
charge a fee to enroll as a client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's $10,000 to say hello to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fee is nonrefundable and is not applied to tickets,
reservations or services. It can be a one-time fee or an annual
fee, depending on how demanding a client is. If potential clients
balk at the fee, Fischer said, he decides right away not to take
them on. ``If they are going to haggle over the fee, then they are
going to haggle over the rates of hotels and flights,'' he said
with an air of distaste.
</P>
<P>
   His attitude is that he will do whatever it takes to meet
clients' needs, but he expects them to pay whatever they are
billed, virtually no questions asked. ``They are so rich, what's 10
or 20 thousand to them,'' he said. A source of pride at his agency
is that the phone number is unlisted. And he makes no apologies for
his policy requiring potential clients to present two or three
references.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like joining a country club,'' he said. ``We have to
accept you.''
</P>
<P>
   Though such practices seem to imply breathtaking hubris,
inviting disbelief about Fischer's business claims, a proffered
list of his blue-chip clients checked out: Diane Sawyer; Martin
Scorsese; Calvin Klein; Jonathan Tisch, the hotelier; Bruce
Wasserstein, the financier; Sanford Weill, the Travelers Group
chairman. Spokesmen for all these individuals said they used
Fischer's services.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Schwarzman, the president and chief executive of the
Blackstone Group, the private investment bank, who is a client,
said, ``Bill is a unique resource and regularly does the
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schwarzman's wife, Christine Hearst, was in Paris recently
and decided at the last minute she wanted to take her daughter,
Janet, to Jules Verne, the popular restaurant on the Eiffel Tower,
Fischer went into action. ``You need six months' advance
reservation,'' he said. ``She gave me six minutes.'' After 10
trans-Atlantic telephone calls, he got mother and daughter a table
at Jules Verne for Janet's 10th birthday.

 NEW YORK: 10th birthday. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fischer, who grew up in Brooklyn, started in the travel business
more than a quarter-century ago, selling $199 packages to Aruba.
Since then, he said, he has flown a client's dog to Los Angeles
alone so the animal could attend dog camp while the owner went to
Europe, and he got an emergency face-lift appointment for a client.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the dancing stock market and a White House in crisis,
Fischer said his business has felt nary an economic ripple. ``All
I've noticed is that no one asked me to get them into the lunch
Denise Rich had for President Clinton in her apartment today,'' he
said on Monday from his midtown offices on Third Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer says he gets his clients impossible reservations and
unavailable seats by persistence and prodigious networking. He
recounts how he once got clients into a small, sold-out hotel in
Gstaad, Switzerland, by telephoning twice a day for three months,
until a room finally opened up. A tan, fit man of 62, he deals with
the stress by popping 50 vitamin pills a day. But many employees _
who include a daughter, Stacy Fischer, 36, and 16 others _ do not
handle it as well, and staff turnover is high.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone to a reservations agent, Fischer is not above
dropping the names of his famous clients, implying that if a hotel
can accommodate client X, then a Calvin Klein or a Diane Sawyer
might be steered there in the near future. One former client,
however, gave a different explanation for Fischer's success: he
overpays enormously for hotel rooms, and tips the staff of hot
restaurants and hotels extravagantly, passing the costs back to his
too-rich-to-complain clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk into a hotel and they know he sent you, they
treat you very well _ it's like when a sugar daddy walks in and
spreads the money around,'' said the former client, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. He said he ceased using Fischer several
years ago because he thought he was being gouged. ``He charges off
the charts for everything,'' the former client said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the claim that he gets results by lavishly
greasing palms, Fischer said: ``Absolutely not. We send them
clients and they like who we send. I show them my list; it's a
`Who's Who' list. We're sending the kind of people who are not
going to complain and will pay for anything. The hotels want our
clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said that if a couple called last Thursday wanting to
fly by Concorde to Paris for the weekend, spend two nights at the
Ritz and dine at Alain Ducasse, Fischer Travel would charge $30,000
to $40,000, not including dinner.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a reporter who tried to book the trip directly was
quoted by Air France a fare of $21,824 for two on the Concorde.
Both the Ritz and Alain Ducasse said they were booked solid for a
month.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the daughter of one of Fischer's famous
clients asked the agency to have her father's frequent-flier miles
switched to her account, and to use them to make free reservations
for her to Europe. Her father's office received a bill for $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made one phone call for me,'' said the daughter, who was
furious and declined to be named, to protect her family's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's response to all questions about billing is to shrug.
``Look, we charge for our services,'' he said. ``That's it. My
clients can afford it.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By rather brief tradition, the literature of choice
at the year-old Public Affairs publishing house started by the
Random House refugee Peter Osnos is intelligent and reflective _
serious nonfiction scorned by conglomerates seeking best-seller
profits.
</P>
<P>
   So how is it that Osnos' leading title on his debut list this
fall is a breast-heaving 421-page tale of unrequited love, of a
tormented affair of a young woman scorned and a married man
scarred, of an impossible relationship characterized by
bodice-ripper sentiments and romance-book regrets? A book with
lines like: I ``cannot ignore what we have shared together. I don't
care what you say, but if you were 100 percent fulfilled in your
marriage I never would have seen that raw, intense sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect no grainy photographs for your $10 purchase, but there's
not much else left to the imagination in ``The Starr Report'' _
That Book _ which Public Affairs started shipping before dawn on
Monday with a dignified crimson-and-gray cover and the complete
text of the report of the Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, chronicling President Clinton's relationship with the former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Also contained inside is the
White House rebuttal and early news articles from The Washington
Post about the steamy government document, which makes ``The Valley
of the Dolls'' read like a telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know that when we chose Public Affairs for this
company's name that we literally meant public affairs, but that's
the way it worked out,'' Osnos, 54, said dryly from the company's
headquarters _ spare, dorm-like offices that share the 18th floor
of the Fisk Building in midtown Manhattan with the nonliterati,
like Arista Dental and Dentogenic Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The company's maiden catalog does indeed boast serious books,
like Arthur L. Liman's posthumous memoir of his legal career and
the Iran-Contra investigation and Neil Baldwin's exploration of
Mexico and the myth of Quetzalcoatl, the principal god of the
Aztecs. But the company has printed far more copies of ``The Starr
Report'' than of any of the nine other titles, with 300,000 books
shipped on Monday, and Osnos is poised to gamble by printing still
more. ``We could print hundreds of thousands right now,'' Osnos
said. ``We still are going to print as conservatively as we can
because we don't know how long this is going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now, copies of ``The Starr Report'' are moving as if
they were Stephen King paperbacks _ and are a far better bargain
for Osnos than a blockbuster novel would be because his company can
publish the government document without paying advances to its
authors, subsidizing expensive book tours or sparring with agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sold out in Cincinnati, Denver, Paramus, Dallas and Las
Vegas,'' an exuberant Osnos marveled before bolting from his office
to meet with another company employee to debate how many more
copies to print. (To be sure, Public Affairs has at least two
competitors, which also report brisk sales of Starr's report _ a
$5.99, mass-market paperback from Simon &AMP; Schuster's Pocket Books
and a $9.99 trade paperback from a small California publisher,
Prima.)
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It's a rather odd state of public affairs for Osnos, a former
reporter and editor at The Washington Post who left Random House
two years ago as the publisher of its Times Books imprint. One of
the last books he published there was a slim political tome by
Clinton, which certainly failed to match the sales power or Oval
Office sizzle of ``The Starr Report.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was the publisher of Times Books _ once owned by The
New York Times Co. _ Osnos came to believe that the system for
publishing serious books was flawed and the audience for them too
limited to support standard author advances and corporate overhead.
It bothered him that ``Times Books was doing more and more consumer
reference books and crossword puzzles, and I wanted to do
public-affairs books,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he resigned to start his own company, and set about looking
for partners to share the costs of author contracts. ``PBS
Frontline'' signed on in return for exclusive rights to produce
documentaries tied to the books it helped underwrite. His plan also
attracted minority investors like the ABC News anchor Peter
Jennings and the former C-Span chairman Robert Rosencrans. It also
prompted Frank H. Pearl, a lawyer and chairman of the venture
capital firm Perseus Capital, to buy a majority interest and make
Public Affairs a part of his expanding publishing group, which also
includes Basic Books, a bastion of scholarly works, and
Counterpoint, a literary press.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Osnos has no qualms about making a publishing
debut with a government page turner of Oval Office romance and
footnotes that helpfully provide the definition of telephone sex
and Ms. Lewinsky's dry-cleaning habits _ or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have a moment's doubt that a report by this special
counsel, recommending the impeachment of the president of the
United States, is a historic document,'' Osnos said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of anything more substantive,'' he added. ``Do
you think I should curl my lip at the president of the United
States? I'm not in the business of judging whether history is
elegant or not. History in this case is degrading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Starr Report'' _ as The Book _ could have a significant
impact on the fledgling Public Affairs, letting it subsidize more
projects and ``change our sense of what is possible,'' Osnos said.
</P>
<P>
   But he is trying to remain cautious _ and practical. Is there a
sequel? Osnos is waiting for the release of Starr's next 2,000
pages of evidence.

  (Editors: This item moves as a free-standing graphic as well) 
(JT) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No. 2 Florida 2-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 at Tennessee 1-0
</P>
<P>
   A slick matchup of Southeastern Conference powers. Both teams
can move the ball, although Florida lost five first-half turnovers
against Northeast Louisiana. Florida has a good defense, and
linebacker Johnny Rutledge said, ``We will throw the kitchen sink,
the wrenches, the whole house against them.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 21 Missouri 2-0
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 at Ohio State 2-0
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State rolled up 502 yards against Toledo with good passing
and Michael Wiley's 151 yards rushing. Against Kansas, Missouri
rushed for 401 yards, 319 by Devin West, but this should be much
tougher.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Louisiana State 1-0
</P>
<P>
   at Auburn 1-1
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Auburn held Mississippi to 39 yards rushing. This
time, Auburn must contend with Kevin Faulk, who has six straight
100-yard rushing games, including 180 yards last week against
Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Texas 1-1
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Kansas State 2-0
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State has beaten Indiana State by 66-0 and Northern
Illinois by 73-7. Now it plays a major team, but even with Ricky
Williams' running (160 yards in losing to UCLA), Texas will have
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Penn State (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Pittsburgh (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Now that Joe Paterno of Penn State has 300 victories, he takes
aim at Bear Bryant's major-college record of 323.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 19 West Virginia (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia's running game, dormant against Ohio State, should
get healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Boston College (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Boston College should fatten up against Temple and Louisville
before tests from Virginia Tech and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Army (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   Army's offense is suspect and Cincinnati's has been careless.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Columbia (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard, the Ivy League defender and favorite, has won its last
seven games. Columbia is concerned about quarterback and the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Princeton (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   Princeton, in the first game in its new stadium, has the better
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Yale (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Brown (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   Brown, with a high-powered offense, could win the Ivy race. Yale
will struggle again.
</P>
<P>
   Penn (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Dartmouth (0-0)
</P>
<P>
   A contest between Penn's sound offense and Dartmouth's strong
defense.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Clemson (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 10 Virginia (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Clemson, which looked awful in losing to Virginia Tech, faces
more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 12 Georgia (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's two victims have averaged only 188 yards in offense.
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Texas A&AMP;M (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Southern Mississippi (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies must repeat the creative defense that stopped
Louisiana Tech's passing.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Miami (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech, which beat East Carolina by 38-3 and Clemson by
37-0, is an underdog here.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 UCLA (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Houston (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   UCLA ran up 584 yards on Texas and found a receiver in Freddie
Mitchell, a redshirt freshman.
</P>
<P>
   No. 20 North Carolina State (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Baylor (0-1)
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State, a 25-point underdog, upset Florida State with six
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   Brigham Young (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 9 Washington (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   In a role reversal, Washington has the passing, Brigham Young
the running.
</P>
<P>
   Utah State (0-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 15 Colorado (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   The jury is still out on Colorado, and Coach Rick Neuheisel
says, ``We are far, far from a finished product.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 16 Arizona (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Iowa can't stop the run, and Arizona can get big yardage
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 18 Southern California (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Against San Diego State, R. Jay Soward of Southern California
averaged 28.4 yards on nine touches of the ball.

</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 13 Syracuse (1-1)

demolition job on Rutgers.
</P>
<P>
   Duke (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 11 Florida State (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, out of the top 10 for the first time in four
years, should right itself.

<P>
   Nevada, Las Vegas (0-2)
</P>
<P>

O'BRIEN HOPES NOT TO REPEAT DEBACLE OF LAST YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tom O'Brien's recollection of his first game as Boston
College coach was not very enjoyable. He shook his head as he
recalled the sloppiness that victimized BC in its 28-21
season-opening loss a year ago at Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were forcing things, we had bad snaps on field goals,
penalties at crucial times _ both on offense and defense,'' he
said. ``It was just your typical nightmare for a first game.''
</P>
<P>
   When the undefeated Eagles (2-0 overall, 1-0 Big East) host the
winless Owls (0-2) in a conference home game Saturday at Alumni
Stadium, the last thing O'Brien will want is to relive his
nightmarish debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They already had a game under their belt, so they had worked
their kinks out,'' O'Brien said, pointing out how Temple entered
last year's meeting with some game experience, though it came in a
34-14 loss at Western Michigan. ``But it took us a while to get
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, when Temple arrives in Chestnut Hill for
Saturday's conference matchup, the Owls will encounter a BC team
that has it going pretty well, offensively and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles followed up their season-opening 41-31 triumph at
Georgia Tech with another offensive show in a 41-14 romp over
Rutgers. They capitalized on a balanced attack that amassed 486
yards total offense and converted on seven of eight red-zone
opportunities, improving their overall red-zone efficiency to 93
percent (14 for 15).
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston College's a very good football team and they run the
ball extremely well,'' said Temple first-year coach Bobby Wallace,
whose team suffered a 35-28 loss to Akron, its second in a row to a
Mid-American Conference opponent. ``They have a great running back
(Mike Cloud) and a quarterback (Scott Mutryn) who does great things
with his running and throwing ability. The offensive line, it's
been documented how big and strong they are, and defensively,
Boston College's nose guard (Chris Hovan) and free safety (Pedro
Cirino) are great players.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got to try and control them,'' he added. ``It will
be an interesting battle, especially with the free safety, because
the nature of our offense involves the free safety in stopping the
running game. It'll be interesting to see how that matchup comes
out.''
</P>
<P>
   BC's defense, which ranks third in the conference in total yield
(331.5 yards per game), will likely face its toughest test _
Temple's option offense, which boasts the nation's No. 4 rushing
attack (298.5 yards per game) and is led by 5-foot-11-inch,
195-pound junior quarterback Kevin Harvey of Paulsboro, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nasty, he's good,'' said Cirino, who's from Jersey City,
N.J. ``He's the real deal, and I saw that firsthand when I played
against him in an all-star game in New Jersey. He holds state
records that I think will never be broken. He's a great player and
they're lucky to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirino is hoping BC can contain, if not stop, Harvey from
executing Temple's option, which sputtered when it came up short on
two critical scoring opportunities last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the ball inside the 10, and it was the fifth time in
two weeks that we've had the ball inside the 10-yard line and come
away with only two field goals,'' said Wallace. ``We've scored some
points other times, but it's very disturbing when you rush for 365
yards during the course of the game. Had we scored, it would've
made it 35-35 and we would've had a chance to get it into OT.
Defensively, we didn't stop their run, and that's going to be a big
problem for us this week against Boston College. You can't play
defense and at least be able to slow somebody down from running the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The other interesting matchup will pit the conference's top two
rushers: Cloud (178.0 yards per game) and Temple's Stacey Mack
(108), who carried 16 times for 121 yards and scored the winning
touchdown on a 27-yard run in last year's triumph over the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't necessarily see it as a duel between us,'' said Cloud,
who had 201 all-purpose yards, including 156 rushing, and a pair of
TDs last week. ``I see it as a great opportunity for BC and the
whole program to come out with a third victory. If we can go 3-0,
it's going to be a great thing for the program.''

CLINTON TURNS TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS TO DEFLECT DOMESTIC TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is plunging into international
summitry to tackle terrorism, communal warfare in the Balkans, the
nuclear arms race in South Asia and global economic problems as he
braces for repercussions from the release of his videotaped grand
jury testimony and fresh details of his sexual liaisons with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton heads to New York City late Sunday to dive into two days
of substantive diplomacy centered upon the annual opening of the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to address the General Assembly at 10:45
a.m. EDT Monday as the nation's attention focuses on the expected
telecast of his videotaped testimony before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The video of Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony about his relationship
with the former White House intern, along with 2,800 pages of
supporting documents, should be released at 9 a.m. EDT Monday, said
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   White House Deputy Press Secretary Barry Toiv said Clinton looks
forward to continuing to do his job in the face of the anticipated
furor over the videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has responsibilities abroad and he obviously has
responsibilities here at home, and he will continue to do both,''
Toiv said. ``He will continue to do the work that he was elected to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the four hours and 12 minutes of testimony ``will
not have an impact'' on Clinton's readiness to represent the nation
``with distinction'' at the United Nations, Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, Clinton's national security adviser,
said world leaders continue to voice support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want and expect the United States to lead,'' Berger said.
``They very much look to the president to lead _ and we intend to
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger discouraged renegade foreign leaders such as Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein from trying to exploit Clinton's domestic
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a grave mistake for any foreign leader or any
group to believe that if the United States' interests are
threatened, the United States will not respond in a firm and united
way,'' Berger declared. ``Anybody who made that calculation would
make a grave miscalculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants to devote his Sunday evening summit with Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi to refining western efforts to quell
ethnic violence in Albania and the Serbian province of Kosovo,
Berger said. Clinton and Prodi also are to discuss the stubborn
economic crisis in Russia, where President Boris Yeltsin has just
installed hard-liner Yevgeny Primikov as the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would focus his address before the U.N.
General Assembly on persuading world leaders and diplomats that the
international community has ``common obligations'' to combat
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hoped to deflect international criticism _ particularly
from Islamic nations _ about last month's cruise missile attacks on
suspected terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. The attacks
were a response to terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fight against terrorism is not a clash of civilizations or
cultures,'' Berger said. ``The dividing line is between those who
practice, support and tolerate terror and those who understand that
terrorism is plain and simple murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then intensifies personal involvement in efforts to
defuse the nuclear arms race that flared between Pakistan and India
in May, when the neighboring countries traded tit-for-tat
underground nuclear explosions in a bid to obtain nuclear weapons
capability.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to use his first face-to-face meeting with
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to seek a commitment from the
Islamic nation to ease the arms race and open direct negotiations
with India over disputed territory in Kashmir. The land dispute has
triggered three wars in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott plans to press Indian
envoy Jaswant Singh to commit India to similar steps at a follow-up
meeting in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton still hopes to add stops in
Pakistan and India to a long-scheduled trip to a pan-Pacific summit
in Malaysia in November _ if Pakistan and India reach agreement to
end their confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discussed with the Indians and with the Pakistanis the
steps that we think need to be taken to put them back on track,''
Berger said Friday. ``I think there's been some movement, but I
think so far it's been insufficient.''

<P>
   Clinton leaves the hubbub of Manhattan Tuesday for the
Rockefeller family's sprawling country estate in Tarrytown, N.Y.,
where he will hold an emergency summit with Japan's new prime
minister, Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was forced to scrap a long-scheduled summit in late July
with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who was forced to
resign by setbacks in parliamentary elections and the country's
economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said that Clinton would press Obuchi to stimulate Japan's
$2.8 trillion economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's stubborn recession is ``a tremendous drag on the overall
Asian financial situation,'' Berger said, adding that the United
States ``cannot see a reversal of the general Asian financial
prospect without a significant upturn in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to continue his focus on foreign affairs after his
return to Washignton late Tuesday. He is scheduled to award the
Congressional Gold Medal to South African President Nelson Mandela
at a ceremony on Capitol Hill Wednesday; meet with Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong later that day; and have a working lunch
with Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz on
Thursday.

<P>
   ARCHER CITY, Texas _ Outsiders. City slickers. Tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Call me self-conscious, but I'm pretty sure that's what the
regulars were thinking when my husband and I walked into the
American Legion Hall, Post 198, on a recent Friday night. Every
head turned our way. Conversations paused. The bartender studied us
suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I'd done my homework on Archer City, a tiny outpost
120 miles from Fort Worth. Calls to two local establishments prior
to our trip indicated our best bet _ our only bet _ for
entertainment there on a Friday night was the American Legion Hall.
Unless we preferred the Dairy Queen.
</P>
<P>
   What the locals neglected to mention was that the Post 198 bar
was a ``members and guests only'' establishment, as a sign above
the tap clearly read. Several uncomfortable seconds passed before a
festive woman whom the bartender introduced as Buttons volunteered
her sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be my very special guests,'' she called, waving her
hands in the air and miraculously maintaining the inch-long ash at
the end of her cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Thus we made our first friend in Archer City. Conversations
resumed, the jukebox dished out Stevie Ray Vaughan and bar manager
Carlyn Parrish offered us the Legion Hall tour _ from the 12-burner
stove where Legionnaires prepare Thanksgiving dinner for the needy
to photographs of former post commanders that decorate the dance
hall.
</P>
<P>
   Archer City, said Parrish, ``is the Bermuda Triangle of Texas.
Once you come here, you can't never leave.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it has turned out for Larry McMurtry, too. The
Pulitzer Prize-winning author graduated from Archer City High
School, spent years in the big city, and now resides in the town
that shaped him _ a town he's now reshaping.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry, after all, initially plunked Archer City on the
cultural map in 1966 with his novel ``The Last Picture Show,'' a
poignant and somewhat dark chronicle of small-town life. Though
McMurtry called the town Thalia, Archer City folks recognized they
were clearly McMurtry's subjects, and some were less than pleased.
Five years later, director Peter Bogdanovich brought his cast and
crew here to film the movie version, changing the town's name to
Anarene. It didn't matter; Archer City was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the exposure (or maybe because of it; the film portrayal
of the town makes it look like one of the bleaker spots on earth),
tourists have bypassed this dusty North Texas outpost 25 miles
south of Wichita Falls. But McMurtry is again drawing the attention
of literati to quirky Archer City, this time with his 10-year-old
used-book operation, which in recent years has grown to fill four
scattered storefronts in the sleepy town square.
</P>
<P>
   Booked Up Inc., in turn, has spawned a mini-but-promising
tourist trade: one hotel, one restaurant, one brand-new
bed-and-breakfast in the former Archer Hospital. The Archer County
News heralded the opening of the Lonesome Dove Inn with a
front-page story.
</P>
<P>
   The bookstores house 150,000-200,000 volumes as valuable as a
first edition of William Faulkner's ``The Sound and the Fury''
($2,500), a publisher's galley proof of ``Catch-22'' ($850), and
facsimiles of Shakespeare's original folios ($175). First-edition
copies of ``Lonesome Dove'' sell for $350, but the budget-minded
can buy it in paperback for $5.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the books we looked at cost between $8 and $50, such as
an illustrated collection of Edgar Allan Poe short stories ($30).
The inventory that Booked Up rejects goes to places like Half Price
Books.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry doesn't own Booked Up in the sense that Arnold
Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis own Planet Hollywood, lending their
star status to the venture and reaping the profits. McMurtry
actually owns and works at Booked Up, sometimes seven days a week,
parking a rented white Cadillac outside a storefront and getting
lunch at the Dairy Queen.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend before our current adventure, we were in Archer City
for the afternoon and caught McMurtry shelving books in Booked Up
No. 3. We elbowed each other and tried to look nonchalant. Should
we ask for an autograph? No, too tacky. Should we say hello? No, he
looks absorbed in his work. Besides, we had heard McMurtry could be
a tad grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, we returned for a night's stay at the Lonesome
Dove Inn, opened in August by sisters and owners Mary Slack Webb
and Ceil Cleveland (McMurtry has no financial stake in the
business). In 1978, the former hospital was converted to a home,
and it still retains a few disco-era touches like shag carpeting.
Webb, who lives at the inn, and Cleveland, who lives in New York,
have redecorated with antiques and lace bedspreads.

IMMIGRANT ADVOCATES SAY MINORS BEING HELD IN ADULT DETENTION CAMP 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARLINGEN _ Dentists are not authorities on immigration law, but
they often determine who gets locked up in a detention camp.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, immigration advocates in South Texas contend that a
dozen undocumented juvenile immigrants from Central America and
other parts of the world are being unlawfully held in a sprawling
immigration camp near Port Isabel. But Immigration and
Naturalization Service officials insist dental examinations have
proven the youths are 18 or older and that they belong in an adult
detention camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem with minors from the camp the INS alleges
are adults, and they give them a dental exam which really isn't
accurate,'' said Jonathan Jones, a paralegal with ``Proyecto
Libertad,'' a Harlingen immigration law center. ``They are, we
believe, detaining minors against federal court orders and throwing
them in with adults on the basis of dental exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any purpose in detaining first entry,
non-criminal, non-violent people who cross into the country,''
Jones added. ``I don't see any purpose in doing that (detention)
and then throwing them in together in a population that may be
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexican juveniles are typically turned over to Mexican consular
authorities in border towns. But each year, the Border Patrol in
the McAllen sector arrests about 1,300 minors who are not from
Mexico. A number of those, who are unaccompanied by family, are
placed in detention.
</P>
<P>
   Undocumented immigrants younger than 18 cannot legally be kept
in detention centers with adults, so if they cannot be turned over
to their country's consulate, they must be placed in group homes in
surrounding communities in the Rio Grande Valley pending their
legal proceedings. If a juvenile has close relatives in the United
States, the INS is required to release the youth to his family
within 72 hours, said INS spokesman Art Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Young adults arrested by the Border Patrol often pose as
juveniles in hopes they can escape from the less-secure juvenile
facilities, Moreno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their rationale is they believe the juvenile facility is more
lenient and they have all these other goodies, and they'll be able
to escape at random,'' the INS spokesman said. ``But we have to be
very careful, because some of these aliens we detain are criminals
_ not all of them _ and we have to consider what's in the best
interest of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreno insists that the dental exams are ``very, very accurate.
It's very comparable to a DNA test. This will determine the age of
a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration advocates say the age dispute has been a common one,
and places youths at risk for physical and sexual abuse from adult
detainees in detention camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come across at least two to three dozen a month who claim
to be minors who are being detained (in the Port Isabel camp).
Oftentimes, they're detained there as an adult even if they have a
birth certificate from their country,'' said Steven Lang, who
directs an American Bar Association project providing free legal
services to detainees seeking political asylum. ``I can't believe
all these kids are liars.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Moreno noted that many birth certificates are
``altered,'' he said INS authorities will revisit a case if
documents are provided that prove a youth at the camp is a
juvenile. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE GREAT MEDIA MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RUSSELL BAKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Later, in one of those comically solemn conclaves at which
journalists ponder the philosophy of their trade and eat high on
the expense account, the news industry will struggle to understand
the Great Media Meltdown of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If I am asked to contribute a monograph, it will tend toward the
theory that something akin to road rage occurred in the Washington
press corps.
</P>
<P>
   This produced actions that were variously foolish, shameful,
dangerous to American democracy and destructive for the reputation
of the news industry.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the fury _ which, let us hope, was the past
week _ sober commentators considered statesmen of the trade were
writing like pornographers to the carriage trade. If the president
had abandoned all taste, as it appeared he had, he carried the
knights of the First Amendment with him into the fens of vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers that had once scolded reporters for mildly suggestive
language with the warning that ``this is a family newspaper''
competed with the shabbiest Internet outlets to serve up a rich
diet of the lewd and salacious.
</P>
<P>
   All journalistic parties, of course, kept straight faces. The
Latin word ``genitalia'' was seriously overworked. Yes, this was
steamy stuff, all right, but no punches could be pulled, no
euphemisms allowed to lessen the impact of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   I was tempted to ask, ``Why not?'' but did not and do not, lest
my colleagues think me soft on the president. Hanging judges lurk
behind every byline, every editorial, every TV reporter, every
talking head.
</P>
<P>
   In the media it is ``get the president'' time. Editorial calls
for his impeachment or resignation come from dozens of newspapers.
Reporters, who once confined themselves to reporting, now speculate
about what sentence should be imposed on the sinner Clinton.
Impeachment? Resignation? Censure?
</P>
<P>
   Normally sober columnists vilify the president with words like
``a pig and a cad and a selfish brute,'' which I found on the op-ed
page of The Washington Post the other day.
</P>
<P>
   All this reminds me of calmer days when hotheaded scolds were
cautioned to ``keep a civil tongue in your head'' and children had
their mouths washed out with soap for saying words like
``genitalia.''
</P>
<P>
   What has caused this abandonment of the ancient newsroom codes?
Why are the media now in cahoots with Kenneth Starr to destroy the
president?
</P>
<P>
   I suspect an acute case of media exasperation. The media,
remember, know the score on presidents and tend to become irritated
with those who do not know the score. Presidents are serious
business; people ought to know the score on them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite all the material they have produced to prove
Clinton unworthy, opinion polls still show undiminished public
support for his job performance. It is bound to put serious,
score-knowing journalists in sour spirits.
</P>
<P>
   Washington journalists had a similar problem with President
Ronald Reagan. Knowing the score, they knew _ didn't they? _ that
Reagan was ``an amiable dunce'' _ wasn't he?
</P>
<P>
   The public, ignorant of the score, didn't care. They liked
Reagan. It was maddening. Clinton is more so. They see a man who
has hoodwinked his way to the top yet still enjoys public approval
despite the media's exposure of his hoodwinkery.
</P>
<P>
   Media people nowadays are almost all college boys and girls,
cream of the crop, top of the class. Which also means they don't
have a lot in common with all those millions to whom jobs and
health insurance are more urgent matters than the unorthodox sexual
proclivities of big-time politicians.
</P>
<P>
   It must be despair of ever destroying Clinton that has driven
the media into their sudden romance with morality. Declaring
Clinton morally unfit to be president is hypocrisy at its most
hilarious when it comes from employees of vast media empires which
thrive on exploitation of sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   All Washington correspondents know that morality is powerless to
sway Congress against the demands of crass old Money. Nothing
betrays the rube reporter more than his testy questions about the
morality of shortchanging the nation's bottom-feeders while
constantly granting boons to the swells.
</P>
<P>
   It's not morality that's at issue here. It's the old Puritan
love-hate affair with sex. So nasty. So irresistible.

<P>
   Webb showed us the seven guest rooms, each named for a McMurtry
novel, and asked us to select one (it was a little lonesome at the
inn that night). We chose ``The Evening Star'' chamber for its
Indonesian teak bed frame and proximity to the shared upstairs
bathroom. The $90 charge included breakfast the next morning; for
$6 a person, Webb will pack guests a lunch, too.
</P>
<P>
   A former schoolteacher in North Texas, Webb moved back to Archer
City to be near her 90-year-old father. She, her two brothers and
sister Ceil were childhood friends of McMurtry, who dedicated his
novel ``Anything for Billy'' to their mother, Margaret Ellen Slack.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks say McMurtry modeled the Jacy character in ``The Last
Picture Show'' after Ceil, who followed up by writing a nonfiction
book, ``Whatever Happened to Jacy Farrow?'' about growing up in
Archer City. McMurtry displays it prominently at Booked Up No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Webb is a treasure trove of McMurtry anecdotes, and upon our
arrival launched into several about the loquacious preteen McMurtry
_ like the times he'd sleep over in her brothers' bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Ceil and I were in the room next door, but we could
just hear him droning on and on all night with these wild tales
he'd be making up as he went along. And the boys would be fast
asleep and he'd still be talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the famous picture show loom large here, as well.
Scrub brush has consumed the carcass of the Royal Theater, where
Parrish remembers seeing films for 13 cents. But groundbreaking on
an ambitious restoration project is scheduled for November. Larry
has given his blessing to that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, Webb made breakfast and we plotted our day
over eggs and biscuits. We'd hit the bookstore after a tour of the
museum and lunch at the tearoom.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer County Museum used to be the Archer County Jail,
until Jack Lofton moved his collection of memorabilia, archaeology
and antiques from the courthouse to this 3-story relic. When we
arrived, caretaker Dolores Cox and her mother, Doris Day Hohhertz,
were playing canasta in the air-conditioned front room.
</P>
<P>
   We were the only visitors, and Dolores was happy to give us the
tour, from the rheumatism machine to the circa 1900 bustier. On a
dresser was a hand-colored photograph of a stern couple. The
caption read, ``Captured by the Indians.'' Dolores wasn't sure if
it was the couple or the photograph that the Indians caught.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton, a prolific amateur archaeologist, has reconfigured
prehistoric lizards with bones found in the area. Dolores pointed
out the 250 million-year-old dimetrodon in a locked glass-top case.
Another case holds curtains from the Royal Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could spend all week here and never see it all,'' Dolores
correctly pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   We lunched at the Cottage Tea Room, an antiques shop and dining
establishment open 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and
by reservation on Saturdays. Harold and Bertie Beekman opened the
place eight years ago and live next door. She cooks; he seats,
serves and fills the water glasses on cue.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chicken breast and chocolate pie put me on the map,''
Bertie told us. The homestyle roast beef platter came with stuffing
and gravy and carrots coated in brown sugar; it was like an early
Thanksgiving dinner (for $7.95 including dessert). We each finished
with a piece of the famous chocolate pie and desperately needed a
nap by the time we left.
</P>
<P>
   But the bookstore beckoned, and McMurtry was hardly difficult to
find. He was sitting at the round wooden table in the front room of
Booked Up No. 1, sipping from a foam Dairy Queen cup. He wore jeans
and a taupe polo-style shirt with a Dr Pepper logo on the sleeve,
and eyeglasses with heavy black frames. His gray hair was slightly
tousled, and, for the record, he didn't look grumpy at all.
</P>
<P>
   After a bit of small talk, my star-struck spouse asked McMurtry
to autograph his copy of ``Lonesome Dove,'' which he was happy to
do (for us and the couple who requested a signature right after we
did). We spent the rest of the afternoon browsing and occasionally
passing McMurtry in the aisles. We even bumped into him back at the
inn, where he was helping move a friend's luggage into the ``Terms
of Endearment'' suite. He promised Webb he'd bring over videos of
the miniseries and movies based on his books so she could dub them
and have them for her guests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have felt like I've left, particularly,'' McMurtry had
said earlier of his boyhood home.
</P>
<P>
   Archer City seems content to have McMurtry back, too.
</P>

 &HT;    REDACTIONS WON'T GIVE MATERIALS A 'PG' RATING
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite scores of deletions made by the House
Judiciary Committee, the 2,800 pages of evidence compiled by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr it plans to release Monday will
still be rated XXX.
</P>
<P>
   Although some ``redactions'' deleted explicit sexual material,
most dealt with privacy issues, such as names or phone numbers of
people mentioned incidentally in the report. When Democrats sought
to excise more graphic details, they were outvoted by the
Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general view among the Democrats not to reveal
anything, and there was a general view among Republicans to reveal
as much as possible consistent with responsible redactions to
protect people whose names and vital statistics and involvement in
this was very peripheral,'' said Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
</P>
<P>
   R-Ill. ``We agreed on 120 (redactions) and I think there were
about 20 we didn't agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements came over sexual details, said Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mi., the ranking minority member. He described some of
the newly released material as ``sexually explicit,'' ``obscene''
and ``offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said that three items
sexual in nature that Democrat and Republican staff counsels had
agreed to delete were reinstated for release by the committee's
Republican majority. He said the Democratic staff sought 27 other
redactions of sexually explicit passages, but were turned down by
the GOP staff.
</P>
<P>
   In defending their votes, Republican members insisted they were
carrying out the mandate of the full House, which voted last week
to release all of Starr's materials by Sept. 28, subject to review
by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would actually prefer that we be able to sanitize this thing
before it gets too much into the public, but our House colleagues
said no,'' said Rep. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view was to get out as much information as possible,'' said
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., explaining that protecting the privacy of
innocent people was the main grounds for the redactions he
supported.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., said members from both parties
readily agreed to redact material ``unrelated to the independent
counsel's investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An example of that could be in any tape-recorded conversations
between parties, they may have, in gossipy chatter, mentioned the
name of a co-worker in an unflattering light,'' he explained.
``That clearly is something that doesn't belong in the public
domain, and we don't want to see innocent people held up to
ridicule in church.''
</P>
<P>
   As raunchy as the released materials are, the evidence would
have been more graphic without redactions. The original Starr
report was ``PG'' compared to this material referred to in the
footnotes, some committee members said.
</P>
<P>
   ``America, you may think you got the details. You did not get
the details at all,'' said Rep. Steve Buyer, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a good-faith effort was made to redact the most
salacious matter, with one or two exceptions,'' said Rep. Lamar
Smith, R-Texas. ``These exceptions were necessary because they were
directly relevant to allegations in the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these exceptions involves Monica Lewinsky's testimony
about a sex act with President Clinton that involved a cigar, said
Smith. That was deemed necessary because Clinton has so narrowly
defined his concept of sexual relations, the congressman said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of redacted materials filled 10 pages, said Smith.

FACING AN UNDYING ISSUE: RIGHT TO DIE  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Good arguments can last awhile. This one is thousands
of years old.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Gerster, M.D., and John Westover, Ph.D., carry the
argument today. They have argued in the halls of the Arizona
Legislature, in the halls of Congress and through their
organizations' attorneys in the halls of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of this dispute, which traces back through the mists
of history to Socrates and Hippocrates: the right to end one's own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster, a Scottsdale internal medicine physician, was the
national president of her side of the argument. Westover of Tucson,
a retired Army officer and military historian, was the national
president of his side.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic asked them to meet again to engage the
issue so our readers can enjoy champion soul wrestling over one of
the great issues of the human condition. The following dialogue is
a compilation of remarks made face to face and in follow-up
comments. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: ``I think over the years there has been a cheapening of
human life,'' says Gerster, chairwoman of the anti-abortion Arizona
Right to Life and the past president of National Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think human life means as much anymore. You can see it
in children killing children and mass suicide. I don't think people
are concerned about their neighbors. I don't think people are
concerned about members of their own family. I don't think we are a
caring people anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Prolonging life _ quality life _ has become central to the
philosophy of this doctor, in practice now for 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   She lost an infant son to pneumonia, a grandfather to suicide, a
mother last year to cancer. She isn't in a mood to easily give
anyone else up to death. Anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: ``I get annoyed with people who are so sure that
somebody wants to take what little money I have away from me. I
just don't feel that way, and I don't worry about my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Westover, 80, has heard the argument about people being rushed
into premature death many times before. He is a past national
president of the Hemlock Society, which advocates people's right to
die as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: But you have a good family. What about other families?
A few years ago I had a patient who had a very treatable illness
and she was all for the treatment. Then she came in with her only
son and a daughter-in-law from hell. The daughter-in-law said,
``Who's going to take you to the oncologist all the time? Who is
going to do that? If you get sick, who's going to lift you? I can't
do any lifting. I don't have any time to drive you! '' It was the
most withering moment. I saw this woman shrink and say, ``I guess
not. I guess I won't have the treatment.'' That is the sort of
thing I see.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: If some families have problems, should that prevent me
from having what I need at the end of my life? Even if there are
some abuses _ and there will be abuses _ do they negate the basic
rights of individuals?
</P>
<P>
   We are coming to a greater respect for the individual and their
right to make decisions for themselves. We have gotten to the point
where you may stop a medical procedure, stop rescue workers from
coming in and breaking the bones of the elderly with unwanted
resuscitation. We are making progress, and it is directed toward
individual rights and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: You already have rights. You have the right to be
hospitalized or not; the right to get rid of your doctor; the right
to request or refuse treatment. But you don't have the right to
have someone else kill you. Suicide is the easiest thing in the
world; you don't have to commission someone else to kill you. My
grandfather did the same type of killing that Kevorkian does: he
went into the garage, turned on the motor of his car and killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors shouldn't be killers. Doctors should be healers.
Physician-assisted suicide, terminal sedation are all perversions
of medicine. Many physicians have tolerated third-party intrusion
and have allowed financial considerations above the life of a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   I mean the HMOs. The fact that you, as a doctor, no longer feel
responsible to your patient, but to the HMO. The HMO dictates when
you can see a specialist _ if you can see a specialist, when you
can have a mammogram, when you can see an oncologist. Woody Allen
once said, ``Death is a great way to save money.'' I'm afraid this
idea has pervaded the era of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: But in many instances the effect (of the medical
system) is to drag out the dying process _ lengthening death. The
fact that more people are going into hospice these days is good,
but in too many cases they go in within hours or days of dying.
That says to me that the doctors aren't letting go. Should
treatments continue when it is futile? I know of a 90-year-old man
dying of cancer who had a pacemaker installed. That's someone
wanting money.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Today, dying is less painful and it should be less
painful. It should be a time of reconciliation for the family.
Patients should be pain-free, which is within our capabilities.
Many doctors are woefully inadequate in this, but the technology is
out there.
</P>
<P>
   We have always had morphine. But there are advances in the ways
it can be introduced, (like with) morphine pumps implanted in the
body. Instead of destroying life we should destroy the conditions
that make death intolerable. When my mother died a year ago, we did
everything we could. In the end, she had no pain.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: In the transcripts of that End of Life Commission, I
read that there are 8 million people with cancer and 50 percent are
going to die in serious pain.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Unless they get good pain relief treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: But that kind of treatment is so rare.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Only 10 percent require higher technology. Many of the
90 percent are dying in pain needlessly because doctors don't
understand how to treat them with oral medications.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: But there are still some patients that cannot be made
pain-free short of putting them into unconsciousness. Isn't that
correct?
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I would say that 99 percent of pain could be
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: Most individuals, if they were assured that their pain
would be controlled, would not request an immediate end of life. We
are finding in Oregon and California and elsewhere that our Hemlock
members who have prescription drugs they know could kill them don't
use them. But having those drugs makes them feel that they are in
control, in case the pain became more than they could bear. But
they should have the right to be in control.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Gerster was asked if there are any cases where she
would see the value of physician-assisted suicide (where the
patient takes a pill or pulls a switch provided by a physician), or
terminal sedation (where the patient is fully sedated while such
life supports as food and water are withdrawn). (endital)
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: As I see it, terminal sedation is homicide. Some
doctors are using terminal sedation with people who have no pain.
It has slipped up on us very quietly. It's covert. At least with
physician-assisted suicide, people know what they are getting into.
</P>
<P>
   I had a patient recently who was concerned because her
father-in-law had been told he probably had six months to live. He
had mild pain but it was well controlled. Suddenly they started the
I.V. and he became sleepy. The next day when family members voiced
their concern about him, they were told that they were making him
comfortable. ``You agreed to make him comfortable, right? '' they
were asked. The next morning he was dead. It was only 36 hours
after the sedation began. I think this is happening more often.
When you start misinterpreting the law, as we are seeing happen
now, it can become very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: As a matter of fact, terminal sedation is recognized
by the AMA isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Not the inappropriate use of it. And this is something
really new in the way it's being used.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: The Supreme Court recognized it as appropriate for
relief of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: It is being used as an excuse to allow a person to die
very quickly. The terminally ill and chronically ill are unwanted,
expensive people. The drains on some of their families are
emotional and financial. No matter how much they might want to
live, they can be coerced.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are misdiagnoses. The ``Archives of Internal
Medicine'' this year reported that autopsies reveal significant
misdiagnosis in a third of cases. That can put someone on the fast
track to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, 70 percent of members of minority groups voted
against the physician-assisted suicide referendum. And among those
over 65 _ the people who would be most affected by it _ 63 percent
voted against it. The bill was popular among 30- and 40-year-olds
who felt invulnerable and probably sick and tired of caring for
their parents. The older people and minorities voted against
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: In Arizona, most of our Hemlock Society members are
over 65, well-educated with above-average incomes. We are talking
about mature adults who are near the end of life and they want to
end it on their terms. We believe this is the correct thing _ they
should be allowed to do it. They are not injuring anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I think people who don't want to live are by and large
depressed and should be treated for that. I think patients want to
be pain free and alert at the end. And this is absolutely
attainable.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: Pain is not always the issue. There are people who
want to end life. When they are terminal they want to speed the
process. They want to die on their terms and it is their right.
They should have assistance. Why shouldn't a doctor help?
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gulf between us is our attitude toward death. As a
physician, you see death mainly in medical terms. I see it more in
its societal and personal terms. Of course, you recognize the
impact of death on the family and community, but less on the
individual whose life is ending. I think it is the terminally ill
person's wishes which should be paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Pain management doesn't address suffering, severe dependence,
prolonged waiting and the financial drain, which is occasioned by
the terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final analysis, whose life is it? If a person has
reason to believe the six-month judgment is correct, and if they
want to shorten the period, I would see no reason why they
shouldn't have that right. It is the availability of a gentle,
dignified death which Hemlock members wish as a right for
themselves and for others.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) How will the issue shape up in the coming Arizona
legislative session? (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I think the right-to-life movement better get
legislation out there on the state level. I would like to see
legislation on physician education on pain relief, education of the
public that hospices exist and what care they are entitled to, and
guidelines on pain relief. I would like to see more of an
educational bill that reiterates what already is available.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: I have just reviewed a grant proposal submitted by the
Governor's Advisory Commission on End-of-Life Issues that looks
like a good proposal. What happens with that will influence
Hemlock's actions in the coming year in Arizona. We are cautious
though, as similar projects in other states have shown zero
improvement in end-of-life patient care. We aren't going to push
this coming year. Maybe in 2000 or 2002 if things don't work out
right, we would consider putting an initiative on the ballot, a
measure that would give people choice. One that will allow
terminally ill patients, with control, to get a prescription,
similar to what they have in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   What are your thoughts about your own death?
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I would like to have my family around me. I'd like time
to try to mend fences and have reconciliations. I'd like to be
alert and pain free, which is my right and easily attainable today.
I'd like to make peace with my God. I'd like to live as long and as
fully as I possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: My mother's family all came down with something
equivalent to Alzheimer's and had long, slow declines. I watched my
mother, who had been a very active, very artistic, very happy woman
go through years of decline. When Derek Humphrey announced the
formation of the Hemlock Society in 1980, I said, ``That is for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   My oldest brother reached up to a cabinet and dropped dead. That
was about as painless as you could possibly go. My next older
brother went through five years of medical treatment and he died
with some pain. I am not a soldier who wants to be shot on the
battlefield. I think a painless, easy-going death _ the soprano
hits the last high C and then out. I don't mind dying, but when I
do, I want it to be while my dignity is intact. &QL;

ROBERTSON URGES REPUBLICANS TO FORGE AHEAD WITH IMPEACHMENT
PROCEEDINGS 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans should shed their
timidity and forge ahead with impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson told
his followers Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are watching the office ennobled by Washington, Jefferson
and Lincoln become the playpen for the sexual freedom of the poster
child of the 1960s,'' Robertson told the gathering of the nation's
largest and arguably most influential group of conservative
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition, which has long been highly critical of
Clinton and the Democrats, has clearly been energized by the
president's problems, believing the scandal will push moral issues
to the forefront in the upcoming election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, mindful of polls showing fundamentalist Christians
more likely to vote, are paying attention to this constituency. A
number of top congressional leaders, including House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and House Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
addressed the Coalition but largely sidestepped the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson played directly to the group's visceral dislike of
the president, saying Clinton had ``mocked, demeaned, belittled,
and lied'' to America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is not Little
Rock on the Potomac. This is the people's house. As landlord of our
house it is time to say his lease is expired,'' said Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson said resignation was not a sufficient way to get
Clinton out of the White House. He said justice could only be
served if Congress went ahead with impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``While resignation might be easier for America, it's not better
for America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also chided some top congressional Republicans for not
being aggressive enough in moving against the president, accusing
them of ``sitting in the foxhole of political safety.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Robertson's scathing criticism was not enough for some
of those in attendance. He elicited scattered boos when he said
``we must be the first to forgive Bill Clinton the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Robertson compared Clinton unfavorably to predecessors
in the White House he did not mention that some of them had their
own scandals. Jefferson, whom Robertson said had ennobled the
presidency, was attacked during his tenure in office for having an
affair with his black slave.
</P>
<P>
   GOP congressional leaders maintained their policy of not
commenting directly about the president in regard to his affair
with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lott urged members to defeat Democratic senators who had refused
to vote to override President Clinton's veto on a bill banning
late- term abortion. On Friday the Senate fell three votes short of
overriding that veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the year that we can nail down a solid, pro-family,
pro-life majority in the United States Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich briefly referred to the scandal saying, ``We in the
House will do our duty. We won't do an inch more than our duty for
partisanship, and we won't do an an inch less than our duty out of
intimidation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Republican also defended House Judiciary Chairman
Henry Hyde, R-Ill, who this week acknowledged having an adulterous
affair 30 years ago after a liberal Internet magazine, Salon,
reported about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Henry's case, it's human and it's personal and he is a
decent, wonderful man and many of you have known him over the
years,'' said Gingrich, who urged the crowd to ``drop him a little
note and let him know that you share his pain and that you're sorry
that doing his duty leads to that kind of treatment by the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and other Republicans have accused the White House of
leaking information about Hyde's affair to news organization and
have asked the FBI to investigate. However, Salon editors have
denied that the White House supplied them with the information, and
Republicans have so far failed to come up with evidence linking the
Clinton administration to the story.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who attended the meeting, seemed more willing to
forgive Hyde's affair than the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong is wrong. It doesn't matter who did it. But I don't
think what he (Hyde) did cost us millions of dollars,'' said Pam
Elimore of Kinston, N.C., referring to the cost of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is involved in a court battle with the
Federal Elections Commission who charges that the group violated
its tax exempt status by aiding the 1992 Bush presidential effort
and other campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition has denied it broke any laws. Coalition president
Randy Tate said that the group will be engaged in the upcoming
election by distributing 45 million voters' guides on Nov. 1, just
a few days before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Tate warned that any candidate who is on the wrong side of the
morals issue ``will have a big problem on election day.'' &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARKSPUR, Colo. _ As an afternoon thunderstorm splashed their
pasture, a small herd of alpacas trotted toward shelter under the
overhanging roof of a nearby barn.
</P>
<P>
   Some, kids only a few weeks old, were about the size of large
dogs; others, full grown, stood nearly five feet tall with their
long necks erect. Their dense, velvety fleeces made up a
fashionable palette of earth tones _ white, tan, brown, gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Cleopatra,'' said Charles Stewart, presenting a female
with dark facial markings that look like too much eyeliner. ``This
is Summer Rain. She's due any day. And this is Vixen, and this is
Calliope.''
</P>
<P>
   The gentle animals milling sociably around Stewart seemed like
exotic pets, but, as a growing number of people are finding,
breeding alpacas can be a profitable business. Some of his animals,
Stewart said, are worth more than $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to do very much at this to make more than you
do at most jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 56, has been a rancher for less than five years. Just
three years ago, he quit a job as administrator of a medical clinic
to devote himself full time to his Colorado spread, 40 hilly acres
on the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains, about 50 miles south
of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Helen Stewart, a pediatrician, are among more
than 1,000 alpaca owners in the United States, where a growing
national herd now numbers about 15,000 head. Some of them keep the
animals mainly as pets or because their coats provide silky,
luxurious fiber for knitting or weaving. But increasing numbers of
alpaca owners are breeding them for profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very lucrative,'' Stewart said. ``The supply is very
low and the demand is high.''
</P>
<P>
   Distantly related to the camel and a smaller first cousin of the
South American llama, alpacas are native to Peru, Bolivia and
Chile. The animals were first imported commercially to the United
States in the early 1980s by American breeders looking to
capitalize on the alpacas' novelty. Alpaca wool _ unlike the
coarser fiber yielded by llama fleece _ has long been prized in
Europe as a luxurious fashion fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the fiber is still used mainly in
artisanal weaving and knitting, but alpaca owners have formed a
fiber cooperative with the goal of expanding the market for their
animals' fleece.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the most profitable aspect of commercial
alpaca husbandry in the United States is breeding the animals for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart sold 18 alpacas last year, 10 of them breeding-quality
females with an average price of $18,000, he said. His
breeding-quality males bring around $5,000 apiece. He paid an
average of $24,000 each for four pregnant females he bought this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Female alpacas, with a gestation period of about 335 days, can
bear one cria, or kid, a year. They remain fertile for 20 years or
more.
</P>
<P>
   Alpaca breeders can take advantage of the same tax benefits as
other livestock breeders, including five-year accelerated
depreciation of breeding animals, according to Stewart, who is
chairman of the marketing committee of the Alpaca Owners and
Breeders Association, in Estes Park, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The alpaca association has 1,550 members, up from 146 in 1991.
Stewart said about a quarter of them are ``wannabes'' who do not
own any animals yet, and most of the rest have fewer than 20
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely young industry,'' said Stewart, whose
marketing committee was formed last year to spread the word about
alpacas and their business possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Hobert, the association's business manager, said the
alpaca herd in the United States has grown steadily at better than
20 percent a year for the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alpaca is easy to take care of,'' Hobert said from his
office in Estes Park. ``It's good for children; it makes for a good
life-style situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many alpaca owners start off small, with just a few animals.
``They begin breeding their herd,'' Hobert said. ``Then they begin
marketing to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is by word of mouth or on the Internet. Breeders
can advertise in Alpacas, the association's quarterly magazine (the
summer issue carried more than 120 ads), and some show their
animals in the growing number of alpaca exhibitions around the
country, many mounted in conjunction with llama shows.
</P>
<P>
   Like purebred horses, most alpacas have pedigrees that can
increase the animals' value for breeders. As of July 3, Alpaca
Registry Inc., a private, industry-supported organization, had
registered 16,846 live alpacas in the United States and Canada,
about eight times as many as in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Before newborn alpacas can be registered, their pedigreed
lineage must be confirmed by blood typing. Imported alpacas are
screened for physical characteristics, health and fiber quality.
The registry accepted 650 animals for registration in 1997,
rejecting 170. As of July 1 of this year, 1,016 animals had been
registered.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this year, the registry will stop registering
newly imported alpacas, mainly because some owners worry that an
increase in supply will erode the value of their herds. The
decision was taken by the 1,600 alpaca owners who are members of
the registry.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a fourth of the association members who took part
in the vote opposed the move, arguing that some alpaca strains were
not yet numerous enough in the United States to provide adequate
gene pools for good selective breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Guidry, a member of the registry's board of directors,
predicted that importers would continue to bring in alpacas, even
if they were not permitted to register them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``The importers have said to us there is no way they're going to
stop,'' she said, and some breeders are concerned that a rival
registry might be created for animals imported after this year. Ms.
Guidry estimated that 98 percent of all alpacas in the United
States are registered.
</P>
<P>
   A similar registry for llamas, which are popular as pack animals
throughout the Rocky Mountains, has not worked well. Only about
half of the nation's llama herd, now estimated to be about 200,000
head, is registered.
</P>
<P>
   As the llama population in the United States has grown, prices
for the animals have fallen, although a top-quality breeding llama
might still be worth several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Alpaca industry officials say careful breeding practices,
registration and the animals' relative scarcity have helped keep
alpaca prices up. But many owners say that it is the high quality
of alpaca wool that will preserve the animals' commercial value
after their novelty wears off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're breeding toward, to get that fine fiber and
to be able to market fine garments from that,'' said Gordon
Anderson, president of the alpaca breeders association. He said
increasing numbers of alpaca owners operate stores to sell products
made of alpaca wool.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and his wife, Carolyn, have 17 alpacas on their ranch
in Mossyrock, Wash., in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains
south of Seattle and weave the animals' wool into designer rugs. He
said the five-year-old business had annual sales of about $90,000,
including rugs and livestock, and had been profitable since 1996.
Alpaca enthusiasts say the fiber is stronger, lighter, warmer and
softer than wool.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's possible to make an absolutely beautiful garment just
using natural colors,'' said Rachel Hendrickson, chairwoman of the
alpaca association's fiber committee. She said American fashion
houses were beginning to take an interest in alpaca.
</P>
<P>
   The American alpaca industry cannot yet produce enough fiber to
supply a major garment maker. But a step in that direction was the
formation of the Alpaca Fiber Cooperative of North America, which
was incorporated in January and has 400 members. The cooperative is
currently collecting fleece from its members and preparing to ship
it this fall to a mill in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really no mills of any size in the United States
that can process alpaca fiber from A to Z,'' said Russell Grattan,
president of the cooperative. ``The mill we're working with in Peru
has been processing alpaca fiber for 95 years.'' The cooperative
plans to send at least 20,000 pounds of fiber, then bring it back
as yarn and finished products like blankets, scarves and rugs. Some
of the goods will be returned to members, and the rest will be
marketed by the cooperative, Grattan said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest alpaca ranch in the United States, the 100-acre
Alpacas of America in Arlington, Wash., has a herd that fluctuates
between 900 and 1,300 head. It has sold more than 500 animals so
far this year, at $12,500 to around $50,000 a head, Randal P. Snow,
the ranch's business manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredibly profitable,'' Snow said, though he declined to
reveal earnings figures.
</P>
<P>
   Small-scale breeders can also make good money, Snow said. And
that is what Tony and Mindy Simon and Vivian Goldstein, Ms. Simon's
mother, are aiming to do with a 19-head alpaca herd they have built
up on a ranch near Longmont, Colo. They now have three pregnant
females and two recently weaned females for sale at prices ranging
from $14,000 to $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those sales would pay off the family's investment in alpacas,
Ms. Simon said. ``So starting next year would be pretty much pure
profit,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Simons, 30, first encountered alpacas in 1994 at a wool
market in Estes Park. ``I went in the alpaca stand and fell in love
with the alpacas,'' she said. The Simons and Ms. Goldstein bought
their first four animals in 1994 and their ranch in 1996. Last
spring, Ms. Simon quit her computer programming job in nearby
Boulder to devote full time to the alpaca business.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 32, who is also a programmer, said he hoped that the
alpaca business would become profitable enough that he too could
leave his job at IBM in Boulder to spend full time on the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be here than at work _ it's a labor of love,'' he
said. ``I would do it in a heartbeat.''

FRENZIED DEMONSTRATORS IN IRAN DENOUNCE TALIBAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ To shouts of ``Death to Taliban!'' and the wail
of a Shiite dirge, tens of thousands of people thronged the streets
of Tehran in protest on Friday as the bodies of six slain Iranian
diplomats were borne toward martyrs' graves.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration was the largest and angriest since the killing
of diplomats touched off a crisis between Iran and Afghanistan's
militant Taliban movement, and it was mirrored on a smaller scale
in other rallies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   One of Iran's most senior clerics declared the country ``ready
for holy war'' against the Taliban, followers of a rival Muslim
faith. But even as Iranians shouted similar slogans as they marched
along crowded streets, there were signs that international
mediation might help to cool the passions.
</P>
<P>
   In response to an Iranian request for intervention, Pakistan's
foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz, announced Friday that the Taliban
movement would soon free some of the Iranian prisoners whose return
has been demanded by the Tehran government as a condition for
averting possible military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Iranian officials said President Mohammed
Khatami would press hard for a more active U.N. role in resolving
the dispute when he visits New York next week to address the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Iran has continued to add to a buildup of military forces
along the Afghan border, where it has said that more than 250,000
soldiers will be in place by Saturday to take part in a new round
of threatening military exercises. Such a force would represent
half of Iran's known troop strength.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats have suggested that the number of troops is
almost certainly being exaggerated, and journalists have been
denied permission to travel anywhere near the Iran-Afghan border.
But the exercises, to include troops backed by tanks, aircraft and
artillery, are nevertheless expected to serve as a major projection
of military muscle that would underscore the anti-Taliban fervor on
display in Friday's demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, issued a
statement in Afghanistan saying the problems between the two
countries ``will not be solved under military pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taliban commanders have responded to the Iranian buildup
with a military buildup of their own, and they have vowed to
retaliate against targets inside Iran if Iranian forces begin any
kind of cross-border raids.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has vowed to avenge the deaths of the eight diplomats and a
journalist who were killed last month when Taliban forces overran
an Iranian consulate in the northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif.
It has also said military intervention may be necessary to halt
what it has portrayed as the slaughter of fellow Shiite Muslims at
the hands of the Taliban, purist followers of Islam's dominant
Sunni faith.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian officials have insisted that they have little appetite
for conflict. ``We are in no rush to fight, and we are definitely
not willing to start now,'' Mohsen Aminzadeh, the deputy foreign
minister for South Asian affairs, said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats and Iranian experts say it is unlikely that
Iran, with its bitter memories of the 1980-88 war with Iraq, might
launch a major invasion of Afghanistan that would risk prolonged
military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But unless others can persuade the Taliban to meet a long list
of Iranian demands, Western diplomats say they believe it remains
possible that Iran might carry out some kind of limited military
attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With measures including the funeral procession that began after
Friday prayers, Iran has also clearly tried to keep emotions at a
high pitch. Along with his declaration that the country was
prepared for holy war against the Taliban, Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati
used his sermon at Tehran University to cite the long war against
Iraq as evidence of ``our stability and strength.''
</P>
<P>
   In the chaotic scene that followed the prayers, the dead
Iranians' coffins were paraded through streets in which the
jostling was so severe that the coffins on several occasions were
almost toppled to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were later loaded into ambulances for the rest of
the journey to a special cemetery outside Tehran already filled
with the bodies of scores of thousands of Iranians killed in the
war with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   On the street, anti-Taliban emotions ran so high that many
Iranians who said relatives had been killed in Iran's last war said
they believed the killings committed in Afghanistan could well
justify another conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything for Islam, and what the Taliban is doing is
against Islam,'' said Shireen Saidpour, a 35-year-old government
employee, who like most women taking part in the demonstration wore
a shapeless black chador. ``They are criminals.''

ADVISORY BOARD ON RACIAL RECONCILIATION FINISHES WORK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An advisory board on President Clinton's racial
reconciliation initiative ended its work Friday with officials
defending the panel's work and endorsing many White House policies.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials tried to bolster the board's
recommendations by announcing the Small Business Administration
would dedicate $1 billion in loans for women and minorities and by
producing another report showing race is often a key predictor of
economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make no apologies for what we have not done. There are
limits to what one can do and what one can achieve in 15 months.
After all we have been working on problems that began with the very
first settlement of our country in the 15th century,'' said John
Hope Franklin, the former Duke University legal history professor.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin chaired the seven-member Advisory Board to the
President's Initiative on Race, a unwieldy title for a panel whose
efforts drew a rash of criticism for lacking direction.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced in June 1997 that he would to create
a yearlong dialogue on race and wanted the panel to identify areas
that helped and hindered racial reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accepted the board's report from Franklin at a ceremony
attended by civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks.
</P>
<P>
   The president praised the panel and its staff for ``straining
their imaginations and finding the energy to take on this
tremendous task of focusing the nation's attention on building one
America for a new century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, this has meant enduring criticism, some of it perhaps
justified, some of it I have questioned because, as Dr. Franklin
said, no one could solve this problem in 15 months since it has not
been resolved in all of human history ... Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The board's report recapped information gleaned by the panel in
a series of town hall meetings, including two attended by the
president. Clinton personally directed one discussion group in Ohio
which was criticized for lacking candid exchanges and he
participated in a forum on sports hosted by ESPN in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a nation need to understand that whites tend to benefit,
either unknowingly or consciously, from this country's history of
white privilege,'' the board's report said.
</P>
<P>
   Among proposals, the board:
</P>
<P>
   Supported Clinton's ``mend it, don't end it'' policy on
affirmative action and called for more study.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed creation of a permanent presidential panel to promote
racial and ethnic harmony and dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Flagged for study police misconduct involving minorities,
stereotyping in media, federal employment, bilingual education,
access to technology and conflicts between non-white ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighted racial profiling, in which police use race to
identify potential criminals. It is employed most often in traffic
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Urged Clinton to reduce the disparity in sentences for crimes
involving powdered cocaine and its concentrated form, crack. The
board said longer sentences for crack crimes, largely involving
poor blacks or Hispanics, are ``morally and intellectually
indefensible.'' &QL;

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS JOIN FORCES TO AVERT A FLURRY OF EXTRAMARITAL
``OUTINGS.''
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The heads of the Senate Democratic and Republican
campaign committees Friday joined their House counterparts in
vowing to cut off financial support to any candidate who launches a
personal attack on an opponent this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., exchanged
the vows on the floor of the Senate less than 24 hours after House
campaign leaders, stung by embarrassing disclosures of an
extramarital affair by House Judiciary Committee Henry Hyde, made a
similar pact.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan effort appeared to be an attempt by Congress to
head off what some members fear could be a flurry of ``outings'' of
lawmakers who have had extramarital affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digging through their record is one thing, digging through
their garbage is quite another,'' said McConnell. ``Criticizing
someone for their vote on the marriage tax is fair game. Attacking
someone for a failed marriage certainly is not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern,'' said Kerrey, ``...is that if we do not exercise
restraint and show American citizens that we will not fund
candidates who use personal problems or past failures to win their
office, the institutions of democracy will suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said ``something that happened 30 years ago or 40 years
ago or 20 years ago ... is irrelevant'' to a political campaign,
especially when the offender has ``dealt with their family and
their friends and their God.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. John Linder, R-Ga., and Martin Frost, D-Texas, who chair
their party's campaign committees in the House, had similar
comments Thursday after the Internet magazine, Salon, reported on
an affair Hyde had 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisanship in the House and the Senate and the
abhorrence of sexual topics came as a sharp contrast to the process
enveloping President Clinton. In a party-line split, the House
Judiciary Committee voted Friday to release more materials from
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's investigation of the
president's 18-month affair with onetime White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have the leaders of the opposing parties in Congress made
such agreements as those reached by McConnell and Kerrey in the
Senate and Linder and Frost in the Senate. The last such occasion
was in 1990 when the leaders agreed to cut off campaign funds to
any opponent of an incumbent who had voted for a controversial pay
raise.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign committees of both parties and the funds they
control are often vital to congressional challengers who rarely
have as much money for their campaigns as incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   But the pact also reflected concern within Congress that the
public believes it is filled with a high number of philanderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start to spend $40 million investigating the lives of
members of Congress, you'll see a stampede across the Potomac
River,'' said Guillermo Galindo, a Latino activist in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not reluctant or shy to have full contact sport when it
comes to campaigns, but I do believe that the ultimate objective of
the candidate needs to be to not just acquire the office, but also
to serve the larger good of preserving our Democratic institutions
_ in this case the U.S. Congress,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in this body knows that I believe in robust, pointed,
hard-hitting campaigns,'' said McConnell. ``And I believe those
kinds of campaigns are good for our democracy and good for the
voters, but only when political campaigns are focused on issues and
not on purely private behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But declining voter turnout and polling data suggest that
presidential and congressional campaigns are increasingly
distasteful to Americans because of their personal attacks and lack
of substantive discussions of issues.
</P>
<P>
   The White House denies it is behind the recent disclosures about
Hyde and two other Republicans who, in response to press inquiries,
acknowledged extramarital affairs: Reps. Dan Burton of Indiana and
Helen Chenoweth of Idaho.

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE CALLS VIDEOTAPE VOTE PARTISAN AND UNFAIR
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration lashed out Friday at
House Republicans for voting to release a videotape of the
president's grand jury testimony, calling the move a raw political
act designed to further tarnish the embattled leader.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said President Clinton remained determined to reject calls
for his resignation, even as the nation braced for the
unprecedented spectacle of watching its chief executive fume and
squirm under more than four hours of interrogation centered on the
excruciatingly intimate details of his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appears to be a rush to prejudgment and an effort to get
out salacious and explicit material at the speed of light, not the
pace of justice,'' Jim Kennedy, spokesman for the office of White
House Counsel Charles Ruff, said in a prepared statement. ''But
ultimately it will be up to the American people to decide whether
this process has been fair or simply a partisan effort to embarrass
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Friday's decision was
poisoned by partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had been our hope that this process would be bipartisan and
fair,'' Toiv said at a White House briefing. ''Today's action was
neither.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not comment on Friday's vote, though he said at a
news conference Wednesday that the matter was out of his hands and
he would not be surprised by a Republican decision to release the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape is to be aired starting at 9 a.m. EDT Monday, one
hour before Clinton is scheduled to address heads of state from
around the world at the United Nations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Several television networks have announced plans to broadcast
Clinton's taped testimony just as he prepares to address the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is going to deliver the speech that he is
planning on giving,'' said Toiv. ''He will represent this country
at the U.N., and he will undoubtedly do it with distinction, and it
(release of the videotape) will not have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to predict the effect the videotape
might have on public opinion, though some analysts speculated that
the move could backfire against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how seeing Clinton in this setting could alter
the situation much,'' said Thomas Mann, director of governmental
studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington research center.
''It might heighten the public's reaction against those who are
forcing the public to confront all this.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of being dragged through a scandal revolving around
sex, lies and, now, videotape, said Mann, many Americans may decide
to simply tune out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The safest bet,'' he said, ''would be that the impact of the
release, on the public, as opposed to on Washington, will be
substantially less than anticipated.''

GREENPEACE ENDS OCCUPATION OF TEXAS OFFICES IN MEXICO CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A dozen anti-nuclear demonstrators declared their
mission accomplished Friday and ended their 30-hour occupation of
the Texas State Government Office here.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters from Greenpeace entered the office Thursday
morning to denounce the proposed low-level nuclear waste dump
scheduled to be built at Sierra Blanca in the West Texas desert,
near the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a very good reaction in the United States from
various anti-nuclear organizations and have gotten widespread
coverage here in Mexico,'' demonstration leader Alejandro Calvillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. organizations like the Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund and
the Nuclear Information and Resource Service have begun campaigns
of faxed messages to the Texas offices of Gov. George W. Bush in
support of the Greenpeace protest, Calvillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was targeted by the protesters for his perceived advocacy
of the nuclear-waste dump.
</P>
<P>
   Although the proposed site is in one of the most desolate parts
of the United States, opponents of the waste site on both sides of
the border worry its proximity to underground aquifers feeding the
Rio Grande could pollute water supplies for millions of people in
South Texas and northern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said dump opponents like
Greenpeace frequently downplayed his oft-repeated concerns for the
safety and integrity of any nuclear-waste facility in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``His position is that if it isn't safe, it won't be built,''
Edwards said by telephone from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca is a project approved under former Gov. Ann
Richards and bequeathed to Bush, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will rely on scientists to help determine the safety and
feasibility of the Sierra Blanca site, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is currently
studying permits for Sierra Blanca.
</P>
<P>
   Few here in Mexico support the proposed dump site. The
Secretariat of Foreign Relations has sent diplomatic notes to the
U.S. government outlining the Mexican government's concern and
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that Bush has stated his concerns, but at the same
time he continues support the project, the site and the pact,''
Calvillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The pact is an agreement among Maine, Vermont and Texas
providing that once an adequate site is located and built in Texas,
low-level nuclear waste from the other two states will be shipped
there for storage, Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than two years of determined opposition from a
broad spectrum of Mexican politicians and non-governmental
organizations, Bush has done nothing to seek another site, Calvillo
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been sensitive to Mexican feelings, he would have
proposed an alternative, but he hasn't,'' he said.

ECONOMISTS DEBATE HOW TO PROTECT EUROPE FROM GLOBAL FINANCIAL
CHAOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ As dismal news accumulates around the globe, European
economies are proving remarkably resilient. But evidence is
multiplying that the Continent's two-year-old recovery is at risk,
fueling debate about how to shield Europe from the effects of
turmoil elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   With exports to Asia, South America and Russia flagging,
corporate profits are under growing pressure. In Britain, two major
semiconductor manufacturers, Japan's Fujitsu and Germany's Siemens,
announced plans to close factories, citing cheap imports from Asian
countries where currencies have collapsed. In Germany, national
elections later this month have markets unnerved by the
possibility, for the first time in 16 years, that a Socialist-led
government might be returned to power.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, head of the new European Central Bank,
acknowledged this week that international financial turmoil would
have a ``dampening effect'' on global growth, and that Europe would
not be spared. Several major banks and brokerages have already
trimmed their European growth projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd gladly be an isle of the blessed,'' said Werner Becker,
senior economist at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt. ``But
we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Europe is expected to sustain reasonable growth. While
Becker is among a number of economists calling attention to the
region's vulnerability, even he sees no major crisis brewing. He
recently predicted that growth for the 11 countries that will adopt
the euro on Jan. 1 should be around 2.6 percent for next year,
scaling back modestly from his earlier prediction of 3.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe will not escape unscathed from the turmoil raging in
Asia and Latin America, and there is fear that things will get
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contagion effect poses a considerable risk for Western
Europe,'' Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, J. Paul Horne, European equity market economist at
Salomon Smith Barney in London, trimmed his European growth
forecast for 1999, to 2.6 percent from 3.2 percent. For Britain, he
projects under 1 percent growth and calls a recession a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unsettling, Becker said, is the slowdown in
Britain, which buys roughly 20 percent of the goods and services
exported by Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Other leading countries, like Germany, are heavily exposed in
Eastern Europe. Though Russia accounts for a mere 2 percent of
German trade, Central European countries like Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic now absorb fully 10 percent of German exports,
more than the United States. Thus, any spillover of the collapse of
Russia's already weak economy into Central Europe would indirectly
hurt Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by many measures, Europe is in enviable shape.
</P>
<P>
   Though Britain may be on the brink of recession, other leading
countries, like France, Germany and Spain, still show robust
growth. Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, has signaled that
it continues to see inflation as a threat, and officials from other
nations have played down the possibility of quick action on
interest rates or other responses to the global economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Bundesbank, in its September monthly report,
depicted Europe's economies as havens of calm and stability amid
the turmoil disrupting many of the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Duisenberg said that broad indicators showed Europe can expect
to be still on track, with ``continued expansion in the second
quarter, albeit at a possibly more moderate pace'' than in the
first. Taken together, the data showed inflation growing in Spain,
Portugal and Ireland, and an unaccustomed shift in France and
Germany, where domestic consumption, rather than exports, fueled
growth and progress was made in job creation. In the first eight
months of 1998, 320,000 people were taken off Germany's jobless
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   European markets have revived since hitting lows in early
September, and business investment is expected to get a further
lift after the euro is introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the four or five channels of transmission
between emerging markets and Western Europe, then the real effects
have been pretty moderate,'' said Eric Barthalon, chief economist
at Paribas in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Trade among the 11 euro-zone countries is so extensive, he said,
that trade with the rest of the world now accounts for only about
11 percent of the region's total gross domestic product, less than
the share in the similarly sized United States, where it is about
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, falling prices for commodities, like oil, benefit
European manufacturers, and the collapse of stock markets in Asia,
Latin America and Eastern Europe has bolstered Europe financially,
by attracting capital in a ``flight to quality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in the United States, European personal and corporate
indebtedness has not grown substantially in recent years, and
because Europeans invest in stocks at a lower rate than Americans,
less money was drained from the pockets of European consumers by
this summer's global market decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident domestic demand will remain strong,'' Horne
said.
</P>
<P>
   One significant problem for Europe is the weakening of the
dollar against European currencies, which makes products sold to
the United States more expensive. And while a weakened dollar
tended in the past to drag fragile European currencies like the
Italian lira down with it, the euro agreement reached last May has
forced the dollar to move more or less uniformly against all 11
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in several European countries, echoing President
Clinton's appeal earlier this week, are raising their voices for
some kind of concerted push to contain the fast-spreading global
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been canvassing leaders of
the Group of Seven industrial nations for proposals. In Italy,
Prime Minister Romano Prodi, addressing parliament on Wednesday,
said the seven must find a ``common neo-Keynesian or expansion
policy to stimulate the economy'' in response to the world's
problems. Both leaders are scheduled to meet with President Clinton
in New York on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While Prodi appeared to be calling for lower interest rates,
European central bankers _ like U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan _ are clearly not yet ready to act.
</P>
<P>
   Many European economists are not convinced a rate cut is even
necessary. Europe's long road to acceptance of the euro, which
required governments in the 11 subscribing countries to rein in
their fiscal policies, has had a lingering effect akin to monetary
easing, from which Europe's economy will continue to benefit for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jan. 1 adoption of the euro by the 11, the new European
Central Bank must set a Europe-wide ``convergence rate'' for
short-term interest rates, and a growing number of economists
believe it will be pegged to the Bundesbank's current short-term
rate of 3.3 percent. Germany and neighboring countries with low
interest rates will ``doubtless play a type of benchmark role'' in
setting interest rates for all of Europe, Hans Tietmeyer, the
Bundesbank president, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tietmeyer said that despite economic turmoil in Asia and Russia,
Europe's economy has ``remained relatively robust _ at least so
far.''

   All adaptive equipment for people with disabilities is
considered specialty equipment, but within this category are the
specialty's specialties. If most automotive adaptive equipment
helps people get into and drive vehicles, these devices help make
that experience more pleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Any occupant is considered best off riding in a conventional car
seat designed with safety and visibility in mind. In fact, sitting
in a regular car seat is considered so important that many makers
of adaptive devices have included electrically controlled seats to
their inventory to help people with limited mobility make the shift
from wheelchair to car seat.
</P>
<P>
   These seats not only move back and forth, as all car seats do,
they also move up and down and rotate.
</P>
<P>
   Some people with disabilities may want the off-road capability
of a truck or sport utility vehicle. But since most trucks are
higher than are cars, a user who might be able to stow a wheelchair
in a car, might not be able to lift it the extra height into a
truck.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno Independent Living Aids Inc. of Oconomowoc, Wis., has
developed special lifts for trucks. Its Curb-Sider moves the
driver's seat outward and downward to aid access. The company's
Cab-Sider, developed with the cooperation of GM, raises wheelchairs
and stows them inside extended-cab trucks with three or four doors.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have developed devices that alert people to
auditory signals even if they are deaf or hard of hearing. For
instance, Ears _ early alert response system _ from Harc Mercantile
of Kalamazoo, Mich., translates the sounds of emergency vehicles
into lights that are displayed on the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   It not only alerts drivers that an emergency vehicle is
approaching, it can identify what sort of vehicle it is. &QL;

SENATE FAILES TO OVERRIDE 2D CLINTON ABORTION BILL VETO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Friday failed for the second time to
override President Clinton's veto of a ban on a controversial
procedure called partial-birth abortion. Proponents vowed to take
the issue to the voters in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dug to the foundation of our ability to turn votes of
those who are in office,'' said Senator Rick Santorum, the
Pennsylvania Republican and sponsor of the ban. ``The future of
this really lies in the American public and what they do in the
next election.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Senator Bob Smith, the New Hampshire Republican and an
advocate of abolishing all abortions, ``I know there have been a
lot of prayers. Those prayers will be answered in early November.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the proximity of the November elections and an
aggressive lobbying campaign by supporters of the ban, not a single
senator switched position on the issue Friday. The Senate voted,
64-36, falling three votes short of the two-thirds needed to
override Clinton's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen Democrats joined 51 Republicans in voting to override.
Four Republicans, all from New England, voted against the ban with
32 Democrats. The House in July voted to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the 12 New England senators voted to override _ Smith
and Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican, and Patrick Leahy,
the Vermont Democrat. Opposing the prohibition, and voting against
the override, were Massachusetts Senators Edward M. Kennedy and
John F. Kerry; John Chafee, the Rhode Island Republican; Jack Reed,
the Rhode Island Democrat; Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, the
Maine Republicans; Jim Jeffords, the Vermont Republican; and
Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman, the Connecticut Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's vote coincided with the national meeting in Washington
of the Christian Coalition, which ran radio ads against the two
Maine senators and others in an unsuccessful effort to persuade
them to change their positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have imposed fines and prison terms on any
physician who performed the procedure. It also allowed the father
of the fetus or parents of a pregnant minor to sue the doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Although the procedure is distasteful, opponents of the ban say
it is sometimes the safest way to end pregnancies of deformed
fetuses to protect the future fertility of the pregnant woman.
Supporters of the ban say it is never medically necessary. A
last-minute compromise by a bipartisan group that included Snowe
and Collins was unable to bridge the gap. The proposed compromise
would have banned all abortions after viability except those needed
to protect the life or health of the pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vetoed the bill in 1997, but House leaders waited nine
months to schedule the override vote during an election year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of movement in the Senate on the issue,
lobbying picked up this week. Religious leaders, including Anthony
Bevilaqua, the Roman Catholic cardinal from Philadelphia, watched
Friday's vote from the visitor's gallery. Several women who have
undergone the procedure worked with abortion-rights supporters in
talking to senators about the implications of a prohibition. Some
of these women appeared with Clinton when he vetoed the bill. They
said the procedure saved their lives and their ability to have
healthy babies.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the ban said overriding the veto would have set a
dangerous precedent by outlawing a specific medical procedure and
would have undermined a woman's right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``These legislators affirmed today that the campaign of
deception that has been promulgated by the religious right, a
campaign that seeks to outlaw abortion for American women, is
dangerous to women's health and is out of step with mainstream
America,'' said Vicki Saporta, director of the National Abortion
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   But those who back the ban vowed to keep up their campaign to
outlaw the practice and bring the issue up again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will inevitably pass,'' Santorum said after the
vote. ``The veto will be overridden, and the will of the American
people will be heard on this issue of infanticide.''

 &HT;    HASTINGS SEES PARALLELS BETWEEN HIS IMPEACHMENT, CLINTON CASE
 &HT;    With HASTINGS-STARR.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Impeachment. Rep. Alcee Hastings has been there,
done that.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hastings, D-Fla., the only House member to be
impeached and removed from office _ thrust himself into the
controversy surrounding President Clinton by calling for the
impeachment and removal of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   There is much anger left in Hastings about his impeachment as a
federal judge, and it boiled over as he talked with reporters about
the parallels he sees between his experience and that facing
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings is incensed at what he considers the prosecutorial
misconduct he faced in 1988 and Clinton is facing now. And he's
disappointed that the bipartisanship that existed then has now
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastings said he doesn't ``have any deja vu feelings. My
having been impeached and removed is not a part of my
consideration, other than the facts of my enormous experience that
I have in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago the House impeached Hastings on charges of
participating in a $150,000 bribery conspiracy, despite his
acquittal on similar criminal charges. A year later, the Senate
removed him from his lifetime appointment. He was first elected to
the House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings has not discussed his impeachment with Clinton, nor
would he offer advice now unless asked, he said. But he chided
Clinton for testifying before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would have told Clinton: ``You're a high-profile
person that may be charged with a crime, and you're going into a
prosecutor's playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years leading to his removal as a judge, Hastings fought
the legal processes used to bring him to that point _ including the
fact that his impeachment was recommended by a judicial panel, the
manner in which the House Judiciary Committee conducted its
proceedings and the Senate's decision to have his case heard by a
12-member select committee, rather than the full body, before
voting.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a replay of what he characterized as prosecutorial
misconduct in his case and the one Starr has developed against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenneth Starr has usurped our powers, and I refuse to be a
member of this body _ having had it happen to me _ where people
were looking on and saying 'it's all right for a prosecutor to do
something wrong because somebody else did something wrong.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh-uh. No. I can't stay here and let that happen. ...I've been
in that 'it's all right for a prosecutor to do wrong process,' and
it's not a good thing for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The other parallel that upsets Hastings is the manner in which
the impeachment proceedings developed against him and appear to be
developing against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Congress was presented with lengthy detailed
cases _ developed by a panel of judges in Hastings' case and
prepared by Starr's office in Clinton's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is something inherently unfair with Congress
giving up its powers ...to judges ...(and to) the independent
counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it should be Congress's responsibility to determine the
grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   One major difference Hastings sees between his experience and
Clinton's is today's charged partisan atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that John Conyers in the majority, and Henry Hyde in
the minority, worked more cooperatively to achieve whatever it is
they achieved,'' Hastings said of the two Judiciary Committee
leaders who have switched places since the Republicans took control
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the end result, but I believe they worked well
together to try to achieve that. This thing has jumped off in
partisan rancor. We're bickering and fighting. ... We're not acting
with decorum. We're not acting in a civil manner toward each other.
We're personalizing, threatening. It's not good.''

<P>
   People with physical disabilities spend their days overcoming
barriers. Like the able-bodied, many with disabilities find that
using a private vehicle is the essence of personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   So when disabled people shop for a vehicle, they need one that
can accommodate their mobility devices as well as themselves. The
vehicle may also need to be altered for special equipment, like
zero-effort steering mechanisms or touch-pad controls, so a
flexible design is important.
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Bussani, shop manager for J. Bussani Inc., of Bethpage,
N.Y., which equips vehicles with special gear, said that only about
half the people with adapted vehicles drive. As passengers, the
others, including children and severely disabled adults, may have
other special needs.
</P>
<P>
   While the range of vehicles acceptable to people with
disabilities remains somewhat limited, the group's needs are being
met better today than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   There may be fewer two-door cars on the market _ the wider doors
of coupes make it easier to load and unload wheelchairs _ but the
doors are lighter on those that remain.
</P>
<P>
   Extended cabs with three and four doors, coupled with wheelchair
lifts, have made the pickup truck a reasonable alternative to the
car. And a wide selection of vans is available to companies that do
customizing. Even sport utility vehicles can be valid choices
because new models like the Subaru Forester are lower to the ground
and easier to enter.
</P>
<P>
   With any vehicle, disabled drivers have to consider the
elevation of the seat, the distance from the ground to the door
sill and the angle of the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Some 450 conversion companies modify up to 20,000 vehicles a
year for private use, according to Becky Plank, executive director
of the National Mobility Equipment Dealers Association in Tampa,
Fla. These adaptations not only make it easier for people with
impaired mobility to get in and out of cars, trucks and vans, they
also make driving possible for amputees, sufferers of severe
arthritis and the hearing-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Census Bureau, 4 percent of Americans aged 17
to 75 _ some 7.3 million people _ have physical disabilities that
limit their mobility. About half these people use wheelchairs,
scooters or other mobility devices, according to Jack MacNeil of
the bureau's disabilities data unit.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers seem to be taking the market seriously. The leading
manufacturers offer some incentives and cash-back programs to help
with what can be costly modifications. These programs do not fully
pay for the most extensive modifications, nor do they pay for
retrofitting older vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   They do provide buyers of new vehicles as much as $1,000 to
cover minor changes _ a fraction of the tens of thousands of
dollars that could be required, say, to convert a van for a
wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, health insurance may cover part of the costs, and
financial aid may be available from a variety of organizations and
government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The key to selecting a vehicle is how well it meets one's needs,
or can be modified. Most hospitals for physical rehabilitation
provide evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Linden, who conducts evaluations at the Helen Hayes
Hospital in West Haverstraw, N.Y., said the first consideration was
whether a person can move into a car's seat without wheelchair
assistance. ``If people can transfer independently and load their
chair, then they can drive a regular car,'' she said. ``If not, can
they transfer into the seat of a van?''
</P>
<P>
   The next consideration, she said, is ``if a standard car is
acceptable, are the doors wide enough to load a wheelchair into the
back seat?''
</P>
<P>
   For most disabled drivers and those who transport disabled
children, vans are the vehicles of choice. Those using power
wheelchairs, which are much larger than manual chairs, usually need
the extra room of a full-size van like the Chevrolet Express, Ford
Club Wagon or Dodge Ram Wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The choice may depend on how easily the van can be modified to
accept a wheelchair or other device. Many full-sized vans cannot be
easily adapted because their rear-wheel-drive configuration makes
it impossible to lower the floor for easy access.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lift or a ramp could be added, the roof must often be
raised to add sufficient headroom. Vision is also often restricted
because a wheelchair tends to be higher than a conventional van
seat.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several conversion companies registered a preference
for Ford's big van, saying it was easiest to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ford's full-size vans, particularly the E-150, can be easily
modified,'' Bussani said. ``Modified mini-vans are growing in
popularity, in part because they cost less while offering many
options and many possibilities for customizing.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``But they also have limitations,'' he added. ``They are less
roomy, but since nearly all have front-wheel drive, they can be
fitted with a lowered floor, necessary for people who use
wheelchairs and scooters.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dwain Nunn, chief operations officer for Independent Mobility
Systems, a van-conversion company, said that although the Ford
Windstar is a bit less roomy than a full-size, rear-drive van, it
is favored by many.
</P>
<P>
   Nunn said converters will generally not use an import because
they are less roomy. But this may change. The 1998 Toyota Sienna is
nearly as large as the domestic mini-vans are, and the new Honda
Odyssey is even bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Nebenzahl of Jupiter, Fla., said her family chose a
Chrysler Town and Country mini-van because it was easier to drive
and park. ``Although it is costly to purchase and convert a
mini-van for a disabled person, it has become a huge asset to me
and my family,'' said Ms. Nebenzahl, 37, who has spina bifida. The
alternative was to buy a conventional van with a raised roof.
</P>
<P>
   Her mini-van has a lowered floor and wheelchair ramp. After
opening the sliding door with a remote control or a switch, the van
``kneels'' and the ramp automatically comes down. Once inside, the
wheelchair is secured by a locking system on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   If a wheelchair lift is chosen rather than a ramp, the buyer
also has two broad choices: those that transport an individual
while seated in the chair or other mobility device or those that
carry only the device. For the most part, if a person has
assistance or is able to get into a vehicle on his own, a lift that
carries only the mobility aide should be suitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After devices that transport people and mobility devices into
vehicles, hand controls are the most common adaptations. The type
of control used by a disabled driver largely depends on the extent
of her disability. So-called right-angle controls, which are
mounted to the steering column and require a downward motion to
activate, are generally considered the least complicated and most
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hillcoff, president of Automobility, a producer of hand
controls in East Regina, Saskatchewan, said push-pull controls are
best for people with limited upper-body strength. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steering mechanisms also come in several forms. Those with good
upper body strength, mobility and dexterity can use spinner knobs,
which are similar to the steering wheel knobs commonly found on
1950s hot rods. People who cannot manage these, like quadriplegics
or those with severe arthritis, can control steering with the help
of a three-pin device that holds the hand in place.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Willouby of Berea, Ky., a quadriplegic who has complete
sensation but no muscle control, drives a full-size 1989 Ford van,
which he bought used; it already had a lift, automatic sliding
doors, hand controls and a special cuff that holds his hand in
place on the steering wheel. Willouby, 46, who was injured in a
diving accident 23 years ago, had previously driven a car with
special hand controls and a spinner knob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a manual chair and used to have to do transfers,'' he
said. ``But that got to be pretty rough after a while. Now I drive
from my wheelchair. I went from a car to a van because my
transferring skills got weaker and also because it's a whole lot
easier getting in and out of the van and driving from my chair. I
feel safe driving in the chair because it was designed to fit me.
The tiedowns that I use are also very safe. Once I'm locked in
position I won't move.''
</P>
<P>
   Willouby said the ability to drive comfortably has changed his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The van makes it easier for me to do the things I like to
do,'' he said. ``I go hunting and fishing a lot these days. I have
a lot more confidence in myself and my driving.''

PEERS GIVE CHELSEA THE SYMPATHY VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV AND GEETA ANAND  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mortified is the word they use most often, trailed
closely by humiliated and just plain ``grossed out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how scores of college students on both coasts said they
would feel if their own fathers got caught having an adulterous
affair with a young woman about their age. Having every detail made
public would be the worst, not just unacceptable but intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   As Andrea Sicuso, a 19-year-old crew team member at the College
of the Holy Cross in Worcester put it, ``I can't imagine my parents
having sex, never mind the whole country knowing your father did
and with someone your own age.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the students' sympathies were not with Hillary
Clinton, who chooses to stay married despite her husband's
infidelities, or with the president himself. Their sympathies were
with the Clinton they can relate to: Chelsea. So was their respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think about her when I hear about it,'' said Laura
Garvey, a 19-year-old sophomore at Holy Cross. ``It makes it even
worse that it could have been one of your friends. It's just gross.
When I see her smiling and holding her parents' hands, I wonder
what she's thinking. I don't know if I could have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the high opinion many students interviewed had of her,
Tim Bradley, a 20-year-old junior at the University of California
in Los Angeles, said simply: ``She can handle it all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the public eye, taught early to anticipate trouble at
home, Chelsea Clinton continues to demonstrate a kind of grace that
her peers said would elude them under similar circumstances. Still,
as student after student was quick to note, the public attention on
such a private family matter would make concentrating on school all
but impossible, especially since the sex scandal is a popular topic
for classroom discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was trained by her parents to live a political life, so
maybe she can handle this better than someone else,'' said Sofia
Carino, a 20-year-old economics major at UCLA. ``But how can you
train someone to deal with a situation like this? ... Any
distraction is hard and this one doesn't compare to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Eileen Donnelly, a 19-year-old sophomore at Holy Cross,
``Because we're her age, we think of her more than anyone. She must
be really embarrassed about the whole thing. To go from being
really proud of your father because he's president to feeling
uncomfortable going across campus, I can't imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Students at both Holy Cross and UCLA pointed out that they had,
in many ways, grown up with Chelsea Clinton, now a sophomore at
Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. They listened to the same
music, watched the same television programs, took their college
entrance exams around the same time. They knew she was smart, had a
swimmer for a boyfriend, invited friends for White House
sleepovers. Paying her a high compliment, many called her ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   They also called her unlucky. During a period that is supposed
to be about learning and maturing, she is being forced to confront
her father's unfaithfulness once again. Several students said they
had heard rumors that she was thinking of dropping out of school _
which they hoped she would not do _ or taking a semester off, which
almost everyone said they would understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's strong, which I think she is, she should stay,'' said
Dana Lazarovici, a senior studying neuroscience at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarovici's friend, a recent graduate named Aviva Sufian,
added, ``But it's no big deal to take a semester off. People do it
if they get mono or break up with their boyfriend. If her father
got cancer, she might leave for a while. She might feel her
responsibility is to be with her family right now.''
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, attended by many former child actors and the sons and
daughters of movie stars, students tended to assume that Chelsea
Clinton could remain relatively anonymous despite the ongoing
coverage of her father's sex life. At Holy Cross, however, many
students assumed the discomfort level would be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be a very bad feeling, but Chelsea should tell
herself, `This is my life and no one can blame me for what my
father has done,''' said Selin Billi, a business major who recently
graduated from UCLA. ``But I know it's easier to say that than to
put it into practice and actually do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarah Auguste, a Holy Cross sophomore, explained just how hard
it could be: ``Man, if it was me, I'd sit there and cry all day. I
think it's time for home tutoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Most students said they knew the unwanted attention could turn
ugly because they had read at least portions of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's report, particularly the sections detailing the
sexual relationship between the president and former White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky. But they were divided over whether
Chelsea Clinton should do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Some said they would be unable to help themselves, that they
would have to read the words that have captivated the country and
could lead to impeachment hearings, even if those words involved
their own fathers. Others argued that Chelsea Clinton should shun
the report, that it would only hurt her more. Instead, they
suggested she speak with her father directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to read the report or watch the video'' of
Clinton testifying before the grand jury, said Sommer Hammoud, a
19-year-old biology major and soccer player at UCLA. ``It's my dad
and I don't want to know nasty and gross stuff like that. But I'd
want to know what he had to say for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Said David Swanson, 21, a UCLA math major, ``I'd want to hear
about it from him first. I'd expect him to talk to me about it and
to be honest, even if he was the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Most students interviewed, particularly those whose parents had
divorced, said they assumed Chelsea Clinton was furious with her
father and, privately, was taking sides with her mother. All agreed
they would, if put in the same position, be shocked, hurt and
uncomprehending. That Lewinsky was about their age would only make
the revelation harder to digest, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many said they could forgive their fathers. None said
they could forget. Recalling the affair of a friend's father, UCLA
graduate student Amy Sakaldasis noted that her friend's
relationship with her father was never the same. Even after years
of work, it was less trusting, less loving. Today they are more
friends than father and daughter, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he's out of office, I bet their relationship is
different,'' said Amie Hibbard, a 20-year-old senior at UCLA. ``She
probably won't be so smiley around him ... But I don't know. Maybe
she's kind of use to it. Maybe it's all part of being this
president's daughter.''

Spurrier's bluster strangely absent
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Fran Blinebury &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The face is familiar, but not the words
coming out of his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Where is the diabolical genius, smiling, plotting, scheming,
doing everything but bragging about what his Gators will do to
Tennessee?
</P>
<P>
   Where is the ``aw shucks'' grin and the incendiary comments
intended to get under the Volunteers' skin?
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the annual Florida-Tennessee showdown, you want to
reach out and grab this impostor by the throat and ask him what
he's done with the real Steve Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   You know, Steve Superior, the guy everybody in the Smoky
Mountains _ and many other places _ loves to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't a lot of 2-0 teams around the country, and
at this point in the season, we're just happy to be one of them,''
Spurrier said. ``We've gone out and gotten us a couple of wins. But
I look at our football team, and I know that we have a lot of room
for improvement in a lot of different areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we have not played extremely well in our
first two games, but over the course of 11, 12, 13 games, you won't
play all of them well. Hopefully, we'll play the big games well.''
</P>
<P>
   This is usually one of the biggest for Spurrier's Gators, who
have taken the Volunteers five years in a row, including a 4-0
shutout of Tennessee that ran all the way through Peyton Manning's
celebrated quarterback career.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier always has seemed to take an extra special delight in
doing it to the Volunteers, maybe because he knows how much it
means to them. There was the time he said Manning had a chance to
become the only four-time starting quarterback in the Citrus Bowl,
which is where the Southeastern Conference's No. 2 team plays on
New Year's Day. There were always so many barbs pointed at
Tennessee by Spurrier.
</P>
<P>
   But not this time.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because Spurrier remembers how his team beat
Tennessee last season _ in defense of its 1996 national
championship _ and then went out and lost to LSU and Georgia. Maybe
it's because the Gators are starting on a torturous stretch of the
schedule that has them playing Kentucky, Alabama and LSU in
succession after the Vols. Or maybe it's because he has seen the
upsets that have occurred this season around the country and
doesn't want to put his club between the cross hairs.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be a part of Spurrier that giggled with glee last
weekend when Bobby Bowden and Florida State were upset by North
Carolina State. But there must also be a wary side of him, with
Jesse Palmer his starting quarterback with all of 2{ games of
experience under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier, like the rest of us, can see what it means to have a
calm veteran hand on the controls of an offense. No. 1-ranked Ohio
State is running behind Joe Germaine and looking like the team to
beat in the early going. Florida State might be out of the
national-championship picture after newcomer Chris Weinke suffered
through a miserable day of 9-for-32 passing with six interceptions.
That produced the Seminoles' first loss to an unranked opponent in
58 games, dating to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden's loss opened the door for the Gators to move up to No. 2
in the polls, but it's obviously an uneasy position, because
``Superior'' hasn't had much to say in his usual fashion of dumping
gasoline on Tennessee's fire.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a little disappointing, like finding out Ken
Starr is a closet Clinton voter. You expect certain people to act a
certain way, always live up to the image they have created.
Volunteers fans expect it. We all expect it.
</P>
<P>
   But after a pair of opening wins over The Citadel and Northeast
Louisiana, there has been no blast from Spurrier. Maybe because he
is hurt that his team has failed to crack the 50-point barrier
against either of the patsies. Or maybe because he watched
Tennessee venture into the Carrier Dome two weeks ago and pull out
a gutty win over Syracuse and its Heisman Trophy candidate,
quarterback Donovan McNabb.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what Tennessee does, history says Florida will
find a way to be a little bit better. The scouting report says the
Gators have an edge on the lines, offensive and defensive. It says
Manning's replacement, Tee Martin, will somehow fall victim to the
same Florida jinx. It says despite his caution with Palmer _ and
hints he'll frequently turn to Doug Johnson _ Spurrier will do what
he always does to the Vols.
</P>
<P>
   It would just be reassuring to Gators fans to hear him say it.
</P>

WHAT NOW FOR MONICA LEWINSKY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What's to become of Monica?
</P>
<P>
   While the president pleads for public forgiveness, the
prosecutor has his say in a long, eye-popping report, and the jury
on Capitol Hill clamors over a constitutional crisis, the femme
fatale in the sordid soap opera of sex and betrayal has dropped out
of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Monica S. Lewinsky, 25 and unemployed, hasn't said a thing or
been seen around town since the detailed revelations of her sad,
salacious, flirtatious, obsessive, and ambitious affair with
President Clinton rocked the world. Judy Smith, her spokeswoman,
won't confirm whether Lewinsky is still living in her mother's
Watergate apartment or say when, if ever, she'll comment on
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   There are rumors of million-dollar book deals and movie rights,
though publishers have thus far been dismissive. Maybe product
endorsements or a celebrity stint on the gossip/talk show circuit,
too. Lewinsky might move to New York, where Marcia Lewis, her
recently remarried mother, now resides, or return to Beverly Hills,
where Bernard Lewinsky, her physician-father, lives a comfortable
life. Smith won't say.
</P>
<P>
   On her birthday in July, Lewinsky told family she just wanted
``to have my life back.'' But it's hard to find anybody who
believes Monica Lewinsky can duck the spotlight now and won't be
remembered for years to come as the woman who loved ``Handsome,''
resented the ``creep,'' saved a soiled dress, and told the secrets
of a 16-month affair that shattered the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Lewinsky, who had a youthful flair for drama,
might get a leading role in the biggest television miniseries of
her life: Testifying at congressional hearings considering the
impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   John Dean III, President Nixon's counsel and chief accuser
during Watergate, recently wrote an open letter to Lewinsky in the
New York Times, warning that it won't be easy to get on with her
life, which already has been trampled by the media mob and probably
threatened by ``the lunatic fringe.'' In fact, he said, it may get
worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen soon. The House Judiciary Committee voted today
to release a videotape of the president's grand jury testimony and
additional documents collected by Starr. Lewinsky's lawyers were on
Capitol Hill Tuesday urging committee members to block the release
of parts of Lewinsky's grand jury testimony that would reveal more
sexual detail or prove embarrassing to her family or friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think your privacy has been invaded already, you will
find the grand jury room was like a confessional booth compared
with your visit to Capitol Hill,'' wrote Dean, who in 1973 gave the
Senate Watergate Committee damning testimony on Nixon's coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Americans titillated by Lewinsky's words in Starr's
report have yet to hear her voice. People close to her believe,
however, that she has a lot more to say. They reportedly are
peddling a book by Lewinsky, who boasts of ``a photographic memory
for the entire relationship,'' which began in November 1995 and
ended in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sure there will be a book, but I wouldn't give you a
plugged nickel for it,'' said New York literary agent Virginia
Barber, who says she has been approached by at least two publishers
looking for a writer for a Lewinsky book. ``I don't see the outline
of a challenging or interesting story.''
</P>
<P>
   But best-sellers have been built on much less than 10 illicit
and real-life sexual encounters inside the White House between a
22-year-old intern and the US president.
</P>
<P>
   While the Starr report breathes heavy with sex, Lewinsky's
memoir would surely meander the emotional road of an infatuated
intern who ``never expected to fall in love with the president'' to
the jealous lover who was ``livid'' when the president entertained
another female visitor, to the scorned woman who came to believe
Clinton saw their relationship as only ``a service contract'' to
satisfy his needs. ``It was a lot more than that to me,'' Lewinsky
said ruefully in Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is going to make money and have a celebrity career. There
most certainly will be a book and probably a TV movie that appeals
to our prurient, voyeuristic human nature,'' said Noreen Jenney,
president of the Celebrity Endorsement Network in Woodland Hills,
Calif. ``Beyond that, I can't imagine Monica having an easy time
finding a job. Her behavior was so abhorrent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenney doesn't think Lewinsky will be in demand for the kind of
big-time endorsements she brokers because Lewinsky conveys a
negative image, and ``no advertiser that needs to sell products
credibly to Middle America would ever use her.'' Like Donna Rice,
who was revealed as Democratic Senator Gary Hart's girlfriend,
Lewinsky might be able to sell jeans or other youthful apparel,
Jenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's job offer from Revlon, secured by presidential friend
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., was withdrawn after her relationship with
Clinton was reported by the media in January. The trouble for her
now, if she undertakes a job search, is that the world has read
what amounts to her White House employment evaluation in the Starr
report, and it isn't positive.
</P>
<P>
   The president's secretary, Betty Currie, called Lewinsky a
``pain in the neck'' and ``a little bit pushy.'' White House deputy
chief of staff Evelyn Lieberman said she was a ``clutch _ always
someplace she shouldn't be.'' Timothy Keating, a special assistant
to the president, transferred Lewinsky from the White House to the
Pentagon in April 1996, because she was ``too sexy'' to be around
the boss, according to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The former intern certainly intimidated and at times exasperated
Clinton, particularly with her persistent demands for a White House
job and her threats of exposing the relationship if Jordan didn't
produce an acceptable position in New York. ``The most important
things to me are that I am engaged and interested in my work, I am
not someone's administrative/executive assistant, and my salary can
provide me a comfortable living in N.Y.,'' Lewinsky said in a note
to the president in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were interviewing her on behalf of a client, I would be
nervous,'' said Jeffrey Davis, president of Mage Inc., an executive
consulting firm in Chestnut Hill, Mass. ``When you are building an
organizaton, you aren't looking for someone who is too
controversial or might distract from the goal at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said it's pretty clear that Lewinsky is not a ``team
player,'' and she would be perceived as a dangerous hire in a
corporate culture that is ``phobic'' about sexual harassment
lawsuits. Lynn Ponton, a San Francisco psychiatrist, says she
``wouldn't be surprised'' if Lewinsky sued the president for
harassment to try to restore her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   There's abundant evidence, though, that Lewinsky aggressively
pursued her boss with what began as ``intense flirting,'' as she
said in Starr's report, including giving the president a peek at
her thong underwear.
</P>
<P>
   For potential employers, Lewinsky could at best be considered
indiscrete and at worst a security threat. She told at least 11
people, including her mother and her therapist, of her workplace
affair. She wrote many e-mail messages about it. And she had a
Valentine's Day love poem to the president published in the
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate in psychology of Lewis &AMP; Clark College in Oregon,
Lewinsky had career goals; at one time she considered getting an
advanced degree in psychology or going to law school. According to
the Starr report, she tried unsuccessfully to impress the president
with her intellect, offering views on education reform or ``my
stupid ideas about what I thought should be done in the
administration.'' Once, when she was ``babbling on about
something,'' the president suddenly kissed her, ``kind of to shut
me up, I think,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have been snared in political sex scandals far less
lofty than Lewinsky's admit they had a hard time going beyond their
15 minutes of fame, finding a career, and getting a life.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Rice Hughes got married, became a born-again Christian,
and now is head of a grass-roots group that battles Internet
pornography. In 1980, Rita Jenrette said she had sex with her
husband, Democratic Representative John Jenrette of South Carolina,
on the Capitol steps and then posed for Playboy magazine. Today she
runs a real estate company but for years ``just wanted to
disappear. I mean, you're just mortified because you'd like to be
anonymous,'' Jenrette said in a recent television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Dale Young, a friend of Lewinsky's, told TV
talk-show host Larry King she expects her to ``land on her feet.''
Young suggested Lewinsky could use her fame to be a spokeswoman for
others who have been ``taken advantage of in a relationship with a
very, very powerful man.''
</P>
<P>
   Michele Mitchell, the 28-year-old author of ``A New Kind of
Party Animal,'' says her generation ``won't fall for'' Lewinsky
reinventing or rehabilitating her image like Donna Rice. ``Anybody
who is a peer of Monica's will have a really hard time accepting
her hawking products or being a patroness of charity,'' said
Mitchell, who calls Lewinsky ``naive. My advice to the poor kid is
disappear. Go to Europe or back to California.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more charitable. Susan Forward, author of ``Men who
Hate Women and the Women who Love Them,'' said Lewinsky is young
enough to learn from this bad chapter and grow into a ``productive
person who can get on a career path and focus on herself and not on
having affairs with older, married men. ``While it must be heady
and flattering for the president to say, `hey, baby, I chose you,'
these choices can have terrible consequences,'' Forward said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the consequences is that Lewinsky, already low in
self-esteem, according to her therapist in the Starr report, finds
herself the target of countless raunchy jokes and with the sorry
distinction of being the least-liked character _ in a recent poll,
only 12 percent said they viewed her favorably _ in the whole
drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica won't be forgotten. She will forever be determined by
this notoriety,'' said Suzanne Garment, author of ``Scandal: The
Culture of Mistrust in American Politics.'' ``I suspect she'll have
a social life if she wants it. There are lots of men who would like
to date someone who has been the president's girlfriend.''

FIRMS AGREE TO SOFTEN CLAIMS ON LICE SHAMPOO

<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Friday that three makers of
over-the-counter head lice treatment shampoos have agreed to stop
using ads asserting that one use of their products will wipe out an
infestation.
</P>
<P>
   Del Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer Inc., and Care Technologies Inc. had
been accused of making sweeping claims about the effectiveness of
their products, without evidence to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   The products cited in the complaint were Del's ``Pronto''
shampoo, Pfizer's ``Rid'' and Care Technologies' ``Clear Lice Egg
Remover and ``Clear Lice Killing Shampoo.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement called on the companies to make prominent
disclosures in ads, saying that multiple applications of shampoo
may be necessary, and that removing the eggs is essential to
successful treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for Del Pharmaceuticals, based in Uniondale, N.Y., and
Care Technologies, based in Darien, Conn., denied that their ads
deceive parents, and said they were eager to end the FTC case.
Del's president, Charles Hinkaty, said he wanted to settle the
charges ``rather than engage in protracted debate.'' Pfizer could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Some groups, such as the Newton-based National Pediculosis
Association, have urged parents to focus on removing nits manually
rather than rely on shampoos. Others, including researchers from
the Harvard School of Public Health, say lice-killing shampoos may
be helpful, given an effort to remove each nit.

CLINTON'S MISBEHAVIOR `INDEFENSIBLE,' GORE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore, making his first extended
remarks on the White House sex scandal, Friday condemned President
Clinton's misbehavior with a White House intern and called the
president's actions ``indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Concord Monitor, Gore said he feels bad
for Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, but he defended the
president's record in office and praised him for his handling of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It was a delicate dance for the vice president as he sought to
remain loyal without condoning Clinton's adultery and misleading
statements. But in a series of interviews with local media, Gore
was gradually forced to answer direct questions about the scandal.
Until Friday, Gore had given only short statements of support for
Clinton, whom he repeatedly describes as ``my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his own presidential aspirations had been
tarnished, Gore told the Monitor: ``This shouldn't be about
politics. This should be about what's right for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he condemned Clinton's escapades with former
intern Monica S. Lewinsky, Gore said: ``He himself has condemned it
_ of course.'' He also said his reaction is the same as the
president's reaction to his own wrongdoing. ``He has said it is
wrong,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed for a more personal response to the report by
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, Gore said he had given a
personal response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree with him that it's indefensible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was wrong. By and large, the country puts its
reaction to what he did in a larger perspective and balances it
against all the good things he's done as president, and there's no
question whatsoever that he has been and is a great president,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore refused to criticize Starr and said Clinton will not resign
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it will end up is finishing his term with a
distinguished record that will go down in history as a virtuoso
performance using economic recovery and American renaissance
producing solutions to problems once thought impossible to solve,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to resign, nor should he,'' Gore said,
insisting that he is not distracted by the ongoing scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked by the Monitor, and later by The Manchester
Union-Leader, if Clinton had apologized to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never revealed my private conversations with the
president,'' Gore said, ``and I'm not going to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union-Leader also questioned Gore about how parents should
talk to their children about the president's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said what he did was wrong and indefensible,''
Gore said. ``He has asked for forgiveness. Each parent has to
interpret that for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore assiduously tried to stick to a message of health care and
job creation in his third visit of the year to New Hampshire, home
of the first-in-the-nation presidential primary. During trips to
Keene, Nashua, and Manchester Friday, Gore avoided reporters from
The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune, The Washington Post, The New
York Times, ABC News, and CNN. (Tape recordings of Gore's
interviews with local media were provided to national reporters.)
</P>
<P>
   But during an interview with Manchester's WMUR-TV, Gore was
asked whether he had read the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really, but I feel like I'm thoroughly familiar with
it based upon briefings and the news accounts,'' said Gore, clearly
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore criticized the House Judiciary Committee's decision
to release the videotape of Clinton's testimony before the grand
jury investigating Whitewater. ``They should adopt a more
bipartisan approach to this,'' he said in response to a shouted
question.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he believes that people in New Hampshire and around
the country are focused on issues, and that Clinton's behavior will
not become fodder for the midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   If the people are focused on Clinton's problems, it would be
tough to tell from Gore's events Friday. Appearing with New
Hampshire Governor Jeanne Shaheen, Gore led a reverse town-hall
style forum on health care with a preselected audience of patients
and health-care providers. Instead of allowing members of the
audience to ask questions, Gore asked the questions, preempting
anything off his message of health care for all.
</P>
<P>
   Gore knew the stories that each audience member would tell
before they told them. ``Let's start with Judy Weisberg,'' he said,
noting that she has four children and no health insurance for any
of them until recently. ``What do you do when they have a serious
accident or illness?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay out of pocket,'' Weisberg explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it mean to you to have them covered?'' Gore followed
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be gambling with their health,'' she said
dutifully.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was glad that Weisberg's children are now covered
by health insurance made available through a joint federal-state
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything you'd like to say to Governor Shaheen?'' he
prompted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' Weisberg said. ``Thank you, Governor Shaheen.''

FBI WARNED EX-BULGER GIRLFRIEND OF DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ To get James ``Whitey'' Bulger's longtime girlfriend to
cooperate with the FBI, agents told her that Bulger might kill her
for knowing too much.
</P>
<P>
   Yet agents didn't contact Teresa Stanley, Bulger's companion of
three decades, for more than a year after Bulger dropped her off at
a South Shore restaurant in late January 1995 to begin his life on
the run, according to testimony Friday in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 months after Stanley returned home to South Boston, FBI
agent John Gamel wrote Stanley a letter seeking help in finding
Bulger. In a meeting in a restaurant, Gamel warned Stanley that
Bulger might murder her to keep her quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I didn't know anything about his business,'' the
57-year-old banquet waitress testified.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had learned long ago not to ask Bulger too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever asked him a question he would tell me to mind my own
business. He would say it's none of my concern,'' Stanley
testified. ``So, I never asked any questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even when she and Bulger heard on the car radio in early
January 1995, while returning to South Boston from a cross-country
trip, that Bulger's criminal sidekick, Stephen Flemmi, had been
arrested, and that authorities wanted Bulger too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ask him what was going on?'' asked Assistant US
Attorney Fred M. Wyshak Jr., who called Stanley as a witness to
rebut Flemmi's claim that Bulger fled after being tipped off by FBI
supervisor John Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ``No ... I didn't want to get into another argument,'' Stanley
replied.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return home, Bulger and Stanley detoured to Long
Island, where he traded his car for a different model. Then they
headed to a Manhattan hotel, where they watched an episode of
``America's Most Wanted'' featuring Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Jan. 23, 1995, Bulger dropped Stanley off at a
Hingham restaurant, before heading to Fields Corner in Dorchester
to meet with his longtime criminal associate, Kevin Weeks. Then
Bulger picked up Catherine Greig, the woman he was seeing behind
Stanley's back for 20 of the 30 years they were together, and
vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Cross-examining Stanley, defense lawyer Anthony M. Cardinale,
who represents one of Flemmi's codefendants, New England Mafia boss
Francis P. Salemme, established through an FBI document that
Stanley was not &UR;  &LR; interviewed by the bureau until April 29, 1996.
Stanley testified that she believed the FBI sent her a letter
within 6 to 9 months of her return.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in contacting Stanley supports assertions _ first
voiced by defense lawyers last year when Bulger and Flemmi were
unmasked as FBI informants _ that the bureau was in no hurry to
catch Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has denied dragging its feet and offered a $250,000
reward for Bulger's capture last year.
</P>
<P>
   After concluding her testimony, Stanley said outside the
courtroom that she's no longer worried about Bulger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``I just had to forget. I can't worry about it anymore,'' she
said. ``I'm just trying to forget that whole existence. I'm trying
to erase 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony Friday, former FBI organized crime supervisor
James A. Ring, who testified at length earlier in the hearings, was
recalled by the government to rebut key points in Flemmi's
testimony, including Flemmi's &UR;  &LR; claim that he and Bulger were
promised protection from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told them that,'' said Ring. ``I didn't have the
capacity to tell them that.'' Ring also denied Flemmi's claim that
he had warned Bulger to stay away from a Boston police lieutenant
who was ``wired'' as part of a police corruption probe in 1986.

LEGENDARY JIMMY PAGE SPEAKS OUT  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Ask any rock musician with a few years under his or
her belt for the short list of truly legendary guitarists, and the
name Jimmy Page is sure to be mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage in the '70s with his monster band, Led Zeppelin, Page
was a force to be reckoned with. Clad in black or white outfits
adorned with flaming dragons or celestial bodies, he attacked his
instrument with such speed that his fingers blurred.
</P>
<P>
   With a flair for the dramatic, Page would saw on the strings of
his Les Paul with a violin bow on occasion, and prance about as he
launched booming musical missiles into the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Page had the licks and chutzpah to go toe-to-toe
with the orgasmic vocals of Robert Plant. Nearly two decades after
Led Zeppelin's demise, Page and Plant are on tour together _ their
second in four years.
</P>
<P>
   This outing ostensibly supports the pair's energetic new album,
``Walking Into Clarksdale.'' But as Page explained in a recent
interview with ``The Arizona Republic,'' it also reprises
Zeppelin's classic catalog in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   Page, 54, spoke via phone from a tour stop in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: On your ``Walking Into Clarksdale'' album and current
tour, you and Robert have stripped things back to a four-piece
band. What inspired you to move in that direction?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: It was the most obvious thing to do, really. We'd always
played that way; it felt (like) the most natural combination of
all, to play as that unit. It is basically a four-piece. . . . The
whole meat and potatoes of the show really is improvisation. Not
lengthy improvisation _ the songs change shape. They're totally
recognizable but then people can see, hey, they're thinking about
that and that's cool. . . . What we're really doing now is really
going out there and doing a serious rock and roll set. . . . Every
set's different every night. If you think about it, that's what
I've done all the way back to the Yardbirds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've loaded up your set list on this tour with Led Zeppelin
classics as well as some tunes from your new album. Why the
decision to go that way?
</P>
<P>
   A: We teamed up for the last tour, ``Unledded,'' and we went
around with the orchestras and the ethnic musicians. . . . We
revisited a lot of numbers like ``Kashmir'' and gave them new
colors and new textures. . . . In the (current) set, we're doing
two numbers that one would have assumed would have been on the
``Unledded'' tour _ ``Going to California ''and ``Tangerine.''
Everything seems to work to the opposite of what people would
expect of you! Now, having done the new album, the songs that are
employed from it fit well within the set. They're presented in the
best places, so it doesn't differ at all within context. And the
rest of the material obviously is the songs that we wrote and
performed from the past and the songs that we feel good playing.
That's the most important thing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Reports from the tour indicate that you two are in your best
musical form in years. Any reason behind that? Perhaps working a
bit of rust off the last time around, and now you're really in
stride?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, there was no rust on the last time around; the only
problem was that there was so much information for the audience to
take in with two orchestras going at once with the rock band
underneath. . . . But now it's back to how I've always been used to
playing, which is exploring the dynamics of the guitar so they can
hear every nuance, every subtlety and every attack. . . . It's now
totally up front, and you can't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm curious about the chemistry between you and Robert these
days, as opposed to when you worked together years ago. With the
passage of time, is it still the same basic feeling?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's probably more focused now because we've learned from the
past. We know what we are, and we know how to get the best out of
each other, really.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That's on both a personal and a musical level?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How far did the two of you drift apart during that period
(1980 to 1994)?
</P>
<P>
   A: About as far a you could go. . . . If you look at what one
was doing and what the other was doing, it was pretty obvious that
we'd gone that far, and we sort of came back around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On a personal level, too?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would say in every way. But as it came together, like
walking around the edge of a circle in two different directions, we
bonded up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It must have been an imposing feeling going into that
rehearsal studio in north London that first day (Page's first
studio session with Plant in 14 years).
</P>
<P>
   A: It was sort of a make or break day, but it didn't bother me.
I knew what could be done, what would be done.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've been at this game more than 30 years. Is it more of a
challenge to motivate yourself to compose and tour?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are certain dates as you go through a tour _ key dates,
magical dates, and they're so good. The most important thing for me
is to keep re-creating that and getting better and better. That's
the prime motivation for me, to keep topping the previous show. You
keep building to a point where it gets scary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've always seemed like a guy who doesn't mind sitting in
the studio and twisting knobs, and you're a wonderful performer.
Does one or the other pull at you stronger as you get a bit older?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm sort of addicted to the adrenaline buzz that you get
playing live. I realize now that it's such a part of my addictive
personality that I have to do that. . . . When you're in the studio
working with the remasters (of Led Zeppelin material), that's
purely technique.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've brought so many musical influences to the table over
the years; I understand you traveled to Brazil before this tour.
What types of music currently intrigue you?
</P>
<P>
   A: In Brazil, there's the sort of music that most people are
aware of . . . those beautiful chord sequences and melodies which
are astonishing. . . . But really beneath it all, there's this sort
of trance drumming. Where I go in Brazil, there's a river that
intersects a village, so there's a hill on each side of it. And
where I stay is on the far side, where you can hear the drums going
on all night, where they're having their . . . magical ceremonies,
healing ceremonies. And you can't escape it. There's two things
there, really: rhythm and sex. And you breathe it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Over the years, a Middle Eastern flavor has crept into your
music. What are the roots of that for you and Robert?
</P>
<P>
   A: Again, it's rhythm. What we're talking about now from Brazil
and Morocco is basically African. It's what came over here to be
blues and then rock and roll. . . . We found that within Arabic
music, Moroccan music, there were some extremely seductive lines -
especially when they started to bring in strings and orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the years since Zeppelin broke up, you've teamed with Paul
Rodgers in The Firm as well as David Coverdale. Were those outings
satisfying and/or frustrating?
</P>
<P>
   A: Working with Robert Plant, Paul Rodgers and John Miles as
well, on the ``Outrider ''tour . . . and then David Coverdale _
they're all tremendous singers and I've been lucky to work with
people like that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there a reason that you came full circle back to Robert
Plant?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was obvious that the two of us had a chemistry which I
didn't have with the other people, though we worked well together.
There was a particularly special chemistry that Robert and I had
together. . . . It was clearly evident when we came back together
and wrote two songs on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Led Zeppelin broke so many rules and set so many precedents
as to how rock and roll is performed and marketed. You ignored the
singles charts and tipped the financial scales toward the artist
and away from the concert promoter. What possessed you to push the
status quo instead of playing it safe?
</P>
<P>
   A: Because the music was more important than the business. . . .
The music said more than what the business was going to say. In
those days, we didn't want to break up an album and have singles.
These days, singles are really of the utmost importance. But in
those days, you have to see it as what it was: We just believed
collectively and individually in what we were doing. . . . We
didn't want to be sidetracked with any sort of nonsense. The album
would go out, and we'd just do the concerts, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With the ``Clarksdale'' album getting good airplay and the
two of you in fine form, have you and Robert looked past this
current tour?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've got a couple of plans, actually, and they're
diametrically opposed. Not that we're disagreeing, it's just that
there's two different things to do. . . . Both projects are very
interesting, but I'd rather it come as a bit of a surprise. &QL;

JUDICIARY COMMITTEE VOTES ALONG STRICT PARTY LINE TO RELEASE
CLINTON TAPE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Giving a sharp partisan cast to deliberations over
impeachment, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee
voted along party lines Friday to release the videotape of
President Clinton's grand jury testimony along with 2,800 more
documents on the inquiry into his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The materials were set to be made public Monday, promising a
nation that would like the scandal to simply go away televised
replays of an angry and legalistic Clinton jousting with lawyers
over the definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The party divide over the public release of material erupted
into the open within minutes after the committee ended its final
two hours of closed-door deliberations Friday morning. Rep. Henry
Hyde, the committee chairman, began to describe the committee's two
days of meetings as ``civil'' sessions in which the ``spirit of
bipartisanship is alive and flourishing.'' But he was quickly
interrupted by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say that this is a new concept, unfortunately
of unilateral bipartisanship,'' Frank said. ``Bipartisanship can't
be unilateral.'' He said virtually every vote taken across two days
of deliberations had been along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde retorted, ``I may have a different definition of
bipartisanship _ it doesn't include surrender to every single
Democrat's wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the four-hour videotape of Clinton, the documents to be
released add further detail to the report of Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, who charged the president with 11 acts that
might constitute impeachable offenses. The documents include FBI
interviews with Lewinsky, her testimony before the grand jury and
her proffer _ the information she was prepared to reveal in
exchange for immunity _ to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did agree to make nearly 120 deletions from the
materials on the grounds of sexual explicitness, national security
or privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings of the House Judiciary Committee mark the first
time since the Watergate scandal in 1974 that the House has
considered whether to open an impeachment inquiry into a president.
And the deliberations are taking place in an atmosphere made more
tense by recent media reports on sexual indiscretions on the part
of three Republican members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said that Hyde telephoned Speaker Newt
Gingrich earlier in the week and offered to step down from the
investigation after the online magazine Slate reported that he had
had an extramarital affair 30 years ago. Gingrich, however, gave
Hyde his full support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker did not consider the resignation because there is
no person who has earned more respect and affection from the House
than Hyde,'' said Christina Martin, a spokeswoman for Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to ease some of the fears sweeping the Congress, Sens.
Mitch McConnell and Bob Kerrey, the chairmen of the Republican and
Democratic Senate campaign committees, followed the lead of their
House counterparts and pledged on the Senate floor Friday not to
finance candidates who make personal attacks against their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digging through their record is one thing,'' said McConnell, a
Kentucky Republican. ``Digging through their garbage is quite
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The partisan acrimony over the ongoing release of Starr's
materials has grown since last week when Gingrich and Rep. Dick
Gephardt, the House minority leader, pledged to work cooperatively.
The House then voted 363-63 to make public Starr's report and
backup materials after scrutiny by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the panel said Friday that they were carrying out
the will of the full House for maximum public disclosure and that
the documents would make clear whether Starr's report had put the
president's testimony in proper context. They also said that the
panel's Democrats were ideologues who are not representative of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent, maybe seventy percent of our colleagues on the
other side had a hard time accepting the mandate of the House,''
said Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the panel.
``Whether that's a partisan fight I don't know. I feel we lived up
to the mandate of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said ``There was a general view among the Democrats not to
reveal anything and there was a general view among Republicans to
reveal as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's Democrats accused the Republicans of trying to keep
up a steady stream of information embarrassing the president,
instead of releasing it at once on the Sept. 28 deadline set by the
House for the committee to review all the material.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla. said, ``We're going to dribble out
information for only one reason: death by a thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were echoed by the White House. ``This appears to be
a rush to prejudgment and an effort to get out the most salacious
material at the speed of light, not at the proper pace of
justice,'' said James Kennedy, a White House spokesman. ``But in
the end it will have to be the American people who will have to see
if this indeed has been a fair process or a partisan effort to
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee, the
Democrats had virtually no chance of prevailing on any vote, but
they did create a record across two days of roll call votes to show
the American public which party was voting to release the explicit
details of Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat on the committee who
won his party's nomination to challenge Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, was
absent from the meetings.

GE, LLOYD'S SETTLE EMLICO CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a pact that finally ends General Electric Co.'s costly legal
troubles over its collapsed insurer, GE and Lloyd's of London have
reached an agreement that settles Lloyd's claims against the failed
unit, known as Emlico, sources familiar with the matter said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms and size of the out-of-court settlement were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes after similar agreements between Fairfield,
Conn.-based GE and other global reinsurers of Emlico, including
Kemper Re, Allstate, Hanover Re and General Re. Another reinsurer,
Commercial Union, is still in arbitration proceedings against GE.
</P>
<P>
   Both LLoyd's, which is not a company but a London-based exchange
representing scores of individual insurers, and GE declined to
comment on the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Emlico, whose sole policy holder was GE, relocated to Bermuda
from Massachusetts in 1995, citing more favorable business
conditions. It then declared bankruptcy, leaving its reinsurers
holding the bill for around $500 million needed for reserves to
cover GE's asbestos and environmental liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Angered reinsurers sued in Massachusetts courts, charging that
Emlico knew it was bankrupt and that it relocated to avoid lawsuits
stateside. The reinsurers had worried that a formal liquidation of
Emlico in Bermuda would be more favorable to GE than to them.
</P>
<P>
   The case cast a cloud over Insurance Commissioner Linda
Ruthardt's decision to allow Emlico to relocate to a foreign
country. The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled earlier this year
that Ruthardt had erred.
</P>
<P>
   GE, the manufacturing, technology, and services giant, faces
what some observers say could amount to $2 billion in cleanup costs
related to its US environmental liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Emlico existed to insure GE's corporate activities, as well as
to provide workman's compensation and other products to GE
employees. The firm must still be formally liquidated, and it is
unclear whether a Boston-based US District Court judge will move to
allow the proceedings to take place in Massachusetts instead of
Bermuda, where they are ongoing.

COALITION, IN CONVENTION, CASTIGATES CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many members of the Christian Coalition, the
issue isn't whether President Clinton must go, but what form his
departure will take.
</P>
<P>
   The rallying cry for religious conservatives Friday at their
annual ``Road to Victory'' convention was ``Impeach him!'' as
several speakers, including coalition founder Pat Robertson,
insisted Congress must do its constitutional duty and oust the
president for immoral behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is not Little Rock on
the Potomac,'' said Robertson, adding that Clinton was ``debauched,
debased, and defamed'' by his sexual affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky. ``As landlords of the White House, it's time to tell this
occupant his lease has expired.''
</P>
<P>
   To a standing ovation, Robertson said that allowing the
president to resign with his government pension and the possible
promise of a pardon ``wouldn't be all that bad for him.''
Congress's duty is to impeach him, Robertson said. ``While
resignation might be easier for America, it's not best for
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's comments drew criticism from C. Welton Gaddy,
director of the Interfaith Alliance. ``As the opening speakers
filled the hall with divisive rhetoric, it was apparent that
hardball partisan politics, pure and simple, drive the coalition,''
Gaddy said.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's political clout and power to turn out voters was
noted by Ralph Reed, the group's former executive director, who
warned candidates of both parties that they will be held
accountable by religious conservatives in November for how they
handle the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there are many in the upper reaches (of the GOP)
who are counseling timidity,'' Reed told the 3,500 delegates.
``They say be quiet, stay out of the cameras, and let the process
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, we didn't work, bleed, and pray to attain a
Republican majority in order to preside over the funeral of a
failed politician,'' said Reed, who is now a political consultant.
``Our goal is to restore righteousness to a country that has lost
its way.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott seemed to take heed as they, along with other members of the
House leadership, paid their respects and pledged their allegiance
to the conservative grass-roots activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the president will do the right thing, but we
will do the right thing,'' Lott said. He said he ``prays'' God
helps elect enough new GOP senators to give Republicans a
two-thirds majority and the ability to override presidential vetoes
of bills the coalition supports, including those that restrict
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates reacted with moans of disappointment and angry
boos when Lott announced the Senate Friday failed by three votes to
oveturn Clinton's veto of a bill to ban certain late-term abortion
procedures. The issue is dead for this term, but Lott said he might
revive it next year.
</P>
<P>
   Former Lt. Col. Oliver North energized the mostly white and
middle-aged audience when he told them Congress must not ``cop
out'' with a meaningless censure of the president. North, whose
three felony convictions for his role in the Iran-contra affair
were overturned on appeal, said the rule of law must be applied to
Clinton for abusing the public trust.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle also got an enthusiastic
reception from the crowd and a mini-demonstration from several
dozen supporters carrying ``Run, Dan, Run in 2000'' placards as he
spoke of the need to replace Clinton with a president who makes
morality central to his private life and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP presidential hopefuls were planning to woo the
delegates with speeches today. Friday they simply entertained them:
Missouri Senator John Ashcroft scooped ice cream sundaes; Gary
Bauer of the Family Research Council held a late afternoon
reception; and businessman Steve Forbes hosted a fiesta, complete
with a mariachi band.
</P>
<P>
   The intense courtship of the coalition shows how much some
politicians want to be in step with the family-values message of
the religious right. ``We used to be scoffed at when we said morals
and ethics do count in a president,'' said Evelyn Reilly of
Waltham, executive director of the Christian Coalition in
Massachusetts. ``I guess you could say we've been vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's apologies and pleas for foregiveness were acknowledged
but not embraced by the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The view here is that if you confess your sins, we'll give you
space. But if you pull a fast one on God, you're going to pay a
price,'' said Chip Berlet, an analyst for Political Research
Associates, a Somerville-based group that studies the religious
right. ``If you wanted to find the Christian Coalition's poster boy
for Satan's plaything, look no further than Bill Clinton.''

EGAN TO LEAVE COMPANY HIS FATHER FOUNDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John R. Egan, executive vice president of EMC Corp. and son of
the company's feisty founder, will leave EMC to devote his energies
to his family and his venture capital company, according to the
Hopkinton, Mass. maker of data storage devices.
</P>
<P>
   Egan will be replaced by Paul E. Noble, Jr., a 17-year veteran
at EMC and the company's senior vice president for business
development.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was not available for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marks the departure of the last Egan to be an
executive of EMC, a company cofounded by Egan's father, Richard J.
Egan, who now serves as chairman of the board. At one point, John
Egan worked at EMC alongside his two brothers, Michael and Chris.
John and his parents, who together own 1.3 percent of the company's
stock, will remain on the company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ruettgers, EMC's chief executive, said John Egan cited
as reasons for his departure a desire to spend more time with his
family. Egan, 40, has three school-age children.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a possible heir to run EMC, Egan has been
gradually withdrawing from the company's day-to-day operations. The
news of his departure, therefore, did not surprise Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was expected to happen sooner or later,'' said Mark
Goodstadt, a technology stock analyst with S&AMP;P Equity Group in New
York. ``It was not a great shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts appeared to take comfort in the fact that Noble, Egan's
replacement, has been with EMC since 1981, when the company was
just 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Noble is very experienced,'' said Mark Kelleher, an
analyst with Tucker Anthony in Boston. ``He's quite capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher noted that Noble built and grew the company's reselling
business, which makes up more than 25 percent of the company's
total sales. That business pairs an EMC storage device with a
high-end computer; the two are then sold as a package to business
customers.
</P>
<P>
   EMC is also adding to its bench of senior management. The
company said it hired Cosmo Santullo as vice president and general
manager of enterprise software and Bruce Rampe as senior vice
president for global marketing. Santullo was general manager of IBM
Corp.'s personal computer division, while Rampe was president of
BBN Software Products, a division of BBN Corp.
</P>
<P>
   EMC shares fell 1 11/16 yesterday to 53 3/8 on the New York
Stock Exchange. While the stock is down from a 52-week high of 58
1/8, it has gained 94 percent year-to-date.

IDEALISM GONE FROM CLINTON POLITICAL TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even by the standards of presidential campaigns,
Bill Clinton's 1992 team was a boisterous, self-assured group. They
were going to end 12 years of Republican leadership, reshape the
Democratic party, and change the world.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are sickened by the media's ravenous appetite for
scandal and livid at Kenneth Starr's incessant probes. And, in many
cases, they are disillusioned with Clinton, the man who used to
inspire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How on earth could you not be disappointed?'' said David
Stone, who helped the Clinton campaign in Pennsylvania while he
served as a staff member for Democratic Senator Harris Wofford.
``How could you not be stunned by the incredible recklessness (of
Clinton's affair)? It's just breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress decides whether the Starr report will lead to an
impeachment inquiry, this is a time for reflection among the men
and women who knew Clinton. Well-known former aides such as George
Stephanopoulos, who have gone on to high-paying, high-profile
careers, have had their say.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the campaigners were young believers who did not
become famous. They left college and jobs to plot strategy, drive
Clinton through snowstorms, and write speeches. They trusted
Clinton, a candidate who seemed personally flawed yet charismatic
and brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most dedicated acolytes went on to join the
administration after the election, so they ended up spending
several years of their lives working for Clinton. They endured
setbacks on health-care reform and reversals in the 1994 and 1996
congressional elections, but the last few days of revelations about
Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky have been downright
humiliating for them.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few of the original Clintonites still believe in the
president, and perhaps they have been hit hardest of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still adore him without a doubt, but I feel like a bottle of
tonic that has no bubbles left,'' said Neel Lattimore, who was
considered an old-timer when he joined the '92 campaign at age 31.
</P>
<P>
   After the election, Lattimore spent five years in the press
office of Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``I'm hurting for Clinton, I'm
hurting for Hillary and frankly I'm hurting for myself because I
feel this tremendous sense of loss. People are joking, and it's
devastating. I invested six years of my life working for Clinton,
and it's not how I want him to be remembered because it's not how I
want my public service to be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Connolly, a reserve officer, joined the Army's 82nd Airborne
Division in Iraq during the Gulf War, then stayed on in Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia for nearly a year. The whole time, he followed
American politics through two-week-old copies of Time and Newsweek.
Something about Clinton's charm was infectious, even thousands of
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly, who had worked for Michael Dukakis' 1988 campaign,
sought out an old colleague, Michael Whouley, a Clinton adviser.
Two weeks after returning to the United States, Connolly was
directing Hillary Clinton's scheduling operation in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton won, Connolly went on to work at the Pentagon. He
earned fame among colleagues when he quit out of principle in April
1996. Connolly supported a ban on anti-personnel mines, but Clinton
and his top commanders did not.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly was not sore at Clinton then and he isn't now. He still
admires the president's stands on gun control and other issues. But
he wonders how Clinton could hurt his most loyal followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for those I knew personally or those I just knew
by reputation or name, people who toil each day for 12 or 14 hours
working for this man or this administration, working on policies we
believe in,'' says Connolly, who is now a social studies teacher at
a New York high school. ``And then to have this happen and
undermine the whole effort...''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses, as if digesting the sordid details of the Starr
report. ``It appears, as the record stands now, that the president
was engaged in activities that would jeopardize beliefs he held his
entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the '92 Clinton campaign reminisce about frenetic
days of living on $10 per diem expenses, sleeping six people in
cramped motel rooms, showing up at airports to pick up tickets
without knowing where they were going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope was always that you could look back at this time and
compare it to working in Bobby Kennedy's Justice Department, or
working on the Great Society,'' said one campaigner who joined the
administration for a few years before taking a private job. ``I and
so many of the people I have worked with now feel that we have lost
a chance at that legacy, for something so reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most of those interviewed, he asked not to be named. Much
of his anger is directed at Starr, who spent months ``writing what
is basically a pulp novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most cynical comments come from the campaigners who
worked with Clinton in the New Hampshire primary in February 1992,
when he denied, and then deflected, questions about an affair with
lounge singer Gennifer Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one who was with Clinton in New Hampshire could be naive
enough to discount the Lewinsky allegations when they first came
out,'' said one of Clinton's earliest supporters, who logged
thousands of miles on the road during the campaign and now works in
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Clinton still has ardent defenders. Lisa Caputo, who
joined the campaign in 1992, ran the media operation at the
Democratic National Convention and went on to serve as Hillary
Clinton's press secretary two years ago. ``Clearly, in my view,
there has been a creation of a fourth branch of government with the
independent counsel law,'' she said. ``I think this has all gone
too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gallagher, was a 22-year old Wesleyan College liberal arts
graduate when he signed on to the Clinton campaign in his home
state of New Hampshire in September 1991. He went on to become the
campaign's travel director, based in Little Rock, Ark., and then to
become a White House aide helping with national service programs.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in San Francisco where he now is in the private sector,
Gallagher said Americans should stop intruding on the president's
personal life. Later, he called back to vent his frustration _ not
at Clinton, but at Clinton's detractors. ``The '92 campaign was
more about Bill Clinton's ideas than Bill Clinton as a person,'' he
said. ``Those who mistook the man for the message seven years ago
appeared to be the most distracted and disappointed today.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Connolly put it this way: ``I never believed I was
in a campaign to elect someone Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   A Massachusetts native who worked on the Clinton campaign and
then spent four years in the White House said she has gone through
the whole gamut of relations: denying Clinton's involvement in
January, feeling sorrow because of the Starr report's revelations
last week, and seething with anger at the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the days go on, I tend to agree with what Clinton said in
Martha's Vineyard _ there is a time for forgiveness,'' said the
woman who took a job in business. ``My biggest concern is what's
best for the country, and what's best for the country is not
destroying this man.''

FACING AN UNDYING ISSUE: RIGHT TO DIE  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Good arguments can last awhile. This one is thousands
of years old.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Gerster, M.D., and John Westover, Ph.D., carry the
argument today. They have argued in the halls of the Arizona
Legislature, in the halls of Congress and through their
organizations' attorneys in the halls of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of this dispute, which traces back through the mists
of history to Socrates and Hippocrates: the right to end one's own
life.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster, a Scottsdale internal medicine physician, was the
national president of her side of the argument. Westover of Tucson,
a retired Army officer and military historian, was the national
president of his side.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Republic asked them to meet again to engage the
issue so our readers can enjoy champion soul wrestling over one of
the great issues of the human condition. The following dialogue is
a compilation of remarks made face to face and in follow-up
comments. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: ``I think over the years there has been a cheapening of
human life,'' says Gerster, chairwoman of the anti-abortion Arizona
Right to Life and the past president of National Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think human life means as much anymore. You can see it
in children killing children and mass suicide. I don't think people
are concerned about their neighbors. I don't think people are
concerned about members of their own family. I don't think we are a
caring people anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preservation of life _ and improving the quality of life _ have
become central to the philosophy
 &UR; of this doctor, in practice now for 38 years.
</P>
<P>
   She lost an infant son to pneumonia, a grandfather to suicide, a
mother last year to cancer. She isn't in a mood to easily give
anyone else up to death. Anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: ``I get annoyed with people who are so sure that
somebody wants to take what little money I have away from me. I
just don't feel that way, and I don't worry about my children.''
</P>
<P>
   Westover, 80, has heard the argument about people being rushed
into premature death many times before. He is a past national
president of the Hemlock Society, which advocates people's right to
die as they choose.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: But you have a good family. What about other families?
A few years ago I had a patient who had a very treatable illness
and she was all for the treatment. Then she came in with her only
son and a daughter-in-law from hell. The daughter-in-law said,
``Who's going to take you to the oncologist all the time? Who is
going to do that? If you get sick, who's going to lift you? I can't
do any lifting. I don't have any time to drive you! '' It was the
most withering moment. I saw this woman shrink and say, ``I guess
not. I guess I won't have the treatment.'' That is the sort of
thing I see.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: If some families have problems, should that prevent me
from having what I need at the end of my life? Even if there are
some abuses _ and there will be abuses _ do they negate the basic
rights of individuals?
</P>
<P>
   We are coming to a greater respect for the individual and their
right to make decisions for themselves. We have gotten to the point
where you may stop a medical procedure, stop rescue workers from
coming in and breaking the bones of the elderly with unwanted
resuscitation. We are making progress, and it is directed toward
individual rights and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: You already have rights. You have the right to be
hospitalized or not; the right to get rid of your doctor; the right
to request or refuse treatment. But you don't have the right to
have someone else kill you. Suicide is the easiest thing in the
world; you don't have to commission someone else to kill you. My
grandfather did the same type of killing that Kevorkian does: he
went into the garage, turned on the motor of his car and killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors shouldn't be killers. Doctors should be healers.
Physician-assisted suicide, terminal sedation are all perversions
of medicine. Many physicians have tolerated third-party intrusion
and have allowed financial considerations above the life of a
patient.
</P>
<P>
   I mean the HMOs. The fact that you, as a doctor, no longer feel
responsible to your patient, but to the HMO. The HMO dictates when
you can see a specialist _ if you can see a specialist, when you
can have a mammogram, when you can see an oncologist. Woody Allen
once said, ``Death is a great way to save money.'' I'm afraid this
idea has pervaded the era of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: But in many instances the effect (of the medical
system) is to drag out the dying process _ lengthening death. The
fact that more people are going into hospice these days is good,
but in too many cases they go in within hours or days of dying.
That says to me that the doctors aren't letting go. Should
treatments continue when it is futile? I know of a 90-year-old man
dying of cancer who had a pacemaker installed. That's someone
wanting money.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Today, dying is less painful and it should be less
painful. It should be a time of reconciliation for the family.
Patients should be pain-free, which is within our capabilities.
Many doctors are woefully inadequate in this, but the technology is
out there.
</P>
<P>
   We have always had morphine. But there are advances in the ways
it can be introduced, (like with) morphine pumps implanted in the
body. Instead of destroying life we should destroy the conditions
that make death intolerable. When my mother died a year ago, we did
everything we could. In the end, she had no pain.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: In the transcripts of that End of Life Commission, I
read that there are 8 million people with cancer and 50 percent are
going to die in serious pain.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Unless they get good pain relief treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: But that kind of treatment is so rare.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Only 10 percent require higher technology. Many of the
90 percent are dying in pain needlessly because doctors don't
understand how to treat them with oral medications.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: But there are still some patients that cannot be made
pain-free short of putting them into unconsciousness. Isn't that
correct?
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I would say that 99 percent of pain could be
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: Most individuals, if they were assured that their pain
would be controlled, would not request an immediate end of life. We
are finding in Oregon and California and elsewhere that our Hemlock
members who have prescription drugs they know could kill them don't
use them. But having those drugs makes them feel that they are in
control, in case the pain became more than they could bear. But
they should have the right to be in control.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Gerster was asked if there are any cases where she
would see the value of physician-assisted suicide (where the
patient takes a pill or pulls a switch provided by a physician), or
terminal sedation (where the patient is fully sedated while such
life supports as food and water are withdrawn). (endital)
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: As I see it, terminal sedation is homicide. Some
doctors are using terminal sedation with people who have no pain.
It has slipped up on us very quietly. It's covert. At least with
physician-assisted suicide, people know what they are getting into.
</P>
<P>
   I had a patient recently who was concerned because her
father-in-law had been told he probably had six months to live. He
had mild pain but it was well controlled. Suddenly they started the
I.V. and he became sleepy. The next day when family members voiced
their concern about him, they were told that they were making him
comfortable. ``You agreed to make him comfortable, right? '' they
were asked. The next morning he was dead. It was only 36 hours
after the sedation began. I think this is happening more often.
When you start misinterpreting the law, as we are seeing happen
now, it can become very dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: As a matter of fact, terminal sedation is recognized
by the AMA isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: Not the inappropriate use of it. And this is something
really new in the way it's being used.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: The Supreme Court recognized it as appropriate for
relief of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: It is being used as an excuse to allow a person to die
very quickly. The terminally ill and chronically ill are unwanted,
expensive people. The drains on some of their families are
emotional and financial. No matter how much they might want to
live, they can be coerced.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are misdiagnoses. The ``Archives of Internal
Medicine'' this year reported that autopsies reveal significant
misdiagnosis in a third of cases. That can put someone on the fast
track to death.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, 70 percent of members of minority groups voted
against the physician-assisted suicide referendum. And among those
over 65 _ the people who would be most affected by it _ 63 percent
voted against it. The bill was popular among 30- and 40-year-olds
who felt invulnerable and probably sick and tired of caring for
their parents. The older people and minorities voted against
physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: In Arizona, most of our Hemlock Society members are
over 65, well-educated with above-average incomes. We are talking
about mature adults who are near the end of life and they want to
end it on their terms. We believe this is the correct thing _ they
should be allowed to do it. They are not injuring anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I think people who don't want to live are by and large
depressed and should be treated for that. I think patients want to
be pain free and alert at the end. And this is absolutely
attainable.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: Pain is not always the issue. There are people who
want to end life. When they are terminal they want to speed the
process. They want to die on their terms and it is their right.
They should have assistance. Why shouldn't a doctor help?
</P>
<P>
   The greatest gulf between us is our attitude toward death. As a
physician, you see death mainly in medical terms. I see it more in
its societal and personal terms. Of course, you recognize the
impact of death on the family and community, but less on the
individual whose life is ending. I think it is the terminally ill
person's wishes which should be paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Pain management doesn't address suffering, severe dependence,
prolonged waiting and the financial drain, which is occasioned by
the terminal illness.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final analysis, whose life is it? If a person has
reason to believe the six-month judgment is correct, and if they
want to shorten the period, I would see no reason why they
shouldn't have that right. It is the availability of a gentle,
dignified death which Hemlock members wish as a right for
themselves and for others.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) How will the issue shape up in the coming Arizona
legislative session? (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I think the right-to-life movement better get
legislation out there on the state level. I would like to see
legislation on physician education on pain relief, education of the
public that hospices exist and what care they are entitled to, and
guidelines on pain relief. I would like to see more of an
educational bill that reiterates what already is available.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: I have just reviewed a grant proposal submitted by the
Governor's Advisory Commission on End-of-Life Issues that looks
like a good proposal. What happens with that will influence
Hemlock's actions in the coming year in Arizona. We are cautious
though, as similar projects in other states have shown zero
improvement in end-of-life patient care. We aren't going to push
this coming year. Maybe in 2000 or 2002 if things don't work out
right, we would consider putting an initiative on the ballot, a
measure that would give people choice. One that will allow
terminally ill patients, with control, to get a prescription,
similar to what they have in Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   What are your thoughts about your own death?
</P>
<P>
   Gerster: I would like to have my family around me. I'd like time
to try to mend fences and have reconciliations. I'd like to be
alert and pain free, which is my right and easily attainable today.
I'd like to make peace with my God. I'd like to live as long and as
fully as I possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   Westover: My mother's family all came down with something
equivalent to Alzheimer's and had long, slow declines. I watched my
mother, who had been a very active, very artistic, very happy woman
go through years of decline. When Derek Humphrey announced the
formation of the Hemlock Society in 1980, I said, ``That is for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   My oldest brother reached up to a cabinet and dropped dead. That
was about as painless as you could possibly go. My next older
brother went through five years of medical treatment and he died
with some pain. I am not a soldier who wants to be shot on the
battlefield. I think a painless, easy-going death _ the soprano
hits the last high C and then out. I don't mind dying, but when I
do, I want it to be while my dignity is intact. &QL;

BANK OF N.E. TRUSTEE AGREES TO BANKRUPTCY TERMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND STEVE BAILEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A bankruptcy trustee for Bank of New England Corp.
reached a tentative settlement with federal regulators Friday that
would pay $140 million to creditors of the failed banking company.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. still
must be approved by the FDIC's board and US Bankruptcy Court Judge
William C. Hillman. A lawyer representing regulators said the FDIC
hopes to gain board approval next month.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators seized Bank of New England on Jan. 6, 1991, marking
the largest-ever bank failure in the New England region. The
company's list of creditors was dominated by bond investors who
were holding more than $700 million in Bank of New England
securities.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New England was the second-largest banking company in
New England when it was pulled under by a disastrous portfolio of
bad real estate and commercial loans.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy trustee Ben Branch had sued the FDIC, alleging that
more than $200 million belonging to Bank of New England bondholders
had improperly fallen into the hands of the regulators. The case
had been scheduled to go to trial Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a fair settlement and a hard-fought settlment,''
said Bill Eddleman, an analyst at APS Financial Corp. of Houston,
who has been tracking the value of the Bank of New England debt for
years.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement would provide the largest recovery by far for
Bank of New England creditors since the company failed. They have
received about $40 million in distributions to date.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New England Corp., which issued stock and bonds, was a
holding company that technically owned its banks as subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Months before it failed, Bank of New England Corp. had issued
$200 million in new bonds and distributed the money among its bank
subsidiaries. Once the money moved to the banks, it fell beyond the
legal grasp of bondholders and into the hands of the FDIC for good.
</P>
<P>
   Branch had charged that the banking company was actually
insolvent before the bond issue and well before the banks were
taken over by regulators. Dueling consultants issued hundreds of
pages of financial reports haggling over Bank of New England's
condition in the final months of its business life.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New England bondholders are divided into senior and
junior camps, depending on what types of securities they had
purchased. Senior creditors had filed claims for about $225 million
and junior creditors had claims of about $525 million.
</P>
<P>
   Eddleman said nearly all of the $140 million in the proposed
FDIC settlment would end up in the hands of senior bondholders.

LOTS AT STAKE IN WOODWARD FOR SKIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is a lot more at stake than a simple victory
for Skip Away in Saturday's $500,000 Woodward Stakes at Belmont
Park. While his four foes will be running for the $300,000 winner's
purse, Skip Away will be racing for an undefeated season, a leg up
on the all-time North American earnings record, and to keep his
place atop the Horse of the Year standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finally coming to understand that Skip Away is one
of the greatest horses of all time,'' said Sonny Hine, 67, who
trains Skip Away for his wife, Carolyn. ``Believe me, I don't say
that lightly. I've been around long enough to see some great
horses. All I tell people to do is look at Skip Away's record. He's
never had a break. He's raced in every important race there is and
he has always run his heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, age 5, has a lifetime record of 35-17-10-5 and
$9,206,360 in earnings. If he wins the Woodward and his next
scheduled start, the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont
Oct. 10, which offers $600,000 to the winner, he will break Cigar's
mark of $9,999,815. The big gray has won six in a row this year,
eight overall, and has not been beaten since the now-retired Formal
Gold ran away from him in last year's Woodward. Skip Away finished
1997 strongly, winning the Jockey Club for the second straight year
and the Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park. However, he lost
the Horse of the Year vote to 2-year-old Favorite Trick, which
embittered Hine, who is doing everything he can to make sure his
horse is not passed over again..
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taken this eight-race winning streak for people to
finally give him the respect he deserves, but I want to do more for
him,'' he said. ``He's been good to all of us. He gave Carolyn an
Eclipse Award (Owner of the Year). He helped the careers of some of
the jockeys who rode him. And he's been good for the game. I want
him to get that money title because I think it will make a lot of
people realize just what kind of horse they've been watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woodward offers Skip Away, the 6-5 choice, a stern test.
Free House, one of the best of last year's 3-year-olds, has
returned in tremendous form, capturing both of his starts this
season, including the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar Aug.
15, by open lengths. Gentlemen, who defeated Skip Away in last
year's Pimlico Special, is a little bit off his game this year at
age 6, but he's still one of the fastest horses in the country. As
if that's not enough, Coronado's Quest has won five in a row,
including the $1 million Haskell and the $750,000 Travers, and
might be this year's best 3-year-old. Only Running Stag, a European
invader who has been victorious at the Group III level on the
grass, seems overmatched in the elite field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Woodward has those three other good horses, and beating
them would certainly bring Skip Away some attention,'' said Hine.
``Then I really want to win the Jockey Club Gold Cup three years in
a row. Kelso won it five years in a row (1960-64), and to get
three, I think, would cause people to realize how great a horse
Skip Away is.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, of course, there's the Breeders' Cup. We spent
$480,000 to run (the supplemental fee to the $4 million Classic)
last year because we believed in our horse and he made us look
smart. So I would like for him to win back-to-back Breeders' Cups,
go to the farm as the top money earner, and go with everybody
knowing that he is one of the greatest horses of all time.''

VITAL SIGNS WEAK ON MONDAY DEBUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The networks will be ushering in the nw season
today. And if you liked what you saw last season, you'll probably
like this one too, because the themes are all familiar.
</P>
<P>
   NBC gives us two sitcoms about attractive single people in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   How unique.
</P>
<P>
   CBS unveils three new shows. There is a stand-up comic playing a
family man on Long Island. Can you say ``Raymond''? I knew you
could. The Eye also adds a medical drama not to be confused with
``Chicago Hope'' and, in the post-``Murphy Brown'' era, a show set
in a TV newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   And the WB's entry stars pretty young people in a small town
named for a body of water into which ``Dawson's Creek'' presumably
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at tonight's new offerings. &QL; 
CONRAD BLOOM &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Bloom (Mark Feuerstein) likes women, but maybe too much
for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's his demanding mother (who makes him be her partner
in ballroom dancing class), his needy ex-girlfriend or hippie
sister (who gets busted at an animal-rights rally), Conrad is
always called in to save the day.
</P>
<P>
   He's a sensitive, good-looking guy who would be a great catch,
except that all his platonic relationships take up so much time he
is rarely available to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad works in an advertising agency, which lends itself to
some pretty hacky humor. George Dorsey (Steve Landesberg) plays a
burned-out former advertising genius _ and Conrad's hero _ who has
turned his Clio Award into a bong.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein is very likable, and his timing gets the job done.
The show is at times funny, albeit too jokey.
</P>
<P>
   There are some terribly clunky scenes in the pilot, and the
older cast members _ like Linda Lavin (formerly of ``Alice''), who
plays Conrad's mom, and Landesberg _ seem out of place.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is an above-average sitcom with a lead character
women will love and guys still may want to be friends with. &QL; 
WILL &AMP; GRACE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a great idea. Introduce network television's first gay
leading man and then offend the very people you are trying to
appease.
</P>
<P>
   Will Truman (Eric McCormack) does a nice job of breaking any gay
stereotypes. He is a handsome lawyer who happens to be gay.
</P>
<P>
   But his friend Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes) is a different story.
When we first meet him, he's singing show tunes, and he continues
to build into a finicky, swishy crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   At the center, this is a buddy comedy between Will and Grace
(Debra Messing). By the end of the first episode, they are both
getting out of serious relationships. They are perfect for each
other. They understand a self-made pop-culture code language,
finish each other's sentences and are both attractive. But when
they kiss, ``Nothing.'' ``Not a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another common bond between them is that they both prefer men.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot story was motoring right along, with Will and Jack
becoming roommates and Grace on her way to getting married. Then
Will tells Grace she can do better than that. After that, the story
falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue is contrived throughout, and, despite the first gay
male lead, following ``Ellen's'' first gay lead character, this is
an ordinary sitcom, NBC style _ slick and urban and certainly
white. &QL; 
THE KING OF QUEENS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Doug Heffernan (Kevin James) is suspended in adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   He drives a truck, has three oddball buddies who urinate
outside, and he likes to call his friends ``mook'' and
``sphincter.'' All they want to do is talk about sex and watch
sports.
</P>
<P>
   Heffernan is also a teddy bear around his thinner and much more
attractive wife.
</P>
<P>
   His life seems complete when his wife gets him a 70-inch TV to
finish out his basement clubhouse, where he hangs with his guys,
one of whom _ now get this _ lives with his mother. This is a
running gag in the show as the guy defends himself by shouting,
``She doesn't drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy turns into agony as Doug's father-in-law (played by
Jerry Stiller in an apparent reprisal of his ``Seinfeld'' Frank
Costanza role) moves in. Not only does Stiller steal every scene
from the hapless series ``star,'' he moves into the basement. Bye
bye TV room.
</P>
<P>
   If this setup sounds familiar, it is. It's an almost
beat-for-beat repeat of the pilot episode for ``That's Life,'' a
miserable failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``King,'' a better program, still features some poor acting and
some outrageous turns for Stiller's character, a pot-smoking old
man who frequents hookers and talks in hip-hop lingo.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest thing in the pilot was the resolution to the
70-inch television dilemma. They move it into the bedroom, where it
jams up against the bed. Doug and his three amigos lie in bed and
watch the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for some reason, the television is gone in episode No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing?
</P>
<P>
   Could be. &QL; 
THE BRIAN BENBEN SHOW &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is more ripe for satire than the local news. Overblown
promos, sensationalized stories, choppers at the ready at the first
sign of a jaywalker.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, ``The Brian Benben Show'' misses most of that and
instead chooses to focus on the downfall of the title character,
played by an actor of the same name. Benben is demoted to
human-interest reporter after younger, more attractive anchors _
Chad Rockwell (Charles Esten) and Tabitha Berkeley (Lisa Thornhill)
_ are brought in and his friend and former human-interest reporter
is killed by a gorilla in a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The setup is weak, and the writing wavers from clunky to clever.
</P>
<P>
   The most annoying attribute to this show is the supporting cast.
Kevin LaRue plays former jock and sports anchor Wendell Pierce,
who, in a groaner of a scene, explains how he lost his groin in a
football game, and Billy Hernandez plays the gay meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   Benben will stop at nothing to get his job back, including
changing TelePrompTer copy to show up Rockwell. Sounds like a
fireable offense _ but not at this station. No one hardly cared.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is trying to cash in on Benben's (``Dream On'') supposed
name recognition by naming the show and the character after him.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew Benben was so well-known?
</P>
<P>
   If the producers shift the focus of the show and punch it up a
bit, he may actually have the name recognition to carry a show by
the end of the season. &QL; 
L.A. DOCTORS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Score one for smart scheduling.
</P>
<P>
   Men around the country will be watching ``Monday Night
Football.'' Those looking for something a little more substantial
will watch ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   And for people looking for three attractive, sensitive male
doctors and their strong female partner, there will be ``L.A.
Doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS has handed out what has traditionally been its best drama
time slot to a medical drama about guys who care about more than
making money. They leave a large practice and start their own,
trying to worry more about patient care than managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Olin (``thirtysomething'') plays Dr. Roger Cattan, a guy who
grew up poor in Van Nuys and now likes fast cars, fast women and
fancy watches that run on time. He hires a publicist for the
practice and commissions his girlfriend to decorate the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Craven plays family man Dr. Tim Lonner, who has two adopted
children. An earnest physician, he still is more concerned with his
time after work than during.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Roberts is Dr. Evan Newman, a sweet guy who is divorced and
is still friends with his ex-wife. He seems to care the most about
his patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Lee plays Dr. Sarah Church, a woman with tremendous
credentials who could get a higher-paying job but likes what the
fellas stand for.
</P>
<P>
   The show walks that fine line between touching and sappy with
varying degrees of success. It is very chatty and could use some
more laughs and a quicker pace.
</P>
<P>
   Any delusions of ``L.A. Doctors'' doing for medicine what ``L.A.
Law'' did for the legal profession are just that.
</P>
<P>
   However, CBS probably found a spot for this program where it
will get some time to find its legs and stick around. &QL; 
HYPERION BAY &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Boy that WB network loves teen idols living in small towns named
for bodies of water.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the Sweeneys. Dennis (a dark-haired Mark-Paul Gosselaar) is
a computer whiz who was the high school geek. His brother Nick
(Dylan Neal) was the popular tough guy growing up.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference a comma in a paycheck can make.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-driving Dennis, who wheels into town with hot new
girlfriend Jennifer (Sydney Penny), has talked his computer company
into opening up a plant in Hyperion (somewhere in Northern
California) that could save the dying town. As such, every move the
company makes is big news there.
</P>
<P>
   While his marriage is failing, Honda-driving Nick works for the
family's construction company.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is two guys going different directions on a
one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is the same in Hyperion Bay, and everyone is keeping
secrets. The girls who once shunned Dennis now flirt with him, and
even his own father may be intimidated by him.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the acting is just comical, however, as there is no real
emotion in the fights between the two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyperion Bay'' has more conflict than a border skirmish, and
it all seems forced. Dennis' girlfriend doesn't want to be in
Hyperion, and most others seem to want him gone.
</P>
<P>
   Me, too.

 &HT;     STEPHEN WRIGHT, REDUX 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I used to work in a fire hydrant factory.
 &HT;    You couldn't park anywhere near the place.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last week, I went to a furniture store to look for a
decaffeinated coffee
 &HT;    table. They couldn't help me.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I bought some batteries, but they weren't included.
 &HT;    So I had to buy them again.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I replaced the headlights on my car with strobe lights.
 &HT;    Now it looks like I'm the only one moving.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I wrote a song, but I can't read music.
 &HT;    Every time I hear a new song on the radio,
 &HT;    I think `Hey, maybe I wrote that.`
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I got my driver's license photo taken out of focus on purpose.
 &HT;    Now when I get pulled over the cop looks at it (moving it nearer
&AMP; farther,
 &HT;    trying to see it clearly)....and says,
 &HT;    `Here, you can go.`
 &HT;    
 &HT;    My neighbor has a circular driveway. He can't get out.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I have a hobby.
 &HT;    I have the world's largest collection of sea shells.
 &HT;    I keep it scattered on beaches all over the world.
 &HT;    Maybe you've seen some of it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;     REVERSE EXIT 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    At 3 am a desk clerk at a hotel gets a call from a drunk guy
asking what time the bar opens.
 &HT;    `It opens at noon,` answers the clerk.
 &HT;    About an hour, later he gets a call from the same guy, sounding
even drunker.
 &HT;    `What time does the bar open?` he asks.
 &HT;    `Same time as before - noon,` replies the clerk.
 &HT;    Another hour passes and he calls again, plastered. `Whatjoo shay
the bar opins at?`
 &HT;    The clerk then answers, `It opens at noon, but if you can't
wait, I can have room service send something up to you.`

karate chop from Japan.`
 &HT;    The little guy thinks `GEEZ` but he gets back up on the stool
and starts drinking again when all of a sudden WHACK the big dude
knocks him down AGAIN and says, `That was a judo chop from Korea.`
 &HT;    So the little guy has had enough of this so he leaves and is
gone for an hour or so and when comes back WHACK he knocks the big
dude off his stool and
 &HT;    out cold!!!

her husband. She explained to the artist what she wanted:
 &HT;    `You should paint me like I am. These little wrinkles, you put
them on your canvas. The lines under my eyes, the flab on my arms,
the turn in my nose, and the mole on my cheek, they all stay....BUT
on my hands you put lots of rings with big diamonds and emeralds
and bright jewels. Around my neck you put chains of gold and
diamonds. Do you understand?`
 &HT;    The artist looked at her in earnest and asked why she should
want such detail of real life in her physical appearance, but adorn
herself with the phony jewelry.
 &HT;    She replied: `When I die my husband will re-marry.

 &HT;     SEARCHING FOR MEANING WITH MISS AMERICA 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many ways to amuse yourself while you watch the
Miss America pageant this Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   You could try to reach a consensus about which contestant is
most likely to be abducted by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Or which is most convinced that God is on her side.
</P>
<P>
   Or which has spent the most money on electrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   You can work up a point-by-point comparison of pageant hosts
past and present, Bert Parks versus Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you're old enough to remember Bert Parks.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are, you know there's no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   You can compose your own Big Questions for the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Example: ``If you were Hillary Clinton would you run for
president in 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``What would you, as an individual, do to solve the Y2K
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``With three games left in the season, the Red Sox have a
four game lead for the American League wild card spot. Explain how
they can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   You can think up interesting platforms that might be adopted by
future contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Or stamping out phobophobia, the fear of fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   Or changing the name of the pageant to Ms. America.
</P>
<P>
   You can speculate wildly about which contestants have had
cosmetic surgery and what they've had done.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can decide if the results are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to figure out how many finalists are taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   And how many should be taking it.
</P>
<P>
   You can guess who's suffering from PMS.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's nervous about her tattoo showing.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's thinking: There must be an easier way than this to win
a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Stage a mini-debate. Resolved: Intelligent life doesn't begin
before age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Have a lively discussion about what exactly people mean when
they use the word ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare and contrast theories about why it's been 65 years since
someone from New England was crowned Miss America. What does this
say about us as a people?
</P>
<P>
   You can sit there and quietly hope that one of the finalists
will be a ventriloquist.
</P>
<P>
   Or somebody who plays ``Dueling Banjos'' on the accordian.
</P>
<P>
   Or roller skates to ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you're disappointed, you can try to guess what the
contestants real talents are, as opposed to the ones on display.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Vermont: cow-tipping.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Delaware: parallel parking.
</P>
<P>
   Miss California: ``X-Files'' trivia champion, Western states
division.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Connecticut: currently memorizing the opening paragraphs of
the 100 greatest novels of 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mississippi: has assembled the world's largest collection
of deviled egg plates.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Maine: juggles lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to guess how many contestants are dog people and how
many are cat people.
</P>
<P>
   And how many have actually described themselves as ``people
persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Decide which finalist looks the most different in real life,
i.e., when she's not wearing big hair and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   And which is most likley to be in big hair and make up all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Be grateful that you never had to parade around in a swimsuit in
front of 50 million people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This was our solution: Release the Clinton testimony tape but
limit its viewing to folks who know the name of their member of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Would our system work better if Americans elected a special
prosecutor and then had the attorney general appoint a president to
be investigated?
</P>
<P>
   Aunt Ilse from Oelwein says her favorite passage in the Starr
Report was the word ``Counsel'' because it's the very last word.
</P>
<P>
   What's the president's best defense against impeachment? No, not
legal strategies. It's Al Gore out giving speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of newspapers have called for the president to resign.
And, we bet, a few have had phone solicitors call him to take out a
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton has ordered the government to buy only recycled
paper. Appropriate for publishing recycled ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``America,'' says the president, ``has got a stake in rural
America.'' To say nothing of some steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Andrew plans to build a three-hole golf course at
Buckingham Palace. It's the royal family's approach to nearly
everything _ par-tee on!
</P>
<P>
   An unaccredited California law school is offering all its
courses on the Internet. Would graduates be known as, say, Bob
Smith, Esq. dot com?
</P>
<P>
   New figures show business at restaurants was down a bit
nationally in August. Maybe folks stayed home to eat up all the
stuff in the fridge in doggy bags.

them on your canvas. The lines under my eyes, the flab on my arms,

and bright jewels. Around my neck you put chains of gold and
diamonds. Do you understand?`
 &HT;    The artist looked at her in earnest and asked why she should

herself with the phony jewelry.

 &HT;     SEARCHING FOR MEANING WITH MISS AMERICA 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many ways to amuse yourself while you watch the
Miss America pageant this Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   You could try to reach a consensus about which contestant is
most likely to be abducted by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Or which is most convinced that God is on her side.
</P>
<P>
   Or which has spent the most money on electrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   You can work up a point-by-point comparison of pageant hosts
past and present, Bert Parks versus Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you're old enough to remember Bert Parks.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are, you know there's no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   You can compose your own Big Questions for the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Example: ``If you were Hillary Clinton would you run for
president in 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``What would you, as an individual, do to solve the Y2K
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``With three games left in the season, the Red Sox have a
four game lead for the American League wild card spot. Explain how
they can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   You can think up interesting platforms that might be adopted by
future contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Or stamping out phobophobia, the fear of fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   Or changing the name of the pageant to Ms. America.
</P>
<P>
   You can speculate wildly about which contestants have had
cosmetic surgery and what they've had done.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can decide if the results are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to figure out how many finalists are taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   And how many should be taking it.
</P>
<P>
   You can guess who's suffering from PMS.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's nervous about her tattoo showing.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's thinking: There must be an easier way than this to win
a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Stage a mini-debate. Resolved: Intelligent life doesn't begin
before age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Have a lively discussion about what exactly people mean when
they use the word ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare and contrast theories about why it's been 65 years since
someone from New England was crowned Miss America. What does this
say about us as a people?
</P>
<P>
   You can sit there and quietly hope that one of the finalists
will be a ventriloquist.
</P>
<P>
   Or somebody who plays ``Dueling Banjos'' on the accordian.
</P>
<P>
   Or roller skates to ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you're disappointed, you can try to guess what the
contestants real talents are, as opposed to the ones on display.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Vermont: cow-tipping.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Delaware: parallel parking.
</P>
<P>
   Miss California: ``X-Files'' trivia champion, Western states
division.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Connecticut: currently memorizing the opening paragraphs of
the 100 greatest novels of 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mississippi: has assembled the world's largest collection
of deviled egg plates.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Maine: juggles lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to guess how many contestants are dog people and how
many are cat people.
</P>
<P>
   And how many have actually described themselves as ``people
persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Decide which finalist looks the most different in real life,
i.e., when she's not wearing big hair and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   And which is most likley to be in big hair and make up all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Be grateful that you never had to parade around in a swimsuit in
front of 50 million people.

 &HT;    Nigeria drops charges against activist Soyinka
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Wole Soyinka took the news in stride Friday: Trying
to make peace with the Nobel Prize-winning writer, the military
government of Nigeria had dropped treason charges against him and
14 other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right thing has been done,'' said Soyinka, a leading
spokesman for Nigeria's democracy movement who teaches at Emory
University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Associated Press, military ruler Gen.
Abdulsalami Abubakar asked last week that the charges be dropped as
a move toward national reconciliation. Police spokesman Young
Arabamen confirmed to the AP Friday that the charges were withdrawn
on Abubakar's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka said he had been informed through informal contacts that
the charges were being dropped. Filed in March 1997, the treason
charges claimed Soyinka and the others were behind a series of
bombings against military authorities, but the accusations were
always widely believed to have been invented by the late dictator,
Sani Abacha, who died in June.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka had gone into self-imposed exile in 1994. Three of the
other accused also went into exile, while the 11 others went to
prison until their release following Abacha's death.
</P>
<P>
   While lifting the charges should clear the way for Soyinka to
return to his country, he said he had no immediate plans for a
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us who have been in exile have remained involved very
intensely in the struggle to remove the dictatorship,'' he said.
``We can now begin to act in a more positive way to become involved
in an authentic democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   But he made clear that the effort to restore democracy to
Nigeria, which has been dominated by the military for all but a
decade since gaining independence from Britain in 1960, is
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very, very uncharitable if we said no progress is
being made,'' Soyinka said. Abubakar has promised a return to
civilian rule next year; many prisoners have been released; and the
press has been allowed to operate more freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are following all these various details,'' Soyinka said.
But he added that the Nigerian people, whose hopes have been dashed
before, have been treated brutally over the years and that
structures ensuring democratic proceedings still are needed.

 &HT;    Powder may tie Rudolph to '96 bomb
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Federal law enforcement officials say they have
connected Eric Robert Rudolph to smokeless powder purchased in
Tennessee about four years ago and used in the 1996 bombing in
Centennial Olympic Park that killed an Albany woman and injured 111
people.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents have
said for months they want to question Rudolph, a fugitive now
believed to be in the western North Carolina mountains, about three
bombings in Atlanta, but the powder evidence appears to connect
Rudolph directly to the Atlanta bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Agents say they have interviewed a Tennessee gun dealer who
identified Rudolph as the man who bought from him a ``special
order'' of about 50 pounds of smokeless powder. They have connected
the powder to the park bomb, agents said. The Tennessee man has not
been charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, agents say they have evidence that the
dynamite-and-nail bomb that killed an off-duty Birmingham police
officer at an Alabama abortion clinic Jan. 29 was detonated
remotely, indicating that the bomber saw his target before he
activated the device.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Robert DeWayne Sanderson, 35, was killed as he
investigated a package that held the bomb. It was left near the
front door of Birmingham's New Woman All Women Health Clinic,
shortly after Sanderson reported to work at his extra job as a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, an itinerate carpenter from Murphy, N.C., who turns 32
today, has been charged with the Birmingham bombing. Rudolph
disappeared Jan. 30 and remains a fugitive with a bounty of up to
$1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Information on new evidence was confirmed by four federal law
enforcement agents connected to the investigation who asked not to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   A man who has been identified as Rudolph was seen within two
blocks of the Birmingham clinic after the blast. The witness who
identified Rudolph said he slipped off a blond wig and drove off in
a truck. The witness copied the license number, and law enforcement
officials determined the truck was registered to Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   Agents said the ATF lab found evidence that the bomb was fitted
with components used in remote detonation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing here is, that changes the whole perspective,''
said Bob Finke, retired from the ATF and Army Special Forces.
``Now, if he has a remote device, he is definitely trying to kill
people. With the other (Atlanta) bombs, (the bomber) didn't know
who he was going to get. He couldn't be certain. Now, he is
certain. It's basically an assassination. That's what it amounts
to.''
</P>
<P>
   The single blast at Centennial Olympic Park in July 1996 was
followed in January 1997 by two explosions at a Sandy Springs
abortion clinic and in February 1997 by the bombing of an Atlanta
gay nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   In Olympic Park, an anonymous call warned police that a bomb
would explode in 30 minutes; the blast occurred 20 minutes later.
In Sandy Springs, a second bomb known as a ``gotcha'' bomb exploded
as police and federal agents investigated. Police detonated a
second bomb by robot at the nightclub. In each case, investigators
have said the bomber may have designed the sequence of events to
kill law enforcement officers, and they speculate he may have
changed to a remote detonation in Birmingham to insure he hit his
target. Federal officials said they think the same bomber planted
all the Atlanta devices, which were detonated with timing devices
using Westclox Big Ben clocks or Baby Big Ben clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Using a remote detonator, the bomber would have been in a
position to see what was happening, said Finke, now a security
consultant with IPSA International in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He punches a button,'' Finke said. ``The receiver is in the
device, and a transmitter is in his hand. A clock could be used to
arm the device. He could be as far away as six blocks using
binoculars even.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from a very unsophisticated device (a pipe bomb in
Olympic Park) to a sophisticated device,'' Finke added. ``When you
get into remotes, you are talking sophistication. Does he have that
knowledge?''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph was a rifleman in the army's 101st Airborne for 18
months until he was kicked out after he tested positive for
marijuana use, agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Enderson, FBI inspector in charge of the Southeast Bomb
Task Force, came as close as he ever has to naming Rudolph a
suspect in the Atlanta cases earlier this week when he said
investigators had ``developed additional evidence'' linking the
fugitive to the five devices planted here. He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Charging Rudolph in the Atlanta cases, he said, would be a U.S.
Department of Justice decision.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to decide whether to prosecute Rudolph
first in Birmingham where they have an identification, or in
Atlanta where the evidence will be based strongly on the forensics
or makeup of the bombs. It's possible they could try him for all
the bombings at once under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations (RICO) Act that makes it illegal to cross state lines
to commit a crime such as a bombing, arson or murder for hire.
</P>
<P>
   There is not a single piece of evidence - other than components
that are generic in nature - that links all six devices. The
evidence describes more of a zig-zag pattern, with some parts of
one or more bombs matching some parts of others, investigators
said.
</P>
<P>
   The park bomb, which killed Alice Hawthorne of Albany, was made
from galvanized steel pipes packed with nails and smokeless powder.
Two dynamite bombs, the second filled with nails for shrapnel,
exploded at the Sandy Springs clinic, and two dynamite bombs, both
packed with nails, were planted at the Otherside Lounge on Piedmont
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence pointing to Rudolph, agents have said, includes
fibers consistent with a blond wig found in a storage unit Rudolph
rented in Murphy, and, in the same storage unit, 1 1/2-inch
flooring nails that came from the same batch as the nails used in
the Sandy Springs abortion clinic double-blast. Also, traces of
nitroglycerine were found in Rudolph's truck abandoned Feb. 7 over
a mountain ridge from the Murphy trailer where he had been living.

 &HT;    Pilgramage of slavery makes its way to Atlanta area
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For the past four months, 65 sojourners have walked
15 to 20 miles a day tracing the pilgrimage of slavery in this
country. The group of men, women and children have trod the back
roads of America without much fanfare, but with a determination
fueled by prayers and commitment to peace and healing.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which began its journey in Leverett, Mass., is
expected to arrive in the city of Atlanta today. The interracial,
multicultural contingent will visit the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Non-Violence Social Change today and, on Sunday, attend
a ``Worship Celebration of the Middle Passage Pilgrimage'' at First
Iconium Baptist Church on Moreland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to plant some seeds of consciousness,'' said
Ingrid Askew, an African-American Massachusetts actress who helped
organize the walk with Sister Claire Carter, a Japanese Buddhist
nun.
</P>
<P>
   As the travelers make their way across the country, churches and
other organizations have been providing food and water. On
Thursday, when the group passed through Covington, 35 east of
downtown Atlanta, the Rev. Hezekiah Benton, Jr. and members of the
Bethlehem Baptist Church served the group a dinner of collard
greens, green beans, baked chicken, corn bread and rice. The dinner
was sponsored by the African American Arts Council of Covington.
</P>
<P>
   The journey has included visits to four Georgia cities where
slaves worked large plantations, and the site of a slave market in
Louisville, located near Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   The route of the pilgrimage was developed by John Bracey, a
historian in the W.E.B. Dubois African American Studies Department
at the University of Massachusetts. The walk in America is
scheduled to end Nov. 3 in New Orleans. Walkers will board a ship
there headed for West Africa. By Jan. 1, a group of European
walkers called the ``Jubilee Pilgrimage'' will meet up with their
American counterparts in Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   The Nipponzan Myohoji Buddhist Order, a walking order of monks,
is a strong backer of the pilgrimage. The order has been connected
with the world peace movement since World War II. However, the
pilgrimage includes people from all walks of life. For example,
Louise Dunlap is a college professor from Cambridge, Mass. Gregory
Dean-Smith of Washington and Aaron Jones of San Francisco are
actors. Tim Liggett, Raina Askew and Christianna Abel are high
school students. Ronald McDonald is a barber; Tizita Assefa is a
college student. The group also has a political activist, Pio
Celestino of Peru, who has been working with Mexican refugees in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Burton, a Bulgarian pacifist who lives in California,
only read about the struggles associated with slavery growing up in
Bulgaria. He joined the walk because he sees it as a spiritual
journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing what I can to help people come together to work out
issues,'' said Burton, who is carrying the group's two flags
representing the earth and world citizenship as the group walks.
</P>
<P>
   Hirofumi Nasu of Japan quit his job as a pharmaceutical
wholesaler to join the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is beyond time and place,'' Nasu said. ``We
brought Koreans into our country as charges, did not pay them or
paid them cheaper wages_ that's like slavery. Slavery is one of the
mistakes of history. I am a Buddhist walking and praying to purify
history.''

 &HT;    Amendment to suit charges both Yagers
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The Philadelphia millionaire who blames Faye Yager
for the disappearance of this two children now wants to make
Yager's husband a part of a $100 million lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Bipin Shah, an electronic banking entrepreneur, on Friday filed
a amendment to an earlier lawsuit in federal court in Atlanta. The
amendment proposes that Howard Yager be named as a defendant and
accuses the couple of racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Yager is the controversial operator of the Children of the
Underground, a network of safe houses that hides children, and
generally their mothers, from allegedly abusive fathers.
</P>
<P>
   While Faye Yager has been sued before _ she was tried and
acquitted in 1992 in Cobb County on kidnapping and child cruelty
charges _ until this summer her husband hasn't been party to those
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Chilivis, the Atlanta attorney representing Shah, said that
while gathering evidence for the original lawsuit filed in January,
Shah learned that Howard Yager is more involved in the underground
than previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   Before she stopped giving interviews this summer, Yager told
reporters from Time and Philadelphia Magazine that she helped
Shah's ex-wife, Ellen Dever, vanish in June 1997 with Sarah, now 8,
and Genevieve, now 6, despite the fact that no one had accused Shah
of harming the girls.
</P>
<P>
   Like an $80 million lawsuit filed in federal court in July by a
Connecticut man looking for his son for a year, the Shah suit now
accuses the Yagers of racketeering. By placing people underground,
the lawsuit asserts, the Yagers engage in organized criminal
activity, including kidnapping, misuse of passports and money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says that Faye Yager often sells the property of the
women going underground and keeps the proceeds. The Yagers also
often keep the property for their own use, the lawsuit states.
</P>
<P>
   A red Jeep Grand Cherokee owned by Ellen Dever was involved in
an accident on April 13 while being driven by Jay Wilcox Davis, a
friend of the Yagers. Wilcox repeatedly invoked her rights against
self-incrimination during an August hearing regarding the case of
the Connecticut man.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Yager's attorney, Robert Schroeder, said he hadn't seen a
copy of the lawsuit and couldn't comment.

 &HT;     STEPHEN WRIGHT, REDUX 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I used to work in a fire hydrant factory.
 &HT;    You couldn't park anywhere near the place.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Last week, I went to a furniture store to look for a
decaffeinated coffee
 &HT;    table. They couldn't help me.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I bought some batteries, but they weren't included.
 &HT;    So I had to buy them again.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I replaced the headlights on my car with strobe lights.
 &HT;    Now it looks like I'm the only one moving.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I wrote a song, but I can't read music.
 &HT;    Every time I hear a new song on the radio,
 &HT;    I think `Hey, maybe I wrote that.`
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I got my driver's license photo taken out of focus on purpose.
 &HT;    Now when I get pulled over the cop looks at it (moving it nearer
&AMP; farther,
 &HT;    trying to see it clearly)....and says,
 &HT;    `Here, you can go.`
 &HT;    
 &HT;    My neighbor has a circular driveway. He can't get out.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I have a hobby.
 &HT;    I have the world's largest collection of sea shells.
 &HT;    I keep it scattered on beaches all over the world.
 &HT;    Maybe you've seen some of it.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;     REVERSE EXIT 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    At 3 am a desk clerk at a hotel gets a call from a drunk guy
asking what time the bar opens.
 &HT;    `It opens at noon,` answers the clerk.
 &HT;    About an hour, later he gets a call from the same guy, sounding
even drunker.
 &HT;    `What time does the bar open?` he asks.
 &HT;    `Same time as before - noon,` replies the clerk.
 &HT;    Another hour passes and he calls again, plastered. `Whatjoo shay
the bar opins at?`
 &HT;    The clerk then answers, `It opens at noon, but if you can't
wait, I can have room service send something up to you.`
 &HT;    
 &HT;    `No! I don't wanna git in, ah wanna git OUT!`
 &HT;    
 &HT;     AMERICAN INGENUITY 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    There was this little guy sitting in a bar, drinking, minding
his own business when all of a sudden this great big dude comes in
and WHACK he knocks him off the bar stool and says, `That was a
karate chop from Japan.`
 &HT;    The little guy thinks `GEEZ` but he gets back up on the stool
and starts drinking again when all of a sudden WHACK the big dude
knocks him down AGAIN and says, `That was a judo chop from Korea.`
 &HT;    So the little guy has had enough of this so he leaves and is
gone for an hour or so and when comes back WHACK he knocks the big
dude off his stool and
 &HT;    out cold!!!
 &HT;    The little guy looks at the bartender and says, `When he comes
to, tell him that is a crowbar from Sears.`

them on your canvas. The lines under my eyes, the flab on my arms,
the turn in my nose, and the mole on my cheek, they all stay....BUT
on my hands you put lots of rings with big diamonds and emeralds
and bright jewels. Around my neck you put chains of gold and
diamonds. Do you understand?`
 &HT;    The artist looked at her in earnest and asked why she should
want such detail of real life in her physical appearance, but adorn
herself with the phony jewelry.
 &HT;    She replied: `When I die my husband will re-marry.

 &HT;     SEARCHING FOR MEANING WITH MISS AMERICA 
 &HT;     By DIANE WHITE    c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are so many ways to amuse yourself while you watch the
Miss America pageant this Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   You could try to reach a consensus about which contestant is
most likely to be abducted by aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Or which is most convinced that God is on her side.
</P>
<P>
   Or which has spent the most money on electrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   You can work up a point-by-point comparison of pageant hosts
past and present, Bert Parks versus Boomer Esiason.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you're old enough to remember Bert Parks.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are, you know there's no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   You can compose your own Big Questions for the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Example: ``If you were Hillary Clinton would you run for
president in 2000?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``What would you, as an individual, do to solve the Y2K
problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``With three games left in the season, the Red Sox have a
four game lead for the American League wild card spot. Explain how
they can lose.''
</P>
<P>
   You can think up interesting platforms that might be adopted by
future contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian rights.
</P>
<P>
   Or stamping out phobophobia, the fear of fear itself.
</P>
<P>
   Or changing the name of the pageant to Ms. America.
</P>
<P>
   You can speculate wildly about which contestants have had
cosmetic surgery and what they've had done.
</P>
<P>
   Then you can decide if the results are worth it.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to figure out how many finalists are taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   And how many should be taking it.
</P>
<P>
   You can guess who's suffering from PMS.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's nervous about her tattoo showing.
</P>
<P>
   Or who's thinking: There must be an easier way than this to win
a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Stage a mini-debate. Resolved: Intelligent life doesn't begin
before age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Have a lively discussion about what exactly people mean when
they use the word ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Compare and contrast theories about why it's been 65 years since
someone from New England was crowned Miss America. What does this
say about us as a people?
</P>
<P>
   You can sit there and quietly hope that one of the finalists
will be a ventriloquist.
</P>
<P>
   Or somebody who plays ``Dueling Banjos'' on the accordian.
</P>
<P>
   Or roller skates to ``Amazing Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you're disappointed, you can try to guess what the
contestants real talents are, as opposed to the ones on display.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Vermont: cow-tipping.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Delaware: parallel parking.
</P>
<P>
   Miss California: ``X-Files'' trivia champion, Western states
division.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Connecticut: currently memorizing the opening paragraphs of
the 100 greatest novels of 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Mississippi: has assembled the world's largest collection
of deviled egg plates.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Maine: juggles lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to guess how many contestants are dog people and how
many are cat people.
</P>
<P>
   And how many have actually described themselves as ``people
persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Decide which finalist looks the most different in real life,
i.e., when she's not wearing big hair and makeup.
</P>
<P>
   And which is most likley to be in big hair and make up all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Be grateful that you never had to parade around in a swimsuit in
front of 50 million people.

CLINTON'S LEGAL ADVISERS SAY THEY WERE FORCED TO AGREE TO
VIDEOTAPING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)   (See also: CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-CONGRESS-MOOD, CLINTON-BLACKS,

 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers and advisers said
Friday that they were forced to agree to the videotaping of his
grand jury appearance last month in order to win other concessions
the president wanted from Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton and his lawyers agreed he would testify before the
grand jury, they said, Clinton wanted most of all to avoid having
to travel to the federal courthouse downtown to appear in person
before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The White House advisers who have been subject to merciless
second-guessing for allowing the videotape to be made said in
interviews that they were always aware that the tape could be aired
publicly in an effort to wound Clinton. But they said that, in the
end, they had little choice but to agree to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew right from the beginning that the video was a
bad thing,'' said one adviser who took part in the discussions and
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``We all knew it entailed a
major risk.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, among the problems Clinton's advisers expect in
endless television replays of his testimony is one early sequence
in which the president engages in an odd colloquy with one of the
prosecutors over whether he is prepared to ``tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth,'' especially the phrase,
``the whole truth.'' People familiar with the testimony said
Clinton might come across in that segment, as well as in others, as
needlessly argumentative.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's advisers said they were annoyed that even
though the president knew he was being videotaped he behaved rashly
at times during his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that was part of Starr's strategy in making the taping
of the testimony one of his prime conditions, especially since he
now contends that the tape shows ``evidence of a crime,' meaning
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had a different set of priorities for his lawyers to
negotiate. The White House was most eager to obtain a series of
concessions from Starr, most importantly the agreement that the
president would not have to appear personally before the grand jury
in the federal courthouse. Clinton, the advisers said, was adamant
that his negotiators insure that he testify by closed-circuit
television from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, one explained, is that Hillary Rodham Clinton was
upset, even traumatized, by the carnival atmosphere that attended
her appearance before the Whitewater grand jury at the federal
courthouse in January 1996. The White House also wanted Starr to
withdraw the subpoena so the president could assert he was
testifying voluntarily and wanted to ensure that his lawyers could
remain with him during the session.
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the testimony on Aug. 17, White House
advisers again asked the president to reconsider his refusal to
travel to the courthouse, arguing that such a move would block a
videotape from being made. But the president refused, they said,
and agreed to have the testimony videotaped.
</P>
<P>
   The Starr team initially told the White House negotiators that
it was necessary to make a tape to play later to grand jurors who
could not be present on the day Clinton testified via a two-way
television hook-up. On that day, Clinton's lawyers said they asked
whether all 23 grand jurors were present in the courtroom downtown,
but Starr had refused to answer. Lawyers familiar with the grand
jury operation said not all were present during the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Friday withheld public comment on the
Judiciary Committee's plan to release the videotape on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, officials were quick to seize on what
they perceived as an unexpected benefit _ the stark demonstration
of partisanship in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a potential for our enemies to do for us what we
haven't been able to do ourselves,'' said one senior adviser to
Clinton. ``We've been grappling all week, trying to find a way to
unite congressional Democrats, and the truth is they just won't
unite around a defense of Clinton for a variety of reasons _ some
of them very sound.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the official added, ``the Republicans, God bless them, they
have finally given congressional Democrats a reason to coalesce''_-
not necessarily around the president, he said, but at least against
the Republican tactics.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's advisers watched Friday's events unfold on
television, they were delighted to see one Democrat after another _
including some who have been critical of Clinton for years _ step
up to microphones to lambaste the Republicans as partisans trying
to railroad the president and force-feed smut to the American
public.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just seems to me the House within a few days has turned
into a snake pit and a war room,'' said Rep. David Obey, a
Wisconsin Democrat who is not on the committee. Obey has harshly
criticized Clinton for a variety of issues over the years, painting
him as someone who is politically unreliable.

A BRIGHT TAX NOTE IN THOSE SORRY FUND RETURNS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)  (af)  
 By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oof!
</P>
<P>
   That is what a lot of mutual fund shareholders will feel when
they open their next account statement. This quarter through Sept.
17, the average general equity fund was off 15 percent, according
to Lipper Analytical Services, the Summit, N.J., research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Returns for the average small-capitalization stock fund were far
worse, down 22.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors with taxable accounts can do something about those
losses by taking advantage of one of the best features of mutual
funds: the ability to generate tax losses to offset realized gains
and then up to $3,000 of earned income, while allowing investors to
keep the same mix in their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Other investments, if sold at a loss, can also create a tax
deduction, but traders must not not run afoul of the ``wash sale''
rule of the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   It forbids them to claim the deduction if, after selling the
security, they repurchase it or a ``substantially identical'' one,
as the IRS puts it, within 30 days of the sale. It is far easier to
comply with that rule, while still replacing the holding, when
investing in funds than when trading stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Funds are distinct legal entities, said Rande Spiegelman, a
manager at KPMG Peat Marwick in San Francisco, so the IRS treats
even virtual fund clones as if they are as different as chalk and
cheese.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of money is at stake? Spiegelman used the example of
Montgomery Emerging Markets, which was down 44.5 percent this year
through the market low on Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   An investor who put $10,000 in the fund at the beginning of the
year would have a short-term loss on paper of $4,170 as of Aug. 31.
If he realizes the loss, it can be used to reduce his tax bill by
as much as $1,651, if he is in the top 39.6 percent federal
bracket, lowering his out-of-pocket loss to $2,519.
</P>
<P>
   This means that the investor who wants to keep his
emerging-markets exposure can afford to reinvest $7,481 _ the
$5,830 realized on the sale plus the $1,651 in tax savings _ in a
similar offering.
</P>
<P>
   With the number of funds expanding, it is getting easier for
investors to find a close double for almost any portfolio.
Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, can determine
a ``best fit'' based on portfolio characteristics like standard
deviation and market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   For Montgomery Emerging Markets, for example, Morningstar picked
Vanguard International Equity Index Emerging Markets Portfolio.
That fund, down 37.1 percent for the year through Aug. 31, did
better than its Montgomery rival; it also has a lower expense
ratio.

CON MAN HAMPTON ARRESTED IN ALLEGED CHECK THEFT, ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Joseph C. Keane met the man at a South End bar in
May, he called himself Antonio, told Keane he was attending Harvard
Law School, and that he was originally from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The two men struck up a friendship and went to Keane's home,
eventually spending several days together before, according to
Keane, his-new found friend stole his checks and assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Keane learned that Antonio was really David Edgar
Hampton Jr., a con man whose scam of some liberal New Yorkers in
the early 1980s inspired the prize-winning play and popular movie,
``Six Degrees of Separation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really impressed. He said he was writing a book. He's
very smart. He's a good talker,'' Keane said Friday about Hampton.
``Obviously, for what he does for a living you have to be
intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Hampton Tuesday with Keane's help.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Keane said he was unaware of
the play and movie until told about it by a reporter Friday. He
added that Hampton, when he took his hat off, ``looked just like
Will Smith.'' The actor Will Smith portrayed the Hampton-inspired
character in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Hampton posed as the son of actor Sidney Poitier
and ingratiated himself into the lives of the New Yorkers.
Playwright David Guare turned that into a one-act play that Globe
stage critic Kevin Kelly called ``a fable in which what is false
has as much power as fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who spent 21 months in prison for the Poitier scam, was
in the Nashua Street Jail Friday being held on $500 cash bail. He
is charged with attacking Keane and cashing two of Keane's checks
after forging Keane's signature on them. Keane said that while
Hampton was in his apartment, Hampton stole six checks from his
check book.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned about a $500 drop in his account balance, Keane
confronted Hampton, who attacked Keane with his own belt and
threatened him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever tell anyone about this, you're dead,'' Hampton
told Keane, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   After their confrontation in May, Keane said he did not see
Hampton again until this Tuesday when he saw him at another bar in
the South End. Keane summoned Boston police, who took Hampton into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   In Hampton's backpack, police found a Harvard University student
identification card in the name of Patrick P. Owens, a birth
certificate with the same name, a California identification card
for Patrick Owens and a Social Security card in that name.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday whether Owens is the name of a student at
Harvard or if Hampton is attending the law school. Spokesmen for
the university could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found a Columbia University identificaton in the
name of Kerry J. Duran and an identification card in that name.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton also had a passport and other identification in his own
name.
</P>
<P>
   At Hampton's arraignment Tuesday in Boston Municipal Court,
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II's office asked that
bail be set at $25,000 cash, said spokesman James Borghesani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was a flight risk,'' he said. ``I don't think this
the type of guy, if he gets out, is going to willingly hang around
and run back to court. We were worried about his coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles Johnson set bail at $500 cash. Hampton remained
jailed on that bail Friday. But Keane said he is concerned about
his safety should Hampton be released and has obtained a
restraining order against Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through some pretty rough things, but this is pretty
bad,'' Keane said, adding that he has become suspicious of people
since his encounter with Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Keane then mused aloud about Hampton. ``So I busted someone
famous,'' he said. ``My horoscope said I would come into a lot of
money in September. I wish it was money instead of this.''

TEXTILE TRIUMPH: A FABRIC MAKER'S TAPESTRY FOR SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (For release Sunday, Sept. 20)  
 (bl)  
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALL RIVER, Mass. _ What could Larry Liebenow have been thinking
in 1989, when he decided to buy Quaker Fabric Corp., an ailing,
43-year-old business in this struggling mill town?
</P>
<P>
   Deserted decades ago by textile companies and other basic
manufacturing industries, Fall River has suffered along with the
rest of southeastern Massachusetts as the state's already high
labor, energy and health care costs have continued to rise. And in
this crowded coastal region, land suitable for a sprawling modern
factory building is hard to come by at any price.
</P>
<P>
   But Liebenow, now 55, a textile veteran whose career has taken
him to Mexico and Argentina, saw possibilities. ``One of the
greatest advantages up here often goes unmentioned: the
particularly high quality of the work force,'' Liebenow said.
``They're committed, energetic and productive. They offset the
disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   The reborn Quaker Fabric, along with other thriving factories,
is unraveling conventional wisdom that good times are gone forever
from the state's industrial base.
</P>
<P>
   Quaker is now the largest maker of chenille yarn in the world
and one of the top three United States manufacturers of upholstery
fabric for the furniture industry. It expects 1998 sales of about
$280 million, a 28 percent gain from last year, and net income of
$14.6 million, up 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, after Quaker completes a new plant that was announced
last month, its annual production capacity will grow to about 80
million yards, from about 27 million yards in 1991, and it will
employ 3,100 people, up from 2,400 today.
</P>
<P>
   The company's success mirrors that of the state. After three
decades of decline, productivity, export growth and job growth in
Massachusetts have outpaced the nation since 1995, according to
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI research unit.
</P>
<P>
   Textile-making was one of New England's first large-scale
industries, and it flourished here for a century before the lures
of low taxes, cheap labor and light regulation began drawing
companies to other states or to Latin America and Asia after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. upholstery fabric industry is now largely concentrated
in the Southeast. With annual sales of roughly $2 billion, it
accounts for about half the global market, which has grown steadily
at about 5 percent a year for two decades and shows no sign of
slowing, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry has fertile ground to sow as aging boomers and
their children cocoon around the entertainment pit,'' said John
Baugh, an analyst with Wheat First Union in Richmond, Va. As they
snuggle in, these buyers are gravitating toward soft, cushiony
sofas, chairs and Ottomans covered with the types of luxurious
fabric that are Quaker's forte, Baugh said.
</P>
<P>
   The softness of Quaker's woven brocade and damask upholstery
fabrics comes from feathery chenille yarn, a product that Liebenow
brought with him _ along with his client list, machinery, top
executives and investors _ when he merged Nortex International, the
yarn maker he ran, with Quaker in 1989. Liebenow knew Quaker well
because Nortex had been supplying it with yarn for six years.
</P>
<P>
   His formula for reviving the fortunes of Quaker _ which had
about 800 workers in 1989, when it lost $7.4 million on revenue of
$80 million _ was to rebuild the company as a ``vertically
integrated'' yarn and upholstery operation. He renovated its
four-story brick mill complex and brought in new high-speed looms
and spinners. The company recruited designers to create new
products, courted export sales _ now 20 percent of its output _ and
expanded into fabrics for cars and commercial furniture. Liebenow
took Quaker public in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The company has seen its earnings growth slow this year, in what
analysts describe as growing pains associated with capital
expansion that will amount to $120 million of new equipment to meet
strong demand. The situation hurt the company's stock price even
before the late-summer market slide, pushing it down from a 52-week
high of $21.58 in April to $9.875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Quaker has a $69.9 million backlog of orders, the largest in
the industry, said Baugh of Wheat First, and analysts expect profit
growth to pick up next year.
</P>
<P>
   Quaker's major rival is Joan/Mastercraft, a privately held
fabric maker with factories in Massachusetts and North Carolina and
sales of about $500 million a year. Two other competitors, based in
the South, are Burlington Industries and Culp.
</P>
<P>
   Quaker must still cope with the inefficiencies of its old mill
buildings and with the high costs of doing business in
Massachusetts, but Liebenow is confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get so caught up in high tech,'' he said. ``We
forget that basic industries _ which can offer stable jobs to a
broad range of the population _ have found ways to reinvent
themselves and be globally competitive.''

SEX, LIES AND CLINTON! SCANDAL AS SOAP OPERA  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - I am appalled. Not so much at the president and his
zipper _ which is now an open-and-shut case _ but at the way the
issue is playing out in the American public and press.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems as if the entire Clinton fiasco is more soap
opera than a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatis personae are assumed to act not like complex human
beings, but like simpletons in low drama:
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected to fall in love with the President,'' Monica
Lewinsky testified in the now infamous Starr Report. ``I'm
surprised that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   She called him ``Handsome;'' he called her ``Sweetie.'' It was
in all the papers. And I mean ``The New York Times'' and the
``Washington Post,'' to say nothing of ``The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, those are the less squalid parts of the report.
</P>
<P>
   But it plays into the same tabloid mentality that I hear all
around me. The real tabloids only put into words what I hear
ordinary people around me saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary &AMP; Monica SHOWDOWN!'' wrote the ``National Enquirer.''
``It's an all out war between First Lady and `The Tramp.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to strangle her,'' Hillary told a friend, at least as
quoted in the tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Monica, in turn, supposedly told the paper, ``Bill wouldn't have
sought refuge in my arms if you weren't such a cold bitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Hillary a suffering wife, a conniving wife or a business
partner? We cannot know, but the popular press squeezes her _ and
everyone else involved _ into the tight shackles of melodrama. So
little imagination. It is as if the whole plot were dreamed up in a
trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same way with Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Did she finall9AEK9 true love with Dodi? Wasn't she special the
way she cared so much?
</P>
<P>
   ``These were two people who recognized themselves in each other,
who really understood the other's hopes, dreams, wishes, fears and
pain,'' Rene Delorm told the ``Enquirer.'' He was Dodi Al Fayed's
butler.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``National Examiner,'' Princess Di's son, Prince William
warns Camilla Parker Bowles, ``You'll NEVER be my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   There are recurring fantasies in the supermarket tabloids:
</P>
<P>
   Being a celebrity means lots of champagne and glamorous parties
_ to say nothing of oodles of kinky sex _ yet they are no happier
than us ordinary people. In fact, they suffer terrible tragedies of
drug dependency, heartache and spousal abuse. Yet, there is always
the hope that they will lose weight, find true love and start
producing babies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every celebrity story in a tabloid exploits one or
another portion of that monotonous story. Sometimes they wear good
clothes while acting out their parts in the melodrama; sometimes
they are fashion accidents, with lots of accusatory photos. Madonna
is in every tabloid this week, for instance, with her sweatshirt
drawn up over her head, hiding from the paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   But it's OK; she has her baby.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone has a tragedy that can be overcome. Christopher
Reeve can walk again, Kirstie Alley battles the bulge _ for love.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities have loose morals, but all they really want is
babies and a steady mate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ``Star,'' Carolyn Kennedy is ``desperate for
baby to save marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Page 1 headline reads ``JFK baby heartache wrecking
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Star'' gossip is that Sharon Stone could be pregnant, as she
``sports a suspicious belly bulge'' on the set of her new movie.
</P>
<P>
   And Cindy Crawford decided to pose nude for ``Playboy''
magazine, reports the ``National Enquirer,'' because she wants to
have a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be my last chance to be a sexy siren in a men's
magazine,'' Cindy told a friend.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems as if the entire Clinton scandal could be
solved if only Hillary would have a baby, or failing that, if
Monica would. We don't care, just as long as somebody gets pregnant
and we all ``ooh'' over the infant.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of pundits have lamented the ``tabloidization'' of the
mainstream press. Stories that would never have been touched in
earlier years make it to Page 1 now, and editors across the land
worry over having to print words they would never have considered
before.
</P>
<P>
   I have to laugh now when I remember the terrible fuss editors
made over whether we could actually print in a family newspaper
what Lorena Bobbitt did. That seems an eon ago in another world.
Now we are forced to print what a president does with his cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't simply that the press makes a fable out of the
headlines. We have always done that. In fact, newspapers naturally
function as a kind of throw-away literature. Like the bigger,
thicker classics, they give us object lessons in behavior and
culture.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the lessons the press is increasingly
presenting us is so boringly conventional and unimaginative.
</P>
<P>
   When we read of Anna Karenina, we read of complex emotions
played out against long development and background. The thoughts
expressed are rich, intelligent and most importantly, adult.
</P>
<P>
   The same for most great literature: ``Madame Bovary, The Scarlet
Letter,'' even ``The Iliad.'' Such classics discuss adultery but do
so with subtlety. The complexity of their psychologies and the
social interactions depicted enlarge our understanding of
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Americans approach the saga of Bill, Hillary and
Monica is in contrast one-dimensional: adolescent and smirky.
</P>
<P>
   There is undoubtedly a larger, involved, complicated and adult
version of the current scandal. Perhaps a novelist will one day
write it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not what we read in the papers or talk about over
office coffee. There, it is as if we have regressed to our teenage
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is all too ordinary. &QL;

 &HT;    Carson's president quits in shake-up
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Carson Inc. announced Friday that Joyce Roche, its
president since 1995, had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Roche's resignation comes on the heels of a management
restructuring at Carson, which makes Dark &AMP; Lovely hair relaxers
and colorings and Magic shaving products.
</P>
<P>
   In that restructuring, which occurred earlier this summer,
Chairman Roy Keith relinquished his duties as CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Roche was succeeded by Gregory J. Andrews, who joined the
Savannah-based maker of ethnic personal-care products less than
three months ago as chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's me taking control of the company,'' Andrews said of
Roche's departure. ``We're trying to get our expenses in line, and,
as you know, we had a really top-heavy management group. ... This
is as much as anything us making moves to get our costs in line
with the levels of sales in the corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, Carson reported a loss of $1.8 million _
excluding one-time items and capital gains _ compared with a profit
of $2.3 million in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Roche said there was no longer a need for her position because
it overlapped with Andrews'. She said top executives discussed her
status several weeks ago and agreed ``this was probably the best
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith said Roche ``is a committed professional. We will miss
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said Roche will serve as a consultant on some Carson
projects and ``with other clients as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche's leaving will be felt at the company, which in recent
months has had to contend with flat sales domestically.
</P>
<P>
   Roche, known as a savvy marketing executive, joined Carson in
1995 after 19 years with Avon Products Co. Part of her job was to
help steer the company on an aggressive course, which included an
expansion into South Africa and Latin America markets and
acquisitions of new brands.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the company purchased the Johnson Products Co. ethnic
hair-care unit from IVX BioSciences Inc. for $70 million in cash.
Johnson Products is the No. 3 maker of ethnic hair-care products
with such brands as Ultra Sheen and Afro Sheen.

 &HT;    BATTLE OVER DOCUMENTS REVIVES PARTY LINES IN CONGRESS
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sharp exchanges Friday between Republicans and
Democrats in the House showed that Congress remains far from the
kind of bipartisan consensus that must precede the forced removal
of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Though technically possible, it would be politically suicidal
for House Republicans to impeach President Clinton by a simple
party-line majority .
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't want it to look like Republicans are getting rid of
him because he's a Democrat,'' said legal historian Michael Les
Benedict of Ohio State University.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, If the House were to send impeachment charges to the
Senate, conviction of Clinton there would require a two-thirds
vote. That would require some Democratic support, since Republicans
hold only 55 of the 100 Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   After a month in which many Democratic members of Congress have
been nearly as harsh as Republicans in criticizing Clinton's
behavior, Friday's eruption was the first public sign that a
significant number of them are starting to give their party's
leader the benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still very fluid,'' said political scientist Calvin C.
Jillson, who directs Southern Methodist University's John G. Tower
Center for Political Studies. Jillson's said he saw indications in
Friday's partisan jousting that ``Democrats would like to retain
Clinton in the presidency if it can be done in a way consistent
with the dignity and the interests of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   The first complaints about GOP conduct of the inquiry into
Clinton's behavior came from Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the
ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. Conyers learned from
news reports that, without consulting him, Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., had asked for and received permission to obtain a
copy of Clinton's videotaped deposition in Paula Jones's sexual
harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're jumping the gun for political purposes,'' Conyers said.
``I'm going to continue my fight in opposition to this kind of
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   As committee members emerged Friday from two days of closed-door
meetings, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said, the committee's
``Republican majority seems intent not on bringing about an
impartial inquiry, but on bringing about maximum feasible
embarrassment of the president by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Hyde said, ``There was a general view among the
Democrats not to reveal anything, and there was a general view
among Republicans to reveal as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Democrats attacked the GOP majority's decision to allow only
light editorial changes in the next batch of materials to be
released from the cartons of material sent to Congress by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. Some 2,800 pages of documents
and a videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony are to be
released in Monday's installment.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Democratic and Republican staffs jointly
recommended 120 cuts on the grounds of privacy, irrelevancy or good
taste. During two days of private meetings, Republicans rejected
three of those 120 proposed cuts, and also rejected about two dozen
motions by Democrats to omit other material that Democrats claimed
was salacious, irrelevant , duplicative or unnecessarily detailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a vigorous debate, but it was civil,'' Hyde insisted.
``I would say the spirit of bipartisanship is alive and
flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very civil, but very partisan,'' rejoined Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass. ``If this was bipartisanship, then the Taliban (the
fundamentalist movement in Afghanistan) wins a medal for religious
tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., dismissed Frank's remarks as
``spin'' from one of the 63 Democrats who last week voted against
having the committee review and release all relevant portions of
the material that supports Starr's summary report.
</P>
<P>
   But those upset included some of the 138 Democrats who joined
224 Republicans and one independent in authorizing the committee to
review, edit and then release the documents and audio and visual
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., told CNN: ``It just seems
to me that the House, within a few days, has turned into a snake
pit and a war room, rather than a rational, thoughtful body in
which the public can have confidence on a matter that's of crucial
importance to every family in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``seem to want to keep alive some sensational,
circus-like atmosphere,'' said another, Rep. Steve Rothman, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints were also raised by House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., who had ostentatiously cooperated with GOP leaders
at bipartisan meetings prior to release of Starr's summary report.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Friday that he now thinks that Republicans ``have
absolutely no intention whatsoever of conducting this investigation
under the bipartisan principles that the Watergate investigation
followed.''

 &HT;    UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES LED TO RELEASE OF GRAND JURY MATERIAL
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among all the shocking details that are about to be
released from the investigation of President Clinton, one shocker
may be overlooked: in the real world, grand jury testimony is so
secret and so sacred that discussing it is almost always a crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a law against violating the secrecy of the grand
jury,'' said former U.S. Attorney James Rolfe of Dallas. ``It is
not public what goes on in the grand jury, who goes there, who is
subpoenaed. ... It isn't a deal where even your buddies in the U.S.
attorney's office are privy to what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of a little-noticed court decision in July and a
vote Friday by the House Judiciary Committee, anyone in the world
will be privy to the grand jury testimony of Clinton, former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky and any number of other witnesses,
from Clinton friend Vernon Jordan to Lewinsky's college chums.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel in Washington gave independent counsel
Kenneth Starr permission to release the testimony to Congress when
Starr asked for that power in July. Starr included the testimony _
Clinton's on videotape and the rest in printed transcripts _ in the
boxes of material that he delivered to Congress Sept. 10 with his
report detailing potentially impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Starr referred to the grand jury testimony in his report to
Congress but, aside from cautioning that the boxes contained some
personal and potentially embarrassing material, he gave Congress no
guidance as to how to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Judiciary Committee voted to release the grand
jury testimony and other evidence to the public, setting the stage
for the broadcast of what otherwise would have been known to only a
few dozen people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently we've now set the precedent for releasing grand
jury testimony,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the
Judiciary Committee. ``Prosecutors ...will be timing their grand
jury testimony for sweeps week.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors interviewed Friday declined to comment on the
propriety of the Judiciary Committee's decision, but they made
clear that a breach of grand jury secrecy in their jobs is
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The institution of the grand jury depends on its proceedings
being kept secret,'' said District Attorney Ronnie Earle of Austin,
Texas, the only state prosecutor with the power to bring misconduct
charges against state officials.
</P>
<P>
   State rules on grand jury proceedings can vary, but not much:
they generally follow the federal rules, which lay out very limited
exceptions for releasing grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The most common, but still limited, release of grand jury
testimony occurs when a prosecution witness in a criminal trial
also testified before the grand jury. In those instances, the
defense attorney can obtain the witness's grand jury testimony, but
only the part that deals with the same topic as the trial
testimony. Anything else stays secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never'' is when criminal defense lawyers obtain a full grand
jury transcript, said Gerald Lefcourt of New York, immediate past
president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
Limited amounts of testimony are given ``to the defense attorney
for the purpose of cross examination,'' he said. ``It is not poured
into the public record.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the secrecy are clear, according to both defense
lawyers and prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first place, the grand jury is an accusatory body,''
Earle said. ``The grand jury hears only one side. The secrecy
protects people from groundless accusations and from being
slandered even by accusations of conduct that is not criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules of evidence used in trials to weed out hearsay and
other impermissible evidence ``don't apply in grand jury
proceedings, so anybody can say anything whether they can prove it
or not, and the reason that's OK is because it's in a secret
proceeding,'' he said. ``They can say whatever they want without
having to worry any possible harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It protects the accused as well as the witness,'' Earle said,
``because it provides the witness with a cloak of anonymity.

 &HT;    'Witching' session casts no spell as stocks gain slightly
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Investors were not bewitched after all in Friday's
trading as stocks moved up in fairly calm trading. Small stocks
continued to stage a comeback by outperforming blue chips for the
day and for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's quarterly ``triple witching'' session _ the expiration
of stock options, index options and index futures _ failed to cause
the usual volatility, although fresh earnings disappointments
surfaced to dampen trader enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Union Carbide was the latest to warn that its third-quarter
results will be hurt by falling raw material prices. Other cyclical
stocks _ the kind that gain in an expanding economy _ declined,
reflected in a 1.6 percent drop in the Morgan Stanley cyclical
index.
</P>
<P>
   The big news may have been the rally in smaller stocks, which
gave the Russell 2000 index a gain of 2.2 percent for the day and
2.7 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent in
Friday's trading and 1.3 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, the Russell 2000 has gained 7.5
percent since the bottom of the sell-off on Aug. 31, vs. the Dow's
gain of 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the week ended with the Dow trading 15.5 percent
below its all-time high, while the Russell 2000 was 26 percent
below its high.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann, told
Dow Jones News Service that investors should focus more attention
on smaller caps, which he said are likely to continue outperforming
big-cap stocks on the rebound from the recent sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the ability of the small-cap and Nasdaq markets to
rally is a sign that the biggest part of the sell-off may be over,
without necessarily signaling an imminent upward move. That's
because the market is still faced with prospects of disappointing
earnings reports in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointments in earnings are devastating, and many of the
big stocks that seem more predictable in terms of their earnings
performance have taken big hits,'' Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co., told Dow Jones News Service.
</P>
<P>
   The market likely would have closed with a bigger weekly gain
except for Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who did not
provide a clear signal in a congressional appearance on Wednesday
that the Fed would cut interest rates soon.

 &HT;    SBA expands access to two loan programs
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The U.S. Small Business Administration announced
Friday an expansion and streamlining of two key loan programs.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agency said the improvements to the LowDoc and SBA
Express programs are expected to provide an additional $1 billion
over the next year in hard-to-get small loans for start-up
businesses, women and minority entrepreneurs, and businesses in
inner cities and rural areas. The two programs were set up earlier
this decade to help small businesses that need loans under
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's changes raise the ceiling on loan limits in both
programs from $100,000 to $150,000. Also, a small-business owner
will be able to get a loan from either program in as little as 36
hours _ half the minimum time it used to take to process a loan. At
the same time, more than 400 lenders have been added to the SBA
Express program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loans will open the doors of opportunity in new markets,
which include African-American, Hispanic-American and women-owned
businesses,'' SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez said. ``We have
discovered from experience that smaller-size loans tend to be
concentrated among women- and minority-owned business.''
</P>
<P>
   LowDoc, short for ``low documentation,'' which refers to the
program's lower paperwork requirements, was set up in 1993 to help
entrepreneurs who needed small loans. It was aimed at start-ups,
women and minorities _ groups with the biggest need for small
loans. The LowDoc program features a one-page application, and the
SBA guarantees up to 75 percent of each loan.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal year 1997, 14,738 LowDoc loans were processed,
totaling $847 million. In fiscal 1998, which ends this month, the
SBA expects to make 11,300 LowDoc loans totaling $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   SBA Express began three years ago as a pilot program called
FA$TRAK. Express allows lenders to use their own forms and
procedures for making loans in order to reduce paperwork. The SBA
guarantees half of each of these loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Express program processed 4,100 FA$TRAK loans during fiscal
1997, totaling more than $190 million. For fiscal year 1998, the
agency expects to make 5,600 loans totaling about $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, 263 LowDoc loans were issued last year, totaling
$16.8 million and representing 24 percent of all SBA-backed loans
made in the state. So far this year, 172 LowDoc loans, totaling $11
million, have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Express loans in Georgia totaled 38 for about $2 million in
1997. Through August of this year, 32 Express loans were issued,
for a total of about $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   SBA officials tied the decline in the number of loans nationally
and in Georgia to a slowdown in the economy and more banks making
direct loans.

Committee voted Friday to release the videotaped grand jury
testimony of President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky matter,
giving the American people what one lawmaker said was ``more than
they ever wanted to know about the president's sex life.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37-member panel, which is expected recommend a congressional
inquiry of impeachment in a few weeks, also voted to release 2,800
pages of other information, including Lewinsky's testimony of sex
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 Democrats tried to keep the material from being made
public, arguing that the videotape and other documents supporting
independent counsel Ken Starr's report to Congress would only serve
to humiliate the president.
</P>
<P>
   But their motions failed on party line votes. They were left
with little choice but to help their Republican colleagues decide
what lurid details should be deleted to protect individuals not
central to the question of whether Clinton lied under oath about
his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The materials are to be released Monday morning, and will
include the unedited tape of the president's four-hour testimony to
the Starr grand jury in which he admits to an improper relationship
with Lewinsky while she was a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members said the material is ``salacious.'' But they
said it does not include any new accusations and not much more than
already has been detailed in the 445-page report Starr provided to
Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was quick to denounce the committee decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be a rush to prejudgment and an effort to get
out the most salacious material at the speed of light, not at the
proper pace of justice,'' said White House aide James Kennedy.
``But in the end it will have to be the American people who will
have to see if this indeed has been a fair process or a partisan
effort to embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to release more information later, and
may decide to make public the president's deposition last January
in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit that was dismissed by
Arkansas U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright. Wright has agreed
to make the deposition available to committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats accused Republicans of ``dribbling out''
information to influence public opinion to support a decision they
have already made _ that Clinton ought to be impeached, or short of
that, driven from office before congressional hearings begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to trickle out evidence, it seems, for only one
reason _ death by a thousand cuts,'' said committee member Robert
Wexler, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Democratic claims that they ``got rolled'' by the 21
Republicans on the committee, Hyde said that the panel sessions
Thursday and Friday were civil even though members had strong
opinions. He even suggested there was a sense of ``collegiality''
as members moved into a debate about which sexually explicit
material to hold back.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both sides agreed to 120 edits, Hyde said. There
were 27 other passages in testimony and various other materials
that the Democrats asked to be deleted, but the Republicans said
no.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general view among Democrats not to reveal
anything, and there was a general view among Republicans to reveal
as much as possible consistent with responsible redactions to
protect people whose names and vital statistics and involvement in
this was very peripheral,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the committee,
said the information remaining is sexually explicit and will
embarrass the president, Lewinsky and others ``for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is offensive, it is obscene,'' he said, adding that it
still ``does not build up any kind of case one way or the other''
against the president for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Republican committee member, Rep. Lindsey Graham of
South Carolina, agreed with that assessment, and said that the
materials do not constitute any impeachable offense in themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to blow people away, in my opinion,'' he said,
adding that Clinton actually ``handles himself pretty well'' in
some exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   But nonetheless, Graham said Republicans felt it important to
release the videotape and other information to show that Clinton
continued to lie and spar with the Starr grand jury over whether
his intimate contacts with Lewinsky did in fact constitute a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats objected to the release of the additional Starr
materials primarily out of concern that it sets ``a dangerous
precedent,'' as Conyers put it, for releasing grand jury testimony
that is normally kept secret. They cited the Watergate impeachment
proceedings against Richard Nixon as an example, saying the
committee in that case took months to deliberate before releasing
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watergate is the standard I am going by,'' said committee
Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee of Houston, adding that Clinton
deserves to be treated ``just as fairly'' as Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said the Republicans' insistence that everything
``be rushed out now'' had ``put a spear through'' the
``constitutional standards that ought to be applied'' when
considering impeachment and ``the spirit of bipartisanship'' that
GOP leaders had promised.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee, joined by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., tried during
the committee meeting to prevent the release of more Starr
materials until the committee could determine whether the
allegations of impeachable offenses made by the independent counsel
amounted to ``an abuse of official powers.'' Every committee
Republican voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also rejected another Democratic motion that
would have allowed Clinton and his lawyers to review the rest of
the Starr materials before they are released.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Republicans and the Democrats agreed on only a
few things, including whether to make public the record of their
votes on 18 motions presented during the committee's executive
session. Thirteen Republicans joined with 15 Democrats to pass that
motion. The Republicans, however, rejected a motion by Democrats to
release a transcript of their deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said that the
partisan tone of the committee meeting raises questions about how
Republicans intend to proceed on the Starr report. ``It is
increasingly clear that the Republicans have absolutely no
intention whatsoever of conducting this investigation under the
bipartisan principles that the Watergate investigation followed,''
Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints from Democrats spurred Gingrich to announce plans
to convene a meeting of congressional leaders next week to discuss
how to tone down the political rhetoric as Congress wrestles with a
decision about whether to proceed with impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who supported the release
of the videotape and other documents, said he expects Congress to
make that decision within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise me if (the Judiciary Committee) met the
first week of October to decide whether to recommend an inquiry of
impeachment to the full House,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to release the 2,800 pages of written records,
consisting primarily of the appendices to Starr's official report
to Congress, was 20-15, breaking down along party lines. The vote
to release an unedited version of Clinton's videotaped testimony
was the same.
</P>
<P>
   The votes reflected just how partisan the executive session was.
But as if to erase any doubt about the fierce politics behind
closed doors, the Republican and Democratic members sparred openly
before television cameras after Hyde announced the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, R-Mass., accused Republicans of adopting ``a
new concept of unilateral bipartisanship.'' But Hyde, standing
beside him, responded that he thought members got along ``very
well,'' adding that bipartisanship in his view ``doesn't include
surrender to everything Democrats want.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also complained that Republicans were being
insensitive by releasing the report on Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish
New Year. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Giving a sharp partisan cast to deliberations over
impeachment, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee
voted along party lines Friday to release the videotape of
President Clinton's grand jury testimony along with 2,800 more
documents on the inquiry into his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The materials were set to be made public Monday, promising a
nation that would like the scandal to simply go away televised
replays of an angry and legalistic Clinton jousting with lawyers
over the definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The party divide over the public release of material erupted
into the open within minutes after the committee ended its final
two hours of closed-door deliberations Friday morning. Rep. Henry
Hyde, the committee chairman, began to describe the committee's two
days of meetings as ``civil'' sessions in which the ``spirit of
bipartisanship is alive and flourishing.'' But he was quickly
interrupted by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say that this is a new concept, unfortunately
of unilateral bipartisanship,'' Frank said. ``Bipartisanship can't
be unilateral.'' He said virtually every vote taken across two days
of deliberations had been along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde retorted, ``I may have a different definition of
bipartisanship _ it doesn't include surrender to every single
Democrat's wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the four-hour videotape of Clinton, the documents to be
released add further detail to the report of Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, who charged the president with 11 acts that
might constitute impeachable offenses. The documents include FBI
interviews with Lewinsky, her testimony before the grand jury and
her proffer _ the information she was prepared to reveal in
exchange for immunity _ to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did agree to make nearly 120 deletions from the
materials on the grounds of sexual explicitness, national security
or privacy.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings of the House Judiciary Committee mark the first
time since the Watergate scandal in 1974 that the House has
considered whether to open an impeachment inquiry into a president.
And the deliberations are taking place in an atmosphere made more
tense by recent media reports on sexual indiscretions on the part
of three Republican members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said that Hyde telephoned Speaker Newt
Gingrich earlier in the week and offered to step down from the
investigation after the online magazine Salon reported that he had
had an extramarital affair 30 years ago. Gingrich, however, gave
Hyde his full support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speaker did not consider the resignation because there is
no person who has earned more respect and affection from the House
than Hyde,'' said Christina Martin, a spokeswoman for Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to ease some of the fears sweeping the Congress, Sens.
Mitch McConnell and Bob Kerrey, the chairmen of the Republican and
Democratic Senate campaign committees, followed the lead of their
House counterparts and pledged on the Senate floor Friday not to
finance candidates who make personal attacks against their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digging through their record is one thing,'' said McConnell, a
Kentucky Republican. ``Digging through their garbage is quite
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The partisan acrimony over the ongoing release of Starr's
materials has grown since last week when Gingrich and Rep. Dick
Gephardt, the House minority leader, pledged to work cooperatively.
The House then voted 363-63 to make public Starr's report and
backup materials after scrutiny by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the panel said Friday that they were carrying out
the will of the full House for maximum public disclosure and that
the documents would make clear whether Starr's report had put the
president's testimony in proper context. They also said that the
panel's Democrats were ideologues who are not representative of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent, maybe seventy percent of our colleagues on the
other side had a hard time accepting the mandate of the House,''
said Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the panel.
``Whether that's a partisan fight I don't know. I feel we lived up
to the mandate of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said ``There was a general view among the Democrats not to
reveal anything and there was a general view among Republicans to
reveal as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's Democrats accused the Republicans of trying to keep
up a steady stream of information embarrassing the president,
instead of releasing it at once on the Sept. 28 deadline set by the
House for the committee to review all the material.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla. said, ``We're going to dribble out
information for only one reason: death by a thousand cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks were echoed by the White House. ``This appears to be
a rush to prejudgment and an effort to get out the most salacious
material at the speed of light, not at the proper pace of
justice,'' said James Kennedy, a White House spokesman. ``But in
the end it will have to be the American people who will have to see
if this indeed has been a fair process or a partisan effort to
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee, the
Democrats had virtually no chance of prevailing on any vote, but
they did create a record across two days of roll call votes to show
the American public which party was voting to release the explicit
details of Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat on the committee who
won his party's nomination to challenge Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, was
absent from the meetings.

OPPOSITION CLAIMS PRI TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FLOODING TO DRUM UP
SUPPORT FOR THEIR CANDIDATES 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ESCUINTLA, Mexico _ Urbano Escalante trekked for seven hours
across swollen rivers and muddy paths, clutching a list.
</P>
<P>
   He held it tight, because the Mexican army general in charge of
distributing aid to flood victims had told him that if he lost it
he would go to prison.
</P>
<P>
   On the list were the names of the heads of families in San
Antonio Miramar, one of the hundreds of villages hit hard by the
floods that have drenched southern Mexico's Chiapas state during
the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Beside each name was a list of goods: 1 kilogram of rice, half a
kilo of sugar, 1 kilo of beans, a tin of sardines, a carton of
milk, a bag of noodles. Next to the list, in the column marked
``received,'' were signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Escalante, the villager in charge of distributing government aid
dropped from helicopters for this tiny hillside settlement, made
sure that everyone who took a parcel of food left a written record.
</P>
<P>
   In years gone by, the distribution of aid has proven to be a
lucrative business in Mexico. In a country where as many as half
the population of 97 million lives in poverty, the government is
regularly called upon to help the most desperate in times of
drought, hurricanes, earthquakes and floods.
</P>
<P>
   But too often, many Mexicans say, some of the aid has been used
by local bosses to line their own pockets or by political leaders
to buy votes and favors. It is still happening in flood-ravaged
Chiapas, rescue workers, soldiers and opposition politicians say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard that political parties are giving away aid,''
said Armando Paniagua, a Red Cross worker organizing medical
brigades in Escuintla. ``It is a common thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With crucial midterm elections for mayors and state legislators
less than three weeks away in Mexico's southernmost state,
opposition politicians claim that the members of the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, are taking advantage of
the flooding to drum up support for their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous disasters, when the federal government was slow
to react, this time President Ernesto Zedillo was quick to go to
the scene. Zedillo has visited Chiapas four times in the last 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling party does not want to lose,'' said Blanca Laura
Castilla, a local activist with the leftist Democratic Revolution
Party. ``We think that is why he has spent so much time here. They
should not be taking advantage of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation is disastrous. As many as 100,000 people were made
homeless by the floods, and hundreds more were reported dead.
Unofficial figures put the death toll into four figures. But with
many isolated villages still cut off, it will be some time before
rescue workers can determine a final count of the dead and missing.
Whatever the casualty toll, Zedillo called the floods ``probably
the worst natural disaster since the earthquake of 1985'' that
killed thousands in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo has toured the region, using his moral stature as chief
executive to make it clear he expects politicians in this
politically divided state to work together for the good of the
people. Acknowledging the reports of abuses, the president said
that anyone caught using aid for political purposes would be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you that government resources will not be
delivered to any political party or any other organization that
intends on running a campaign,'' he said. ``The resources do not
belong to the government but to the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the message relayed to Urbano Escalante by the general
in charge at Escuintla, a small town around 60 miles from the
Guatemalan border.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with his list of names, Escalante sat in the shade of a
tree, awaiting the word on more aid.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old father of six first hiked down the mountain from
his village last Sunday to ask for food and medicine, and army
helicopters dropped supplies 24 hours later. But that food ran out
quickly, and Escalante returned to ask the military to send another
mercy flight.
</P>
<P>
   While handing out assistance, the army made villagers and others
aware of Zedillo's orders. But the army, trying not to rely on
lists made by strangers like Escalante, put a soldier on duty to
oversee the distribution of aid. When the army was unable to
oversee the operations, soldiers were ordered to make return trips
to the villages to ask people if the distribution was equitable.
</P>
<P>
   Several such flights left Escuintla each day as soldiers in
helicopters swooped out across acres of banana plantations and
muddy fields to drop supplies to their starving countrymen and
women.
</P>
<P>
   The deliveries were sometimes haphazard. Lingering rains and
low-hanging clouds forced the cancellation of some flights, and the
Mexican armed forces were limited by the small number of
helicopters available.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's national oil monopoly, Petroleos Mexicanos, sent six
helicopters and pilots, but the fliers did not know the area.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting pilots were forced to rely on photocopied maps and
local spotters who sat in their cabins and pointed the right
direction. On at least one occasion this week, pilots touched down
on a waterlogged sports field to ask villagers the way to a town
they suspected was nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The deliveries were also somewhat patchy during the week, some
say, with places such as San Antonio Miramar receiving two mercy
flights in the week while others waited and watched the sky.

CLINTON TURNS ATTENTION TO ISSUES OF RACE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Friday focused his attention
on an area where he has displayed comfort, as well as intellectual
and political surefootedness: race. On a day when the the
appearance of normality was a precious commodity at the White
House, Clinton's only public act was to officially receive the
report of the Advisory Board to the President's Initiative on Race.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a ceremony that included such prominent figures of
the civil rights movement as Rosa Parks and John Lewis, the
president put on display his understanding of the history of racial
conflict and an eloquence about ways to reduce those antagonisms in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes from, yes, opportunity; it comes from, yes, learning;
it comes from, yes, the absence of discrimination,'' Clinton said
in a speech. ``But it also has to come from the presence of
reconciliation, from a turning away from the madness that life only
matters if there is someone we can demean, destroy or put down.''
</P>
<P>
   The event marked the culmination of the work of Clinton's
advisory board whose 15-month tenure was marred by a slow start,
criticism for not including enough conservative voices, anger on
the part of American Indians for not having someone to represent
them on the seven-member panel, and charges of too much white House
interference in its planning and work.
</P>
<P>
   But in presenting the voluminous report to Clinton _ first in a
private meeting in the Oval Office, and later at the public event
in an auditorium at the Old Executive Office Building _ John Hope
Franklin, the head of the board, said the board's work had
stimulated a unique discussion on race throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seemed relieved that someone was doing something about
this,'' Franklin told the president during the meeting in the Oval
Office. ``They felt that they could accomplish something.''
</P>
<P>
   The report the board presented to Clinton was a compilation of
suggestions that had been made to the president during the course
of panel's work. Many were endorsements of policy initiatives _
like funds for teachers, and for school construction in minority
areas _ that the administration has already implemented. Some
people, including at least one board member, have said it was a
relatively bland document that contained no bold initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Its major recommendation, stressed by several board members on
Friday, was the setting up of a permanent Presidential Council on
Race. Such a body would monitor efforts and recommend policies to
promote racial reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely essential that this initiative be carried
forward in a permanent way,'' said William Winter, the former
governor of Mississippi, explaining to Clinton the rationale for a
Presidential Council on Race.
</P>
<P>
   The Oval Office and the public events with the board gave an
edgy White House a welcome respite from the Monica Lewinsky affair.
But even during these moments the scandal's political and legal
challenges intruded, sometimes through gallows humor.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Suzanne Johnson Cook, a New York City pastor and a
board member gave Clinton a present _ a book titled ``Too Blessed
to Be Stressed.'' The president laughed and said, ``I think I need
that.''

RELIGION COLUMN: CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS CHANGED GREATLY IN PAST 20
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, 1978, 20 years ago next month, Cardinal Karol
Wojtyla, the archbishop of Krakow, became Pope John Paul II.
Evaluations of his event-studded pontificate _ already one of the
longest in the history of the Roman Catholic Church _ and of his
remarkable personality will soon be sprouting left and right (and
no doubt reflecting different predispositions, left and right).
Such evaluations will obviously require political insight,
knowledge about Catholic teaching and a good deal of nuance.
</P>
<P>
   On a less elevated level, they may also benefit from some
numbers, and not only how many times the pope has visited how many
countries and how many major church documents he has issued or how
many copies of his books have been sold. Here are some other
pertinent data, drawn largely from the Vatican's Statistical
Yearbook of the Church.
</P>
<P>
   From 1978 to 1995, the Roman Catholic Church grew to almost 990
million baptized members from 750 million. At the same time, it
shrunk slightly as a proportion of the world's population, to 17.4
percent from 17.8 percent. It especially grew, as has often been
reported, in Asia and Africa, both in absolute numbers and as a
percentage of the population. In the United States and Western
Europe it continued to grow in numbers but, as elsewhere, to shrink
slightly as a percentage of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all these numbers are approximations that blend local
reports of varying precision. Comparisons are further complicated
by the fact that halfway through John Paul's pontificate, the
collapse of communist regimes allowed new statistics where data had
been unavailable. And one wonders how meaningful some of the
figures are.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that 97 percent of the Italian population continues to
be baptized as of 1995, the same percentage that the Vatican
reported for 1978. But that figure scarcely registers the two
decades of secularization that Italy's church officials regularly
lament.
</P>
<P>
   More reliable indicators of the church's health may be found in
the statistics on its ``work force,'' as the yearbook puts it,
primarily the numbers of priests and sisters. Here the general
impression is that John Paul's papacy has put an end to the
hemorrhaging of the church's mid-level leadership, which followed
the Second Vatican Council's recasting of church roles in the 1960s
and the subsequent debates about celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell a more complicated story. From 1978 to 1995,
for example, the numbers of priests grew by 42 in Africa and 48
percent in Asia, but the decline in North America (13 percent) and
Europe (12 percent) continued. Because North America and Europe
still harbor most of the world's Catholic priests, the overall
picture for the world remained a decline of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Those are absolute numbers, however, and because the numbers of
Catholics have been growing, the ratio of priests to people has
become even more strained. In Africa, there were 3,251 Catholics
for every priest at the beginning of this pontificate; in 1995
there were 4,476; in Asia the figure went from 2,223 Catholics per
priest to 2,620. (In the United States, the figure went to 1,117
from 833.)
</P>
<P>
   The pattern is similar for sisters. The numbers have gone up
sharply in Africa and Asia since 1978, but they have gone down so
sharply in North America and Europe that by 1995 there were 15
percent fewer nuns worldwide serving a much larger church than at
the beginning of John Paul's reign.
</P>
<P>
   It is also interesting to compare such statistics under Pope
John Paul II with those under Pope Paul VI. Pope Paul's
pontificate, from 1963 to 1978, is often considered a period of
extreme postconciliar turmoil and disarray. Yet it is striking how
similar the overall score is for both pontificates. Under Paul VI,
Catholicism grew in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the
population in Africa and Asia, as it would under John Paul II, but
still shrank slightly as a percentage of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   During the 15 years of Pope Paul VI's reign, the number of
priests declined 2.7 percent, a loss slightly less than that
suffered during the 17 years, from 1978 to 1995, under John Paul
II.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the number of Catholics who had to be
served by each priest grew by 23 percent under Paul VI. Under John
Paul II the number has increased by more than 25 percent. And the
decline in the number of sisters has been much sharper under the
present Pope than the earlier one.
</P>
<P>
   One could tweak these figures in different ways. For example,
one could assume a ``lag,'' as economists often do. Thus the first
five years of John Paul II's papacy might be chalked up to Paul
VI's leadership, and the numbers would almost certainly show that
under the current pope, many of the negative trends that seemed to
build in the decade after 1973 were slowed if not completely
reversed. In some cases, that was probably because John Paul II's
policies were taking effect. In other cases, it was probably a
natural settling down _ for example, the priests most likely to
leave the active priesthood had already done so.
</P>
<P>
   And one always needs to remember the shortcomings of the data.
It would take a major scholarly study to make truly accurate
comparisons. Still, one might risk a few very broad conclusions:
</P>
<P>
   First, as witnessed by the similarities in trends under two very
different popes, the major forces affecting the church's health may
be well beyond papal leadership _ forces like birth rates and
social, economic and cultural changes in both non-Western nations
and the church's European-based heartlands.
</P>
<P>
   Second, while some church leaders hail a shift in the church's
center of gravity from Europe and North America to Africa and Asia
(with traditionally Catholic Latin America partaking of some of the
weaknesses of the Old World Catholicism from which it sprang, along
with the indigenous religious vitality it shares with other Third
World regions), it will be a long time, and a hard time, before the
new growth can compensate for the apparent loss of morale, which
this pontificate does not seem to have arrested, in the church's
European and North American territories.

&HT;        BLACK LEADERS VOW SUPPORT FOR CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- Black political leaders visiting the
nation's capital Friday rushed to President Clinton's defense and
vowed to wage a grass-roots campaign designed to discredit
Democrats who publicly denounce him.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Harold James, a Philadelphia Democrat, released a
list of 200-plus lawmakers -- most of them black -- who have
pledged to support the embattled president as Congress decides
whether or not to begin impeachment proceedings against him.
</P>
<P>
   James said recent attacks of Clinton from high profile Democrats
such as U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Maryland Gov.
Parris Glendening are ``shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is sad to see some of the Democratic leadership
abandoning Clinton,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was the first Democrat to publicly scold Clinton from
the Senate floor after the president apologized for having an
``inappropriate relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky. Glendening
snubbed Clinton during two Maryland events earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   James joined hundreds of black leaders from across the country
in Washington this week for the Congressional Black Caucus
Foundation's 28th Annual Legislative Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Americans to Save the Presidency'' group will begin
placing issue ads -- mainly in black urban newspapers -- to let
people know of the betrayal of Clinton by some Democrats,
organizers said. The 1,000-member group is made up of state
lawmakers such as James, local officials, former lawmakers and
other civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have scheduled 100 town meetings across the country to
discuss Clinton defense strategy. Supporters of perennial
presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche helped organize the group.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is designed to embarrass Democrats who attack
Clinton and to make them rethink their positions, James said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. John Hilliard, an Alabama Democrat, said Clinton's
problems amount to nothing more than ``money, power and sex.'' He
said the country would be better served if Congress focused on
issues that affect on people's daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is doing excellent,'' Hilliard said. ``Why would
we attack a president that has built the economy better than it has
ever been before? But the only issue we can find is to try and make
tabloid news.'' State Rep. Louise Williams Bishop, one of eight
Pennsylvania Democrats who signed the petition, said Clinton has
been good for the country despite his personal transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I voted for him. I knew when I campaigned for him
he was a man,'' Bishop said in a telephone interview from
Philadelphia. ``He is human. He is not a rabbi, a priest or a
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him on the basis he was a good candidate, and I
don't think I cast an incorrect vote,'' Bishop said.

 &HT;    REP. HASTINGS CALLS FOR STARR'S IMPEACHMENT
 &HT;    WITH CLINTON-HASTINGS.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing what he called prosecutorial misconduct
designed to ``demean, defame and embarrass the president and the
people of the United States, `` Rep. Alcee Hastings called Friday
for the impeachment of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, D-Fla., filed a ``privileged motion'' at the close of
the House's business Friday. House Speaker Newt Gingrich indicated
he would decide when Congress returns to work Wednesday whether to
let the House vote on the motion. Hastings said he expects the
Republican majority to try to table, or kill, the motion if comes
to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, a former federal judge who was impeached by the House
10 years ago and removed a year later by the Senate on bribery
conspiracy charges _ after being acquitted on similar criminal
charges _ said he was bringing the action to slow to the proceeding
moving against Clinton and to express his outrage at Starr's
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give the salacious, tawdry, trashy details (in the report)
was taking this thing to a realm that, when it was released, there
was no useful way that the president could defend himself,''
Hastings said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to take the focus off of President Clinton, but
I don't want somebody to have a hammer _ I don't care if they are a
Democrat or a Republican _ to beat up on somebody the way that
Kenneth Starr has.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Congress would have the power to impeach
Starr, whose appointment was requested by Attorney General Janet
Reno and who reports to a three-judge appellate panel.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastings said Starr should be impeached and removed for
``submitting to the House an unnecessarily pornographic report''
and ``leaking grand jury material for the purpose of embarrassing''
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings also criticized Starr for ``wasting more than $40
million in an investigation that he knew could not justify such
extraordinary expenditures'' and by embarrassing the United States
``before the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his actions thus far, Hastings said Starr had
attempted to disrupt the House and ``disgust a nation grown weary
by hinting that Whitewater, Travelgate, (and) Filegate, like a
Sword of Damocles, hang by a thread just beyond our horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings said he had not discussed his intent to file the motion
with anyone in the Clinton administration or with Democratic
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the rule of law, and I don't think Kenneth Starr
is above the rule of law any more than is Bill Clinton or Alcee
Hastings,'' he said.

GROUP WARNS ABOUT CAMPUS CREDIT CARD OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a, l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of giving out free T-shirts, chocolates, or mugs to lure
new customers, banks peddling credit cards on campuses ought to be
handing out brochures about responsible debt, officials from a
consumer advocacy group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group said its
national study of 1,260 undergraduates at 15 campuses found that
students who acquire credit cards from on-campus marketers are more
likely to carry larger balances and acquire more cards than those
who get them through other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, especially those who fill out credit card
applications at campus tables in return for trinkets and candy, run
the risk of falling into the campus credit card trap,'' said
Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for MassPIRG, at a
press conference at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for curbs on the use of gifts as enticements, Cummings
said banks zealously market to young adults in hopes of winning
lifetime loyalty through this first-time credit card. Yet college
students, many without jobs, often can't handle the debt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``The Campus Credit Card Trap,''
students responsible for their own cards who obtained them through
an application made on campus had an average unpaid balance of
$1,039. This compares to $854 for those who obtained their cards by
applying another way.
</P>
<P>
   Those who applied on-campus also had an average of 2.6 cards,
compared with 2.1 cards for those who applied outside of school.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said other studies that have painted a brighter picture
of students' ability to handle debt, such as one recently by the
Institute for Higher Education Policy, fail to distinguish between
students who rely on parents to pay the bills and those who are
responsible for their own cards.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass-Boston, a marketer for Associates National Bank of
Delaware stood inside a student building with free T-shirts,
calling cards, and a thesaurus for anyone who filled out the VISA
application. The card comes with a variable annual percentage rate,
which this month would be about 17.99.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank's headquarters in Irving, Texas, spokesman Joe
Stroop said the bank recruits students hoping they will become
long-term customers when their earning power grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we make a ton of money on students, because
we don't,'' he said. ``It's an investment in the future of the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG called on colleges to consider a ban on on-campus card
marketers, and to provide more education about debt. It also called
into question some banks' practice of paying colleges a fee based
on the number of applications completed, giving the schools an
incentive to encourage sign-ups.
</P>
<P>
   College policies vary. Northeastern University bars credit card
marketers from academic buildings and student centers, while Boston
University allows them at some student buildings in return for a
fixed fee, said school officials. UMass-Boston dean of students
Stephanie Janey said it is considering revisions to rules that
currently allow on-campus credit card marketers under a variety of
financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   At many colleges, marketers skirt rules by setting up shop on
public sidewalks near the school.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mara, 20, a UMass Boston student, said credit card marketers
are seductive. Wearing a Citibank T-shirt he was given this week
for applying for his third card, he acknowledged he already has two
cards with a total unpaid balance of $3,800. ``These giveaways of
T-shirts and gifts do influence students,'' he said.

   WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- Black political leaders visiting the

RUSSIA TO PUMP HUGE RUBLE RESERVE INTO BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the latest example of a leaky ship bailing out
sinking boats, the Russian central bank said Friday that the
country's insolvent banks could use about $1.65 billion in precious
ruble reserves to enable them to make good on customers' bills and
debts that are going unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble has been hopping up and down for weeks now as banks
and the Russian government manipulated its value against the dollar
to make it easier for Russian banks to pay off debts denominated in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   While this provided brief comfort to delinquent banks, it has
thrown the finances of Russian citizens into disarray and made it
impossible to predict the ruble's daily value. That
unpredictability and a lack of cash have led banks to stop
processing bill payments and have brought financial activity in the
country to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   The government's reasoning is that freeing up the reserves,
which banks typically pledge to the central bank as a nest egg
designated to cover bad loans, will grease the wheels of the
payment system and get financial activity moving again.
</P>
<P>
   But the central bank is gambling that it can trust its errant
banks to use the reserves to settle stalled bills. Russian banks,
many of which operate more like freewheeling speculative funds than
banks in the Western sense, may instead use the rubles to buy
dollars. Such was the case when the International Monetary Fund
injected some cash into the central bank a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the banks buy dollars, that will further drive down the value
of the ruble and take another bite out of the buying power of
rubles held by Russian citizens. Moreover, the central bank said it
would print extra rubles to replenish the reserve fund, a move that
will be inflationary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The central bank said Thursday that it would print rubles to buy
short-term government bonds, known as GKOs, from banks. Russian
banks' GKO holdings are currently worthless, although they were
worth about $8 billion when the ruble was, in effect, devalued in
August. It was unclear what price tag the government intends to put
on worthless bonds, but it said it would also print rubles to
accomplish the task _ another inflationary exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Russian finance is essentially a shell game right now, with the
government's printing press issuing increasingly devalued rubles in
an effort to create enough momentum so the economy can begin
creating real value again. Russian banks lauded the decision
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first serious step to improve the situation of the
Russian banking system,'' said Rossiisky Kredit chairman Dmitri
Lyubinin in a prepared statement. ``We hope the payments which were
coming from other banks to our clients will at least be made and
our clients will get the money they have been waiting for for so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the government is far from being the ideal candidate to be
bailing out flailing banks because its own finances are in
dangerously sorry shape. The government has slightly more than $12
billion in foreign exchange reserves, a standard by which its
financial wherewithal can be measured. But about $5 billion of
those reserves are in gold, leaving about $7 billion in liquid
assets that the government can use to prop up the ruble or pay off
foreign debt. Foreign debts may total as much as $200 billion,
however, so the government is left with desperately little room to
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   To build a lifeline that can pump funds into the central bank,
the government said on Thursday it would nationalize the tobacco
and alcohol industries. Alcohol sales abroad earn Russia a sizable
chunk of hard currency reserves that can be earmarked for
government use, while control of the tobacco industry gives the
government access to a steady stream of rubles.
</P>
<P>
   While many experts raised serious doubts about the viability of
the government's recent initiatives, others had mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand it offers further benefits to Russian banks in
terms of the domestic restructuring, and so will aggravate the
concerns of foreign investors,'' a brokerage firm, United Financial
Group, said in a research report. ``On the other hand, the plan
does seem well-conceived as a way to solve the ruble payments
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, American companies are watching the unfolding
economic situations with a close eye and lot of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community feels like it was hit by a neutron
bomb, and we've all been irradiated,'' said Scott Blacklin,
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Russia. ``We are alive
today, but in 30 days, 60 days, 90 days some are going to die.''

CON MAN HAMPTON ARRESTED IN ALLEGED CHECK THEFT, ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ When Joseph C. Keane met the man at a South End bar in
May, he called himself Antonio, told Keane he was attending Harvard
Law School, and that he was originally from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The two men struck up a friendship and went to Keane's home,
eventually spending several days together before, according to
Keane, his-new found friend stole his checks and assaulted him.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Keane learned that Antonio was really David Edgar
Hampton Jr., a con man whose scam of some liberal New Yorkers in
the early 1980s inspired the prize-winning play and popular movie,
``Six Degrees of Separation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really impressed. He said he was writing a book. He's
very smart. He's a good talker,'' Keane said Friday about Hampton.
``Obviously, for what he does for a living you have to be
intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Hampton Tuesday with Keane's help.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Keane said he was unaware of
the play and movie until told about it by a reporter Friday. He
added that Hampton, when he took his hat off, ``looked just like
Will Smith.'' The actor Will Smith portrayed the Hampton-inspired
character in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Hampton posed as the son of actor Sidney Poitier
and ingratiated himself into the lives of the New Yorkers.
Playwright David Guare turned that into a one-act play that Globe
stage critic Kevin Kelly called ``a fable in which what is false
has as much power as fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who spent 21 months in prison for the Poitier scam, was
in the Nashua Street Jail Friday being held on $500 cash bail. He
is charged with attacking Keane and cashing two of Keane's checks
after forging Keane's signature on them. Keane said that while
Hampton was in his apartment, Hampton stole six checks from his
check book.
</P>
<P>
   When he learned about a $500 drop in his account balance, Keane
confronted Hampton, who attacked Keane with his own belt and
threatened him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever tell anyone about this, you're dead,'' Hampton
told Keane, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   After their confrontation in May, Keane said he did not see
Hampton again until this Tuesday when he saw him at another bar in
the South End. Keane summoned Boston police, who took Hampton into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   In Hampton's backpack, police found a Harvard University student
identification card in the name of Patrick P. Owens, a birth
certificate with the same name, a California identification card
for Patrick Owens and a Social Security card in that name.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday whether Owens is the name of a student at
Harvard or if Hampton is attending the law school. Spokesmen for
the university could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police also found a Columbia University identificaton in the
name of Kerry J. Duran and an identification card in that name.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton also had a passport and other identification in his own
name.
</P>
<P>
   At Hampton's arraignment Tuesday in Boston Municipal Court,
Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C. Martin II's office asked that
bail be set at $25,000 cash, said spokesman James Borghesani.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew he was a flight risk,'' he said. ``I don't think this
the type of guy, if he gets out, is going to willingly hang around
and run back to court. We were worried about his coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Charles Johnson set bail at $500 cash. Hampton remained
jailed on that bail Friday. But Keane said he is concerned about
his safety should Hampton be released and has obtained a
restraining order against Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through some pretty rough things, but this is pretty
bad,'' Keane said, adding that he has become suspicious of people
since his encounter with Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Keane then mused aloud about Hampton. ``So I busted someone
famous,'' he said. ``My horoscope said I would come into a lot of
money in September. I wish it was money instead of this.''

SENATE NARROWLY FAILS TO OVERRIDE VETO ON `PARTIAL BIRTH'
ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Wash., N.Y., Ind., Tenn., Kan.)  (lh) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in two years, the Senate on
Friday failed to override President Clinton's veto of a ban on a
late-term abortion procedure that opponents call partial birth. The
vote was 64-36, three shy of the two-thirds needed to override.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate, the graphic charts, the anecdotal stories and
the vote itself were familiar, the stark mathematics of the
November elections loomed large over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The most politically vulnerable Democratic senators _ Carol
Moseley-Braun of Illinois, Barbara Boxer of California and Patty
Murray of Washington _ are all fierce supporters of abortion
rights. Abortion opponents hope to pick up those seats and tip the
balance in the Senate to enact the partial-birth ban.
</P>
<P>
   Since the House has twice overridden the president's veto with
votes to spare, both sides have taken their struggle to the Senate.
The loss of these three senators, who are at risk in part because
of their continued support for President Clinton despite his
involvement with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, could
cost the president his protection on a policy that has kept many
liberal women steadfastly in his corner.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson, a lobbyist for the National Right to Life
Committee, said his side was looking for a net gain in the November
elections of at least three senators who would vote with abortion
opponents on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a real possibility that the Senate coming in
in January might be able to override this veto,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League, was also looking toward
November, with more nervousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has been extremely good in advancing women's
policies,'' said Ms. Michelman, who conceded that even advocates of
abortion rights had been ``demoralized'' by the president's
involvement with Ms. Lewinsky. ``We have to convince people that
these elections aren't about the president; they are about their
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Friday's vote marked the 97th abortion-related
vote in Congress since the Republicans took control four years ago,
and that advocates of abortion rights had lost all but 13.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and
Policy, a New York-based group that fights for abortion rights
through the courts, said the political climate made Friday's
victory a difficult one. On one side, she said, was an $800,000
advertising campaign by abortion opponents to convert the votes of
five senators. On the other was the weakened hand of some of the
Senate's most reliable abortion-rights advocates and the
president's perceived political weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in tight races didn't give this real aggressive
leadership this time, frankly,'' Ms. Benshoof said. ``And the
president has not been calling senators and twisting their arms. He
has a lot of chits to call in to save himself from impeachment _
you think he's going to call them in on this?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Friday's vote was staged by Republican leaders, not with the
expectation that they were going to win, but to coincide with the
annual gathering here of the Christian Coalition, which is drawing
up plans on how to galvanize its base of conservative voters for
the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their loss Friday, abortion opponents have found that
their graphic descriptions of the controversial procedure, which
they call infanticide, has proved an enormously successful strategy
for advancing their cause on otherwise stable political terrain. In
the procedure, a fetus is partly delivered feet first, then the
brains are suctioned out so that the skull can be collapsed and the
head delivered the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   By highlighting this particular procedure _ which opponents of a
ban say it is not a defined medical procedure _ abortion opponents
have won over some advocates of abortion rights and have helped
cast those who want to keep the procedure legal as the extremists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the abortion opponents' central tenets is that as long as
Clinton is in the White House, the best chance they have of banning
the procedure is through the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my hope,'' Sen. Daniel Coats, R-Ind., said after
Friday's vote, ``that the American people will choose to elect
representatives this year who will continue to fight for the
preservation of the ideals of life and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the lack of action by Congress, abortion
opponents in 25 states have successfully enacted bans similar to
the proposed federal legislation. But some uncertainty remains over
their constitutionality, and courts have blocked them in 18 states,
citing vagueness and an overly broad reach. Cases from several
states are headed toward the Supreme Court, which has yet to rule
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's debate followed the by-now familiar contours of the
seven others that have preceded it, four in the House and three in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents offered charts that emphasize the gruesomeness of the
procedure and said it was performed far more often and earlier in
pregnancy than advocates admitted. Advocates served up the personal
stories of women who said that they needed the procedure to save
their lives or future fertility and that the ban was
unconstitutional because it did not protect a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ban allows an exception to save the life of the
woman, but the president has cited its lack of an exception for the
health of the woman as his reason for vetoing it.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who is a medical doctor and who voted
to override the veto, said the procedure should never be performed
``because it is needlessly risky to the woman, because it is an
unnecessary procedure, because it is inhumane to the fetus, and
because it is medically unacceptable and offends the very basic
civil sensibilities of people all across this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boxer, speaking against the ban, said that a ban would be
dangerous because it would not protect a woman's health and because
it would allow unwarranted government intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``No woman wants to walk into her doctor's office,'' she said,
``and see a sign that says, `Warning: Senate interference in your
doctor's decisions may be hazardous to your health.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., closed the debate by quoting
broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow. ``He would say, `There are
not two sides to every story,''' Brownback said. ``There are not
two sides to this story. Partial-birth abortion must be banned.''
</P>
<P>
   Voting to override Clinton were 51 Republicans and 13 Democrats.
Voting to sustain his veto were 32 Democrats and four Republicans.

SYRIA USES KIDNAPPINGS AS IRON FIST ON LEBANON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
EDITORS: FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20. This story is a sidebar to
Sunday advance story LEBANON-RECONCILIATION By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ When Syrian soldiers were first deployed to
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley in 1976, at the invitation of then-President
Suleiman Franjieh, they brought a shadowy instrument of fear the
Lebanese never asked for _ the Mukhabarat.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of the Mukhabarat, Syria's intelligence
service, a few Lebanese have quietly ``disappeared'' every year.
Usually, they are abducted at roadblocks or taken from homes while
dismayed family members look on, according to human rights workers.
Some are never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   The spate of kidnappings reached its zenith during Lebanon's
17-year-civil war, when the abduction of the other side's fighters
was a preferred method of warfare among Lebanon's militias.
</P>
<P>
   But after the war ended, human right workers say, Syrians
continued to snatch Lebanese and throw them in prison in Syria.
Today, human-rights organizations estimate that at least 200
Lebanese have vanished at the hands of Syrian agents.
</P>
<P>
   While Syria's grip on its weaker neighbor covers everything from
foreign policy to security, the kidnappings may be its most
effective method of controlling the population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to put pressure on the Lebanese population, to shut
them up,'' said Marie Daunay, an activist with the France-based
human rights organization, Solida, or Support for Lebanese Detained
Arbitrarily. ``It makes them afraid to do anything against the
Syrian occupation of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Daunay's organization organized mass
demonstrations in Paris in an effort to pressure Syrian President
Hafez Assad to let the ``disappeared'' go. In March, the campaign
paid off with the release of 120 Lebanese, some of whom had been in
Syrian prisons for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory, it seems, was calculated to coincide with
Assad's visit to Paris in July with French President Jacques
Chirac. More Lebanese were abducted after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are still detained,'' said Daunay. ``And
anyone that has something against Syria, that might say something
or do something against them might be arrested by them any time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, human rights workers paint a picture of a secret
police agency that would have rivaled the Soviet KGB. Through
informants, they say, Syria keeps tabs on nearly everyone's
movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people pass information to Lebanese secret services or
Syrian secret services,'' said Elia Abou Aoun, a Lebanese with New
Human Rights. ``Everyone is afraid because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Syria targets people who sympathize with pro-Iraq
Baathist party, the Sunni Muslim Tawhid Party or members of the
Christian Lebanese Forces militia. But in a region where sometimes
thousands of people have the same name, innocent people are often
seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sometimes take people because it's a mistake,'' said
Daunay. ``They beat them and then they notice that that's not the
man they are looking for. These people are sometimes very badly
injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Once arrested, a prisoner may not be released for years. Human
rights organizations tell of a particularly nasty Syrian habit of
holding people years after their sentences have expired.
</P>
<P>
   Perceived challenges to the authority of the Syrian government
are swiftly crushed. In 1982, Assad put down an uprising by the
Muslim Brotherhood in the Syrian town of Hama by killing about
10,000 people in roughly one month. In Lebanon, the Syrians
shattered another Muslim movement, the Tawhid, by imprisoning most
party members.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's post-civil war government spends much of its time
selling its alliance with Syria to a skeptical public. It argues
that the presence of Syrian troops keeps the peace, counterbalances
Israel's occupation in the south and strengthens Lebanon's hand in
Middle East peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But few Lebanese seem convinced. Instead, they feel abandoned by
the West, which they say opted for Lebanon's stability at the
expense of its sovereignty. And, they say, in trying to nudge Assad
toward peace with Israel, U.S. policymakers have turned a blind eye
to Syrian human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the U.S. State Department kept Syria on its list of
states that sponsor terrorism. But the Clinton administration
exempted it from a 1996 antiterrorism law, which prohibits all
financial transactions by U.S. citizens with terrorist governments.
</P>
<P>
   In Syria, human rights workers say the situation is so bad that
the relatives of people who have disappeared are often reluctant to
speak and that several Syrian human rights workers who did were
sentenced to 10-year jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a human rights activist sentenced for 10 years is
unusual, even for the Middle East,'' said Virginia Sherry, of Human
Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the problems, the Lebanese enjoy much greater
freedom than the Syrians do, rights activists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newspapers publish more, you can read a lot more about
what's going on in Lebanon,'' said Sherry.
</P>
<P>
   Even reports issued by Human Rights Watch about Syrian abuses in
Lebanon were published in the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you won't find hard-hitting criticism on the Syrian role''
in the stories, she said. &QL;

OXFORD CURATOR TO DIRECT MIT MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jane Pickering, a former assistant curator of the
Oxford University Museum in England, has been appointed as the new
director of the MIT Museum, the university announced this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is coming to us with a fresh vision, a passion for the
very idea of a museum in an academic setting,'' said Alan Brody,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's associate provost for
the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, 33, will be leading a reexamination of the museum's
programs, hoping to widen its scope of exhibitions and increase its
public outreach and educational activities.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering, who most recently was senior curator for the Royal
College of Surgeons' four museums in England, said that her work
there and at Oxford ``made me very aware of the pivotal role that
university museums can play in bringing together researchers with a
story to tell and the wider public who are eager to hear it.'' At
best, she said, such museums can be ``a genuine interface between
the two `worlds,' with an active flow of ideas and information in
both directions.''
</P>
<P>
   She holds degrees in natural sciences and museum studies from
the universities of Cambridge and Leicester. Her husband,
Christopher Norris, is a museum zoologist.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT museum, founded in 1971 to collect and exhibit materials
related to MIT research, will open a long-term exhibit next
Friday &UR;  &LR; (Sept. 25) devoted to the work of legendary MIT professor
Harold ``Doc'' Edgerton, who made major advances in high-speed
stroboscopic photography.
</P>
<P>
   Pickering said the Edgerton exhibit will ``celebrate one of the
fascinating people that makes MIT such an exciting place ... It's a
perfect example of something I'd like to see even more of at the
museum.''

ZENGA URGES REVOLUTION TO LOOK AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Revolution have not lost to Tampa Bay in three
games, an indication of the Mutiny's decline more than New
England's success this season. But Walter Zenga is preaching
vigiliance for Saturday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to forget the previous games,'' Zenga said. ``In
soccer, if you think you have an easy game, it is certain that you
will lose.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Zenga's advice has found a receptive audience in the
Revolution players. They have outscored three opponents, 6-1, in
the last five halves of play and have salvaged their playoff hopes.
A defense which had been the most generous in Major League Soccer
became impenetrable in 2-0 wins over the MetroStars and Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mentality is to play for the win, always,'' Zenga said.
``We must stay balanced, compact, play intelligently and with
pride, and concentrate for 90 minutes. If we are good enough, we
will win the game. If the other team wins, we will respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Zenga to replace Thomas Rongen as coach last month
changed the momentum of the team. Zenga might have arrived too late
to get the Revolution a playoff berth _ they trail Miami by 6
points for fourth place in the Eastern Conference. But he has
helped restore the team's credibility and self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Zenga's success has been through tactical adjustments.
He has been resourceful enough to redefine some roles and to
rejuvenate players such as Paul Keegan and Carlos Rocha. The
defense has become an asset rather than a debit.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Zenga has injected an effective mixture of
aggressiveness and safety-first conservativism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true that we played defensively against Columbus,''
Zenga said. ``You can say you are playing a 3-5-2, a 4-4-2, or a
9-1-1. It doesn't matter what you say before the game. Once the
game starts, you are either on the attack or in defense. It depends
on the players. If we get the ball in their box for 90 minutes,
that's great. And if they get the ball in our box for 90 minutes,
we will play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one logic to the game. It all depends on
circumstances. The other team can have 80 percent of possession and
you can win, 1-0.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay won four of the first five games against the
Revolution, but the Mutiny soon were stripped of most of their
assets by coach John Kowalski, who then was replaced by Tim
Hankinson. Now the Mutiny are seeking a new home after the demise
of Houlihan's Stadium and could be leaving Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though the Revolution have found recent success, they
remain last in the conference with the lowest point total in MLS
and the No. 3 average attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tampa has won a couple of games in a row, so they cannot be a
bad team,'' Zenga said. ``You can't look at the standings. We just
need to play well in front of our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Frankie Hejduk, the only US player to earn a
contract in Europe from his World Cup performance, will miss the
game with a leg injury. Hejduk is to join Bayer Leverkusen in the
German Bundesliga when the Mutiny is eliminated from playoff
contention.

`20/20'' REPORT TO FOCUS ON CELTICS FORWARD WALKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ This hasn't been the rosiest of offseasons for Antoine
Walker. The Celtics forward has sparred with his coach, been named
as a defendant in a federal civil suit, and will find himself as a
defendant in the public eye Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``20/20'' reports on Walker in a segment on NBA stars who
father children out of wedlock. Walker has a 4-year-old daughter,
Crystal; he is no longer involved with the child's mother, Margaret
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   According to a release from the network, Johnson says she
received little child support until recently and had to live on
welfare even when Walker was drawing a seven-figure paycheck from
the Celtics. ABC refused to provide any more information.
</P>
<P>
   Walker declined to be interviewed for the piece, according to
Michael Higgins of FAME, the agency which represents him. Higgins
said Walker will decide how to respond to the piece after it is
aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad, because Antoine is one of the good guys in
this,'' he said. ``They had the story done and they wanted to rip
him. It's totally unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Higgins, Walker purchased a home for Johnson, but
the woman declined to move. Johnson lives close to Walker's mother,
Diane, in Chicago, Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diane has practically raised both Crystal and the mother,''
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's Chicago-based attorney, Doreen Marcus, said Walker was
responsible for initiating the proceedings resulting in both the
establishment of paternity and the amount paid in child support.
``He has been open and generous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Walker pays $2,500 a month in
child support. He estimated his yearly income to be around $2
million. Marcus said Walker has offered to pay more than the
court-ordered amount.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's lawyer, Sherry Faulkner, did not return calls left at
her office. Johnson did not return a call to her south Chicago
home.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the welfare charge, Higgins said Walker was in no
position to pay child support for the first two years of Crystal's
life because he was at the University of Kentucky. He said Walker
has been more than generous with child support since turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Johnson has gone to court in Chicago
with a complaint against Diane Walker, seeking a protection order
against the woman. That case was assigned to a judge last week, and
a hearing is scheduled Oct 9.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the civil suit, Walker, Ron Mercer, Chauncey Billups,
and a friend of Walker's were named as defendants in a case filed
in May. The case, believed to concern an allegation of sexual
assault at Walker's townhouse in Waltham almost a year ago, has
been impounded, and attorneys for the defendants have filed motions
to dimiss. One of the lawyers said Friday that the case is plodding
along with ``procedural motions'' and may well go to trial. Police
have investigated the incident, but no charges have been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Walker also got into some hot water with his coach in a battle
of words this summer in the Globe. Rick Pitino said he was
disappointed that Walker did not attend a voluntary pre-lockout
workout at Brandeis in June. Walker responded a few weeks later
that ``veteran All-Stars'' like himself never stoop to such things
and that Pitino's remarks were uncalled for.

CARROLL TUNES HIS TEAM FOR TENNESSEE OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll is like the instructor trying
to prepare his pupils for the Scholastic Aptitude Tests. The
Patriots coach has spent the week training the offense for Sunday's
exam. It's one which the unit may experience just once this season,
yet its success or failure may determine how others prepare for the
Patriots for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The exam is the Tennessee Oilers' 46 defense. Test time is 1
p.m., at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As if the Patriots didn't have enough to be concerned about with
an inconsistent running game and an All-Pro tight end who has been
hobbled, though he is excpected to play. Surely, both the run and
pass will be tested by Tennessee's aggressive, blitz-oriented
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult scheme that historically has been a
real problem,'' said Carroll, who considers himself fortunate to
have someone on his staff quite familiar with the scheme _
defensive coordinator Steve Sidwell, a former Oilers assistant.
``This is the kind of game where they try to disrupt you at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Patriots fans should be well acquainted with the 46
defense. The scheme had its heyday during the 1985 season, when
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan devised an attack that helped lead
the Chicago Bears to one of the most dominant NFL seasons ever.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Bears' 15 victories that season came against the
Patriots, including a 46-10 rout in Super Bowl XX. Ryan went on to
coach the Eagles from 1986-90, beating the Patriots in 1987 (34-31
in overtime) and 1990 (48-20). He was defensive coordinator with
the then Houston Oilers in 1993 when they beat the Patriots, 28-14.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who aren't familiar with the scheme, here's a
refresher course from the Patriots coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scheme is born out of threatening the line of scrimmage
with personnel so that they can be in position to blitz,'' said
Carroll. ``It's born out of having a bunch of guys at the line of
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unusual defense in that they put two linebackers over
the tight end, one right on him and one outside of him, and either
one can blitz and drop. They also have a defensive back as a
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are eight guys at the line of scrimmage, which all can
threaten to blitz. So there are eight guys in the box, so it's
difficult to run the ball, and you can't tell who they are sending
to blitz. The reason it's not a universal defense is you have to
come from the philosophy of being a blitzing, aggressive football
team and you have to learn to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been Tennessee's mainstay since Ryan's tenure,
and many teams run some variation. ``Denver ran a little bit of it
(in the season opener),'' said center Dave Wohlabaugh. ``They may
have it as one of their premier packages.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to beat the 46, Carroll said, ``you have to get rid of
the football. It makes it difficult because they can confuse you
and send so many different guys.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears Carroll's pupils have absorbed much of his
instruction. At least they know what they're in for Sunday. ``We
all have to be aware of what your responsibilities are and what
everyone else's responsibilities are,'' said guard Max Lane. ``We
have to know what the fronts are and when they blitz and pick it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Shawn Jefferson agreed, adding that receivers
spend more time performing noncatching duties against the 46 than
any other defense. ``We are going to have to block a lot with this
thing,'' he said. ``They send so many guys out there, and if we're
in maximum protection, a lot of guys are going to have to stay back
and block. But on the flip side, there's a chance for us making a
big play.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll pointed out that one of the keys in getting rid of the
football against the 46 is to read and react quickly. It doesn't
hurt to have a quarterback with a quick release, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is knowing who's hot and when they're overloading
the blitzes,'' he said. ``And there's a lot to it. It's not just
the physical quickness. It's recognizing you have to release'' in
response to what the defense shows.
</P>
<P>
   It won't hurt to have an additional receiver. Carroll said
Friday that tight end Ben Coates, who missed last week's game with
ankle sprains, practiced Thursday and is expected to suit up
Sunday. ``Just the experience of him being able to pick up the
stuff _ and he will have some protections and hot reads and stuff
like that _ will help us,'' said Carroll.

CONSUMERS HAVE BECOME ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE CAUTIOUS, SURVEY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The financial and political events of recent weeks have yet to
shake Americans' basic faith in the U.S. economy or their own
finances _ good news for the seven-and-a-half-year-old expansion
and for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's collapse, the tumble in stock prices and the
release of the Starr report, consumers have turned only slightly
more cautious, according to a major poll of consumer attitudes
disclosed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, a
barometer of influences on spending, slipped to 100.1 in September,
from 104.1 in August _ showing only somewhat less upbeat
expectations for the economy in the next year or so.
</P>
<P>
   By past measures, confidence remains exceptionally high. Between
the late 1960s and early 1997, the Michigan index hit 100 or higher
only three times, even during the long, strong expansion of the
1980s. Its average value since 1947, when the survey was begun, is
85.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are demonstrating a remarkable degree of
resilience,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the Center for
Consumer Surveys at the University of Michigan. ``If this is all
the decline there is, the consumer sector will be the strongest
part of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers account for two-thirds of the $8 trillion U.S.
economy. With other sectors, like business investment, slowing, a
sharp retrenchment by consumers could tip the economy into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers perceived that the economy slowed significantly in
the third quarter and they expect the slowdown to continue in the
year ahead,'' Curtin said. ``But they still do not expect a
recession.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is especially good news for President Clinton,
whose popularity rests on the healthy economy that has dominated
his time in office. While Congress considers what if any action to
take against the president in coming months, public opinion will be
crucial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A poll released Wednesday showed that a near-record portion _
more than two thirds _ of households rate the condition of the
economy and their own finances as good to excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells us what the average American is experiencing,''
said Gary Langer, who updates that personal financial survey each
week for Money magazine and ABC. ``What they're experiencing
influences decisions they make and what decisions they make
influence the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although spending is no longer growing rapidly, consumers are
still in a spending mood. With the General Motors strike settled,
car dealers are reporting brisk sales. Despite a wait-and-see
attitude among prospective buyers of luxury homes in some parts of
the country, most builders are reporting strong traffic and a jump
in permits. And retailers posted excellent results on the Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The big fear lately has been that fear itself will turn into a
self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumers could take one look at the
declining Dow Jones industrial average, conclude that the economy
will follow stocks downward and retrench in a hurry. Something
similar happened in July 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait and
worldwide oil prices doubled.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan poll is reassuring on this score. Back in 1990,
confidence, which had been hovering at 90, plunged by 10 points in
the month following the Kuwait invasion and by 25 points within
three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In June and July 1990, we were jumping up and down yelling
about the way consumer confidence crating,'' Langer said. ``We're
not jumping up and down right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan report is a preliminary one. Conducted over the
first two weeks of the month, it is based on telephone interviews
with roughly 325 people, out of a total monthly sample of 500
households, chosen to be representative of the nation's consumers.
One encouraging sign is that the tenor of responses did not
deteriorate over the polling period, despite the avalanche of bad
news from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The September reading seems to confirm what pollsters have long
suspected: That the stock market and Washington do not loom as
large in consumer consciousness as do everyday pocketbook issues.
``People don't look to the stock market for cues about the
condition of the economy,'' Langer said. ``They look to their own
experience, especially their pay, their job prospects and the cost
of things they have to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtin said that it would be surprising if the president's
troubles affected confidence much. ``In Watergate there wasn't a
direct effect,'' he said, ``but rather an indirect one, as
consumers eventually concluded that the president was too
preoccupied to deal with the growing economic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not hard to come up with reasons why consumers might
continue to feel good. Prices are remarkably tame, rising 1.6
percent in the past year compared with 1.7 the previous year.
Consumers are paying more for clothing and many services, but they
have rarely seen lower gasoline prices. Home mortgage rates have
plummeted to a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' moods are most sensitive to their income levels and
job prospects. Income after taxes is growing handily. And the
economy is still adding an average of 200,000 jobs a month.
Consumers' biggest concern, reported Curtin, was that economic
troubles abroad would result in layoffs and higher unemployment at
home. Outside select manufacturing industries, such cutbacks have
not yet materialized. This week, the government reported that
first-time unemployment claims fell below 300,000 in the second
week of September, a 10-year low.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, consumer spending was expected to slow down from its
red-hot pace in the first half of the year. Spending then grew 5
percent, well ahead of the 3 percent growth in after-tax income.
Spending was so strong, in fact, that the saving rate _ the
difference between income and spending _ narrowed to nearly zero by
summer. ``Obviously, that couldn't last under any circumstances,''
said Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The drop in the stock market _ nearly 20 percent from the July
high until the end of August _ means that well-to-do households
that own stock can no longer count on automatic portfolio growth do
their saving for them. The extra kick in consumer spending during
the previous three and a half years as stock prices soared will now
evaporate. The wealth effect, used to describe how much extra
consumers spend as their wealth grows on paper, contributed about
$75 billion to overall consumer spending in three years.
Macroeconomic Advisers Inc. in St. Louis estimates that about
one-third of the growth in spending in the first half of 1998 was
directly attributable to the market. That contribution will drop
from 1.9 percentage points early this year to just 0.5.
</P>
<P>
   In short, most economists expect spending to grow no faster than
income _ about 2 to 3 percent in the next year. That's half the
pace of earlier this year, but still solid.

INVESTIGATORS SAY MURDERS APPEAR TO BE DRUG RELATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SAUZAL, Mexico - Fermin Castro is best known in this seaside
coastal village for the fine horses he keeps and the American-style
rodeos he puts on with them.
</P>
<P>
   He also was apparently becoming a big figure in this area's
burgeoning marijuana and heroin market, which the authorities here
believe is why Castro and 20 other members of his family were
pulled from their beds early Thursday morning, lined up against a
wall and shot one by one. Among the dead were two children, ages 1
and 2.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, while Castro, 38, lay in a coma in a hospital in the
nearby fishing and resort town Ensenada, police and army
investigators continued to comb the sprawling, hillside ranch he
owned with two other families. Officials said they also took 10
people into custody for questioning and seized several vehicles and
weapons, ranging from a .45 caliber pistol to an AK-47 rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the testimonies we've received to this moment, it
seems clear that Fermin Castro had activities connected to
narcotics trafficking,'' Jose Luis Chavez, an army general and one
of the lead investigators in the case, said at a press conference
Friday afternoon. ``Let me make it clear that this is not based on
our own evidence, but on the statements we have received.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials also insisted that they could not yet establish a
connection between Thursday's pre-dawn massacre and any other of
the known drug cartels that have sprouted in recent years in the
northwestern state of Baja California or in the state of Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   Investgators in Mexico City and Tijuana initially suggested the
executions could have been the work of the Arellano Felix
organization, the dominant drug ring in this region, or perhaps be
linked to an equally powerful band in Ciudad Juarez once headed by
the late Amado Carillo Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
   But what remained clear to authorities and residents alike in
this area was that they had never before seen or heard of such
brutal violence, especially against women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't understand why someone could be so heartless as
to kill babies,'' said Eugenio Sanchez, an 80-year-old resident who
works as a nightwatchman at a ceramics factory that sits about 100
yards from the iron-gated entrance. ``If this was something about
Fermin, that's one thing, but why the women and babies?''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said investigators found a blood-stained chair in the
2-story house and that forensics officials found cuts and lesions
on Castro, signs that he was tortured before being shot in the
head. He added that Castro was the only one who appeared to have
been tortured.
</P>
<P>
   There were two other survivors of the massacre - a 12-year-old
boy, who was shot, and a 15-year-old girl, who is six-months
pregnant, but avoided injury because she hid under a bid throughout
the ordeal and was never spotted by the gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the children have been taken to secure and undisclosed
locations, said the state attorney general, Marco Antonio de la
Fuente. Officials did not say if they had yet interviewed the
children.
</P>
<P>
   The victims, some of them wearing pajamas and some naked, were
apparently dragged from their beds at about 4:30 Thursday morning
by a group of intruders who wore black. They were taken outside and
shot at close range. Their corpses were discovered by police less
than an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   One California-based U.S. drug official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity Friday, said that even though the
Ensenada-Tijuana corridor has seen a significant increase in
drug-related violence in recent years, the brutality demonstrated
by the gunmen was unique for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of this year, a police officer has been
killed and two women have disappeared in what authorities believe
were drug-related incidents in Tijuana and Ensenada. Friday, de la
Fuente and other investigators said the executions at the Castro
ranch did not appear connected to those crimes.
</P>
<P>
   For many residents in the suburb of El Sauzal, where Castro and
his family had lived for about 15 years, the image of Fermin Castro
as an up-and-coming drug baron left many residents surprised and
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the tiny Indian village of Santa Catalina, about 100
miles south of Ensenada, Castro was a bilingual instructor,
teaching both Spanish and his tribal language. He emigrated north
nearly two decades ago and eventually married into a family in this
area that owned restaurants and other small businesses in nearby
San Miguel and in California.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro is most famous among locals for the rodeo he runs,
which travels around the region, and the dozens of show-quality
horses he breeds on his ranch. On Tuesday, as part of El Sauzal's
Independence Day celebrations, Castro put on another rodeo, which
was seen by hundreds of families.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Castro hosted a raucous party at his house,
said Sanchez, the nightwatchman who heard the festivities from his
post. Live bands played a mix of northern and mariachi music well
into the morning.
</P>
<P>
   There were more parties at the ranch nearly all day Wednesday,
neighbors said, but things appeared to settle down that night --
until the shots rang out. Some residents thought the pops were left
over fireworks. But Sanchez said he knew something was wrong when
he heard a woman screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was gunfire and I knew something horrible was
happening, but I stayed down on the floor and away from the
window,'' he added. ``I didn't want to look because I was afraid
that they might shoot me, too.''

BOSNIAN SERB HARDLINER'S SEEMING VICTORY VEXES WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Clinton administration officials said Friday that
they were dismayed by projections that a hardline nationalist would
be the new president of the Bosnian Serbs, an outcome that would
threaten to undo U.S. efforts to reintegrate Bosnian Serbs, Croats
and Muslims into a single nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the nightmare,'' a State Department official said of
reports this week that Nikola Poplasen, an extreme nationalist who
is leader of the Serbian Radical Party, had defeated the
U.S.-backed incumbent, Biljana Plavsic, in elections last weekend
in the Serbian-populated half of Bosnia. ``What do we do if the
thugs are back in charge?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they are hoping that the projections being
offered by European election observers are wrong. Administration
spokesmen have not provided any official comment on the outcome,
noting that the ballot counting is expected to continue into next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a lot of the factions are making claims, as they are
wont to do, but it is our view we have to wait for the final
returns and for those results to be certified,'' said James Rubin,
the State Department spokesman. He acknowledged that it was not too
early to describe this as ``the freest and fairest election in
Bosnia's short democratic history.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said it was hard to imagine how the United States
could do business with Poplasen, who promised voters during the
election campaign that the Serbian republic in Bosnia would remain
strong and independent of Muslim influence and Western
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   A political science professor in prewar Sarajevo, Poplasen
became a leader of Serbian paramilitary units in Bosnia that were
accused by human rights groups of widespread atrocities against
Muslims and Croats, as well as looting and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was not shy during the campaign about its
support for Mrs. Plavsic, who had wrested control of the government
of the Bosnian Serb republic away from nationalists aligned with
Radovan Karadzic, the wartime leader and indicted war crimes
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright campaigned for Mrs.
Plavsic during a tour of the Balkans last month, standing beside
her at the opening of an electrical substation in Bosnian Serb
territory that had been rebuilt with U.S. aid money.
</P>
<P>
   The United States spent tens of millions of dollars in the last
year to bolster Mrs. Plavsic's standing with the public, hoping
that large U.S.-sponsored public works projects would convince
Bosnian Serb voters that there were tangible benefits to her
government's support for the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended
the war.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials say they now fear that the effort
may have backfired, creating for many a perception that Mrs.
Plavsic is a dupe of the United States and is too willing to
compromise with her Muslim and Croatian counterparts.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the only encouraging news from the election
results is that the weak showing of Poplasen's party in legislative
races might force him to appoint a moderate prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least a possibility, they said, that he will
reappoint the incumbent, Milorad Dodik, who was named by Mrs.
Plavsic and is another favorite of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get Dodik or someone like him in place, there is
some hope,'' said an administration official. ``If we can't, then
you have to wonder about the point of our efforts to hold Bosnia
together. The election results would certainly suggest that the
Bosnian Serbs are not looking for any sort of reconciliation with
their Muslim and Croat cousins.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that if the voting trends hold and
Poplasen proves victorious, the United States will cut off millions
of dollars in development aid to the Bosnian Serbs unless it gets a
clear statement from his government that it intends to abide by the
U.S.-brokered Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of which candidates take office, our expectation of
them will be the same,'' Rubin said. ``If you are prepared to
implement the provisions of Dayton's requirements, then we are
prepared to work with you. If you are not, we will respond
accordingly. And our financial assistance, our diplomatic work and
all of our work will be premised on that simple principle.''

 &HT;    RACE BOARD, IN FINAL REPORT, URGES AMERICANS TO CONFRONT HISTORY
OF ``WHITE PRIVILEGE''
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Civil rights leaders, praising the work of
President Clinton's race advisory board Friday, endorsed its final
recommendations, including the creation of a permanent White House
panel on race relations, and urged the president to help Americans
confront the nation's history of ``white privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed, it was worthwhile,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said as he
departed an Old Executive Office Building ceremony in which the
board presented the president with its 121-page report on the state
of race relations in America. ``The more we talk to each other, the
more we see the advantage of building relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end, but the beginning,'' said Rep. John
Lewis, D-Ga., a pioneer of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
``In its own way, the board has started people thinking and
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the board completed its yearlong mission, the ``national
conversation'' on race that the president launched in June 1997
with such high hopes appeared in some jeopardy as a result of the
moral wreckage of Clinton's personal life since his confession of
an extramarital affair with onetime White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the president and his board continued to receive
criticism from the leaders of the movement to abolish affirmative
action programs and all race-based remedies for discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The board ``has failed to recommend any new or interesting
policy ideas,'' said Ward Connerly, chairman of the American Civil
Rights Institute in California and a leader of the anti-affirmative
action movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike President John F. Kennedy, who said that 'race has no
place in American life or law,' President Clinton and his advisors
believe that race matters,'' added Connerly.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Phyllis Berry Myers, a member of the conservative
Center for New Black Leadership, said the board's deliberations
were ``a tired, old side'' of the debate over the course of civil
rights in the next century. ``The real work of racial
reconciliation will never happen in the offices of the federal
government, but on the streets, in our schools and at our
churches,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rev. Joseph Lowery, the retired leader of the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, said, ``In an issue as complex as
race, there are a lot of people in denial.'' But he credited the
board with ``pointing us in the direction we need to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential board said America has yet to confront the
damage that ``white privilege'' has done. ``We as a nation need to
understand that whites tend to benefit, either knowingly or
consciously, from this country's history of white privilege,'' its
report said. It is the job of the president to make Americans
understand ``the facts of racial domination,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the seven-member board found that ``significant
racial disparities and discrimination continue despite more than 30
years of civil rights laws and some progress directly attributable
to affirmative action and other programs.'' It found ``steadily
improving racial attitudes, especially among whites,'' but
suggested that more direct presidential involvement was needed,
particularly as the population shifts from primarily whites and
blacks to increasing numbers of Hispanics and Asian Americans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1990 Census, 73 percent of Americans were
white, 11 percent Hispanic, 12 percent black, 4 percent Asian
Pacific American and 1 percent American Indian and Alaska Native.
</P>
<P>
   The projected figures for 2050 say 53 percent of the population
will be white, 25 percent Hispanic, 14 percent black, 8 percent
Asian Pacific and 1 percent American Indian and Alaska Native.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended that a permanent board on race relations
be created within the White House. It also endorsed the president's
policy of mending rather than ending affirmative action. And it
recommended areas of study: police misconduct, stereotyping of
minorities in the media, bilingual education, federal employment,
access to technology and conflicts between nonwhite ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's ceremony, the president made only an oblique
reference to his current troubles. ``The more I stay in Washington,
the more I realize that sometimes the very ability to hold strong
opinions depends upon being able to be deaf to the facts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But in an apparent effort to shore up the moral underpinnings of
the event, the White House arranged for Rosa Parks to attend _ and
to be introduced to the audience before the president and the
members of his advisory board. Parks is credited with sparking the
modern civil rights movement with her refusal to move to the back
of a bus in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   John Hope Franklin, the noted historian who chaired the
president's race initiative board, told the White House audience
that ``strong leadership'' would be required of Clinton in order to
realize the board's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview following the ceremony, Franklin insisted
that Clinton's confession of moral shortcomings had not undermined
the president's moral authority to promote racial healing in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the president had lost that authority, Franklin
replied, ``Not a great deal. It's not for me to make a judgment.
But he hasn't lost it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the president did not specifically endorse the board's
recommendations, he praised its work and credited it with having
``raised the consciousness and quickened the conscience of
America.'' He added, ``They have moved us closer to our ideal. But
we have more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he added, ``I think we have to begin with one
clear understanding: When we approach others with discrimination
and distrust, when we demean them from the beginning, when we
believe our power can only come from their subjugation, their
weakness or their destruction, as human beings and as citizens we
pay a terrible price.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony included the announcement of a $1 billion program
for new loans to minority- and women-owned businesses through the
Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has suggested that he would like racial healing to
be his legacy, is expected to address racial issues again Saturday
at a meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus.

   U.S. on the Short End Of Vacation Benefits &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As summer ends, that vacation taken just weeks ago is already a
distant memory, with credit card bills the only real souvenirs.
Perhaps it's not necessary to know that in some countries, many
employees have vacation allowances three times as long as those in
the United States. Hewitt Associates, a management consulting firm
in Lincolnshire, Ill., notes that many other nations set minimum
vacation lengths by law. &QL;

<P>
   In a small dinner-table revolution, Americans are drinking more
beer, wine and distilled spirits and less coffee, according to a
new study of the nation's eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the NPD Group of Port Washington, N.Y., found that
alcoholic drinks have slipped past coffee as a beverage at in-home
dinners for the first time in the survey's 13-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked 5,200 people to keep two-week diaries of
everything they ate and drank. Alcoholic drinks were served at 3.5
percent of all home dinners, edging out coffee, at 3.4 percent. The
top beverage continues to be milk (19.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest jump in alcohol use came among consumers 55 to 64
years old. Citing studies that suggest a daily glass of wine can
reduce some health risks, Harry Balzer, an NPD vice president,
said, ``we're going to try to drink ourselves to health.''

   Job Moves: They're Not Just For Sluggish Economies &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a weak economy, people often relocate to find jobs. But a
strong economy can also feed the urge to move.
</P>
<P>
   Among people looking for new jobs, 27 percent relocated in the
second quarter, according to a quarterly survey of 3,000
job-seekers by Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an outplacement
company in Chicago. That compares with 18 percent in the first
quarter, and with a quarterly average of 21 percent for 1995-97.
</P>
<P>
   There are seasonal factors for the second-quarter increase _
more people move, for example, as the weather warms up. Still, the
27 percent figure is about equal to the quarterly averages for a
two-year period when the economy was slower _ 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Relocation now can be a result of tight job markets that force
employers to offer candidates lucrative salaries and signing
bonuses, said John A. Challenger, executive vice president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that more double-income households are
moving. ``With such a hot job market, spouses are reassured that a
move doesn't mean demotion,'' he said. &QL;

COMMENTARY: BROOKLYN GRANNY'S 30,000-MILE DRIVE BRINGS SERENITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lookout posted outside Melvin Mister's house gave
the doorbell two urgent rings, prompting him to scramble from the
parlor to the sidewalk. He got outside in time to see his wife,
Joan, drive up in her silver Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There she is,'' Melvin said, as his wife stepped into the
street and gave him a peck on the cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went out for a short drive,'' she said. ``How is
everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember me?'' Melvin asked as he embraced her.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, he helped carry some of her travel bags into the
house. She looked at him and smiled. ``You look real good,'' she
said. ``Nothing like a little absence.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that affection, that must have been some drive. It was.
Joan, 65, had returned Wednesday to her neighborhood in Lefferts
Gardens, Brooklyn, after her Big Trip: a six-month, 30,038-mile
journey through 48 states. She easily surpassed her goal to drive
as far as the earth's circumference, logging 1,000 miles for every
year she has been married to Melvin, 60, with whom she spoke every
day she was gone. Her route resembled a spaghetti heap that looped
and crossed over prairies, plains and mountains, as she followed
her heart rather than a compass.
</P>
<P>
   There's a similar tangle of emotions inside her, since the trek
by the self-described ``Brooklyn Granny'' was the kind of open-road
adventure that combined equal parts of mythic heroism and American
wanderlust. She savored every moment: moonlit nights spent in a
tent, sharing dinners in simple homes, casual conversations at
diners, and even a spirited church service where the black
congregation called her Sister Mister.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times I felt like Luke Skywalker, driving along on the
surface of the planet,'' she said. ``Especially in southwest Texas,
where I wouldn't see another car in front or behind me. There I was
in this scrubby area on the frontier. It was astounding. It looked
the way God flung the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't totally alone. A few days into her trip, she visited
the Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland. She thought about
the young men who died there in the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought: `You guys didn't see too much of the world in your
time. You died young. Why don't you come along?''' she said. ``I
needed some company. I think they all said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   She could have used their help when she locked her keys inside
her car. But she did just fine another time when a drunken man
shouted obscenities at her while she was using a pay phone at a
campsite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been given mountain lion training because a mountain
lion had swiped a woman and her child,'' she said. ``We were told
if we saw one, keep your ground, act big and make a lot of noise. I
never saw a mountain lion, but that's what I gave this guy. I never
shouted so loud in public.''
</P>
<P>
   The drunk was one of the few grouches she met along the way. Of
the many who shared their lives with her, she is especially fond of
two women she met at a Shoney's in Florida. One had a brother in
Brooklyn, and they got to talking. By the end of their conversation
the woman, a poet, offered to write a poem for her. ``The people I
met along the way affected me deeply,'' she said. ``I don't know if
the internal or external journey was the deepest.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin shares that feeling, since his wife's example led him to
reconsider his own work-work-work life and nurture his secret
desires. He took a trip of his own to Montana and started catching
up on sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joan's pursuit of her Big Trip made me feel like it was
possible for me to chart some new directions,'' he said. ``Your
sense of freedom is something very internal. These external things
_ the car, the job, the money _ they are important. But what goes
on inside is more important.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife learned that lesson by the mile, with help from a book,
``Zen Driving,'' her son Tommy gave her. It spoke of the ``eternal
moment,'' which seemed appropriate the other day as she was stuck
in traffic near Court Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving is about experience and awareness,'' she said. ``That
may be sort of what life is all about, too. All we have in life is
the present. Whatever the moment is. The moment at hand is a
traffic jam.''
</P>
<P>
   She seized it, chatting up a man who was unloading crates of
beer into a warehouse. Small talk for a small moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only going to see what I see,'' she said as the traffic
cleared. ``Even if it's only this intersection.''
</P>
<P>
   After 48 states, she was serene. She was in a state the frantic
jaywalkers and horn honkers would envy, if they only knew.

NEW DATA WON'T OFFEND DURING ROSH HASHANA, JEWS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Jews across the country attend religious services
Monday in observation of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, the US
House will release reams of x-rated documents and television
stations will begin broadcasting President Clinton's sexually
loaded videotaped grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sanctity of the holiday, however, Jewish leaders say
they were not offended by the GOP's timing in making public the
latest round of details about Clinton's extramarital affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they said they hoped religious observances that day
would give Jews a chance to escape the continuing flood of
publicity about the issue. They also expressed the belief that the
inevitable uproar Monday won't cause Jews to pay less attention to
one of their holiest holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be a distraction to Jews,'' said Rabbi
Michael Menitoff of Congregation Mishkan Tefila in Chestnut Hill.
``I'm not sure that releasing it on Rosh Hashana would be different
than releasing it on any other day.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosh Hashana is a time when Jews reflect on their lives,
families and communities, and consider ways to become better
citizens. Jews traditionally attend special services with their
families, and many refrain from doing work or watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Emily Lipof of Ohabei Shalom in Brookline said she was
glad that the House Judiciary Committee had decided to release the
documents and videotape on a Jewish holy day. That way, she said,
Jews won't ``be listening to that garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipof said she was angry that Republican members of Congress
decided to release the tapes at all, saying the public already
knows that Clinton lied and had an adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the saddest, ugliest moments in history,''
Lipof said of the tapes' upcoming release. ``It's much worse than
anything Clinton has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipof nevertheless said she doubts anyone who feels the spirit
of the high holy day will allow the Clinton testimony to moot their
synogogue experience.
</P>
<P>
   Another Brookline rabbi, William Hamilton of Congregation
Kehillath Israel, said he wasn't offended by the decision to
release the tapes on Rosh Hashana because he's used to major news
stories breaking on Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to stay away from the topic during his sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my congregants know very well what's right and what's
wrong and about the predicament this country now faces. They know
deceit when they see it. They know partisan politics when they see
it,'' Hamilton said. ``Frankly, there's very little I can add.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said he wants to give his congregants a respite from a
``media culture and societal obsession that seems rather
relentless.''
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the Sabbath Friday, Debra Hachen, rabbi of
Congregation B'nai Shalom in Westborough, said she has more
important spiritual issues on her mind than what day Congress will
release the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter what day they release the tapes. I
don't take offense to it. ... There are lots of things that happen
on Saturday,'' Hachen said, referring to the Sabbath, when
observant Jews refrain from watching TV.
</P>
<P>
   She said any Jew interested in watching the president's
testimony can do so during replays later in the week anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something they have to act on right away,'' Hachen
said. ``They can deal with the tapes any day.''

PUBLISHERS SAY STARR REPORT IS A BEST SELLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: CLINTON-CONGRESS, CLINTON-CONGRESS-MOOD, CLINTON-BLACKS,

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the week since three publishers started selling sober-looking
versions of ``that book'' _ the 400-plus-page report of the
Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth Starr _ the steamy
chronicle of the relationship between President Clinton and Monica
Lewinsky is selling at brisker rates than Tom Clancy's new novel
about an elite antiterrorist squad.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 1.5 million copies of ``The Starr Report''
printed, two of the book's three publishers are poised to issue
sequels with the expected release of 2,800 pages of evidence
compiled by the independent counsel's investigators. Since
government documents are in the public domain, publishers are free
to use the material without paying royalties or advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of sales so far is fairly astonishing,'' said Liz
Hartman, a spokeswoman for Simon &AMP; Schuster's Pocket Books, which
initially printed 650,000 copies of its $5.99 paperback and has now
increased its run to a total of 800,000. She added that the company
is still uncertain about how many copies of the sequel it will
print but that the sequel already has a title: ``The Starr
Evidence: Testimony From President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky and
Other Documents From the Independent Counsel's Investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the report has also created a sudden burst of
literary demand for Walt Whitman's ``Leaves of Grass.'' Whitman's
book receives a warm endorsement from Ms. Lewinsky in the Starr
report, which quotes her as calling it ``the most sentimental
gift'' the president gave her.
</P>
<P>
   At the national Borders Books &AMP; Music chain, sales of ``Leaves
of Grass'' increased by 100 percent with the release of the Starr
report, but even more impressive was the demand for all three book
versions of the report itself, according to Jody Kohn, a
spokeswoman for the chain, which operates more than 225 stores.
</P>
<P>
   The early sales of the three versions, published by Pocket
Books, Prima Publishing and Public Affairs, ``were twice as strong
as the first day of sales of the new Tom Clancy novel, `Rainbow
Six,' '' Ms. Kohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Prima, a 14-year-old independent publisher in Rocklin, Calif.,
has published government documents before, including a report by
the surgeon general on health in America and a study on exports.
But its president and founder, Ben Dominitz, said the company had
never encountered such keen demand for a government report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are buying our book as a collectible as well as
perusing it at leisure,'' said Dominitz. He added that his company,
which printed 300,000 copies of the report, tried to strike a
dignified tone with a dark-blue and white cover.

   California-based Dove Audio is preparing an eight-hour, $19.95
audio version of the document, ``The Starr Report: Substantial and
Credible Information.'' The company expects to start shipping to
stores by Oct. 12, although it would like to rush the tape out
faster, according to Charna West, a sales representative for
Newstar Media, which owns the imprint. A male and female actor will
read the various parts of the report, with the White House rebuttal
and some commentary read by two lawyers, including the well-known
trial lawyer Alan Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   This sudden rush in sales, obviously, does not mean the original
authors will share in any of this wealth, because the report is
part of the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't seem to disturb Lynn Chu, a literary agent whose
clients include Newt Gingrich and whose New York literary agency,
Writers Representatives, has in the past represented Starr and
Stephen Bates, one of the main authors of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' Ms. Chu said. ``I'm sure there will be
many cool books written about this.'' She added, ``I actually tried
to lend a hand by calling the publishers.''

WHITE HOUSE PREPARING TO DEFLECT IMPACT OF NEW MATERIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House is bracing for a negative public
reaction to more tawdry details of President Clinton's relationship
with Monica S. Lewinsky, while hoping against hope that the
American people will be so disgusted that they will direct their
anger primarily at the Republicans for releasing the material.
</P>
<P>
   Senior White House officials are ready to pounce on possible
news leaks as early as this weekend, though the GOP majority on the
House Judiciary Committee voted not to release until Monday the
videotape of Clinton's grand jury testimony and 2,800 pages of
documents on the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials openly fretted Friday about the contents of the
material and about the reaction to the videotape. Their chief worry
is that viewers will take the information at face value, even
though it represents only the prosecutor's side of the case; they
said they are particularly concerned because they are trying to
formulate a defense without having been shown the potentially
volatile materials in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we are put in a very difficult posture having all
this released without an opportunity to review it,'' said James
Kennedy, a White House lawyer and spokesman. ``One must recognize
that this is raw, untested grand jury material, and it will be
magnified to the extent that there are leaks emanating from various
sources that could be taking things out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House aide, who spoke on the condition of
anonimity, said: ``Anytime you've got a party that has control of a
committee and that has a hard-core political agenda and is so
heavy-handed about it and they have all this material _ you have to
be concerned about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, White House officials are left to talk on the
margins of the evidence against the president. They portray the
Judiciary Committee's release of the material as overtly partisan
while accusing Republicans of having politicized the impeachment
process, an argument the White House plans to make when
administration officials fan out on Sunday's talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``At bottom, this will fall on the judgment of the American
people and whether they conclude that the process is fair,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the administration was buoyed by some long-desired
reinforcement from Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, who went
before reporters immediately after the party-line vote on releasing
the grand jury materials. For the first time in weeks, a chorus of
Democrats spoke out, condemning any notion that the process had
been fair and nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on
the Judiciary Committee, said that during the investigation of
President Nixon in 1974, records were kept private for seven weeks
to give congressional officials a chance to carefully examine them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time we've dumped process and fairness on its head,''
said Conyers, who also served on the committee during the Watergate
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials viewed Friday's reaction of House
Democrats _ many of whom have been harshly critical of the
president's handling of the Lewinsky affair _ partly as a product
of the recent hiring of several aides to help repair Clinton's
relationship with his own party on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   White House deputy press secretary Barry Toiv, in a briefing
with reporters, repeatedly referred to committee Democrats'
statements to back up the administration's rallying cry that the
House process is proceeding unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Based on ``what a number of the members coming out of the room
have had to say about the process,'' he said, ``we would have hoped
for a process that was bipartisan. Last week, it seemed like they
were headed in a direction towards bipartisanship, and they seem to
be going in the other direction now.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior aide described the process as ``wholly
political,'' and therefore one that the White House, with its
political agility, may have a chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make people understand how this has now become a
political process, a partisan effort to cancel the election, and
how they (Republicans) are determined to batter us all with all
this information,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, White House aides said their plan is to keep Clinton
from being dragged down by the scandal, by staying focused on
policy; to continue making comparisons to congressional leaders'
handling of Watergate to underscore the fairness question; and to
expand their outreach to congressional Democrats, whose support
they will need even more in the event of an impeachment hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going someplace none of us has been before,'' said Ann
Lewis, communications director at the White House. ``We are going
to have to take it step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide, meanwhile, underscored just how political and
partisan the administration's view of the situation has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a point at which they (Republicans) pay the
price for politicizing this,'' said the aide. ``There's not an
appetite for, based on the polling, a long and drawn out and
explicit and revealing yearlong public debate about this.''

HARVARD SLOW   TO DROP SOUTH AFRICA-LINKED INVESTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Surrounded by black-velvet pageantry and
time-honored etiquette, Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela walked through
Harvard Yard Friday a president and an icon of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The honorary degree he accepted _ only the third the university
has granted to a single individual outside of commencement _ put
him in a thin stratosphere with George Washington and Winston
Churchill, whose 1943 Latin citation foreshadowed Mandela's legacy:
``A statesman and warrior whose tenacity and courage turned back
the tide of tyranny in freedom's darkest hour.''
</P>
<P>
   But 20 years ago, in 1978, the picture at Harvard could not have
been more different.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, Mandela languished in an island prison,
breaking rocks on a diet of stale vegetables. And on a bleak winter
day in Cambridge, students protesting Harvard's refusal to divest
funds from the country that imprisoned him transformed Harvard Yard
into a symbolic cemetery, planting black crosses into the packed
snow of its lawns.
</P>
<P>
   This week, some who watched and lived through the waves of
protest that rocked Harvard for a quarter-century said Mandela's
arrival brought strange closure to a protracted moral crisis at the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Through sit-ins, hunger strikes, and even the election of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu to the Harvard Board of Overseers, the
university clung to its refusal to totally divest in South Africa
through 1990, when Mandela's release from prison signaled the end
of white rule and eased worldwide pressure to divst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard was a slow and reluctant participant in the campaign
to push companies it had stock in to influence the South African
government,'' said Robert K. Massie, author of ``Loosing the
Bonds,'' a prize-winning book that chronicles US-South African
relations over the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Massie, who lives in Somerville, attended Friday's event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They questioned the idea that a university should have any
role in ending an unjust system such as apartheid,'' Massie said.
``Now, after so many years, it is both fitting and ironic that they
are honoring the man who, more than any other, helped to bring that
cruel system of racism to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement to divest began in the 1960s as a groundswell of
church leaders, left-wing activists, and foundations who saw US
investments in South Africa as an endorsement of apartheid, and
mushroomed into a national push to force US companies to withdraw
economically from South Africa. Injecting moral urgency into the
equation of capital and profit, the movement spurred some of the
world's largest corporations and many US cities to pull billions of
dollars worth of stock out of firms that did business in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, an anti-apartheid coalition called MassDIVEST
spearheaded an effort that led the state in 1983 to sell $68
million in investments in companies doing business in South Africa.
It was the first full divestment of a state pension plan in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But Harvard, with an endowment of $4.5 billion and some $400
million in South Africa-related stock, was slow to pull its capital
interests out of the country. While student protests at other US
universities like Yale and Columbia led those schools to divest
completely, Harvard adopted a policy of gradualism and partial
divestment that fueled a constant, consuming battle between
students, many alumni, and the university's managers.
</P>
<P>
   The school argued against divestment repeatedly, saying it was
ineffective, costly and could potentially worsen conditions for the
country's already-oppressed blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tenure of former Harvard president Derek Bok, the
sometimes-dormant, sometimes-volatile controversy focused worldwide
attention and pressure on the school _ so much so that Bok later
said his 20-year tenure ``sometimes seemed like one long debate
about divestment.''
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1972, dozens of black students took over
Massachusetts Hall, the oldest building on campus and the heart of
Harvard's central administration, forcing Bok to find temporary
office space in another building. Six years later, Stephen Biko's
murder, rioting in Soweto and the lack of movement on issues of
divestment inside the university reignited mass protests.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, 1,500 students streamed into Harvard Yard and again
took control of Massachusetts Hall, blocking Bok from his own
offices after a report released by Harvard's corporate managers
said the board would review investments on a case-by-case basis,
but would not take a stand for blanket divestment.
</P>
<P>
   After the protests waned, in the 1980s, students and alumni
developed new strategies, holding their donations to Harvard's
endowment in escrow pending divestiture, and inflitrating Harvard's
Board of Overseers through petitions that put pro-divestment
candidates on ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The argument of ineffectiveness would soon prove fragile, when,
in 1991, Harvard sold $51 million in Citicorp debt instruments when
the bank decided to lend money directly to the South African
government. That decision sent shock waves to policy-makers and
Wall Street watchers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   With Mandela's US arrival focusing new attention at Harvard
Friday, the first president of a democratic South Africa spoke only
of Harvard's contributions to the anti-apartheid fight, not its
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Some who fought for divestment in years past said it was in
keeping with optimism and the serene diplomacy Mandela has shown to
those who took conflicting positions in the struggle to end
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration of the university strongly resisted taking
what clearly was the most effective action which other people in
the world took, and that was divestment,'' said Robert B. Zevin, an
economist and retired portfolio manager who was active in the
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that this was the most important step in
a chain of events that brought apartheid to an end. Mandela himself
has said that without the international community boycott and
sanctions, apartheid would not have ended,'' said Zevin. ``He does
Harvard honor by accepting a degree.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By midday, the principal legislators at the heart
of the crisis left their debating chamber and eagerly strutted
toward what threatens to be the dominant forum in their judgment of
President Clinton, the television screens of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last day and half has been a sobering experience,''
declared Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., as a group of Judiciary
Committee members descended on the clot of cameras and microphones
waiting at the news media's traditional crisis oasis, by the shade
of a big elm tree southeast of the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   At great length, members told alternate tales of what went on in
the private meeting that led to the decision to flood the nation's
airwaves first thing Monday with fresh reams of lurid detail about
the case against President Clinton. The promised tape of the
president's grand jury testimony was not yet public, so television
producers could afford to give the lawmakers extra swathes of air
time to argue their differences and complaints on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``A voyeuristic peep show,'' decried one Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans insisted civility was salvaged. ``Nobody hit anybody
else over the head with a cane or anything, like in the old days,''
said Lamar Smith, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But as the partisan passion became acidly clear on television
screens across the nation, other members offered private accounts
of the tooth-and-claw battling that, under a portrait of Watergate
committee chairman Peter Rodino, went on behind closed doors for
two days in the Judicary Committee room.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise highlight, by common measure of Democrats and
Republicans, was an unexpected proposal to describe one of
approximately 120 proposed ``redactions'' _ deletions of explicit
file material _ not simply as ``sexual description'' but as a more
specific description of the interplay between the president and Ms.
Lewinsky. Even in private, participants reported, the chairman,
Henry Hyde, was obviously startled by the proposal to use such
explicit language.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment of recognizing a common danger, the proposal,
attributed to Rep. Bob Inglis, R-S.C., was voted down and the less
titillating label set in place. Of such were the redaction fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a pretty sight,'' one losing Democrat summarized
with a near shiver of the committee's two days of private wrangling
in the Sam Rayburn House Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   Out by the elm tree afterward, members sought to explain what
they had done. Hyde noted that the committee's delving into this
underside of the crisis was hardly over, with the contents of 17
cartons still to be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think there was graphic sexual material in the report
itself?'' asked Democratic minority counsel Abbe Lowell of the
impeachment allegations offered last week by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr. ``Just wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde offered the television a genial pronouncement: ``The spirit
of bipartisanship is alive and flourishing.'' Nearby, Democrats in
the camera-ready crowd offered double-takes of disbelief.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At first, the Republican majority hoped to have the deletions
and the release of fresh material settled by 2 p.m. Thursday. But
Democrats weighed in with a tattoo of time-consuming counter
proposals, from an attempt to debate a basic definition of ``high
crimes,'' to a simpler motion to at least release to the public the
first few hours of speechifying at the closed session. After a
burst of dispute, this was defeated, but the Republicans' target
release time was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the members reassembled and skirmished, by several
accounts, over perhaps 10 of the 120 redactions agreed upon for the
agenda by the majority and minority staffs. One of these was
described by one participant as centering on one of the more
ludicrous and lurid details of the long investigation, with the
call to make it public finally lost by Bob Barr, R-Ga., a longtime
advocate of impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at every context, every nuance,'' said Barr
after the committee broke for the larger TV forum.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the material, Bill McCollum, R-Fla., apologized, ``is
sexually explicit, and I think that's unfortunate.'' But, he
explained, the president had forced this through his testimony on
the soon-to-be-revealed television tape ``which you've been asking
about.'' As he spoke, the White House was denouncing the committee
majority for engineering a ``rush to prejudgment'' and Democrats
warned that polls show that the public heartily opposes another
wave of sexual revelations from the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying not to be guided by polls, but by our instinct
and principles,'' said Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Off-camera, a Democrat bracing for Monday muttered, ``Sure, this
means the public has to see every jot and tittle.''

TO BRUINS, WINLESS MEANS DANGEROUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Stiff and sore and settling onto his couch, UCLA
safety Larry Atkins flicked on ``SportsCenter'' last Saturday and
was amazed by what he saw: North Carolina State 24, Florida State
7. Atkins leaned toward the TV, inhaling the highlights while
expecting a correction. There had to be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Then it hit him.
</P>
<P>
   If it happened to the mighty Seminoles, it could happen to
anyone _ including No. 4 UCLA, a four-touchdown favorite this
afternoon against winless Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the type of games you have to watch for, games when
a team is expected to win,'' Atkins said. ``You can't have that
attitude. We've got to have the same attitude (against Houston)
that we had against Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, UCLA's sky glows with warning flares. There's one
coming from Chapel Hill, N.C., where the Tar Heels lost to Miami
(Ohio) two weeks ago. There's one coming from Ann Arbor, Mich.,
where the defending national champions are 0-2 after a home loss to
Syracuse. And another coming from Tempe, where Arizona State coach
Bruce Snyder talks of ``finding the black box'' to decode the Sun
Devils' disastrous 0-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   But the brightest flare is in the mirror. Just last year, the
0-2 Bruins got their shot at a ranked team, locked and loaded, and
did not miss. Now the roles are reversed. They're the heavies, with
0-2 Houston thinking upset, hoping to catch UCLA in a lull between
Texas and next week's foe, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to remind (ourselves) of last year,'' UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown said. ``We were 0-2 and came out and put up
66 (against Texas). I don't see us looking past anybody now. We're
not in the position to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with the national title on their radar screen. To that end,
the Bruins face 11 rounds of single-elimination play _ an extended
NCAA Tournament _ because their first loss will be their last loss
as far as the Bowl Championship Series is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss to Houston is like a loss to Texas,'' McNown said.
``It's like a loss to Miami. It's a loss. It's the early season,
and we want to work out the kinks and get to be a well-oiled
machine quickly. Houston presents an opportunity to get geared up
for league (play).''
</P>
<P>
   Since its school-record 11-game winning streak began, UCLA has
performed at high efficiency against lesser opponents. The Bruins
smashed Houston 66-10 last year at the Rose Bowl, then crushed
underdogs Oregon State (34-10) and Cal (35-17) later in the season.
But those Bruins had seniors on defense and seniors at the scoring
positions and a chip on their collective shoulder the size of Ryan
Leaf and Peyton Manning.
</P>
<P>
   This group oozes underclassmen _ 16 of the 22 starters, in fact
_ and they know only success. Who's to keep tailback Jermaine
Lewis, flanker Freddie Mitchell, defensive end Kenyon Coleman or
cornerback Marques Anderson from taking a three-hour snooze in the
heat and humidity of Robertson Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Toledo, that's who.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be careful,'' Toledo said. ``We can fall into a
trap and not be ready. I'm constantly reminding them: `We can't
lose respect.' We've got to find something to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't be easy. The Cougars are younger than UCLA, with
three senior starters. They scored 10 points at Cal and seven
points against Minnesota. Their quarterback, Jason McKinley, has
been sacked 10 times, and their tailback, Ketric Sanford, missed
last year's game (emergency appendectomy) and remains a mystery to
the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Toledo will focus on Houston's defense, which ranks
second in the nation in rushing (19 yards per game), and on the
unusual atmosphere. Robertson Stadium holds 20,500 and is little
more than a glorified high school field. He'll warn the Bruins of
nasty weather and intense crowd and a potential ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo received no help from Houston coach Kim Helton, whose
effusive praise for McNown and Co. _ ``The best college offensive
team I've enjoyed watching in a long time'' _ appeared plagiarized
from the Lou Holtz Guide to Sandbagging.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to the Bruins to prove Helton right, and to avoid
turning Houston into this week's version of N.C. State.

GROUP WARNS ABOUT CAMPUS CREDIT CARD OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Instead of giving out free T-shirts, chocolates, or mugs to lure
new customers, banks peddling credit cards on campuses ought to be
handing out brochures about responsible debt, officials from a
consumer advocacy group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group said its
national study of 1,260 undergraduates at 15 campuses found that
students who acquire credit cards from on-campus marketers are more
likely to carry larger balances and acquire more cards than those
who get them through other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, especially those who fill out credit card
applications at campus tables in return for trinkets and candy, run
the risk of falling into the campus credit card trap,'' said
Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for MassPIRG, at a
press conference at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for curbs on the use of gifts as enticements, Cummings
said banks zealously market to young adults in hopes of winning
lifetime loyalty through this first-time credit card. Yet college
students, many without jobs, often can't handle the debt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``The Campus Credit Card Trap,''
students responsible for their own cards who obtained them through
an application made on campus had an average unpaid balance of
$1,039. This compares to $854 for those who obtained their cards by
applying another way.
</P>
<P>
   Those who applied on-campus also had an average of 2.6 cards,
compared with 2.1 cards for those who applied outside of school.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said other studies that have painted a brighter picture
of students' ability to handle debt, such as one recently by the
Institute for Higher Education Policy, fail to distinguish between
students who rely on parents to pay the bills and those who are
responsible for their own cards.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass-Boston, a marketer for Associates National Bank of
Delaware stood inside a student building with free T-shirts,
calling cards, and a thesaurus for anyone who filled out the VISA
application. The card comes with a variable annual percentage rate,
which this month would be about 17.99.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank's headquarters in Irving, Texas, spokesman Joe
Stroop said the bank recruits students hoping they will become
long-term customers when their earning power grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we make a ton of money on students, because
we don't,'' he said. ``It's an investment in the future of the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG called on colleges to consider a ban on on-campus card
marketers, and to provide more education about debt. It also called
into question some banks' practice of paying colleges a fee based
on the number of applications completed, giving the schools an
incentive to encourage sign-ups.
</P>
<P>
   College policies vary. Northeastern University bars credit card
marketers from academic buildings and student centers, while Boston
University allows them at some student buildings in return for a
fixed fee, said school officials. UMass-Boston dean of students
Stephanie Janey said it is considering revisions to rules that
currently allow on-campus credit card marketers under a variety of
financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   At many colleges, marketers skirt rules by setting up shop on
public sidewalks near the school.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mara, 20, a UMass Boston student, said credit card marketers
are seductive. Wearing a Citibank T-shirt he was given this week
for applying for his third card, he acknowledged he already has two
cards with a total unpaid balance of $3,800. ``These giveaways of
T-shirts and gifts do influence students,'' he said.

NO HOLIDAY FROM FEAR, OR HOPE, IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the bustling, open-air Mahane Yehuda Market,
David Biton pressed his ear to a cell phone and then barked out his
wife's holiday food orders to the vendors: apples, honey, fish,
head of lamb.
</P>
<P>
   On the last full shopping day before the Jewish New Year begins
on Sunday night, Israelis Friday crowded this market, the target of
many past bombings. At the same time as 5,000 Palestinians marched
through the West Bank calling for a return to violence, shoppers
said they were willfully ignoring the threat of reprisals for the
Israeli army slaying of two Islamic militants last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in their hearts, everyone here is afraid,'' Biton, a
41-year-old drug counselor, said, standing inches from the site
where 15 people were killed by suicide bombers last summer. ``But
it's best to believe that we have extra protection from above
during the holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next to last day of an American peace team's visit here,
a kind of national skepticism about the stalemated peace process
softened ever so slightly following Friday's reports that Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright has promised to meet next week in the
United States with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But holiday errands took precedence as busy shoppers said there
was no point in following every downturn and uptick in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another meeting is another meeting,'' Batsheva Eliyahu, 52, a
secretary, said as she waited to buy honey cake. ``Someday,
hopefully, there will be peace. Then we will pay full attention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since the Oslo interim peace agreement was
signed, the negotiations over Israeli withdrawal from Palestinian
territories have become so protracted that much of the nation has
turned away from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing, at least on the Israeli side, is a growing
apathy to the process,'' said Chemi Shalev, political analyst for
Maariv, one of the three major newspapers. ``So long as there is no
great outburst of terrorism, they feel they can live with the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year since the last deadly terrorist attack hit a
pedestrian mall in the heart of Jerusalem, which was preceded by
the suicide bombing five weeks earlier at the Mahane Yehuda market.
</P>
<P>
   Facing new threats, Israeli security officials said they were
most concerned about car bombs in the major cities and the
abduction of soldiers. Soldiers received special training in how to
behave when hitchhiking home from their posts for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating tensions was Thursday's killing of a Palestinian
teen-ager by a Jewish settler, who gunned down the boy after his
car was stoned in a town outside Ramallah. When angry Palestinians
marched Friday, they chanted for a coffin to be specially made for
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   During the Americans' 11-day visit here, negotiators have
hammered away at details of the Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank, and at a security agreement that calls
for a Palestinian Authority crackdown on terrorism and extremist
propaganda. The American envoy, Dennis Ross, has ping-ponged
between Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, with
occasional sidetrips to see Egyptian and Jordanian officials.
Tight-lipped in public, Ross issued a rare burst of optimism
Friday, declaring that he had ``made headway.''
</P>
<P>
   During Ross' visit, each side has vehemently accused the other
of intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   Given the deep-seated mistrust between them, many Israelis and
many Palestinians question the value that any agreement would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about peace any more,'' said Orly Levy, 23,
an English-speaking Israeli student who was shopping for a New
Year's dress on Ben Yehuda Street. ``We are talking about a piece
of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Manmoud, a retired worker and resident of the West Bank town
of Bitunya, agreed: ``What they are talking about is nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders have been debating both leaders' motivations
for pursuing or abandoning an agreement at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   One of Netanyahu's advisers said that the prime minister feels
he needs an agreement to enhance his political standing at home and
abroad. Another adviser, though, said he is reluctant to turn over
more of the West Bank because then Arafat will have more territory
if he makes a unilateral declaration of statehood next May.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian advisers to Arafat are also of mixed mind. One said
that he wants as much land as possible in advance of next May. And
another said it could be politically advantageous to arrive at next
May without any agreement because then the world would blame the
Israelis for giving him no choice but to declare a state.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to rise above the local pessimism, Ron Pundak, one of
the authors of the Oslo agreement, said the nation was weathering
what would look, in 20 years, like ``mere hiccups in the historical
process of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the ground, though, what many factored into their
skepticism was growing doubt about the authority of the current
American administration, not to broker a deal but to see it
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder if, in the end, this shuttle diplomacy is
going to produce anything but frequent flier mileage,'' said Hannan
Ashrawi, a Palestinian leader who recently resigned from Arafat's
cabinet. ``We don't want to be used, to be subject to the domestic
political considerations of the American administration.''

IMPEACHMENT PROCESS CLOUDED BY RELEASE OF NEW MATERIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the 37 men and women who will oversee the first
stage of the impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, there
could hardly have been a more ignominious start to their most
serious task, constitutional scholars said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A week that began with solemn talk of sacred oaths and
commitments to bipartisanship ended, for the House Judiciary
Committee, in a polarizing vote to release another trove of lurid
materials.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, even the committee's white-thatched chairman,
Henry Hyde, respected for his judicious manner, found himself
fending off tales of his own three-decades-old marital misdeeds.
And Friday's closed-door vote was followed, seemingly inevitably,
by a series of hyperbolic press conferences, as members sought to
impose their spin on what had transpired inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the initial rhetoric was promising, but the way it
ended this week was less promising,'' said Michael Gerhardt, a law
professor at the College of William and Mary and author of a
respected text on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The infighting bodes ill for the country, because the integrity
of the impeachment process depends on members' abilities to reach a
consensus, Gerhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that members of Congress can rise above partisan
politics,'' he said. ``The framework of impeachment encourages them
to do that. Also, because their decisions aren't reviewable (in
court), one hopes they'll be able to reach judgments that will
withstand the test of history.''
</P>
<P>
   For many scholars, the opening week of hearings also raised
another question, more fundamental to the Constitution: Does the
committee plan to conduct its own, thorough investigation, or
simply use Kenneth W. Starr's report as the main grist for its
inquiry?
</P>
<P>
   ``Constitutionally speaking, Starr is not the one who is
supposed to be doing the investigation,'' said Tracey Maclin, a
professor of constitutional law at Boston University Law School.
``Here we have Starr laying out most of the charges and the
committee voting up or down. That's not what the framers had in
mind. The committee should do the investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's power derives from the independent counsel law, not the
Constitution, and his role in the impeachment inquiry is unformed;
his report should be the starting point for a probe, not the
wrap-up, Maclin and others said.
</P>
<P>
   During the previous presidential impeachment case, in 1973,
there was no independent counsel law in place. The House Judiciary
Committee met behind closed doors, taking testimony from President
Richard Nixon's aides, and revealed its findings later. A special
prosecutor, appointed by the Justice Department, worked on a
separate track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been entirely different from what we did,''
complained former representative Robert F. Drinan, a Massachusetts
Democrat who was on the Judiciary Committee during the Nixon probe.
``We went into secret session immediately. We felt we were acting
as a grand jury and didn't want to hurt any innocent people. We
wanted to be fair to the president. I don't see any fairness in
what they're doing now.''
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's vote to release President Clinton's videotaped
testimony, the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, quickly
blamed the Republicans for pressing ahead with the release of
embarrassing material through votes along strict party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of bipartisanship cannot be `alive and well' as
Chairman Hyde has claimed, when party line votes decide issues of
disagreement between the parties,'' said Gephardt, a Missouri
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's Republican majority, however, suggested that
Democrats were using partisan warfare to deflect attention from
Clinton. In a prepared statement, they declared, ``The process is
working just as our founding fathers intended, and no amount of
partisan sniping will keep us from doing our job in a responsible
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders had a grim view of both parties' performances during
the opening act of this drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off to a bad start after a lot of talk about
bipartisanship,'' said George Dargo, professor of constitutional
law at New England School of Law, pointing to the largely
party-line votes to release Starr's report before allowing
Clinton's lawyers to review it, and Friday's decision to issue
copies of the tape of Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   David Stewart, managing partner of the Washington office of
Ropes &AMP; Gray who represented Judge Walter Nixon during his
impeachment proceedings in the late '80s, said the partisanship on
the Judiciary Committee suggests that Congress _ and the country _
are a long way from resolving their feelings about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it remains partisan, it indicates that the process
is not nearly complete,'' Stewart said. ``When it becomes
nonpartisan, that's when you reach consensus, and either the
president is cooked, or the president is free.''

FOR HOLYFIELD, LOCATION IS EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That age-old question _ if a heavyweight title bout is
held with only one fighter's name on the marquee, will anybody
care? _ just might be answered tonight in the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   It is being billed as Evander Holyfield's ``Homecoming Party,''
and this undoubtedly was the only way to entice 30,000 fans to pay
good money to watch Holyfield fight That Great Unknown, Vaughn
Bean. Stage the fight in Atlanta, Holyfield's hometown, and the
1,000 fans who might show up otherwise will be multiplied
thirtyfold.
</P>
<P>
   The utmost gravity with which Holyfield, the World Boxing
Association and International Boxing Federation champion, is
approaching this bout is reflected in his fight-day preparations _
the champ Saturday will be watching his sons play football in the
Atlanta area, one a Pee Wee game, the other for older boys. ``Just
another day at the office,'' said Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to fight; I'm here to do a job,'' said Bean (31-1, 25
knockouts against mostly stiffs). ``This will be a September to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a good Don King line, from the the ``Thrilla in
Manila'' genre. Holyfield, of course, hasn't fought in 10 months
since finishing off Michael Moorer for the IBF crown with an
eighth-round TKO last November in Las Vegas, a fight in which he
sent Moorer to the canvas five times.
</P>
<P>
   Bean also has fought Moorer, and that might be the only glimmer
of hope for Saturday night's fight. Bean lost a 12-round decision
to Moorer in March 1997 and conceded it wasn't much of a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for him to make a move and he was waiting for me
to make a move,'' said Bean. ``So we were just standing there
taking pictures of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean's other glimmer of hope might be that he has Butch Lewis,
Michael and Leon Spinks's promoter, and Joe Frazier in his corner.
Alas, Frazier said he will not be lacing up his own gloves Saturday
night but Bean's.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield weighed in in his usual chiseled form, this time at
217 pounds. Bean, strangely, ballooned to 231 pounds, a whopping
(or Whopper) 19 pounds heavier than he was against Moorer and 8
pounds heavier than he has ever fought at.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too big,'' said Don Turner, Holyfield's wise trainer.
``That means he can't move.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus down here is that Bean's weight gain was caused by
a simple human reaction: ``He knows he can't win,'' said one
veteran observer, ``so he didn't even train.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was set to fight Henry Akinwande June 6 at Madison
Square Garden, but the fight was canceled because (a) Akinwande was
weak from hepatitis B or (b) ticket sales were weak at the Garden
ticket wickets or (c) King was too busy in court bobbing and
weaving from the latest federal charges against him. Interestingly,
the ever thoughtful King has brought the 12 New York jurors who
cleared him down to Atlanta for Saturday night's 12-round
``Homecoming Party.'' Justice does sometimes pay.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield is guaranteed $3.5 million by Showtime for Saturday
night's exercise and stands to make about $6 million with gate
sales _ that is, before King shaves off his share.

 &HT;    Neagle joins Braves' 15-win club
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Denny Neagle reintroduced himself Thursday night. The
Braves pitching staff responded almost by impulse _ with another
shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta would need it too. The club had one hit reach the
outfield all night.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen drove in the lone run, which was plenty for Neagle
in his first start in two weeks as Atlanta dropped Arizona 1-0. The
shutout was the Braves' 19th of the season and second in three
days. Over their last 37 innings, Atlanta pitchers have given up
three runs (0.73 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a bunt and somehow got a run out of it,'' said manager
Bobby Cox. ``And that was about it. Not much else happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that the Braves continued to fatten up on a generous
portion of the schedule. With Neagle now 15-11 after two weeks down
with bursitis in his left shoulder, the Braves became the first
team in 68 years with five pitchers to reach 15 wins. The 1930
Washington Senators last turned the trick with Bump Hadley, General
Crowder, Lloyd Brown, Firpo Marberry and Sad Sam Jones going a
collective 76-44. The Braves five starters are 83-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got his 15th, I told (John) Smoltzie, I felt like we
were out on the golf course,'' said Neagle, who allowed four hits
in six innings. ``I had an eight-footer and you had a 15-footer and
you drained it and now the pressure is on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning for the seventh time in eight games, the Braves moved to
99-55, two games over idle Houston for the best record in the
league, while San Diego fell to four games back.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Atlanta beat up Diamondbacks starter Omar Daal. The
Braves' four hits included two bunts and an infield single. Their
only run came about when plate umpire Eric Gregg called a Tony
Graffanino bunt fair in the third when all replays showed it
suspiciously foul when Daal brushed it away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a perfect game tonight,'' said Neagle.

<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ Visits to New Hampshire have always been de
rigeur for presidential candidates, and Vice President Al Gore has
made his share. Friday, on his third trip to the state so far this
year, he visited a health-care seminar in Keene and a computer firm
here.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his previous tours through the host state of the
nation's first presidential primary, Gore had never before come
under such extraordinary circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   With leading Republicans, as well as some Democrats, clamoring
for President Clinton's impeachment or resignation over the scandal
involving a former White House intern, Gore appears to many New
Hampshire voters as a President-in-waiting _ even if it remains a
fanciful notion well ahead of events in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think people are paying more attention to him,''
said Dr. Alan Rogers, medical director at a hospital in Manchester
and one of about 200 people who heard Gore and New Hampshire's
governor, Jeanne Shaheen, discuss health-care issues at Keene State
College. ``Everybody assumes he will be the Democratic nominee
anyway. So, yeah, I'd say it has intensified a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mona Anderson, a therapist at the college agreed, saying: ``I
overheard someone misspeak, calling him `President Gore,' when he
meant Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at Teredyne, a company that makes computer modules, Strat
Smith, an operations manager, listened to Gore's 20-minute speech
on job creation and said of the scandal's possible effect on Gore:
``This brings things to the fore. He has to make his case sooner,
which is obviously what he did today.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part during the weeks leading the midterm elections in
November, Gore has steadfastly avoided saying anything that might
fuel such thinking. His oft-stated goal these tumultuous weeks has
been to support President Clinton, administration policies and
Democrats running for election this year.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, he never mentions the scandal or deliberations in
Congress over impeachment hearings or calls for Clinton's
resignation or the smattering of protesters that have begun
appearing along the route of Gore's motorcade, as they did again
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews with New Hampshire newspapers and a
television station, WMUR _ also de riguer for visiting politicians
_ Gore admitted for the first time that he had not read the report
to Congress by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, that
outlined charges against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel I'm thoroughly familiar with it based upon
briefings and news accounts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he felt most Americans could put the scandal ``in a
larger perspective,'' and predicted that Clinton would finish his
term ``with a distinguished record that will go down in history as
a virtuoso performance.''
</P>
<P>
   In none of the interviews did Gore reveal any personal feelings
about the president's predicament, noting that the president has
already apologized and said it was indefensible. Gore would say
only that Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, ``are good
friends'' and ``I feel badly for them and for their family.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, when Gore began a tour of the plant and a reporter shouted
a question about the House judiciary committee's vote along party
lines to release on Monday the tape of Clinton's grand jury
testimony, Gore said, ``If that's the case, it shouldn't be that
way. They should adopt a more bipartisan approach to this.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of Gore's listeners here and in Keene, frank
discussions about issues affecting the country provided welcome
relief from events roiling Washington. After the 90-minute
health-care discussion, Alan Green, a health-care administrator,
said, ``This is refreshing to me, putting the of scandal aside.''

 &HT;    Assured Holyfield awaits Bean
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It is not unusual that he would spend part of a day
watching two sons play football, even hours before defending his
heavyweight title. Evander Holyfield never has been one to
hibernate in a hotel room or lose himself in a three-deep entourage
or punch holes in walls, just in the name of prefight preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that doesn't stop anybody from wondering what in the
heck he is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I win, everybody will say, `Hey, you did a great job
promoting,' and winning would just put icing on the cake,'' said
Holyfield, who has been part promoter and part champion in the days
leading up to his IBF/WBA title defense against Vaughn Bean tonight
at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing ever comes my way that I can't handle. But in this
case, I know if I don't do well, people will say, `See, we know
what the problem is.' But there's no excuse for not doing well. I
train hard; I work hard. If I don't make mistakes, I can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's decision to watch his sons' football games is for
personal, not promotional reasons. But it is appropriate
punctuation for the past two weeks, during which the Fairburn
resident has spent as much time hawking tickets as sparring.
Holyfield hit nearly every stop on the Atlanta sports circuit:
Falcons, Braves, Georgia Tech football, Atlanta Motor Speedway. He
kicked off a United Way drive in Birmingham and spoke to several
youths at the World of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   He staged two open workouts during lunchtime traffic at CNN
Center, threw a barbeque for media members and officials at his
mansion and gave ahandshake-and-photo op with corporate
ticket-buyers along with the usual blur of press interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through this before,'' Holyfield's attorney, Jim
Thomas, said, ``and look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the rematch with Mike Tyson, Holyfield
launched a clothing line at an elaborate Las Vegas press
conference/stage production, complete with dancers and gospel
singers. No matter. Holyfield appeared well on his way to knocking
out Tyson for a second time when he won by disqualification in the
third round for Tyson's ear-biting.
</P>
<P>
   Before last November's heavyweight title unification against
Michael Moorer, fight-week activities in Las Vegas included a
fitness demonstration and pep talk for kids at a shopping mall, a
news conference with a group of high school journalists, an online
chat and, most memorably, a large religious crusade at a
minor-league baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Then Holyfield dropped Moorer five times en route to a win.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas reiterated his standard Holyfield defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's training, he sleeps 10 hours a day,'' Thomas said.
``If he trains two hours, he's got 12 hours to go. If he stretches
and does sprints, that still leaves 11 hours. What's he going to
do? He's not the kind of guy who's going to sit in his room and try
to get angry enough to beat somebody. It's wasted energy. So he
goes out and speaks to kids, tells them a story, gets energized and
comes home.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Don Turner said the activity would be reason for concern
for most boxers, but not Holyfield. ``This fighter knows how to
keep things in perspective,'' he said. ``Larry Holmes was another
one. So was Ray Leonard, and Marvin Hagler. They know what's
important. Evander is the most focused fighter I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield said, ``People say, `What in the world is he doing out
talking to all the people?' But I realize limiting the things I do
limits who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The only difference here from the Tyson and Moorer fights is
that Holyfield has accepted greater responsibility for selling
tickets. This bout is Holyfield's first in Atlanta since 1991, when
the Omni was two-thirds full for a meeting with Bert Cooper, and it
probably will be his last here. The local business community
initially was cool to the fight, and the promotion to fill the
Georgia Dome's 42,000 available seats was harried.
</P>
<P>
   But Holyfield's visibility helped spark strong sales in the past
two weeks. More than 32,000 tickets had been sold as of Friday
afternoon _ more than doubling the 12,996 attendance for the Cooper
fight. Georgia Dome general manager Khalil Johnson said, ``We're
very excited. We're knocking on the door of a sellout. For us, this
is more than a knockout right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on appearances, there is little reason to believe that
tonight's main event won't end in a KO by Holyfield. Bean weighed
in at a puffy 231 pounds and doesn't possess much of a knockout
threat. Holyfield hasn't fought in 10 months but is a fit 217
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield also realizes that if he slips up against Bean, it
smothers his goal of unifying the three heavyweight belts with an
eventual fight against WBC champion Lennox Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   If Holyfield defeats Bean, he probably will make a rescheduled
WBA mandatory defense against Henry Akinwande in Las Vegas, New
York or South Africa, assuming Akinwande's blood test is free of
hepatitis B, then meet Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield smiled when he heard that Bean recently had predicted
a knockout win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's how the man feels,'' he said. ``But you know talk
don't mean nothing to me. How many (opponents) always say I'm gonna
lose?''

 &HT;    Vols look to snap Gator hex
 &HT;    By Leo Willingham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It doesn't get any bigger in the SEC than Florida
versus Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked Gators and sixth-ranked Volunteers are the
winningest teams in the conference this decade and have combined to
win seven of the last eight SEC championships. The rivalry resumes
tonight at 8 in Knoxville, where two years ago an NCAA-record crowd
of 107,608 watched Florida win 35-29.
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Georgia, awaiting the heart of its conference schedule
next month, plays a non-conference game against Wyoming at Sanford
Satdium (2 p.m.). The 2-0 Bulldogs have won seven straight
non-conference games, since an 11-7 loss to Southern Mississippi in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   After a week off, the Bulldogs will open October on the road
against seventh-ranked LSU, and then face Tennessee on Oct. 10 in
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has won 78 games this decade, but only two against
Florida. The Gators have won the last five games in the series,
including a 33-20 victory last year. This is the first conference
game for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really important for us to get over this hurdle
of Florida,'' Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said. ``We're in the
same division, and all the consequences puts a special emphasis on
this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, however, rebounded from its loss to Florida to win
the SEC East while the Gators lost to LSU and Georgia and missed
the title game for the first time in the event's six-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won our title. They have our ring,'' Florida linebacker
Johnny Rutledge said. ``Now we've got to go out and try to take it
from them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 LSU (1-0) travels to Auburn (1-1) in a SEC West contest.
LSU opened the season last week with a 42-6 victory over Arkansas
State while Auburn defeated Mississippi 17-0 its SEC opener.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Florida State (1-1) looks to rebound from last week's
24-7 loss at North Carolina State when it plays host to Duke (2-0).

 &HT;    Volunteers, Gators view game with own agendas
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ Both teams are ranked in the Top 10, but No.
2 Florida and No. 6 Tennessee will be seeking very different things
tonight at Neyland Stadium (8 p.m., CBS).
</P>
<P>
   For Tennessee (1-0), which has had a week off since beating
Syracuse on Sept. 5, tonight's game is another attempt at
redemption. The Volunteers are the defending SEC champions but have
spent this week being constantly reminded that they have lost five
straight games to the Gators. Tennessee has won 50 games over the
past five seasons, but the failure to beat Florida in that span is
a demon the Volunteers _ and their fans _ desperately want to
exorcise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last senior class didn't beat them and this one is 0-3
against them,'' Tennessee wide receiver Jeremaine Copeland said.
``If we could just win once _ just to let them know that we beat
them _ that would be a great thing.''
</P>
<P>
   An orange-clad crowd of more than107,000 fans will stuff Neyland
Stadium, hoping that what they've read about this group of
Volunteers turns out to be true. Tennessee, which has been known to
come into the game a bit tight, has appeared looser and more
relaxed this week. The Volunteers hope this approach will help them
reverse a significant trend over the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   They have turned the ball over 18 times in their last five
meetings with Florida. Those turnovers usually allowed the Gators
to jump on top early and shake Tennessee's confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to play our game, keep cool, and keep moving the
chains,'' said sophomore running back Jamal Lewis, who figures to
play a prominent role in the Tennessee attack. ``We know we can
play with these guys if we don't make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida, 2-0 after lackluster wins over The Citadel and
Northeast Louisiana, is a team searching for an identity. The
Gators committed nine turnovers and a host of other miscues in the
first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Steve Spurrier made no secret of the fact that the first
two games were little more than glorified scrimmages, and he used a
lot of young players. The tempo has picked up considerably this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to play a lot smarter, tighten up and take care
of the ball,'' said Spurrier, in his ninth season at Florida. ``If
we do those things we've got a chance to be pretty good this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier usually trots out something special in big games, and
the expectation is that junior quarterback Doug Johnson will play a
more prominent role.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, still recovering from shoulder surgery on May 8, did
not play against The Citadel and only a few snaps against Northeast
Louisiana. He is close to being 100 percent. Johnson threw for
three touchdowns in last year's 33-20 win over Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Jesse Palmer will start at quarterback, but Spurrier
has not ruled out a shuttle with Johnson, a plan that proved
effective in last year's 32-29 upset of No. 1 Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's possible,'' Spurrier said. ``Of course, that's been
possible all season.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner essentially gets a two-game lead on the other in the
race for the SEC East title.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't end the season or make the season for either
team,'' Spurrier said. ``Last season proved that.''

 &HT;    Donnan: Wyoming best Dogs' foe yet
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It's the type of game that often makes college
football coaches cringe _ a non-conference contest against an
opponent with nothing to lose and everything to gain.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Southern Miss?
</P>
<P>
   You can be assured that Georgia coach Jim Donnan recalls that
debacle, an 11-7 loss to the Golden Eagles in his first game as
coach of the Bulldogs in 1996. That's what Donnan says he sees when
watching film of Wyoming, which 12th-ranked Georgia meets today at
2 p.m. in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have to do is put the tape on for our players,'' Donnan
said. ``When we showed them the Kent tape (before the Sept. 5
opener), it was hard to convince our players because we definitely
had them outmanned. This team, we don't have them outmanned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a good football tradition out there. The normal
reaction would be, `Oh, well, we're playing Wyoming. Ho hum.' ...
But we're getting tested here. They're the best team we've played
(this year), no question.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming has more to gain than the $400,000 payday for the
1,500-mile trip south. The Cowboys still are searching for an
identity under second-year coach Dana Dimel after dropping four of
their final six games last season. Wyoming looked sloppy in a 17-9
win over Division I-AA Montana State in last week's opener.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia might have a hard time knowing exactly what it's
going up against. The Cowboys resemble little of the pass-happy
teams of former coach Joe Tiller, now at Purdue. Under Dimel, the
Pokes have gone to a more balanced offensive attack, along with a
blitz-heavy defense.
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrival of Dimel, a former offensive coordinator at
Kansas State, Wyoming had ranked among the top 20 teams in the
nation in passing nine of the last 12 seasons. It was just two
years ago that the Cowboys ranked No. 1 nationally in passing and
No. 3 in total offense. Against the Bobcats, though, Wyoming never
attempted to stretch the field with deep passes and relied on its
running game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't show one thing that we're going to do against
Georgia,'' Dimel said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the offensive reputations of both programs, don't expect
a shootout. Wyoming's offensive numbers dropped off considerably
last season, when they averaged 24.8 points and 368.3 yards per
game. In their five losses, the Cowboys scored a combined 44
points. Both offenses struggled last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to score every time we had the ball. We just didn't
finish things off,'' Dimel said. ``I think that was an indication
of the rust we had. We didn't play a bowl game last year, and we
started a week later than most people. We had 10 months between
games, and the rust showed a little bit.''

 &HT;    On deck: Arizona Diamondbacks
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- When: Tonight at 10:05 p.m.; Sunday at 4:05.
</P>
<P>
   -- Where: Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   -- TV/radio: TBS, WSB (750 AM).
</P>
<P>
   -- Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Tom Glavine (19-6,
2.63; 2-0, 1.29 lifetime vs. Diamondacks) vs. LHP Brian Anderson
(12-12, 4.34; 0-0, 9.00 lifetime vs. Braves). Sunday, LHP Bruce
Chen (1-0, 5.79; first appearance vs. Diamondbacks) vs. RHP Amaury
Telemaco (6-9, 3.92; 1-1, 3.29 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   -- Quickly: If Tom Glavine is to win his second Cy Young award -
and his chances are three times stronger than they were a month ago
- his case must include a 20-win season, which he can accomplish
tonight. His second half has been remarkable. Take away a five-run
beating he took from San Francisco Aug. 19 and Glavine is 7-1 in
his last 12 starts with 17 runs allowed in 81 innings (1.89 ERA).
His season ERA of 2.63, fourth lowest in the NL, is his best since
the 2.55 he posted in his first Cy Young season of 1991. He ranks
third in the league in winning percentage (.760) and is ninth in
both innings pitched (215-1/3) and opponents batting average
(.240). In 14 innings against Arizona this year, he has allowed two
runs on nine hits while striking out 13. After a 1-6 start,
Anderson has turned his year around, ranking second on the D-backs
to Andy Benes in wins and innings (192-2/3). He leads the league in
two catagories, though he could dispense with one. His 1.1 walks
per nine innings is lowest in the NL but he has given up 37 homers
in 30 starts, which is tied with Colorado's Pedro Astacio for the
league lead. Arizona's first selction in the expansion draft,
Anderson faced the Braves April 24 in Atlanta and was ill-treated,
giving up 10 hits and four runs in just innings.

INQUIRY LINKS RAUL SALINAS TO MEXICAN DRUG TRADE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a nearly three-year inquiry into drug
corruption in Mexico, Swiss police investigators have concluded
that a brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari played
a central role in Mexico's cocaine trade, raking in huge bribes to
protect the flow of drugs into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret, 369-page report, the investigators assert that
Salinas' elder brother, Raul, used his wide influence in the
administration to organize an elaborate network of protection for
drug smugglers. He also channeled drug money to his brother's
presidential campaign, the report alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Carlos Salinas de Gortari became president of Mexico in
1988, Raul Salinas de Gortari assumed control over practically all
drug shipments through Mexico,'' the report states. ``Through his
influence and bribes paid with drug money, officials of the army
and the police supported and protected the flourishing drug
business.''
</P>
<P>
   From a low-profile position in the administration's
food-distribution agency, the report states, Raul Salinas
commandeered government trucks and railroad cars to haul cocaine
north. On what some of his reputed former associates referred to as
``green-light days,'' he arranged for drug loads to transit Mexico
without concern that they might be checked by the army, the coast
guard or the federal police.
</P>
<P>
   A partial copy of the report, which appears to be based largely
on interviews with unidentified witnesses, was obtained by The New
York Times. Swiss officials said they expected it to be the basis
for their government's seizure in the coming weeks of more than
$130 million that Raul Salinas deposited in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Raul Salinas, who received a copy of the report
about two months ago, dismissed it Friday as the slanderous product
of a Swiss crusade to confiscate what they insist is a fortune that
their client earned by legitimate means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is absolutely false,'' Salinas' lead attorney,
Eduardo Luengo Creel, said in an interview. ``It contains
statements, assertions and situations that do not correspond to the
facts. It is a police report; it does not have the validity of an
evaluation by an investigating judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not even know who these people are,'' Luengo said of the
many confidential informants listed in the document. ``To accuse
someone with anonymous witnesses is unconstitutional in any country
that enjoys the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Swiss investigators were unable to
determine conclusively what involvement the former president, his
father and other family members might have had in the purportedly
illicit activities of Raul Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives, it implies, were among a group of people around
Raul Salinas who were implicated in criminal activities by
witnesses whom the report describes as ``principally credible''; it
does not name any of those people.
</P>
<P>
   The report also notes that the investigators did not look
further into the matter, because the people mentioned were
irrelevant to their inquiry into whether Salinas' Swiss funds came
from illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat obliquely, the report adds: ``We have to seriously
question the probability that a person with as much power as the
president of Mexico for years did not learn about criminal
activities of this extent, even if his brother was heavily
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss report is by far the most exhaustive assessment to
date of Raul Salinas' reported dealings with the Mexican
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly a prosecutorial document, one that cites Salinas'
own version of events mostly to show how it appears to contradict
other facts. Because the seizure of Salinas' assets would be a
civil-court action, the report also aims at a considerably lower
threshold of proof than would be required in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas was widely rumored to have grown rich on dubious
business dealings during his brother's presidency, but the
accusations were almost never public or specific. Shortly after
Carlos Salinas stepped down in December 1994, his chosen successor,
Ernesto Zedillo, shattered a long Mexican tradition of impunity for
presidential families by authorizing Raul Salinas' arrest on
charges that he ordered the murder of a leader of the governing
party who was Raul's former brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny maximum-security prison cell where Salinas has spent
the last three and a half years, he has been struck by wave after
wave of new allegations. Federal prosecutors in New York are
pressing ahead with a criminal investigation into the possibility
that he may have laundered illicit funds through his accounts at
Citibank headquarters in New York. And after a series of reversals
in their murder case, Mexican officials say they are close to
announcing new corruption charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Swiss evidence seems to come from witnesses who are
identified only by pseudonyms like ``Ludmilla'' and ``Juan,'' and
whose credibility is difficult to judge. As the true names of
several of those witnesses have leaked out, Salinas' lawyers have
attacked their accounts. But even when the informants are convicted
criminals, the report often highlights reasons that their claims
are credible.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts in Switzerland and the United States predicted
that the confidentiality of the sources arrayed against Salinas
might well prove a weak point in the Swiss government's case. If a
seizure is ordered and lawyers for Salinas challenge it in court,
as they insist they will, the judge who evaluates the case will
have access to the witnesses' identities. Lawyers will not
necessarily be able to investigate their backgrounds, and the
police report is not expected to be made public.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to law-enforcement officials in the United States,
who have studied Mexican drug corruption for years, the small team
of Swiss federal police investigators had virtually no background
in the subject. But since their arrest of Salinas' third wife,
Paulina Castanon, as she tried to retrieve phony passports with her
husband's picture from a Swiss safe-deposit box in November 1995,
the Swiss detectives managed to scour U.S. court files and jail
cells for anyone who might claim a link to their target.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few such cases, U.S. law-enforcement officials
have acknowledged, those informants had been ignored or misused by
prosecutors in the United States until the Swiss sought them out.
The Swiss report also cites some confidential witnesses who are
described as people who once worked or socialized around Salinas,
and it contains what two American investigators described as a
meticulous analysis of his financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, what they have would be a triable case,'' said one
U.S. law-enforcement official who is familiar with the Swiss
evidence. ``It wouldn't be a slam-dunk, but you could definitely
take it to court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   For the family of a former president who was once celebrated as
the bold architect of a new relationship between Mexico and the
United States _ the man who fathered the North American Free Trade
Agreement and brought to power a new generation of Ivy-educated
technocrats _ the report paints a devastating portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Both Raul and Carlos, the report contends, were introduced to
the drug trade in the late 1970s by their father, Raul Salinas
Lozano, a former government minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul Salinas Lozano, with his political influence, would have
preferred Raul at the head of the government in Mexico,'' it
continues, quoting an informant close to the family to present a
dark new twist on an old story of brotherly ambition. ``But because
Raul Salinas de Gortari's infamous earlier life would not have
permitted him to hold a high-level government position, the father
decided to support his son Carlos instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before Carlos Salinas began to make his name in the
mid-1980s as Mexico's young, Harvard-trained budget minister, the
report suggests, his father had built a friendship with one of the
legendary figures of Mexico's northern-border drug trade, Juan
Guerra. Such a relationship has been reported in the past, and
angrily denied by Raul Salinas Lozano.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son of the one-time border senator _ Salinas Lozano
was a dominant figure in the politics of his home state of Nuevo
Leon _ and a nephew of the trafficker, Juan Garcia Abrego,
inherited the connection, the report contends.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a series of former drug traffickers, the Swiss
investigators state that Raul Salinas began arranging protection
for both Garcia Abrego and traffickers of Colombia's Medellin
cartel even before his brother became president.
</P>
<P>
   One of those traffickers, identified as ``Giuseppe,'' appears to
be Jose Manuel Ramos, a former Colombian cocaine distributor who
operated out of northern Mexico and Texas until his arrest in 1990.
Three U.S. law-enforcement officials familiar with his case
described Ramos, who remains in prison, as highly credible.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ramos and his wife, Luz Salazar, or ``Ludmilla,'' referred
the Swiss detectives to payment ledgers and other documents that
had been seized at the time of their arrest in Houston to show that
over a two-year period between 1987 and 1989, they themselves paid
Salinas $28.7 million.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 20, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-REVIEW _ On Capitol Hill last week, the
Republican-controlled Congress began consideration of a tax cut,
renewed its efforts to limit some late-term abortions, started
wrapping up the spending bills needed to keep the federal
government operating and pushed ahead with an overhaul of the
bankruptcy system. Hobbled though he may be, President Clinton set
in motion an international effort to contain the financial crisis
that began last year in Asia, considered a plea from the Pentagon
for more money, received a report from his advisory commission on
race and directed that the government purchase only recycled paper.
By Richard W. Stevenson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STRAUSS-SAGE-REVIEW _ Robert Strauss is a former ambassador and
trade representative, who has offered sage advice for former
presidents like Carter, Reagan and Bush. A close friend of Strauss,
Vin Weber, a former Republican congressman from Minnesota, doubts
that President Clinton will seek Strauss' advice in his sex scandal
case. By Francis X. Clines. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LEARN-DISABLED-REVIEW _ Over the last decade, learning
disabilities have moved squarely to the foreground of the education
world: more than 5 percent of the nation's students now have
diagnosed learning disabilities. Hundreds of thousands of students
in elementary schools, colleges and graduate schools get special
accommodations like extra time on tests, quiet rooms to work in or
note-takers. By Tamar Lewin. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECON-REVIEW _ The Japanese are well versed in the art of
fending off American accusations, including perpetual
hyperventilating over Japan's protectionist trade policies. But
nothing from the past could have prepared the Japanese for the
latest salvo by several prominent American economists. They say
that the Japanese government has been insufficiently reckless. By
running a tight monetary policy, wringing inflation out of the
economy now and for the foreseeable future, the government has
inadvertently contributed to a downward spiral of prices and
production that has cost the Japanese nearly a decade of growth. By
Michael M. Weinstein.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FERRARO-REVIEW _ Perhaps more than any other issue, the 14-year
gap since she had been in elective office _ or run for
vice-president, her claim to fame _ dogged Geraldine A. Ferraro in
her race for the democratic nomination to the United States Senate
from New York. She lost last week and declared her political career
closed, which makes this a good time to reflect on what went wrong.
By Amy Waldman. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW _ Although the world has focused its
attention on the one-sided battle between the Chinese Communist
government and the political dissidents who press for radical
change, there is also a large population of intellectuals, many of
them scholars or former officials, who work openly to nudge the
system in a more democratic direction. By Erik Eckholm. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW _ Who's afraid of Afghanistan? Iran, it seems. The
Islamic Republic has positioned as many as 70,000 Revolutionary
Guards and volunteers on its border with Afghanistan. And perhaps
200,000 regular soldiers are on the way. The Taliban of Afghanistan
have only about 40,000 men under arms, so te primary threat to Iran
is not military. It is instead a threat that is deeply political,
and quite humiliating. Instead of showing Iran a little respect,
the four-year-old Sunni Muslim movement, which follows a rigid,
repressive version of Islamic law and now controls most of
Afghanistan, has nothing but contempt for its neighbor to the west.
By Elaine Sciolino. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-PLANS-REVIEW _ The 1985 invasion of Libya would now be
in the lesson plans of every high school history teacher in America
if it had actually taken place. Instead, the stillborn invasion is
a classic example of Washington's propensity to gin up contingency
plans for seemingly otherworldly operations that never get the
green light. Indeed, there is a permanent infrastructure in the
United States national security apparatus that does nothing but
plan for every conceivable crisis, often with little or no hope
that the plans will be taken seriously by senior policy-makers or
the president. By James Risen. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   STARR-SPOOF-REVIEW _ A spoof on a supposed manuscript submitted
by Ken Starr for publication. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KING-BABE-REVIEW _ After a long silence, Babe Ruth has emerged
for a rare interview on ``Larry King Live.'' By Richard Sandomir. &QL;

GROUP WARNS ABOUT CAMPUS CREDIT CARD OFFERS

<P>
   Instead of giving out free T-shirts, chocolates, or mugs to lure
new customers, banks peddling credit cards on campuses ought to be
handing out brochures about responsible debt, officials from a
consumer advocacy group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group said its
national study of 1,260 undergraduates at 15 campuses found that
students who acquire credit cards from on-campus marketers are more
likely to carry larger balances and acquire more cards than those
who get them through other means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, especially those who fill out credit card
applications at campus tables in return for trinkets and candy, run
the risk of falling into the campus credit card trap,'' said
Deirdre Cummings, consumer program director for MassPIRG, at a
press conference at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Calling for curbs on the use of gifts as enticements, Cummings
said banks zealously market to young adults in hopes of winning
lifetime loyalty through this first-time credit card. Yet college
students, many without jobs, often can't handle the debt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, ``The Campus Credit Card Trap,''
students responsible for their own cards who obtained them through
an application made on campus had an average unpaid balance of
$1,039. This compares to $854 for those who obtained their cards by
applying another way.
</P>
<P>
   Those who applied on-campus also had an average of 2.6 cards,
compared with 2.1 cards for those who applied outside of school.
</P>
<P>
   Cummings said other studies that have painted a brighter picture
of students' ability to handle debt, such as one recently by the
Institute for Higher Education Policy, fail to distinguish between
students who rely on parents to pay the bills and those who are
responsible for their own cards.
</P>
<P>
   At UMass-Boston, a marketer for Associates National Bank of
Delaware stood inside a student building with free T-shirts,
calling cards, and a thesaurus for anyone who filled out the VISA
application. The card comes with a variable annual percentage rate,
which this month would be about 17.99.
</P>
<P>
   At the bank's headquarters in Irving, Texas, spokesman Joe
Stroop said the bank recruits students hoping they will become
long-term customers when their earning power grows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not because we make a ton of money on students, because
we don't,'' he said. ``It's an investment in the future of the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   MassPIRG called on colleges to consider a ban on on-campus card
marketers, and to provide more education about debt. It also called
into question some banks' practice of paying colleges a fee based
on the number of applications completed, giving the schools an
incentive to encourage sign-ups.
</P>
<P>
   College policies vary. Northeastern University bars credit card
marketers from academic buildings and student centers, while Boston
University allows them at some student buildings in return for a
fixed fee, said school officials. UMass-Boston dean of students
Stephanie Janey said it is considering revisions to rules that
currently allow on-campus credit card marketers under a variety of
financial arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   At many colleges, marketers skirt rules by setting up shop on
public sidewalks near the school.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Mara, 20, a UMass Boston student, said credit card marketers
are seductive. Wearing a Citibank T-shirt he was given this week
for applying for his third card, he acknowledged he already has two
cards with a total unpaid balance of $3,800. ``These giveaways of
T-shirts and gifts do influence students,'' he said.

JAPANESE POLITICIANS REACH TENTATIVE PACT ON ECONOMIC PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WudUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Ending weeks of bitter deadlock, Japan's governing party
declared Friday night that it had reached agreement with the
political opposition on how to bolster the jittery financial system
and begin reviving the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute deal appeared to be sketchy, however, glossing
over crucial questions, and it could fall apart. Still, the pact
will give Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi a chance to show off a rough
blueprint to President Clinton when they Tuesday in Tarrytown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided that, as the world's second-largest economy,
Japan should not become the source of a global financial
meltdown,'' Obuchi told reporters Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a deal, however, Obuchi appears to have made
significant concessions, adopting key planks of the opposition,
which controls the upper house of Parliament and has blocked
movement in the legislation for weeks. These include sharply
scaling down the Finance Ministry's power to regulate the country's
financial system, and the ``temporary'' nationalization of the
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, one of the nation's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi also appears to have agreed to abolish a $100 billion
pool of public funds set up to rescue banks. It is therefore not
clear how much money will be available to write-off the massive bad
debts held by Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement were not available Friday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The long tussle over the financial legislation reflected a
subtle political joust among the parties. The opposition wanted to
discredit the government and nibble away at its authority so that
general elections might be called _ not immediately, but next year
or so, when the opposition has built up its local organizations.
And Obuchi wanted to show that he can get things done and take
steps toward economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear who won, and it may not be clear for months. The
political consequences may simply depend on whether these measures
restore some vitality to the economy by next year and thus improve
the government's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Key opposition figures were exultant Friday night, declaring
that the government had submitted to their demands, raising the
prospect of difficult battles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. officials said they could not assess the
plan because they do not expect to be fully briefed on it until
Monday. They appear particularly focused on whether the plan will
commit Japan to inject billions in public funds to improve the
capital base of banks after they are nationalized.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, who said he had not seen
the plan, said, ``I think we have a strong sense of urgency that
the Japanese government move as quickly as possible to stimulate
its economy, restore growth to deal with its banking problem, open
its markets, to deregulate.''
</P>
<P>
   Movement on the banking legislation has been viewed as crucial
because it would allow Japan to proceed with the task of grappling
with its frail banking system and mountain of bad debts. Only by
tackling those twin challenges, many economists say, can Japan
restore its economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been criticized around the world for dithering in
dealing with its banks and its bad debts, which have been mounting
as the nation's recession deepens. Earlier this week, Standard &AMP;
Poor's said that Japan's bad debts could climb as high as 30
percent of the country's total economic output. The debt has been
an enormous drag on the entire economy for nearly eight years, and
has prevented Japan from acting as an engine of growth for both
Asia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was released after the close of Tokyo's
long-battered stock market, which now stands at about where it was
12 years ago. Bond yields have plummeted, with the benchmark
10-year bond touching a new record low of 0.64 percent at one point
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has begun carrying out a giant fiscal stimulus
package, worth about $126 billion in real spending and loans, along
with big tax cuts. But it has also acknowledged that even with that
program, the economy is expected to contract by more than one
percent during this fiscal year.Some economists say the spending
package focuses too much on dubious public works and will be hard
to implement as swiftly as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials denied that the deal was cemented just so
that Obuchi would not go empty-handed when he meets President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan's policies are not formulated as gifts for the
president,'' said Koji Tsuruoka, a Foreign Ministry official. ``It
could become a turning point in promoting change and reform in the
banking system.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the ruling Liberal Democratic Party appears to have
achieved the deal mainly by acquiescing to the opposition, most of
the opposition parties seemed reasonably satisfied. They can claim
that their own proposal will become the basis for the new financial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reached an agreement in principle with the government,''
said Naoto Kan, head of the Democratic Party, the main opposition
group, after he emerged from a meeting with Obuchi. ``Now it is
time to put it in place.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the government will have to rewrite its bill for
establishing ``bridge banks,'' the original centerpiece of its
financial legislation now before the Parliament. The idea was to
create a bridge bank to take on the bad debts of failed banks and
collect on those debts or sell them off at cut-rate prices. But the
government resisted using the scheme with the big, frail banks,
while the opposition demanded that a mechanism be designed to deal
with such institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to compromise quite a bit,'' said Yasuhisa Shiozaki, a
member of Parliament and one of the negotiators for the Liberal
Democrats. But he added that the deal was still ``broad'' and the
two sides ``have to work on it to clear up the details.''
</P>
<P>
   The new, rewritten bills are expected to pass the Parliament as
early as mid-October but there is some question over exactly how
firm the pact is. Still, Shiozaki and others said they did not
expect the agreement to fall apart. Still, the wording was vague
enough to allow multiple interpretations, enabling both sides to
claim that they are comfortable with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very broad framework, so the real negotiations will
come,'' said Motohisa Furukawa, a Parliament member for the
Democratic Party and one of the negotiators. He described the deal
as ``chameleon-like'' _ that is, it can be ``read sometimes in two
ways'' or more.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the government is expected to temporarily
nationalize the Long-Term Credit Bank, an ailing institution with
25 trillion yen, or $186 billion, in assets and a capital base so
weak that opposition groups have deemed it insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   But the two sides still need to thrash out exactly how Long-Term
Credit will be taken over by the state and whether it will be
declared technically bankrupt. The Liberal Democrats have resisted
declaring such a large institution bankrupt, partly out of fear
that doing so would provoke financial instability.
</P>
<P>
   An official at the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank,
ruled out the possibility of a default by Long-Term Credit if it is
put under state control, according to Japanese media, and he said
the Bank of Japan would provide loans, even without collateral, to
Long-Term Credit to prevent a credit squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   While many economists agree that the Liberal Democrats may have
a point in worrying about instability in the overall system, some
have criticized the emphasis that politicians have put on the
problems of Long-Term Credit, or LTCB, an institution originally
set up after World War II to provide long-term loans to help
finance economic rebuilding . They fear that once a solution to
that bank's crisis is reached, officials may feel that they have
finished their work and relax their resolve to overhaul the
financial system at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world will closely watch LTCB and shift its focus to the
next phase of banking consolidation and restructuring,'' said
Charles Dallara, managing director at the Institute of
International Finance. ``The issue is: Can they pull the entire
banking system through consolidation?''
</P>
<P>
   This issue has been at the heart of the controversy, ever since
the Liberal Democrats first proposed the financial bills during the
spring, in the form of the Total Plan. Even members within the
Liberal Democratic Party were somewhat divided on how to deal with
very large banks that were in danger of collapsing, and everyone
has been concerned about how to save the worthy borrowers of failed
institutions. Many Liberal Democrats members, though, agreed on a
``soft landing'' for the financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the party brokered a rescue merger between the ailing
Long-Term Credit and Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Corp. But after a
stunning defeat of the Liberal Democrats in landmark elections this
summer, then-Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was forced to resign
and the financial legislation was put in jeopardy. The opposition
groups seized the opportunity to challenge the governing party's
approach and offer a more radical path for stabilizing the
financial system.
</P>
<P>
   With the new agreement Friday night, it is unclear what will
happen to those merger plans.
</P>
<P>
   One important question that Friday night's deal does not address
is whether the government will let other weak and insolvent banks
fail or go bankrupt, even if they are among the nation's biggest
ones.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the pact, the Liberal Democrats also agreed to scrap
a 13 trillion yen pool of government funds created in February to
boost capital in the banking system. In March, nearly 2 trillion
yen was used to buy stakes in the nation's largest 19 banks, on the
condition that they were still solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling back that scheme is a humiliation for the Finance
Ministry and its minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, who was instrumental in
designing the government fund, part of an overall 30 trillion yen,
or $225 billion, plan to help bail out the banks. The remainder of
the money will still be used to support depositors.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the biggest concessions, the Liberal Democrats say
they have have agreed to strip the Finance Ministry of some of its
powers in determining financial policy and instead create an
independent panel to determine the fate of troubled financial
institutions. This change, if actually put into effect, could
transform the way financial institutions function in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To separate out the financial policy-making powers from the
ministry, the politicians agreed to draft new legislation by the
next Parliamentary session in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition will help draw up a new mechanism to deal with
hobbled, weakly capitalized banks under the supervision of a
bankruptcy administrator.
</P>
<P>
   According to Japanese media, these banks will be able to apply
for state control or they may be given the option of conversion
into a bridge bank. The deal also calls for setting up a debt
collection entity, similar to the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp., and
this institution will purchase bad loans from failed banks until
the end of March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of public money to be set aside for the new scheme
has not been decided upon, though Japanese media reports have put
the figure at 10 trillion yen, or $75 billion.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So much for the dignity attendant to the solemn process of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This will surely be remembered as a week when the last shred of
civility in Washington's political culture was torn away, and the
day when Republicans found ``bipartisanship'' in party-line votes
and Democrats called them the intolerant equivalent fo
Afghanistan's Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any bipartisan agreement left about Washington, it
was in disgust for this atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Texas, George W. Bush, told the Austin
American-Statesman that the scandal is depressing him and has left
him wondering whether he wants to seek the presidency after all.
``The process in Washington is a sullied process,'' Bush said in an
interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, a veteran who
served in the House during the Watergate impeachment proceedings,
called the atmosphere in Washington ``sick,'' and said that he,
too, was deeply depressed and distressed. ``You have politicians
using the Ten Commandments as spears to skewer each other,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding issue was the insistence by House Republicans on
prompt publication of President Clinton's testimony to Kenneth
Starr's grand jury _ a torrent of still more salacious and
embarrassing material which they calculate will damage him further
_ even if it risks a backlash against them.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had barely begun to absorb the shock of Starr's lurid
report before new wrangling over releasing the videotape of the
president's testimony inflamed already raw feelings in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Wednesday, another body blow came with the publication
of an article about Rep. Henry J. Hyde's extramarital affair 30
years ago. The article was published in Salon, an online magazine,
which conceded, in a statement explaining why it published a story
that several other publications declined to pursue, that it was
``fighting fire with fire, descending to the gutter tactics of
those we deplore.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Republicans were trying to exploit the sympathy
generated for Hyde, R-Ill., by accusing the White House, with no
evidence at all, of stimulating the story, something several White
House officials, as well as the magazine, strenuously denied.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's tableau, after the House Judiciary Committee met,
showed that partisan acrimony has firmly taken hold. After two days
of rancorous debate over the videotape and 2,800 more pages of
damaging evidence, Republicans prevailed in forcing the release of
the materials.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the microphones outside the committee room to decry the
move, which came in a party-line vote, Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts drew a metaphor that revealed the intensity of the
ill will that pervaded the deliberations. ``If this is
bipartisanship,'' the feisty Democratic liberal said, ``then the
Taliban wins a medal for religious tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Hyde, the panel's chairman, attempted to explain the
rationale for the committee's decision, saying he didn't think the
divisions between Republicans and Democrats were so bitter, Frank
stepped back up to the microphone, interrupted Hyde, and lambasted
the Republicans all over again for trying to embarrass the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emerging bipartisan agreement on the gutter level of
political discourse in Washington these days, it still seems to get
worse with each passing day. But there is a simple explanation, and
one that suggests the end may be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The November congressional elections are looming and the
shrillest voices in both parties are trying to motivate their voter
base, no matter that the name-calling and salacious subject matter
turns off many other voters in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are Republicans, including Senate Judiciary
Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah, who have expressed deep concern over
the effect the sordid Lewinsky imbroglio is having on public life,
others see partisan advantage to pushing the scandal to the limit
and further damaging Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that the public wants Washington to
put the scandal behind it, and even Republican voters expressed
reluctance about releasing the tape of the president's grand jury
testimony, though conservative Republicans favored the release. But
in an off-year election when a low turnout is expected,
congressional Republicans are dependent on these conservative
voters and are thus following their instincts about how hard to
push president Clinton to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that House Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, who earlier this month said he would leave the impeachment
process to the judicious Hyde, reversed course this week and
strongly urged his Republican colleagues, in a closed-door meeting,
to vote to release a second wave of more damaging evidence compiled
by Starr. Indeed, Republicans had hoped to resolve the issue
earlier in the week, in time for the Sunday public affairs
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Frank are also looking to November, hoping that
the hard-line Republican rhetoric and Starr's tough tactics will
create a backlash. When Rep. Maxine Waters of California, another
liberal Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, complained to
news media that the president was being ``railroaded,'' she was
attempting to galvanize an African-American constituency whose
turnout is central to Democratic hopes of escaping an electoral
rout in November and whose support could be one of Clinton's last
lines of defense.

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Even within the wings of the two parties, there have been some
jarring contradictions. Rep. Christopher Cox, a California
conservative, took to the airwaves this week to urge the public
release of Starr's case, despite the salaciousness of the
materials. Three years ago, Cox was one of the champions of
Republican legislation to ban indecent material from the Internet.
In a speech on the House floor, he expressed worries about having
his two children find ``offensive material.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's elders, who have a stake in preserving a culture
where politicians spar by day and dine together by night, expressed
worries that in a media age, such niceties were all but impossible
to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawyer Leonard Garment, who lived through Watergate
inside the Nixon White House, said the current debate seems more
bitter and hyperbolic because of the ``immense competitive
pressures of this media age. Explanations cannot be given,
distinctions cannot be drawn. We're in the middle of this huge,
emotionally agitating culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mankiewicz, a veteran of the Robert Kennedy and George
McGovern presidential campaigns, said in an interview: ``I've never
known it to be so bilious or so rancorous. It's as if all the oil
had drained out of the machinery and metal is rubbing on metal
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran of the Watergate era, former Senate Majority
Leader Robert Dole, who was a Republican of Kansas, expressed hope
that Washington would find its moorings once again. He was
scheduled to meet privately Friday with Clinton, who defeated Dole
for the presidency in 1996, to discuss turmoil in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through one of these,'' Dole said in an interview.
``It gets testy and nasty and partisan. And then, hopefully, the
Congress will come together in some bipartisan way.''

CONDITION OF CRASH WRECKAGE COMPLICATES WORK OF INVESTIGATORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ All those who have seen it fumble with
words that seem inadequate to express the horror of the ocean floor
where the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111 came to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine or describe what's down there, because
it's unbelievable,'' said Petty Officer Josh Boisvert, one of the
Canadian divers who has descended the 180 feet to work at the crash
site five miles off the fishing village of Peggy's Cove.
</P>
<P>
   From the accounts of divers and from videotapes of the wreckage,
it is a hellish scene _ jagged hunks of metal that one Canadian
Navy officer said ``don't resemble an aircraft any more,'' with
cables squirming in the murky currents and shattered bits of human
remains tangled in the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Crews of helmeted divers from Canada and the United States,
wearing weighted boots and vests, have had to pick their way
carefully through the mess, watching for razor-edged shards that
could pierce their protective suits or sever the line to the
surface that allows them to breath a special mixture of helium and
oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Working with caution, respect and quiet efficiency during the 25
to 30 minutes they have on the bottom for each descent, they have
managed to recover most of the easily gathered human remains from
the ocean floor and have started venturing into the pulverized
pieces of the fuselage to find more remains. Altogether, 229
passengers and crew members died instantly when the McDonnell
Douglas jet, flying from Kennedy International Airport in New York
to Geneva, slammed into the North Atlantic two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   From sonar readings taken in the days shortly after the Sept. 2
crash, investigators at first believed that the jumbo jet broke
into several large pieces on impact. But the sonar proved
deceptive. One hunk detected by sonar was actually a big rock, and
the rest were not large pieces, but, said Dana Doiron, a spokesman
for the Transportation Safety Board of Canada, ``large piles of
small pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now say the main area of debris measures just 200
feet long by 120 feet wide _ less than the dimensions of the MD-11
when it was whole. That suggests that the plane hit the water at a
tremendous rate of speed and at a sharp _ almost perpendicular _
angle. However, Vic Gerden, chief investigator for the
Transportation Safety Board of Canada, said it was too early to
know exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The condition of the wreckage vastly complicates the work of
investigators who are trying to learn what caused the MD-11 to
suddenly plunge into the Atlantic. So far, only about 2 percent of
the wreckage has been brought up from the depths and reassembled,
and it is not at all clear that investigators will be able to bring
up all _ or even most _ of the debris.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials are proceeding cautiously with the recovery
and investigation, but in sharp contrast to the situation two years
ago when Trans World Airlines Flight 800 exploded off off Long
Island, N.Y., they are under no obvious pressure from on shore to
speed up their work.
</P>
<P>
   After the TWA crash, relatives of the victims clamored for
answers, demanding quick retrieval of bodies and recovery of all
the wreckage in hopes of learning what caused that air disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that urgency stemmed from the suspicion that the jet had
been the target of a bomb or missile, a theory that was eventually
discarded by the FBI, but only after every piece of the wreckage
had been examined for even minute traces of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   From almost the very beginning, investigators on the Swissair
crash have said they had no evidence to suggest that a criminal act
was involved. Rather, they know the cockpit filled with smoke
before the crash, and that both flight recorders quit working at
about the same time _ strong indications of a massive electrical
failure. But they do not know what caused the smoke or the
electrical failure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, although many grieving family members made the
sorrowful journey to Halifax and Peggy's Cove to bid farewell,
officials say they expressed no impatience over the course of the
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not once. Not at all,'' said Dr. John Butt, the Nova Scotia
chief medical examiner who has been working almost nonstop to try
to identify the remains of the victims. Only one body was recovered
intact, and Butt's team of pathologists, working out of a temporary
morgue set up inside a hangar at a nearby air base, have been able
to identify the remains of only 10 victims. ``One of the reasons
why there have been no angry phone calls,'' Butt said, ``is that
the situation is such that there are no easy answers.''

<P>
   Butt said he and his team have compiled a computer list of the
medical and personal characteristics of the passengers and crew and
try to find matches with information that comes from collected
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from dental records to DNA and personal jewelry is
cataloged in the computer, Butt said, to make identification
easier.
</P>
<P>
   But the task is enormous and is complicated even further by the
dangerous conditions the divers face as they search through the
debris.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the scene underwater, Boisvert said that in the
central pile of twisted debris, the largest piece seems to be a
section of fuselage about 10 feet long and 5 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had jagged edges, like somebody peeled it off the
aircraft,'' he said. The light on his helmet also illuminated part
of an engine cowling, a wheel of the front landing gear that was
standing upright in the water and what appeared to be some part of
a wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much aircraft parts everywhere, what's left of
human remains is hard to identify sometimes because it almost looks
like cushions,'' Boisvert said.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after his first dive to the wreckage, Master Seaman
Paul Walsh of the Canadian Navy described the eerie sight of jumble
of debris, strangely livened by bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are life vests down there with Swissair on it,'' he said
by telephone from one of the Navy ships anchored over the debris
field about five miles off Peggy's Cove. ``You've got the orange
colors of the interior and the white of the airplane skin itself.
And then amongst that you have the flesh tones of human remains
mixed among it.''
</P>
<P>
   The jumble of metal gave evidence of the force of the impact,
but it was the personal items mixed in that most affected the
divers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a woman's purse, a travel purse, not a big one, that was
obviously full of personal effects, and that really put it home for
me,'' said Seaman Walsh, a native of Nova Scotia who remembers his
father, Mickey, also a a Navy diver, sitting alone in the family
kitchen after coming back from a recovery mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in there, who that purse belonged to and the idea that
that person less than a week and a half ago was on their way home
or on the way from visiting somebody ...'' he paused. ``Everywhere
you look, you say this is definitely a place where people once were
happily on their way going somewhere, and then, kaboom.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, a specially equipped U.S. salvage ship that
played a key role in the TWA crash investigation, the USS Grapple,
will be used to lift the larger pieces of wreckage to uncover more
remains and to bring parts of the jet to the surface to help
investigators determine what happened.
</P>
<P>
   But although the Grapple has been in place since Monday, said
Lt. John Oliviera of the U.S. Navy, its 300-ton capacity crane
won't be used extensively until the recovery of human remains is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority of the Navy remains the recovery of human
remains,'' Oliviera said.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern now about deteriorating weather conditions as
winter nears, and about exposing the divers to unacceptable risk.
That issue was raised in the early days of the recovery by a group
of relatives of the victims. Commander Rick Town of HMCS Preserver,
the first Canadian ship to reach the crash site, said that when he
accidentally encountered a group of grieving relatives shortly
after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting there was a group of about 20 grieving relatives. They
quickly surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the people in the group came forward, clearly one of
the families who had suffered the loss of a loved on in this event.
You can see it in their eyes,'' Town said. ``She came up to me and
said, `We understand,' then very quickly she corrected herself and
said `We're trying to understand what it's like for you out there
trying to gather everything on our behalf.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Later,'' he continued, ``they communicated back to my boss and
told him that what they want in very clear and very unequivocal
terms is `Do not endanger yourself to recover the remains for us.'
So is that providing pressure on us? Well, we're human too.'' &QL;

CHRISTIAN COALITION IS OUTSPOKEN ON CLINTON SCANDAL

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the starkest display of contrasting Republican
approaches to capitalizing on the White House scandal, several
speakers at the Christian Coalition's convention here on Friday
expressed outrage at President Clinton while others said only that
he deserved their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening session of the group's annual meeting, Pat
Robertson, the coalition's founder and chairman, thundered to about
3,000 cheering religious conservatives: ``For nearly nine months we
have been mocked, demeaned, belittled and lied to.'' The applause
grew when he said the office once occupied ``by Washington and
Jefferson and Lincoln'' had become ``the playpen for the sexual
freedom of the poster child of the 1960s.''
</P>
<P>
   That, he said, was only the beginning. ``I say to you today,''
he continued, ``we will be silent no longer.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as Robertson, the television evangelist, set the stage
for a weekend of red-meat appeals to the loyal, conservative
Republican base, subsequent speeches by the party's top two leaders
in Congress were decidedly tame.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican
leader, seemed to go out of their way to resist delivering
sure-fire applause lines. Instead of calling on the president to
resign, they called upon the audience to pray for him.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering offered the most telling display of how
Republicans are seeking to politically make the most of the
president's scandal. By attacking Clinton as immoral, Robertson and
several presidential hopefuls seized the opportunity to emphasize
their religious and conservative credentials to core Republicans
who are crucial in the party's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Their invective _ Robertson and others said the president should
not resign but be impeached, so he could be punished _ was also
intended to send conservatives to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional leaders such as Gingrich, who behind the
scenes are orchestrating the effort toward impeaching the president
and are making sure the videotape of his grand jury testimony is
released, are publicly trying to appear above partisanship. The
scandal could backfire on Republicans, their advisers say, if they
appear to relish Clinton's travails.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats run the risk of defending a president who has
got a kind of rich man's justice: The laws apply to everybody but
me,'' Randy Tate, the executive director of the Christian
Coalition. said in an interview. The Republicans ``run the risk of
looking like they're too anxious to go through with this.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who did not know better, Gingrich sounded like a
close friend of the president. ``I ask all of you as Americans to
include in your prayers the president,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than attack Clinton directly, Lott, of Mississippi,
referred to ``the White House attack dogs,'' whom he accused of
being the source for a magazine article this week that disclosed
that Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had an
affair three decades ago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several speakers denounced Clinton while trying not to appear
overtly partisan. Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader,
did not mention the president directly when he described a
conversation with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the sense that she was speaking for all the women in
America when she started the conversation with `Listen, buster, you
pull a stunt like that on me and you'll be lying in a pool of blood
hearing me ask, `How do I reload this thing?''' Armey said. Turning
to the audience, he added, ``What I'm afraid of is how many of you
guys are going to come out for gun control?''
</P>
<P>
   A comment by Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip,
prompted several listeners to hoot: ``Impeach! Impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This president shows such reckless behavior sitting in the
Oval Office _ and I'm being a little indelicate _ being serviced by
a 21-year-old intern while he's on the phone to the chairman of the
Foreign Operations Appropriations Committee, discussing sending
your sons and daughters to Bosnia,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle devoted most of his address to
abortion. Like many other speakers, he ridiculed Democrats for
failing on Friday _ for the second time in two years _ to overturn
Clinton's veto of a ban on a late-term abortion procedure. Senate
leaders delayed the vote so it would coincide with the coalition's
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   But Quayle, who weeks ago called for Clinton's resignation, did
not skip the subject entirely. ``The nation is finally coming to
grips with the consequences of what we have tolerated,'' he said.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, N.Y. SENATE RACE GETS NASTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To listen to Rep. Charles Schumer in recent days,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato is a liar: an untrustworthy, out-of-touch,
Republican relic who is soft on crime and a promoter of higher
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to D'Amato, Schumer is a liar: an ambitious,
out-of-touch, liberal Brooklyn congressman who is soft on crime and
a promoter of higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It has been just four days since Schumer began the third attempt
by the Democratic Party to remove D'Amato from the Senate. But
already _ in television advertisements and press conferences, in
speeches and interviews _ the competition between Schumer and
D'Amato has attained a level of invective that usually does not
arrive until a contest's final days.
</P>
<P>
   In an unmistakable signal of how the race is going to be played
during the next six weeks _ rough and on television _ D'Amato
demanded Friday afternoon that Schumer withdraw ``blatantly wrong''
advertisements that end with the memorably harsh tag line:
``D'Amato: too many lies for too long.'' Schumer laughed him off.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Democrats and Republicans familiar with the political
histories of D'Amato and Schumer, and aware of polls showing that
D'Amato's re-election is not assured, had eagerly anticipated this
competition. They expected it to be hard-fought, fast-paced and
engaging.
</P>
<P>
   But few expected it to be this hard-fought and this fast-paced
so soon, even though Schumer had promised that he would ``take it
to'' D'Amato if he won the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of ferocity, I don't think I've seen anything like
this since the 1993 mayoral race in New York,'' said Richard
Schrader, a political analyst. ``Schumer is defining himself as a
stronger candidate than any other candidate D'Amato has faced
before.''
</P>
<P>
   That these two, of all candidates in New York, have engaged so
quickly and intensely is, in many ways, not a surprise to
politicians here. But the fact that the campaign has struck a
negative tone so soon, particularly after a primary that was
noteworthy for its civility, was unexpected by Democrats and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when voters are known to dislike negative
campaigns _ no matter how effective such tactics prove to be for
some candidates _ there was concern among many Democrats and
Republicans about the risks Schumer and D'Amato were taking in
starting their campaigns at this level.

INVESTING WITH JAMES H. GIPSON OF THE CLIPPER FUND 
</HEADLINE>

clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20)  
 (af)  
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As stock indexes climbed to record highs during the first half
of the year, many managers of stock mutual funds were throwing most
every dollar they had into the market.
</P>
<P>
   Not James H. Gipson, founder and lead manager of the Clipper
Fund. By mid-July, he had a fat 44 percent of his portfolio in cash
and Treasury bonds, with the balance in just 17 stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not happy, said Gipson, recalling snippy letters
from shareholders. One, he remembered, said something like this:
``If I wanted my money in cash, I would have put it in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   With the summer selloff in stocks, cash suddenly looked great,
and so did Clipper, which lost far less than the market over all.
And the fund now has a bundle of cash on hand for bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you will find that we did an exceptionally good job of
capital preservation during a difficult period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's right. From July 17, when the market peaked, through Sept.
11, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index slumped by 17.2 percent.
The average large-capitalization value fund lost 17.4 percent over
that period, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial
publisher. Gipson's fund, with $960.1 million in assets, lost just
7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in early 1984, Clipper has returned 17
percent annually, on average, just ahead of the S&AMP;P and
substantially better than the 13.5 percent of the average large-cap
value fund.
</P>
<P>
   Gipson founded Clipper's adviser, Pacific Financial Research of
Beverly Hills, Calif., in 1980, to manage institutional portfolios.
Last year, he and four minority partners sold Pacific Financial to
United Asset Management, ``in part for personal reasons but also
for the same reason that we've been selling stocks in the
portfolio,'' he said. ``We found the market was generously valued
and we decided to take some money off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a contract to continue running the firm for seven years,
as do his co-managers, Michael C. Sandler and Bruce Veaco.
</P>
<P>
   Gipson buys a company's stock only when it is priced at least 30
percent below its so-called intrinsic value, the amount a company
is estimated to be worth to a private buyer, and typically sells
when it hits that value. For the last two years or so, the fund
found few stocks that met its standards, and its cash position
grew.
</P>
<P>
   Since the market correction began in July, however, the number
of stocks in Clipper has risen to 23, while cash has fallen to less
than 40 percent. ``We have shifted from being holders of sizable
cash to being patient buyers'' of stocks, Gipson said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the fund's concentration bothers him. Last week, Gipson
rolled out a more concentrated and equity-heavy version of the
fund, UAM Clipper Focus, which invests in the same stocks but holds
no more than 5 percent in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Clipper uses a variety of models in putting a price tag on
companies, a process that helps set Gipson apart from other value
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a large segment of value investors who use a simple
mechanical approach to determining value,'' he said, citing
price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-book ratios and high dividend
yield as examples. He said an advocate of such a strategy could be
considered ``a first-generation value investor, who uses the same
valuation approach for each kind of company.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls his team of seven analyst-managers ``second-generation
value investors,'' because they try to value each company in the
way a private buyer would in bidding for the company, tailoring the
analysis to the nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   In valuing a media company, for example, relevant benchmarks may
be price to cash flow or price per subscriber, but not book value,
he said. ``On the other hand, book value does have a sizable
element of relevance if you're looking at a bank or an insurance
company or a security broker.''
</P>
<P>
   For giant companies like Coca-Cola or Philip Morris, it may be
more difficult to establish intrinsic value, so he relies heavily
on a model of discounted free cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   He takes his 10-year estimate of a company's free cash flow _
cash after capital and other expenditures _ and discounts it by the
return of a 30-year Treasury bond (now 5.14 percent) and then by a
``risk premium'' that varies with each company (say, 2 percent for
Coca-Cola, a company seen as having little risk, and 4 percent for
Philip Morris).
</P>
<P>
   Gipson then compares the company's intrinsic value with the
price of its stock. ``If we can buy the company at 70 percent or
less of its intrinsic value, then that company would become a good
candidate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make sure that you buy stocks with a margin of
safety,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Gipson looks for opportunities company by company, with no
preference for any economic sector or industry. Currently, he said,
``we are finding some reasonable opportunities in specialty
chemical companies.'' But he declined to identify the stocks
because he was still buying them.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the fund has been heavily weighted in the
financial area because of large positions in the Federal National
Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored
mortgage enterprises; each is about 9 percent of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two very good companies who share a market niche that
is highly profitable and well protected from competition,'' Gipson
said. Fannie Mae closed at $63.375 on Friday; he estimates its
intrinsic value at $82. Freddie Mac trades at $47.125; he puts its
intrinsic value at $60.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest position in Clipper, nearly 12 percent of assets, is
Philip Morris. ``We had a smaller position going into the spring of
this year, when the concern about both litigation and legislation
reached a crescendo,'' he said. He bought more Philip Morris, in
the $36-to-$39 range, in mid-May. ``That was an example of being a
contrarian value investor, buying on bad news,'' he said. The stock
has climbed to $46.25, even as the market has fallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime reason it's cheap is concern over litigation and
legislation'' on domestic tobacco, he said. ``But there's more to
Philip Morris than domestic tobacco. They have a very good food
business and a great international tobacco business.''
</P>
<P>
   Gipson estimates the company's intrinsic value at $70 a share,
but he is in no hurry to see it reach that point. ``We're quite
happy to sit and wait, with the 4 percent dividend yield,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is not afraid to venture abroad. In recent months,
Clipper added to a small position in De Beers Consolidated Mines,
the South African diamond giant.
</P>
<P>
   He recently paid between $12 and $15 for its American depository
receipts, which have fallen by nearly half from their April high on
concern about plummeting diamond sales in Asia. The ADRs trade at
$14.3125; Gipson puts the intrinsic value at $30.

 &HT;    AIDS advance: New drug is effective, taken once a day
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The newest AIDS drug approved Friday by the Food and
Drug Administration will set new standards of effectiveness and
convenience in HIV/AIDS treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Sustiva is the first once-a-day HIV medication. In combination
with other anti-HIV drugs, Sustiva, or efavirenz, excels at
reducing the amount of virus in a person's body to undetectable
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Because so few HIV drugs have been approved _ only 13, with
Sustiva _ and because people with AIDS often must switch drugs as
they develop resistance, AIDS patients and their doctors have
anxiously awaited this drug, as they do every addition to their
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Sustiva belongs to a class of drugs called non-nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors but seems more effective than the
other two drugs in that category. It has the bonus of being
relatively easy to take _ just three capsules, once a day, with no
food restrictions and few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   A drug regimen of Sustiva and Combivir, a twice-daily pill
combining the popular HIV drugs AZT and 3TC, would involve a total
of only five pills, in two doses.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to other AIDS therapies requiring dozens of pills
daily, some to be taken with every meal, others on an empty
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pills control what you do, how you live,'' said Nicholas
Teti, president of DuPont Pharmaceuticals, which developed Sustiva.
``Sustiva really reverses that. People can have their freedom
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The burden of cumbersome drug regimens is increasingly
problematic in HIV/AIDS treatment. Patients find it tough to adhere
to strict medication schedules, and just a few missed doses of
medication can allow HIV to mutate into a drug-resistant form.
</P>
<P>
   Sustiva answers this concern because the drug remains at
sufficiently high levels in the blood for 40 to 55 hours after
ingestion, said Dr. Laurent Fischer, DuPont's lead virologist.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials, drug regimens in combination with Sustiva
have been even more effective than combinations with Crixivan,
which belongs to an extremely potent class of anti-HIV drugs known
as protease inhibitors. Crixivan has been associated with
debilitating and bizarre side effects, such as the redistribution
of body fat to the midsection or back, that have forced many to
abandon the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Sustiva has been generally well tolerated. In some people it
causes dizziness and vivid dreams, but these effects usually
disappear after a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont will price Sustiva in the middle of the range of HIV
drugs; a year's worth will cost around $4,000. Because HIV drugs
usually are taken in combination, annual drug therapy averages
between $10,000 and $15,000.

 &HT;    New names catch on at FLW bass tourney
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOLINE, Ill. _ Denny Brauer showed that he was only human, but a
few of the other anglers still in contention in the Wal-Mart FLW
Tour World Bass Fishing Championships were sounding like men of
steel Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Brauer, from Camdenton, Mo., failed to qualify for today's final
round of the top five, ending his string of two straight wins on
the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society circuit and four victories since
the spring. Brauer caught only two fish weighing 4 pounds, 2
ounces, eighth among the 10 qualifying pros who fished the long
stretch of the Mississippi River border between Iowa and Illinois
Friday. All 10 competitors started from scratch, and no weights
will be carried over to today.
</P>
<P>
   Davy Hite of Prosperity, S.C., and Tommy Biffle of Wagoner,
Okla., sharing the same backwater area 50 miles to the north of
Moline, turned in two of the day's heaviest five-fish limits,
propelling both into the favorite's role to win the $250,000 top
prize. Hite caught a 11-12 limit, while Biffle had 11-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there's enough fish in there for both of us,''
Biffle said of the weed-filled shallow area he and Hite agreed to
divide. ``I'm predicting one of us is going to win it. . . . I
don't know what the other five are going to say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   George Cochran of Hot Springs, Ark., who was second to Brauer in
last month's BASS Masters Classic, had the biggest catch of the day
(11-15), using a quarter-ounce buzzbait early in the morning in
shallow water also well north of the launch area. ``Gentleman
George'' made his own polite prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine,'' he said of Biffle's comment. ``I'm confident in
my spot, too. If it's cloudy or rainy or sprinkling tomorrow
morning, I think I can win, too.'' A chance of rain was predicted
for today.
</P>
<P>
   Also advancing to today's final were Gary Klein of Weatherford,
Texas (9-12), and Jerry Williams of Conway, Ark. (9-1). Williams,
the lone angler to go south (he went almost 90 miles down river),
is the comeback story of the tournament. He was shut out the first
day, then took a 13-3 limit Thursday to qualify 10th for the third
round.
</P>
<P>
   In the non-boaters class, which finished up with the top 10
fishing Friday, Stone Mountain's Pat Fisher (two fish, 4-0)
finished second behind Todd Lee of Jasper, Ala. (five, 12-14), who
teamed with Biffle.

 &HT;    Bean worthy of our pity, not praise
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Perhaps if they had stayed the course with the
original nickname, we would have trembled at the approach of Vaughn
Bean. ``Vicious'' Vaughn Bean it was when he first broke into the
exciting, glamorous world of professional prizefighting.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it was forced. Didn't really go with such a gentle given
name, sort of like ``Rabid'' Richard Simmons or ``Malicious'' Mr.
Rogers. But at least it was an honest attempt at covering him in
menace.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, however, Vaughn ``Shake-N-Bake'' Bean climbs into the
ring against Evander Holyfield, his nom de fist suggesting a poor
substitute for real fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy bringing his lightweight reputation and his
9-to-1 underdog status to Holyfield's home streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get recognized when people see me walking around in my
turban,'' Bean said, referring to his bright red headwear, symbolic
of his Muslim faith. ``I was walking through Underground and a few
people were saying stuff like, `Holyfield's gonna kill you _ better
get out of town while you can.' I just shook their hands and went
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The setting) just doesn't matter. Everybody's entitled to
their opinion. I would fight Holyfield in any one of his
(mansion's) 32 rooms. I'm going for the gold at the end of the
rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bean seems a well-meaning sort. It's not his desire to enter the
Georgia Dome as a walking punchline. In preparation for this night,
he has had some pointed observations.
</P>
<P>
   On his regrets over a low-impact, majority-decision loss to
Michael Moorer, Bean's only opponent of merit: ``Laying around
after that fight, all I could think about was, `If I had only done
a little more, I'd be champion. If I'd only done a little more.'''
</P>
<P>
   On the way to beat Holyfield: ``It's not about finding a
weakness. I have to beat him at every level. Whatever he's good at,
I've got to be better. I've got to be the total package. I've got
to train harder than he does. I've got to believe in God even more
than he does. Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make (Holyfield) change his mind,'' Bean's
trainer, Butch Lewis, said. ``Make him think, `I'm a warrior, but
do I really want to be doing this? This is something I wasn't
expecting. I was looking for Butterbean.''' If they really believe
the solution to Holyfield lies with breaking his will, they have no
idea. They are trying to blow a bank safe with a firecracker.
</P>
<P>
   We should really attempt to take Mr. Bean seriously, because
anyone who risks the ring deserves a portion of respect. Yet, any
informal Bean poll yields the same consensus _ the man is laughably
overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Belief isn't easy to come by while scanning his 31-1 resume. I
keep re-reading the list of opponents, convinced there must be a
Harpo and a Zeppo in there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he inspire confidence at Thursday's weigh-in, coming in
at an all-time high 231, with all the muscle definition of an
eggplant. No string-Bean here, he lost the pose-down to Holyfield
in a bloody, first-round knockout.
</P>
<P>
   If tonight somehow became a battle of seconds, then look out.
There in the challenger's corner are Joe Frazier and Michael
Spinks, men of fine standing in the fistic community. But all they
can do tonight is look, not touch.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that nice, young Bean against the world, a prospect
that seems to cause more pity than concern.

 &HT;    Hurricane's French name has certain je ne sais quoi
 &HT;    By C.J. Clemmons
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- So what's with a hurricane named Georges?
</P>
<P>
   If we're up to the G's, why not plain old George or Gus or Gary?
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Weather Service, the name of the
latest tropical menace is George, only it's the French spelling and
pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   After all, hurricanes aren't just for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Flashes of international culture are reflected in the 1998 list
of tropical storms and hurricane names.
</P>
<P>
   Because hurricanes affect countries worldwide, weather watchers
can say adios to standard American names like Bob and Betsy, both
of which have been retired.
</P>
<P>
   National Weather Service spokesman Curtis Carey said forecasters
have been frustrated by the mispronunciation of the latest tropical
storm, the French-inspired Georges, which was christened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the European pronunciation is the way most people at the
weather service do it,'' said Carey, who works at the regional
weather service office in Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch name Hermine is next in line for the weather
disturbance currently brewing in the Gulf of Mexico. Coming later
in 1998 _ if the storms develop _ will be Ivan, Otto, Danielle and
Nicole in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern and Central Pacific storms will have names like Blas,
Isis, Orlene, Xavier and Zeke.
</P>
<P>
   A storm is given a name only when it reaches a wind speed of
about 40 mph and evolves from a tropical depression into a tropical
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane names are selected by members of the World
Meteorological Organization, Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   They are revised about every six years. If a storm was
especially destructive, its name is retired.
</P>
<P>
   In his Web site, Arizona meteorologist Ed Phillips says before
hurricanes were named, weather forecasters labeled storms with
numbers and letters.
</P>
<P>
   This eventually led to naming hurricanes after weather service
employees, and that evolved into the current alphabetical list .

 &HT;    Quayle to Clinton: Give it up, get out
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE , Ga. _ President Clinton no longer has the ``moral
authority'' to be president and should resign, former Vice
President Dan Quayle said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In what could easily become the theme in his probable bid for
the Oval Office in 2000, Quayle blasted Clinton for destroying the
credibility of the office.
</P>
<P>
   The former vice president, well known for his criticism of the
family values portrayed in television sitcoms, said Clinton's tryst
with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and the handling of the
scandal has ``stripped away any credibility, any moral authority
that he had to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle swung through Georgia raising money for Republican
gubernatorial candidate Guy Millner at a $1,000-per-couple private
fund-raiser in Gainesville and was to tout other Republican
candidates today. But after the prerequisite glowing words for his
partisans, the attention soon turned to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton ought to do what's best for our country, and that
is for him to step aside,'' Quayle said during an airport news
conference with Millner. ``He could end this today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Republican said ``it is likely'' he will seek the
presidency during the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is the second potential Republican presidental contender
to endorse Millner's 1998 bid to be Georgia's governor. And he
won't be the last. Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Sen. Fred
Thompson and publishing magnate Steve Forbes also are on tap in the
next six weeks to raise money for Millner and to build IOUs among
Georgia Republican leaders for their potential bids for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush raked in more than $500,000 for
Millner at a fund-raiser last month.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle praised Millner as a candidate who shares his values.
``He will be absolutely tireless working for the people of this
great state,'' the former vice president said. ``He's a man of
vision, of good character and good values.''

 &HT;    Elliott family patriarch dead at 74
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOVER, Del. _ George Elliott, patriarch of the Elliott racing
family, died Friday morning at his home in Dawsonville. Cause of
death were complications after the removal of a brain tumor in May.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 74, is survived by his wife, Joyce, and three children,
Ernie, Dan and Bill. George Elliott's first wife, Mildred, died in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Services for Elliott will be held Sunday at 2 p.m. at Bethel
United Methodist Church in Dawsonville, with burial at McKees's
Chapel United Methodist Cemetery in Dawsonville.
</P>

   Matt Kinseth, a regular on the Busch Grand National circuit will
replace Bill Elliott in the No. 94 McDonald's Ford Taurus for
Sunday's MBNA 400.
</P>
<P>
   Grubb on pole
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kevin Grubb won his first Busch Grand National pole
Friday qualifying with a BGN track-record speed of 153.498 mph for
today's MBNA 200. Winston Cup regular Bobby Labonte was
second-fastest, 153.055 mph. Atlanta's Buckshot Jones starts
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds to stay
</P>
<P>
   Larry McReynolds has decided to remain with Richard Childress
Racing after briefly considering running his own operation in 1999.
``All of our focus for the remainder of '98 and all of '99 will be
to put Mike Skinner and the Lowe's car in victory lane,''
McReynolds said. ``This decision was getting harder and harder, and
the deeper I got into this deal with the 31 team (Skinner), the
harder it was to think about not being part of this operation. I
want to see this team reach its full potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. for five
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. reportedly will run five Winston Cup events
in 1999, sponsored by Budweiser. Budweiser and Dale Earnhardt Inc.
are expected to announce Monday a multiyear deal to sponsor
Earnhardt Jr. on the 2000 Winston Cup circuit.

   DOVER, Del. _ If Mark Martin is to make a run on Jeff Gordon for
the Winston Cup championship, now could be the starting point. He
won his second pole of the year Friday, qualifying with a track
record speed of 155.966 mph for Sunday's MBNA 400 at Dover Downs.

that man Gordon is sixth, 0.089 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was perfect, I never had to change a thing,'' Martin
said of his lap. ``I felt like I got all that was there when I made
my lap, and that had to be good enough. It was lucky for us that it
wound up being on the pole. But, winning this race is really what
we're focused on.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Martin liked what he brought to the mile oval, Gordon was
hoping for more. The sun came out, changing the car and leaving him
with an ill-handling Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car has been driving great,'' Gordon said. ``We just
missed a little bit on what we should have done, based on the sun
coming out. This is the same car we ran at Darlington and I'm
pretty sure it's the same we ran here last time. If it's not, we'd
be crazy to bring something different, unless it gets better fuel
mileage.''
</P>
<P>
   What they may get come Sunday is a dose of Wallace, Cope, Lepage
and Labonte, sprinkled with some John Andretti, Jerry Nadeau and
Dick Trickle, as well as Dale Jarrett, who rounds out the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Each survived hair-raising seconds as the track changed with an
intensive sun beating down, creating loose race cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car made a great lap, but the sun came out about six cars
before me and we dropped in performance,'' Trickle said. ``The day
just got away from us a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It totally escaped some. Jeff Burton is 26th, a week after
winning at Richmond. Jeremy Mayfield is 27th, failing to qualify
for the third straight race. Dale Earnhardt is 41st and said,
``That stinks.'' And Dave Marcis, Wally Dallenbach, Rick Mast, Rick
Bickle and Hut Stricklin are 42nd, 43rd, 44th, 45th and 46th.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Buckshot Jones positioned himself nicely for a second
straight Dover start, qualifying 14th.

HOUSE PANEL TO RELEASE EVIDENCE   IN IMPEACHMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning of a new wave of shocking disclosures, the
Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee voted Friday to
unseal the videotape and mounds of sexually graphic evidence in
President's Clinton potential impeachment inquiry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, behind closed doors, followed a second day of furious
_ but fruitless _ protests from the Democratic minority and cleared
the way for images of Clinton's videotaped grand-jury testimony to
begin appearing on the airwaves at 9 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the committee is scheduled to release about
2,800 pages of material the independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr,
used to develop 11 possible impeachable allegations against
Clinton. The package includes often crude grand-jury testimony by
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, and reams of other
potentially offensive documents.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among other items, according to congressinal sources,
are transcripts of some FBI interviews of Lewinsky, and documents
supporting Starr's allegation that Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a
Washington power broker and Clinton confidant, helped Lewinsky find
her ``dream'' job in New York as part of an effort to cover up
Clinton's illicit affair with her.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring concerns about the committee's ability to conduct a
judicious review of Starr's charges, many members bolted angrily
from the meeting, with Republicans assailing Democrats for acting
like ``criminal defense lawyers'' for Clinton, and Democrats
accusing some GOP members of abusing the president's due-process
rights in their zeal to drive him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from both parties said they expect the committee to
recommend a full impeachment investigation of Clinton to the House
by early October. They are reviewing Starr's allegations that
Clinton committed perjury, witness tampering, obstruction of
justice, and abuse of his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the committee has done is simply turn itself into a
transmission belt for attacks on the president and nothing else,''
said Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat and
senior member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois Republican who is the
committee chairman, said, ``I don't think things are as dismal as
Barney portrayed them ... I would say the spirit of bipartisanship
is alive and flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagreed. ``This has the makings of a partisan
stampede,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman James Kennedy said: ``This appears
to be a rush to prejudgment and an effort to get out the most
salacious material at the speed of light, not at the proper pace of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who advocated the material's speedy
release, defended the move in a speech to a group of political
conservatives. ``We won't rush to judgment, and we won't refrain
from judgment'' of the president, Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri, was unimpressed by the committee's action. ``It is a
truly sad beginning to this investigation,'' he said. ``It is
increasingly clear that the Republicans have absolutely no
intention of conducting this investigation under the bipartisan
principles that the Watergate investigation followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes dispute unfolded just a week after the panel
released Starr's original, 445-page report, revulsing many readers
with details of Clinton's illicit affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans generally fearful of a backlash for unleashing
a new barrage of offensive material and Democrats wary of appearing
overly defensive of Clinton's misdeeds, the committee battled
mostly over how much of Lewinsky's provocative grand-jury testimony
to release.
</P>
<P>
   A transcript of Lewinsky's grand-jury appearance contains
voluminous details about her alleged sex acts and sexually explicit
telephone conversations with Clinton. ``If people thought they got
the details in the Starr report, they haven't seen anything yet,''
said Representative Stephen E. Buyer, an Indiana Republican who
serves on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   After days of negotiations, the committee's majority and
minority staffs agreed to propose a list of about 120 sections of
the Lewinsky transcript and other documents to redact, or black
out. Committee aides said they chose material that could
unnecessarily infringe on the privacy of individuals, that was
considered critical to national security, or that was deemed
offensive and irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposal touched off a torrent of procedural moves,
including several motions by Democrats to censor more than an
additional 20 references on similar grounds. Each motion was
defeated along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a general view among the Democrats not to reveal
anything, and there was a general view among Republicans to reveal
as much as possible,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's highest-ranking Democrat, Representative John
Conyers Jr. of Michigan, accused committee Republicans of
distributing the material to humiliate Clinton for political gain.
``It is sexually explicit, it is offensive, it is obscene,''
Conyers said. ``And I think it is a politicalization'' of the
process.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the committee voted to make public five sections of
material that both staffs had proposed keeping confidential.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the panel voted, 20-15, to approve a motion to
disclose three graphic passages involving Lewinsky's testimony
about sexual activity with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, by Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who
was among the first House members to call for Clinton's
impeachment, ignited a pitched confrontation. Only one Republican
joined every Democrat in voting against releasing the passages:
Representative W. Asa Hutchinson, a former US attorney for
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is bipartisanship,'' Frank said after the meeting,
``then the Taliban wins a medal for religious tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said he opposed Barr's motion because he ``did not
want to put anything more out, more graphic in detail, than what
was already in the public record.''
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the panel voted, 20-15, to approve a motion to
disclose three graphic passages involving Lewinsky's testimony
about sexual activity with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, by Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who

</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said he opposed Barr's motion because he ``did not
want to put anything more out, more graphic in detail, than what
was already in the public record.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, a source said, Buyer proposed disclosing two
sections about sexually explicit telephone conversations between
Clinton and Lewinsky. The motion passed, 22-14, with support from
all the Republicans and one Democrat: Representative William D.
Delahunt of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Delahunt, who has strived to bridge the
committee's partisan gulf, said of the committee's action: ``This
is not about defending the president. This is not about
partisanship. This is about the integrity of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Delahunt also said: ``This is not a process that can be
considered fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In another episode, Representative Bob Inglis, a South Carolina
Republican running for the Senate, sought to publish explanations
of two other redacted sections involving alleged sexual relations
between Clinton and Lewinsky. Inglis asked that the reason for the
redactions to state: ``description of oral-anal sexual contract
between the president and Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   But, in a rare victory for the Democrats, the motion was
defeated, 29-5. Inglis was joined in supporting the measure only by
Republicans: Representatives Ed Bryant of Tennessee, Lindsey O.
Graham of South Carolina, Edward A. Pease of Indiana, James E.
Rogan of California, and Barr.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's GOP majority defeated numerous Democratic
motions aimed at delaying the material's release. One measure would
have required the committee to decide what constitutes an
impeachable offense before it released additional material. Another
would have permitted Clinton to review the documents first.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the committee's final actions, the panel agreed 28-7
to make public the votes it took. Five Republicans who initially
opposed publicizing the votes switched their votes after it
appeared likely to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican leaders came under fire for scheduling the
material's release on Monday, Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year.
``It is a time for celebration and reflection, not for dealing with
the videotaped testimony and the inevitable controversy it will
bring,'' said Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   She urged House leaders to postpone the release until after the
religious holiday.

CLINTON LIKELY TO DELAY TRIP TO PAKISTAN AND INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will probably postpone traveling
to India and Pakistan because both countries tested nuclear devices
in May and have shown little inclination to defuse their arms race,
officials with knowledge of plans for the trip said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A presidential trip to South Asia remains on hold,'' a White
House aide said in response to speculation that the trip, which had
been planned for mid-November, is virtually certain to be put off.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, responding to questions on
condition that he not be identified, said he, too, understood the
visits had been indefinitely postponed.
</P>
<P>
   In May, India exploded five nuclear devices, and the United
States imposed sanctions against the country, warning Pakistan not
to respond with tests of its own. But at the end of that month the
Pakistanis conducted nuclear tests, and the United States imposed
sanctions on Pakistan, too.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have been antagonists since 1947 when they
became separate, independent nations carved out of British colonial
India.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had hoped to go to India, Pakistan and possibly
Bangladesh in November. Promoting trade would have been high on the
agenda, as well as encouraging an end to nuclear arms competition.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is not expected to announce a final decision
until after the president meets with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of
Pakistan next week at the United Nations, but there is a growing
consensus among Clinton's advisers that not enough can be
accomplished then to make the trip to South Asia worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; the national security
adviser, Sandy Berger; and Secretary of Defense William Cohen are
among those who are believed to have told the president that such a
trip would be unwise.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, in a wide-ranging interview on his foreign
policy plans, Clinton said he hoped to visit India and Pakistan in
1998 ``if all goes well.''
</P>
<P>
   The most severe economic sanctions imposed against both nations
after the tests were soon lifted. U.S. diplomats met with Indian
and Pakistani leaders to discuss the arms race, but made little
tangible progress.

MEXICAN RANCHER TORTURED BEFORE OTHERS WERE SLAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSENADA, Mexico _ The 38-year-old rancher who was the target of
an apparent drug-related killing here on Thursday was tortured in
his own living room before gunmen put him against a wall and shot
him along with 18 relatives and neighbors, the authorities said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal attorney in Baja California state, Gen. Jose Luis
Chavez Garcia, said in a news conference Friday that the cattle
rancher, Fermin Castro, headed a small criminal organization that
specialized in guiding drug planes into desert airstrips and
unloading their cargo onto trucks for shipment across the border
into California.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said men carrying assault rifles and dressed in black,
the color of federal police uniforms, carried out the shootings,
but he said investigators had no idea who they were or what their
motive was.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of men, women and children from three families in
this Pacific coast settlement 60 miles south of the U.S. border
before dawn on Thursday was the worst incident in the history of
drug-related violence in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Castro survived a gunshot wound in the head and is in a coma in
an Ensenada hospital, said Marco Antonio de la Fuente, the Baja
California attorney general, who appeared with Chavez at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said a 12-year-old boy and a pregnant
15-year-old who survived the attack have been put under army
protection out of state.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are questioning 10 people in Tecate, a city on the
California border, about Castro's activities and the attack on his
organization. The police seized several rifles and small arms in a
building they searched there.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons are of the same calibers as 80 shells retrieved at
the murder site, and the weapons are being tested for evidence they
may have been used in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez and de la Fuente sought to portray the statements they
had taken in Tecate and the weapons they had confiscated as
important advances, but it was unclear how quickly or methodically
the investigation was advancing. Both men denied reports, repeated
at the news conference by local journalists, about squabbling among
federal and state investigators, who are working together on the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ensenada, a salty town on the rugged Pacific coast where tuna
boats harbor, attracts hundreds of thousands of American tourists
each year, and the Baja state governor, Hector Teran Teran, said he
feared the violence could harm the area's image.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the state and federal investigators appear to be
feeling pressure to produce quick results.

LABOR LEADER EXPELLED FOR PLUNDERING UNION'S COFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The long-time president of the local representing
22,000 school cafeteria aides and crossing guards in New York City
has been expelled from the union after an internal judicial panel
concluded that he illegally received $1.75 million from the union,
including $685,000 in fraudulent overtime expenses and $329,000 to
pay his family's credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also found said that the official Charles Hughes, had
the union pay a total of $106,000 to 13 people in Georgia who did
not work for the union. Hughes has a luxurious second home in
Georgia, and union officials said many of these payments went to
his personal friends there.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, appointed by the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, found that over the past two years Hughes
engaged in a vigorous effort to plunder his union's coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The parent union has long refused to release the ruling, which
was issued on June 26. But a union official upset about extensive
corruption at District Council 37, the umbrella group representing
120,000 New York City workers, including Hughes' members, made the
decision available to a reporter this week.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schmukler, a lawyer for Hughes, criticized the panel's
work, saying the investigation was one-sided. ``All they did was
have some accountant introduce documents that I have no reason to
believe my client was personally acquainted with,'' Schmukler
added. ``The findings are not based on cross-examination.''
</P>
<P>
   But the panel noted that Hughes and his lawyer were present
throughout the hearing and that no evidence was offered to refute
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts said the panel's findings documented what
appeared to be one of the worst cases of union embezzlement in
years. It involves a man who was long one of New York's most
visible and powerful union leaders _ someone whom many politicians
courted because of his local's campaign contributions and its phone
banks, which could make thousands of calls an hour on behalf of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hughes was one of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's closest
labor allies. He appeared in a campaign commercial for Giuliani, he
sponsored a fund-raiser for the mayor at his home, and the two
leaders often hug each other when they meet.
</P>
<P>
   District Council 37 officials said Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau, was investigating Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that Hughes' local was $8 million in debt, the
international union put his local into trusteeship last February,
effectively ousting him. Hughes, who ran the local for nearly three
decades, resigned from the union in June, hoping to forestall the
expulsion ruling on the ground that the union no longer had
jurisdiction over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hughes had decided that he had enough and he retired,''
Schmukler said. ``It was before this decision. There really was no
point.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the judicial panel harshly criticized Hughes for
claiming 1,820 hours of overtime _ an average of 35 hours a week _
in 1997 alone. Thus, he was owed more than $300,000 for overtime,
for which he was paid time-and-a-half. His base salary was
$224,000, while most of his local's members earned less than
$15,000 a year from their school jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes also claimed that he had worked 1,820 hours of overtime
in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 and deserved hundreds of thousands of
dollars for those years as well. All told, Hughes received $685,000
for the overtime requests at a time his local and District Council
37, which includes 56 union locals, were facing a deep deficit and
were seeking a 30 percent dues increase from members.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the overtime payments an ``improper and illegal use of
union funds,'' the panel wrote that it ``finds it inherently
impossible that Charlie Hughes, or anyone else for that matter,
worked 35 hours of overtime every week of the year for five years
(or 260 consecutive weeks).''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the panel, $310,000 of the $329,000 in credit card
payments made by the union went to pay for Hughes' American Express
Gold Card account. ``Most of the charges incurred on the Gold Card
were incurred by his wife, daughter and son,'' the panel wrote.
``The overwhelming majority of the purchases charged to these
accounts were for obviously personal items, such as clothing and
jewelry, with repeated purchases at such retail stores as
Victoria's Secret, Nordstrom, Macy's and Saks Fifth Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel said that Charles Jurgonis, the auditing director for
the international union, found that Hughes received $196,086.24 in
additional cash and checks from the union, although Jurgonis could
find no documentation justifying the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Panel officials also said Hughes wrongly received $512,000 in
retroactive allowances for executive board meetings he attended
from 1991 to 1997. Hughes had requested $979,047.97 for such
allowances, plus interest, saying that in 1971 his local offered
him a $1,000 monthly stipend that he never took.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not find the request for these payments credible,
asserting that it was unlikely the local's executive board would
have voted Hughes a $1,000 monthly stipend for attending meetings
back in 1971 when his salary was $245 a week.
</P>
<P>
   The panel found that the executive board of Hughes' local had
not approved the overtime payments or many other payments, but it
noted that Robert Myers, treasurer of District Council 37, which
handled much of the local's finances, paid Hughes nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Many union members have faulted Myers and Stanley Hill, the
district council's executive director, for neither stopping nor
sufficiently questioning the payments to Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is outrageous,'' Tom Dawes, a leader of Committee for
Real Change in DC 37, a group seeking financial reforms in the
union. ``It shows the union has no way of holding local presidents
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill said, ``We cannot comment on this case. It's in the
district attorney's hands.''

<P>
   So much for the dignity attendant to the solemn process of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   This will surely be remembered as a week when the last shred of
civility in Washington's political culture was torn away, and the
day when Republicans found ``bipartisanship'' in party-line votes
and Democrats called them the intolerant equivalent fo
Afghanistan's Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any bipartisan agreement left about Washington, it
was in disgust for this atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Texas, George W. Bush, told the Austin
American-Statesman that the scandal is depressing him and has left
him wondering whether he wants to seek the presidency after all.
``The process in Washington is a sullied process,'' Bush said in an
interview with the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, a veteran who
served in the House during the Watergate impeachment proceedings,
called the atmosphere in Washington ``sick,'' and said that he,
too, was deeply depressed and distressed. ``You have politicians
using the Ten Commandments as spears to skewer each other,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The overriding issue was the insistence by House Republicans on
prompt publication of President Clinton's testimony to Kenneth
Starr's grand jury _ a torrent of still more salacious and
embarrassing material which they calculate will damage him further
_ even if it risks a backlash against them.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had barely begun to absorb the shock of Starr's lurid
report before new wrangling over releasing the videotape of the
president's testimony inflamed already raw feelings in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Wednesday, another body blow came with the publication
of an article about Rep. Henry J. Hyde's extramarital affair 30
years ago. The article was published in Salon, an online magazine,
which conceded, in a statement explaining why it published a story
that several other publications declined to pursue, that it was
``fighting fire with fire, descending to the gutter tactics of
those we deplore.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Republicans were trying to exploit the sympathy
generated for Hyde, R-Ill., by accusing the White House, with no
evidence at all, of stimulating the story, something several White
House officials, as well as the magazine, strenuously denied.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's tableau, after the House Judiciary Committee met,
showed that partisan acrimony has firmly taken hold. After two days
of rancorous debate over the videotape and 2,800 more pages of
damaging evidence, Republicans prevailed in forcing the release of
the materials.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the microphones outside the committee room to decry the
move, which came in a party-line vote, Rep. Barney Frank of
Massachusetts drew a metaphor that revealed the intensity of the
ill will that pervaded the deliberations. ``If this is
bipartisanship,'' the feisty Democratic liberal said, ``then the
Taliban wins a medal for religious tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Hyde, the panel's chairman, attempted to explain the
rationale for the committee's decision, saying he didn't think the
divisions between Republicans and Democrats were so bitter, Frank
stepped back up to the microphone, interrupted Hyde, and lambasted
the Republicans all over again for trying to embarrass the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emerging bipartisan agreement on the gutter level of
political discourse in Washington these days, it still seems to get
worse with each passing day. But there is a simple explanation, and
one that suggests the end may be in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The November congressional elections are looming and the
shrillest voices in both parties are trying to motivate their voter
base, no matter that the name-calling and salacious subject matter
turns off many other voters in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are Republicans, including Senate Judiciary
Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah, who have expressed deep concern over
the effect the sordid Lewinsky imbroglio is having on public life,
others see partisan advantage to pushing the scandal to the limit
and further damaging Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that the public wants Washington to
put the scandal behind it, and even Republican voters expressed
reluctance about releasing the tape of the president's grand jury
testimony, though conservative Republicans favored the release. But
in an off-year election when a low turnout is expected,
congressional Republicans are dependent on these conservative
voters and are thus following their instincts about how hard to
push president Clinton to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that House Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, who earlier this month said he would leave the impeachment
process to the judicious Hyde, reversed course this week and
strongly urged his Republican colleagues, in a closed-door meeting,
to vote to release a second wave of more damaging evidence compiled
by Starr. Indeed, Republicans had hoped to resolve the issue
earlier in the week, in time for the Sunday public affairs
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats like Frank are also looking to November, hoping that
the hard-line Republican rhetoric and Starr's tough tactics will
create a backlash. When Rep. Maxine Waters of California, another
liberal Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee, complained to
news media that the president was being ``railroaded,'' she was
attempting to galvanize an African-American constituency whose
turnout is central to Democratic hopes of escaping an electoral
rout in November and whose support could be one of Clinton's last
lines of defense.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Even within the wings of the two parties, there have been some
jarring contradictions. Rep. Christopher Cox, a California
conservative, took to the airwaves this week to urge the public
release of Starr's case, despite the salaciousness of the
materials. Three years ago, Cox was one of the champions of
Republican legislation to ban indecent material from the Internet.
In a speech on the House floor, he expressed worries about having
his two children find ``offensive material.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington's elders, who have a stake in preserving a culture
where politicians spar by day and dine together by night, expressed
worries that in a media age, such niceties were all but impossible
to preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawyer Leonard Garment, who lived through Watergate
inside the Nixon White House, said the current debate seems more
bitter and hyperbolic because of the ``immense competitive
pressures of this media age. Explanations cannot be given,
distinctions cannot be drawn. We're in the middle of this huge,
emotionally agitating culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mankiewicz, a veteran of the Robert Kennedy and George
McGovern presidential campaigns, said in an interview: ``I've never
known it to be so bilious or so rancorous. It's as if all the oil
had drained out of the machinery and metal is rubbing on metal
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Another veteran of the Watergate era, former Senate Majority
Leader Robert Dole, who was a Republican of Kansas, expressed hope
that Washington would find its moorings once again. He was
scheduled to meet privately Friday with Clinton, who defeated Dole
for the presidency in 1996, to discuss turmoil in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through one of these,'' Dole said in an interview.
``It gets testy and nasty and partisan. And then, hopefully, the
Congress will come together in some bipartisan way.''

<P>
   CHICAGO _ It sounds like a typical child welfare dispute: The
foster parents who have reared a 2{-year-old boy almost since birth
want to adopt him. The boy's mother, who lost him because of
addiction but has since stopped using drugs, wants him back.
</P>
<P>
   But when the foster parents are a powerful city alderman and a
prominent judge, accusations of political favoritism are bound to
bubble up. And because the couple are white and the child is black,
the case has also brought a small petition drive and a protest
vigil led by a black minister outside the alderman's office.
</P>
<P>
   The state's effort to terminate the birth mother's parental
rights, which goes to court next month, has already seen its share
of legal skirmishing. With the mother's lawyers arguing that she
could not get a fair hearing in Cook County because both foster
parents held positions of influence here, the state Supreme Court
responded by assigning the case to a judge from another county.
</P>
<P>
   State officials deny any political favoritism and say they are
acting in the best interests of the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``The handling of this case is consistent with the direction
that child welfare systems across the nation are moving in,'' said
Maudlyne Iherjirika, a spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of
Children and Family Services. ``Children cannot be allowed to
linger in foster care while parents are given chance after chance
after chance to get their acts together.''
</P>
<P>
   The story begins in February 1996, when Alderman Edward Burke,
who has been on the City Council for nearly 30 years and is
chairman of its Finance Committee, and his wife, Anne, an Illinois
appellate judge, took in an 8-day-old foster child, whom officials
call Baby T.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's mother, Tina Olison, 36, had a long pattern of
cocaine, marijuana and PCP use, and her son was born with drugs in
his system. Two other sons had previously been removed from her
care, the first in 1989 after she had disciplined him by putting
two five-pound sacks of sugar on his arms and so pinning him on his
back, the second in 1994 because of her drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those children were placed in foster care with Ms.
Olison's mother, Cecile, who decided not to take Baby T, thinking
that if Ms. Olison was separated from him, she would have incentive
to stop using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic apparently worked. Ms. Olison spent 18 months in drug
rehabilitation programs, and state drug tests, administered to
monitor her progress toward becoming a fit mother, have turned up
no trace of drugs since. She also went to school, became a
certified nursing assistant and now works for an agency that cares
for elderly patients.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olison, who is single, and her lawyer, Anita
Rivkin-Carothers, say her turnaround entitles her to get her son
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I overcame my drug addiction,'' Ms. Olison said in an
interview. ``I have my own apartment. I don't depend on any state
income. I'm a member of a church. I'm reliable and responsible now,
and I'm ready to be a mother to my child.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially the Department of Children and Family Services
intended to reunite Baby T with his mother. But in August 1997, the
agency changed its mind and recommended that the boy be placed for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say their decision was based on an evaluation of
Ms. Olison by an outside agency, which concluded that ``serious
deficits remain in terms of her ability to safely and adequately
carry the primary responsibilities of parenting.'' The agency said
Ms. Olison had reacted angrily to the evaluators, and Donald
Jonker, a lawyer for the child services department, said the
``report has concluded that the mother's volatile and potentially
dangerous anger would be directed at her children.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olison said she had accused the evaluators of ``being
racist,'' of ``being a part of the conspiracy to keep me away from
my child'' and of ``being bribed by the Burkes.'' She spoke that
way to the evaluators, she said, because she believed that they had
already made up their minds and she was upset at the prospect of
losing her child.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Olison and her supporters say they believe the real reason
for the department's change of heart is that about a month before
the evaluation, the Burkes began expressing interest in adopting
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Burke, reached at home, said that neither she nor her
husband could discuss the case because it was in litigation and
involved issues of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters here,'' she said, ``is a little boy's life.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the Burkes, both 54, have been dutiful, loving
foster parents, caring for Baby T in the Tudor house on a leafy
street on the Southwest Side of Chicago where they reared four of
their own children, now grown, and briefly cared for another foster
child.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when Illinois and other states are trying hard to
find permanent homes for foster children, the Burkes, a wealthy,
well-educated couple willing to take a child born with medical
problems, seem to some like a rare find.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Olison says her boy has been well cared for, although
she says that Judge Burke does ``certain things that I wouldn't
do'' and that the judge is unsure of certain ``cultural things,''
like how to care for his hair.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Ms. Olison says, she is being denied a chance to
rear her son, because, she maintains, the state has been unfairly
swayed by the Burkes' credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her job on the bench, which entails ruling on
appeals filed in Cook County, Judge Burke was appointed Gov. Jim
Edgar's special counsel on child welfare in 1994, working for a
year for the Department of Children and Family Services.

NEW COUGAR IS MORE WILDCAT THAN TAMER OLD MODELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget everything you ever knew about the Mercury Cougar, that
overpriced, bulky, stodgy, rear-drive midsize coupe that Mercury
dropped last year because of slow sales and general buyer apathy.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, picture this: a youthful-looking, compact,
front-drive hatchback coupe with cutting-edge design, an available
V-6 engine and a price that youthful buyers of all ages can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome the 1999 Cougar, an all-new three-door that will appeal
to just the consumers that Mercury desperately needs in its
showrooms: Generation X-ers who want to make a statement in
automotive fashion without having to take out a 30-year loan.
</P>
<P>
   Mark my words: This car is going to be a success if enough young
people hear about it and aren't afraid to show their faces in a
Lincoln-Mercury showroom, where the average buyer's hair has long
since turned to silver.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. proves with this car that it is serious about
changing Mercury's image. Of course, this isn't the first time Ford
has tried. Some notable recent failures at bringing in youthful
buyers include the Capri, a two-door convertible made in Australia,
and the Merkur, a European coupe that just never caught on. Part of
the problem for both cars was dubious quality and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Cougar is built by Ford; it's not an import,
although it was designed and engineered by a multicultural team at
Ford's Small and Medium Vehicle Center in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath, it's basically a Ford Contour/Mercury Mystique, the
sedan clones that were designed in Europe. Neither has been a great
success, however, since they are close in price but somewhat
smaller than the better-selling midsize Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable
sedans.
</P>
<P>
   With all the unused production capacity at the Contour/Mystique
factories, Ford had lots of room available to build the Cougar.
</P>
<P>
   And I'll guarantee that if you're in the market for a compact
coupe, you'll find the Cougar at least worth a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar comes with a choice of the 2.0-liter, Zetec
four-cylinder engine of the Contour/Mystique, which cranks out 125
horsepower and 130 foot-pounds of torque; or the
sportier-performing 2.5-liter, Duratec 24-valve V-6, rated at an
impressive 170 horsepower and 165 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   We tested the V-6 model, whose base price is $16,695 plus $400
transportation. Although a five-speed manual gearbox is standard,
ours came with the four-speed automatic transmission, an $815
option. For sportiest performance, forget the automatic and go with
the manual.
</P>
<P>
   Because the V-6 engine doesn't develop full torque until it
reaches 4,250 rpm, and full horsepower until it hits 6,250 rpm,
this car doesn't sprint from the stoplight like cars with more
low-rpm grunt. In fact, it's a bit slow on the uptake.
</P>
<P>
   But it does shine once it gets near highway speeds, and it's
ready to pass and merge on the freeway with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Handling has a heavy feel like that of a sports car, with
accurate and precise steering. The car corners remarkably well,
thanks to a MacPherson strut front end and a Quadralink rear
suspension engineered to minimize rear skids.
</P>
<P>
   Braking on our test car was sure and straight, thanks to the
optional antilock braking system ($500). And the optional traction
control ($235) helped keep the vehicle going smoothly on slippery
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   I found the front bucket seats very comfortable, but the two
rear bucket seats are best left to kids _ like most rear seats in
compact coupes. Instruments are large, simple dials that are easy
to read and understand; there's none of that digital silliness that
auto makers have recently become fond of.
</P>
<P>
   The manual air-conditioning is cold enough and the fan strong
enough to keep a polar bear comfy, and the dashboard vents are
super-easy to move to direct the cold air where you want it. This
is one of the best air-conditioning systems on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The cargo area, accessed by raising the hatchback, is large for
this class _ 12.4 cubic feet. It can be extended by folding down
half or all of the rear seat back.
</P>
<P>
   I had only a couple of complaints: The rearview mirror is too
low on the windshield; it restricts the driver's view. Likewise,
the B-pillars, at the rear of the two doors, are too wide; they
restrict the view when looking to the side.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with dual front air bags, a standard feature,
as well as side air bags for the front occupants, a $375 option.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features include side-impact door beams, antitheft
system, side turn signals, power windows and door locks, tilt
steering wheel, rear defroster, variable intermittent wipers,
rack-and-pinion power steering, front disc/rear drum brakes,
16-inch aluminum wheels, projector-beam headlights, dual
power/heated outside mirrors, premium AM/FM/cassette stereo,
driver's seat power height adjustment, solar-tinted glass and a
micron air-filtration system.
</P>
<P>
   Extras on our test car were many, including the V-6 sport group
($775), which added fog lamps, leather-wrapped shift knob and
steering wheel, rear-deck spoiler, and illuminated mirrors; V-6
convenience group ($720), that brought cruise control, rear
wiper/washer, remote key-less entry, and automatic interior
illumination when doors are unlocked; power tilt/slide sun roof
($615); power driver's seat ($235); and unspecified ``other
optional equipment'' ($945).
</P>
<P>
   Total price for our test vehicle was $22,310, including
transportation. But bear in mind that you could leave most of the
options off and still have a well-equipped V-6 Cougar for well
under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy estimates are 20 miles per gallon in the city
and 29 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 15.6 gallons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   NEW MUSTANG UNVEILED: Ford has rolled out the updated pony car
for 1999. There is new styling and more power but the car still
looks very much like a Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly 2 inches longer and 1.3 inches wider, but retains
the 101.3-inch wheelbase of the '98 model and the 53.1-inch height.
</P>
<P>
   Exterior styling is a bit more crisp, with more angles than the
previous model. Ford says the angles take the car closer to its
roots in the '60s while encompassing the company's so-called New
Edge styling that will be appearing on a variety of Ford vehicles
(including the new Cougar).
</P>
<P>
   The 3.8-liter V-6 engine has 190 horsepower, up 40 from this
year's, and the 4.6-liter GT V-8 engine sports 265 horsepower, an
increase of 35 from 1998 (and closer to competitor Camaro's 305
hp).
</P>
<P>
   Production is scheduled to begin Nov. 2 and the cars will go on
sale in mid-to-late December, Ford officials said. No prices have
been announced, but there will be coupe and convertible models.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said about two-thirds of buyers are expected to choose the
V-6 engine; and 48 percent of the buyers are expected to be women,
most of whom will opt for the smaller engine.

 CHICAGO: Family Services.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her husband, a lawyer and former police officer, has been a
Democratic alderman in the 14th Ward since 1969, occupying a seat
once held by his father. He is a savvy political insider who sits
on the Cook County Democratic committee that selects judicial
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. Olison's supporters say they would consider Burke's
adoption of the child particularly upsetting because he represents
a ward with few African-Americans and was known as a vigorous
opponent of Chicago's first black mayor, Harold Washington. (Burke
has always said that his opposition to Mayor Washington was
motivated not by race but by politics.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Their family has a pattern of not being sensitive to the
African-American community,'' said the Rev. Albert Sampson, a South
Side minister who fasted for 40 days this summer and led a small
protest outside the alderman's office, pushing an empty baby
carriage. Sampson accused the Burkes of trying to ``steal the
child, his legacy and identity, and allow the child to live in one
of the most segregated wards in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough Irish Catholic children for Burke to adopt
his own,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream black political leaders here have not jumped into the
fray. And under state and federal law, race cannot be a factor in
the placement of a foster child.
</P>
<P>
   Cook County Public Guardian Patrick Murphy, who represents the
interests of Baby T, said that although the Burkes might never have
asked for special treatment, he believed that their prominence had
led the state to bend in their favor. The outspoken Murphy has
tangled with state officials before but initially recommended that
Baby T be adopted. Then one of his office's own psychiatric
evaluators concluded that Ms. Olison was a fit mother, and Murphy
has said he now plans to change his stance and support her.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who is white, said he believed that Ms. Olison's backers
were making a mistake in raising racial issues. But he also said:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the mom has done everything the agency asked
of her. It's also clear that DCFS has treated this mother
differently from other mothers and that it's clearly for political
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Children and Family Services has tried
unsuccessfully to have Murphy removed from the case, saying he has
undermined his credibility by flip-flopping.
</P>
<P>
   As for his charge of politics, Ms. Iherjirika, the department's
spokeswoman, said they had played no role.

 &HT;    Rains bring relief, but drought's effects remain
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The lawn in front of the Experimental Science
Building at the University of Texas is once again green. Ervin
Lemuel put his gasoline-powered trimmer to work on it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All summer we were just cuttin' dirt,'' said Lemuel, a
groundskeeper for the university. ``Now it's growing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs are everywhere: Weeks of on-and-off rains have eased
the drought in Central Texas. Aquifers are rising, creeks are
flowing, and long-dormant lawns are growing. Some officials say the
drought is over in this region, but others caution that it is too
early to make that statement.
</P>
<P>
   There is no debate, however, that severe water shortages remain
in portions of the state, especially in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley, the High Plains and far West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Recent rains spawned by Tropical Storm Frances have brought
considerable relief to Central Texas, East Texas and the Gulf
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is a case in point. Precipitation this month stood at
6.57 inches Friday morning, compared with 1.75 inches at that point
in a normal September, according to the National Weather Service.
Austin has received 20.81 inches of rain this year, compared with
22.65 inches so far in a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   The city's voluntary conservation program, which calls for lawn
watering every five days based on a household's address, runs
through the end of the month. But the urgency has passed as a
result of the rains and a decline in usage to about 110 million
gallons a day this week, said Tony Gregg, the city's
water-conservation chief. Officials get concerned when daily usage
approaches 200 million gallons _ not because of a shortage in the
Colorado River but because of limitations in the system of pumps
and pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For now, we're in good shape,'' Gregg said. ``We're not
concerned at this point about what day people water on.'' At the
suggestion of city officials, the American-Statesman on Friday
discontinued its watering reminders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the drought is certainly over in Central and South
Central Texas even though we remain a couple of inches below normal
precipitation for the year,'' said John Patton, a hydrologist with
the weather service. Day after day of scattered storms across the
region, with localized accumulations of a half-inch to 6 inches,
``is exactly what the doctor ordered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Texas Water Development Board, the state's
water-planning agency, gave a more cautious assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say that here in Central Texas we have
returned to near-normal conditions,'' said Bill Hoffman, assistant
director of water resources planning for the board. ``If we
continue with normal rainfall in the future, we basically will have
come through the drought. However, we're still at a point where, if
we were not to get normal rainfall, we may slip back to drought
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Barton Springs-Edwards Aquifer Conservation District, which
oversees groundwater supplies for about 45,000 people south and
west of Austin, also stopped short of declaring an end to the
drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in a drought-stage alert, but things are probably
changing with the rains we've had,'' said Nico Hauwert, senior
hydrogeologist for the district. ``On Monday we'll have more
information on how much aquifer levels came up when we check five
monitoring wells.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, which relies on the southern segment of the Edwards
Aquifer, is poised to lift its drought alert. The water level in
the main monitoring well stood at 664.3 feet above sea level
Friday, nicely above the 655-foot drought trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got some really good rains, and the aquifer levels have
continued to rise,'' said John Boggess, a spokesman for the San
Antonio Water System. ``Plus, things have cooled off
significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   A problem of definition It's not surprising that experts differ
on whether the drought is over. There is no standard method of
making such a determination. Nor, for that matter, is there a
single, all-purpose way to measure a drought.
</P>
<P>
   The term has scores of definitions, according to the National
Drought Mitigation Center, part of the University of Nebraska at
Lincoln. In simple terms, a drought is a prolonged shortage of
rain. But drought can be measured not only by precipitation but
also by stream flow, spring flow, aquifer levels, farm-pond levels,
temperature, soil moisture, reservoir levels and a combination of
these and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of drought, the Palmer index, shows near-normal
conditions in much of Central and South Texas and a mild drought in
the Valley. The former is true, but the latter is misleading
because, while rain has fallen in the Valley, the upstream
reservoirs are still low, said the development board's Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Combined U.S. and Mexico water storage in Falcon and Amistad
reservoirs on the Rio Grande is about 29 percent of capacity. That
is up from the 17.5 percent before the August and September rains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is still in a major hydrological drought,'' Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   For farmers throughout the state, the rains have come too late
to save this year's crops, said Kathleen Phillips, spokeswoman for
Texas A&AMP;M University's agricultural program.
</P>
<P>
   Crop, livestock and other agricultural losses total $2.1 billion
and will cost the state's economy as a whole $5.8 billion, said
Roland Smith, a Texas Agricultural Extension Service economist.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the Texas Forest Service estimates an additional
loss of $342 million in East Texas timber production from dead pine
seedlings and trees that grew at half their normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   When the losses to processors, haulers, distributors and related
businesses are considered, this works out to a $1.1 billion loss
for the state's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects have brightened for farmers intending to plant wheat
or hay in coming weeks and months. Leonard Germer, who farms 1,500
acres north of Maxwell in Caldwell County, lost his corn, sorghum
and cotton crops this summer. He's hoping to plant winter wheat in
mid-October. But now he's concerned that his fields might be too
soggy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put machines in the fields if it's too wet,'' he
said. ``They just choke up and won't work in the mud. If we get
delayed we might have to switch to spring wheat, which we would
plant anytime from December 15th to the first of February.''

PHONY INSPECTOR COLLECTS RESTAURANTS' `FINES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All-points bulletin to restaurateurs: Beware the
portly, middle-aged fellow in the greenish suit who flashes a
silver badge and photo, identifies himself as an inspector from the
City Health Department and asks to be paid _ on the spot _ for
kitchen violations.
</P>
<P>
   The man is armed: with an official-looking briefcase. And if he
isn't so dangerous, he certainly is persistent: So far he has pried
as much as $15,000 from some 60 restaurants in four boroughs (he
hasn't hit Staten Island yet).
</P>
<P>
   And he is on the loose: The Department of Investigation on
Friday identified the sham inspector as Nathaniel O'Neill, 56, a
veteran of impersonation who has been jailed nine times, including
twice in the past for impersonating a health inspector.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill is accused of three felonies involving forgery and
falsification, punishable by up to seven years in prison, and two
misdemeanors involving criminal impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   The bogus inspector is hardly a fantasizing Walter Mitty, or a
Great Impostor fulfilling long-held dreams of becoming a city
bureaucrat. ``He's in it for the money,'' Edward Kuriansky, the
city's investigation commissioner, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat, publisher of the Zagat restaurant and hotel surveys,
called the deception ``a very smart scam, because a lot of people
in the restaurant industry expect the worst of inspectors, given
the history.''
</P>
<P>
   Zagat referred to the March 1988 undercover investigation that
led initially to charges against 28 health inspectors. They were
accused of extorting hundreds of thousands of dollars from 300
restaurants by threatening to close them or cite them for sanitary
violations. Eventually, nearly 40 inspectors were convicted in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are an awful lot of little restaurant guys out
there who are vulnerable to this kind of approach,'' Zagat said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill is believed to have impersonated a health inspector more
than 50 different times over the last five years, imposing
``fines'' as high as $500. ``Generally he targets restaurants whose
owners may have a limited understanding of English,'' said
Kuriansky.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said the Department of Investigation released
the photograph of O'Neill ``because the defendant has become
increasingly brazen and is striking with greater frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuriansky said that O'Neill had a convincing manner and a
knowledge of Health Department procedures, but had never been an
inspector. At times, the masquerader may have been more akin to the
bumbling Inspector Clouseau of Peter Sellers than some Great
Impostor. Sixty restaurants were known to have been visited by the
impostor, and at 20 of them, people became suspicious and declined
to pay him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, many restaurateurs were taken in. ``The phony
inspector got $200 from us,'' said Nino Catuogno, the owner of
Bricco Ristorante, the Southern Italian trattoria at 304 West 56th
St. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in a month ago, checked our inspection records, and
said I had to pay a fine of $200,'' Catuogno said. ``He said that
cash would go through the court more quickly, so I gave him the
money but insisted on a receipt. It's not losing the money so much
that bothers me _ it was that I was taken for a ride.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jennifer Mahabir, who was working behind the counter at the New
Kebab House at 183 Church St. in Manhattan on Friday, said that the
impostor ``is big and fat and looks like he eats a lot,'' recalling
his visit to the restaurant a week ago. ``He said our permit had
expired, and the fine was $250. My boss gave him money and he gave
us a receipt.''
</P>
<P>
   Under no circumstances ``should a member of the public ever give
money to a Department of Health employee outside of a Department of
Health facility,'' said Neal Cohen, the city's health commissioner.
``No Department of Health inspector is authorized to collect money
in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department currently has 90 restaurant inspectors,
called public health sanitarians, who visit the city's 18,000
restaurants. Kuriansky said that the impostor was not asking for
bribes, but rather was cleverly pretending to be carrying out
inspection procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Kuriansky said O'Neill has 13 prior convictions going back to
1962, and has been jailed nine times ``for con scams, larceny and
burglary,'' he said. O'Neill was last released from prison in
August 1997, and has bilked some 15 to 16 restaurants since then.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the authorities released a photograph of O'Neill, but
many restaurateurs already have mug shots posted in their
establishments. ``They have photos of the restaurant critics inside
the kitchen door, on the way out,'' said Zagat. ``Now they'll have
photos of a crook there as well.''

<P>
   XIAOGANG, China _ Shooing away clouds of giant dragonflies,
surrounded by lush fields of rice and platoons of clacking ducks,
it is hard to imagine the parched and decrepit conditions of this
little village 20 years ago that forced many of its residents to
become itinerant beggars.
</P>
<P>
   As a few middle-aged villagers tell their practiced story, it is
even harder to imagine that these same people once fearfully defied
Communist Party policy, secretly dividing up the communal farm that
Mao had imposed with disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1978, starving and desperate, the 20 families in this
village of Anhui Province in eastern China took matters into their
own hands, risking the wrath of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, as the country learned of the remarkable
gains in Xiaogang and a few other pioneering places, the hated
communal farms broke apart all over China _ the single greatest
step toward the country's vibrant, market-oriented economy of the
1990s. This village in the middle of nowhere earned an important
footnote in the history of the new, post-Mao China.
</P>
<P>
   Historians often focus on leadership struggles in Beijing to
explain such momentous shifts in policy. But the insistent demand
for change from the bottom also played what scholars say is an
often overlooked role in smashing the communes. And similar
grass-roots pressures could, some think, be a driving force of
future convulsions in Chinese politics or economics.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the family farm, and the wider decontrol of rural
business that followed, ``radically changed the face of China,
altering the relationship between central and local authorities and
perhaps providing China's best single hope of making the transition
to a post-Communist world,'' said Joseph Fewsmith, a China scholar
at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on a fertile plain between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers,
Xiaogang should never have reached the nadir it did.
</P>
<P>
   The disasters began soon after the forced collectivization of
farming here and then the introduction of communes during the Great
Leap Forward of 1958-60. Many Xiaogang residents starved to death
in the catastrophic national famine that resulted from the
disruption of agriculture under the Great Leap Forward.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness among the area's farmers never dissipated, and
productivity declined. In the decade up to 1978, the village
required large subsidies of grain from the government, recalled Yan
Junchang, 57, who was leader of the communal village ``production
team'' in 1978. Travelers described homes with no doors, with
chairs and tables made only of mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm of the farmers was frustrated,'' was how Yan
described the corrosive effects of communal work in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Local party officials selected Yan along with Yan Hongchang, 48,
who was deputy production leader in 1978, and Yan Jinchang, 55,
another one of the original rebels, to meet a foreign reporter in
Xiaogang, with Yan Junchang, the former team leader, apparently
designated to do the talking. As in many Chinese villages, many
residents are from the same clan and share the same family name.
</P>
<P>
   ``As team leader, no matter how hard I rang the bell or blew the
whistle, I couldn't get anyone to go into the fields,'' Yan
Junchang said. Much of the available land was not even tilled.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, family members would spend months away in towns,
begging for food and coins. Then in 1978 a severe drought made
conditions unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   At an emotional meeting at the end of that year, the family
heads drew up an oath, signed with thumbprints. The parceling of
land to individual households would be kept secret, they agreed. If
any among them were imprisoned, the rest would raise their children
to the age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   The change was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people even got up before dawn to go work in the
fields,'' Yan said. The amount of land planted to grain nearly
doubled in one year, and the village began producing a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring villages learned of Xiaogang's move and sought to
emulate it, but angry commune officials tried to squelch the
rebellion, at one point in late 1979 cutting Xiaogang off from its
subsidies of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, Yan said.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after, the county party secretary visited and called
this a worthy experiment. Then the Communist Party leader of Anhui
Province, Wan Li, visited Xiaogang and gave his blessing _ a bold
decision at a time when the top farm officials in Beijing were
still promoting communal farming, true to the memory of Mao, who
died in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In that first year, the village produced a large grain surplus,
according to the official history, and output continued to rise. In
1980, as similar wildcat breakups of communes occurred around the
country, Deng Xiaoping _ who was consolidating power as the
national leader _ openly endorsed the change for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1984, the communes had disappeared nationwide,
Zhang Guangyou, a former aide to Wan Li, said in an interview. Wan
himself, a largely unsung hero of China's economic reforms, quickly
moved on to high office in Beijing and is now a retired party
elder.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars like Fewsmith warn against romanticizing the role of
Xiaogang and other villages that defied national policy. Such broad
national changes, he said, resulted from an interaction among
grass-roots pressures, the work of sympathetic local officials and,
at the top in Beijing, the drive of Deng and other reformers to
oust hard-line Maoists.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Xiaogang is a legitimate symbol of independent farmer
action,'' said Dali Yang, a Chinese-born political scientist at the
University of Chicago and author of ``Calamity and Reform in
China'' (Stanford University Press, 1996).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even today, 70 percent of Chinese live in the countryside: the
breakup of the communes altered more lives than any subsequent
event. It also, scholars say, was the inspiration for Deng's
much-vaunted urban economic reform in 1985, which allowed the
spread of private enterprise and, in recent years, spectacular
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Injecting market forces into the factories and cities was
easier, Yang observed, because three-fourths of the population
already lived in a virtual market economy, producing not only ample
food but also sought-after consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   With ``market socialism'' China's new dogma, Xiaogang's onetime
rebels are now heroes of the post-Mao revolution. Today, Xiaogang
has a colorful archway at its entrance and a paved strip of road
down the middle, the better to greet the occasional official
visitor. Many are expected this fall and winter to celebrate the
20th anniversary of that legendary secret oath.
</P>
<P>
   Its borders expanded, the village now is home to 312 people in
75 families. If they are not nearly as prosperous as those in more
advantageous locales, many farmers here have small tractors and
have branched out into production of ducks and pigs and
watermelons, and many homes sport refrigerators and washing
machines.
</P>
<P>
   These days Yan, the onetime production team leader, is careful
with his words. ``What we did was still under the socialist system,
but the pattern was just changed,'' he repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Both Yan and Yan Hongchang, the younger, former deputy team
leader, are now officials in a nearby larger town.The older Yan
said he became a party member in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superiority of the Communist Party led me to join,'' he
said, looking over the green fields.
</P>
<P>
   His 27-year-old son is the party secretary of Xiaogang.

 &HT;    President sitting duck, even if not lame one
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Hey, heard the one about the president and the
intern?
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry. If you haven't already, you will.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's troubles are no laughing matter _ except of
course for those in the business of mocking the high and mighty
when they seem to be down and out.
</P>
<P>
   The White House scandal has provided a plethora of punchlines
for TV comedians, joke writers and political satirists lured to the
story by an irresistible mix of power, sex and a news media gone
mad.
</P>
<P>
   No big news story in recent memory _ including the O.J. Simpson
murder trial _ has yielded as many zingers as the Clinton-Monica
Lewinsky saga.
</P>
<P>
   And there appears to be no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are either in hog heaven or hog hell on this one,'' said
Madeline Smithberg, supervising producer for Comedy Central's
newsmagazine spoof ``The Daily Show,'' which includes a segment
called ``Countdown to Impeachment '98.'' ``We have so much fodder
that it's beyond anyone's wildest dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Late-night wiseguys David Letterman, Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien
are frequently breaking tradition by devoting their entire opening
monologues to the president's sexual misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has three possibilities to consider'' Letterman joked
earlier this week on CBS' ``Late Show.'' ``One, (Clinton) could be
impeached; two he could be censured; three he could be neutered.''
</P>
<P>
   So just how many jokes and one-liners have been told on TV since
the Clinton scandal first broke? Dan Amundson of the Center for
Media &AMP; Public Affairs in Washington has been keeping count.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1 through Sept. 10, there were 1,401 Clinton sex
scandal jokes told on ``Late Show,'' NBC's ``Tonight Show with Jay
Leno,'' NBC's ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' and ABC's
``Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those, 1,306 involved Clinton, 226 were about Lewinsky and 99
lampooned Kenneth Starr. Also getting jabbed: Paula Jones (66),
Hillary Rodham Clinton (65), Linda Tripp (62), Al Gore (57) and
Janet Reno (34).
</P>
<P>
   The jokes have continued unabated since the Starr Report became
public, and have also become more pointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the jokes are getting bolder because there's so much
more material in the news that's making it harder to define what's
risque,'' Amundson said. ``I don't even think the O.J. jokes were
as blunt as this; they were more elliptical. There is really
nothing to compare this to.''
</P>
<P>
   But while comedians are carpet-bombing just about everyone
anyone associated with the scandal, Chelsea Clinton has been the
only no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't talk about Chelsea in the monologue,'' said Scott
Carter, the executive producer for ABC's ``Politically Incorrect.''
``We do make a distinction about what's fair game and what we won't
touch. She's still a child, not an adult and this is not of her
making.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the story has been a bonanza for television's court
jesters, some are starting to worry the story is growing tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was really exciting and the jokes were writing
themselves,'' said Jeff Stilson, head writer for HBO's ``The Chris
Rock Show.'' ``But after a while you want to write the jokes
yourself. You can't ignore it, but we don't want the show to become
'The Clinton Sex Scandal Show.' And trust me, if we're getting
weary of it, audiences are getting weary of it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Amundson is concerned about another potential effect on the
public.
</P>
<P>
   While skewering politicians is an American tradition dating back
generations, he said he fears the proliferation of jokes on TV
might trivialize the legitimate constitutional issues at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of this is just the way we blow off steam and
we're celebrating the fact that we can do it with such impunity,''
Amundson said. ``But I also think it has done a lot to inoculate
the public, and a majority of people are not shocked by any of
this. It makes the discourse more frivolous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said ``Chris Rock's'' Stillson. ``Jokes are just
jokes,'' he said. ``And we're just comedians.''

 &HT;    Tape, evidence will go public
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans decided Friday to make public President
Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony and a raft of sexually
explicit material about his adulterous affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The vote of the House Judiciary Committee, which broke along
party lines, means Clinton's four hours' testimony Aug. 17 in the
White House Map Room will be broadcast nationwide as soon as Monday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the videotape will be accompanied by transcripts of
Clinton's testimony as well as Lewinsky's appearances before the
grand jury convened by independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Some
2,600 pages of documents are expected to lay out in graphic detail
the sexual encounters Starr first described in the report to the
House released last week.
</P>
<P>
   The debate Friday focused not so much on the release of
Clinton's testimony as on what to release from the evidence backing
up Starr's report. In that report, Starr alleged that the president
committed perjury in his testimony about his sexual relationship
with Lewinsky and then obstructed justice in trying to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats fought hard to keep the more lurid details out of the
public domain, arguing that Starr's 445-page report released last
week has already delivered ``enough smut'' to American families via
the Internet, where the report was released and the media. But
Republicans argued that all of the evidence should be made public
if the impeachment process is going to be a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, all of the details in the 2,600 pages of material
will be made public save for 117 exempted passages that members
deleted on the grounds of sexual explicitness, national security or
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   And Georgia Republican Bob Barr is largely responsible for
making public three key passages that were intended to be kept
under seal. Barr won support from most of the committee's
Republicans to include how Clinton used a cigar as a sex prop with
Lewinsky, saying the public needs to know specific evidence of the
president's sexual encounters if it is going to weigh whether he
perjured himself in denying the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes extremely relevant,'' Barr said. ``We're forced to
do this by the president's own words.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lewinsky's testimony to the grand jury, Monday's
release is also expected to include descriptions of phone sex that
the president and Lewinksy had, explicit details about how the
president undressed her during their sexual encounters and
Lewinsky's description of how the president sexually aroused her.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly hammered the committee for releasing
such explicit detail. ``This appears to be a rush to prejudgment
and an effort to get the most salacious material at the speed of
light, not at the proper pace of justice,'' said James Kennedy, a
spokesman for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Following the committee's vote, there was a rush to a gaggle of
microphones awaiting members outside the Judiciary Committee
chambers and there was little attempt to hide the cantankerous
debate that took place inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accomplished a lot,'' said a weary Chairman Henry Hyde,
(R-Ill.). ``We had vigorous, spirited debate, but it was civil. I
would say that the spirit of bipartisanship is alive and
flourishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to him, Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank
quipped that the chairman seemed to hold a ``new concept of
unilateral bipartisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde telephoned Speaker Newt Gingrich earlier in the week and
offered to step down from the investigation after the online
magazine Salon reported that he had had an extramarital affair 30
years ago. Gingrich, however, gave Hyde his support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a sign of the depth of Henry Hyde's integrity that he
would offer a resignation for a 30-year-old affair,'' Gingrich
press spokesperson Christina Martin said. ``The speaker did not
entertain the offer because he could think of no person who had
earned more respect or affection than Henry Hyde.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, members stuck to their party lines. Rep.
Lamar Smith, (R-Texas), defended the decision to release the
evidence, but he said the discussion inside the room would make
``you want to wash your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a good faith effort was made to redact the most
salacious matter, with one or two exceptions,'' Smith said. ``These
exceptions were necessary because they were directly relevant to
allegations in the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly the view taken by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got rolled,'' said Michigan Democrat John Conyers, the
ranking member of the Judiciary panel. Conyers said that it was
unnecessary to release the details of the cigar episode and other
information in 27 passages that Republicans refused to exclude from
the material.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-page record of votes on various amendments and motions
made it clear that Republicans attempted wherever possible to make
sexual episodes public, yet they refused to make Thursday and
Friday's committee debates open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sexually explicit, it is offensive, it is obscene,''
said Conyers, attacking the Republicans for allegedly politicizing
the process. Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, (D-Mo.), agreed,
saying the decision was ``a truly sad a beginning to the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Releasing the material and the video tapes of Clinton's
testimony is akin to pouring ``gasoline on a burning fire,'' said
Sheila Jackson Lee, (D-Texas), questioning how in ``this climate of
hysteria the committee could proceed with fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all the partisan rhetoric, is a sense that the committee
is paralyzed by partisanship. California Democrat Zoe Lofgren
contrasted the current atmosphere on Capitol Hill with the
bipartisan consensus forged during the Watergate hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a comparison to be made and it's certainly not
favorable to this Congress,'' said Lofgren, who served as a
low-level aide to a member of the Watergate judiciary committee.
``What are we doing here when salacious material is rushed out into
the public arena, but discussion of the Constitution is hidden?''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that the Democrats are merely trying to turn
this into a partisan fight in order to deflect attention from the
allegations against the president presented in the Starr report.
Arguing that the Democrats used the same strategy during the
campaign fundraising investigations, Barr said it was important not
to let the partisan rancor interfere with the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a step in the direction to resolve these matters today
(by voting to make the materials public) and despite these sort of
shenanigans, we were able to move forward,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will be for the committee to decide whether to
move forward on an inquiry of impeachment. That would be in the
form of a resolution and could be taken up by the House at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that the scope of that inquiry could be expanded
outside the Lewinsky matter and include the campaign fundraising
questions raised by the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee. The chairman of that committee, Indiana Republican Dan
Burton, said on Thursday that he would refer examples of abusing
executive privilege to the Judiciary Committee for review.
</P>
<P>
   But the first test will be the public's reaction on Monday.

BLAKE PLEASED WITH NEW KINGS DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just 24 hours after saying he didn't know if he'd
be playing in a day, a week or two months, Kings captain Rob Blake
sat before a media gathering Friday afternoon elated that the first
of those possibilities had come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I wanted to stay here in Los Angeles,''
Blake, 28, said after signing a three-year contract worth $15.8
million. ``But with a contract this size, it takes some time (to
negotiate). Fortunately, it took only five days (of training camp)
and I can get back to business.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake, who earned $3.15 million last season when he won the
Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenseman, now will be paid $5.267
million a season, the highest salary for an NHL defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings also confirmed the signing of enforcer Matt Johnson to
a three-year deal believed to be worth a total of $2.175 million _
$650,000 this year, $725,000 next year and $800,000 in 2000-01.
Johnson earned $400,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get back as soon as possible and they made it
clear they wanted me back,'' said Johnson, 22, who has four goals,
11 points and 550 penalty minutes in 148 NHL games. ``I didn't know
it would happen this fast, but I was assuming it would be within a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   With Blake and Johnson under contract, both practiced Friday,
but neither is expected to play in weekend exhibition games in Las
Vegas against Colorado. The only unsigned Kings are goalie Jamie
Storr and defenseman Aki Berg, who has returned to his native
Finland.
</P>
<P>
   On finalizing Blake's deal, general manager Dave Taylor said:
``It gives us the opportunity to move forward. Last year, we gained
a lot of respect around the league. With Rob being the captain of
the team, we felt it was important to have him around for the
entire preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   One term of Blake's contract is that he will buy a luxury suite
(at a cost of $217,500 a year) when the Kings move into their new
arena, the Staples Center, next season. The suite will be made
available to charitable organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a leader for this organization as a player and as
a person,'' Blake said. ``To give underprivileged individuals the
opportunity to experience things they may never get a chance to see
is a thrill, and something I really want to make happen.''
</P>
<P>
   By signing Blake for three years, the Kings were able to get
their top player into training camp, but they also ensured that
they will have to deal with him again sooner than if he had
accepted the five-year, $25 million contract he reportedly had been
offered all summer. Blake, who surpassed St. Louis' Al MacInnis ($5
million a year) as the NHL's top-paid defenseman, will be eligible
for unrestricted free agency when he completes his new contract.
It's possible, however, that Taylor will discuss an extension with
Blake's agent, Ron Salcer, before the contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, they're going to be talking to us again,''
Salcer said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Taylor, ``We may try to lock Rob up for longer at some
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson was just happy to have two key contracts
resolved and two key players back on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, our team is much better with Blakey and Matty, and
hopefully Jamie and Bergy will come to their senses, too,''
Robinson said. ``They'll make us a better team. They're all pretty
talented players.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Kings returned seven players to their junior teams
and assigned three others to the IHL's Ice Dogs. Heading back to
junior hockey are defensemen Konrad Brand, Jeff Katcher, Kip
Brennan, Mathieu Biron and Joe Rullier, center Justin Papineau and
goalie Alexey Volkov.... Assigned to the Ice Dogs were defenseman
Jan Nemecek and right wings Justin Martin and Greg Phillips.

EDITORIAL: THE CHANGE IN RENO'S COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno's recent decision to review the
advertising blitz orchestrated by President Clinton during his
re-election campaign marks an important if belated turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, Reno has misread federal campaign finance laws to
justify her refusal to seek investigation by an independent counsel
of the ``soft-money'' shenanigans by the president and the
Republicans in the 1996 campaign. Her laissez-faire stance
protected Clinton, but eviscerated restrictions on campaign
spending and contributions designed to curb the buying of access
and influence.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's move is the latest of three separate inquiries that could
lead to a broader investigation of campaign fund-raising abuses. It
targets the audacious scheme by which Clinton and his team used
unregulated soft-money contributions from unions, corporations and
wealthy donors that are barred in federal campaigns to pay for a
barrage of television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotape that emerged a year ago, Clinton is seen telling
supporters about the scheme to run the money through party accounts
to evade restrictions he had agreed to as a condition of receiving
$75 million in public financing.
</P>
<P>
   The subterfuge fooled no one but Reno and her advisers in the
Justice Department's misnamed Public Integrity section. Even before
the election, it was clear that the commercials were really Clinton
campaign ads, not generic issue ads on which the party may spend
unlimited amounts of unregulated soft money.
</P>
<P>
   But in a 1997 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee chairman
Orrin Hatch, Reno tolerantly embraced the White House claim that by
having the Democratic Party write the checks, and by omitting
language urging the election or defeat of a candidate, it had
transformed the campaign ads into issue ads not chargeable to the
presidential spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth the party's only role was to act as a conduit for
the money, which all those White House coffees and sleepovers
helped to raise. Clinton and his team totally controlled the
funding, content and broadcasting of the ads. Both the statute
establishing the public financing system and Federal Election
Commission regulations make plain that expenditures made by or at
the request of a candidate count as a ``qualified campaign
expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Reno's change of position has not led to an
increase in candor. She attributes her decision to re-examine the
Clinton ads to a preliminary finding by a Federal Election
Commission auditor that White House control of the commercials
rendered them campaign ads. But that finding hardly comes as a
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   As former FEC Chairman Trevor Potter testified a year ago, FEC
advisory opinions hold that party commercials coordinated with a
candidate's campaign and containing an ``electioneering message''
depicting an identifiable candidate are campaign ads, whether or
not they tell viewers to vote for or against someone.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was finally goaded into action by the memo left by the
outgoing chief of her campaign finance task force, Charles La
Bella. It said the known evidence required an independent counsel,
and advanced a refreshing legal theory that campaign finance laws
mean what they say.

<P>
   MEERUT, India _ When Srichand, among the least touchable of
untouchables, was killed Sept. 2, he was doing the humiliating work
of his subcaste, the balmikis, going from house to house with a
broom, a scoop and a bowl, carrying away the ``night soil'' from
the dry toilets in people's houses.
</P>
<P>
   Srichand had been chosen for death by a gang of jatavs, another
untouchable subcaste that is a few notches above the balmikis in
India's ancient pecking order. Days before, a balmiki boy had left
the city with a jatav girl, a departure that the balmikis took to
be teen-age love and the jatavs considered a spiteful kidnaping.
</P>
<P>
   While the spark for this strife was a disputed romance, the
kindling lay in the caste-based tensions of India, where a
half-century of well-intended efforts to erase the lines of
prejudice have in some ways made caste more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution of 1950 nominally abolished the notion of
untouchability. At the same time, it expanded a system of
``reservations,'' first applied in India by the British, that
guarantees untouchables 15 percent of all seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   This reservation system, which came to include state elected
offices and government jobs, shook the rigid scaffolding of caste
hierarchy. Untouchables, now more commonly called dalits or the
scheduled castes, increasingly resented being shunned. They
demanded their rights, and, numbering 150 million _ more than a
sixth of India's population _ became voters that political parties
could not ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Untouchables, however, are not a unified multitude. Divided and
subdivided into hundreds of social stations, some have accrued the
spoils that come with political horsetrading _ such as jobs and
better schools. And some have not.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Meerut, a city of 1.5 million in the northern state of
Uttar Pradesh, the more-numerous jatavs _ descendants of cobblers _
have begun to develop political muscle and advance economically.
Left behind are the balmikis, who have grown ever more resentful
and now look for their own political alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now, the jatavs have gotten most of the reserved
seats, and this must change,'' said Prem Nath Dhingra, a balmiki
activist. ``We demand 50 percent, and there are political parties
encouraging us. It threatens the jatavs that we raise our voices.''
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwat Pura is a neighborhood of narrow alleyways where the
noise of smoke-belching trucks gives way to the squeal of
handcarts. Amid the cement hovels, some jatavs still live
side-by-side with balmikis, and it was from here on Aug. 27 that
the boy disappeared with the girl.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors quickly began to stoke animosity, and taunting from both
sides overheated into stoning and looting. Even after the police
found the girl unharmed in a nearby town five days later, the
trouble went on.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 2, 45-year-old Srichand _ who used but that single name
_ began his work day at 4 a.m., going off to his city job, sweeping
excrement into sewers. It paid him $71 a month.
</P>
<P>
   He had two sons and four daughters. For them, he wanted
education, and they all remain in no-tuition state schools.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning he died, his eldest daughter, Seema, who has
completed college, warned him not to go into the tense streets.
``My father told me, `We work daily so that we make money daily so
that we eat daily,''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Around 10 a.m., he came home to join his wife, Uma.
Side-by-side, they made the rounds each day to 40 houses,
collecting night soil. This earned them another $14 a month.
</P>
<P>
   They had just come from a Muslim house when the jatavs leaped
from hiding. ``First, they started beating him and then they
dragged him to an alley,'' she said. ``My husband told me, `They'll
kill you, so run,' And I ran.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped when she heard gun shots. Hurrying back, she found
her husband bleeding from wounds made by bullets and a knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw no more,'' she said. ``I fainted.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indian civilization, so rich with wonderment and greatness, has
been marred by the proposition that all men are created unequal.
</P>
<P>
   Ancient Hindu scriptures tell of how the gods created the world
and the social order within it by sacrificing a primeval man,
Purusha. From his face came the priestly elite Brahmans, his arms
the warrior Kshatriya, his thighs the merchant Vaishyas, his feet
the servile, hapless Shudras. Beneath them all were those whom
nature had ordained to be unclean _ people destined to do filthy
work. The jatavs are an offshoot of such pariahs, a sub-caste
scorned because of their traditional work as cobblers, which
requires the handling of dead flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Names for sub-castes have varied, and sometimes the hierarchical
order has differed as well, but the result has always been the
same, a ranking of human worth.
</P>
<P>
   In modern India, caste has not disappeared, only changed. ``The
ritual side of caste _ the eating separately, the maintaining of
ritual distances, may have broken down _ but the politics of caste
has become extremely important,'' said Andre Beteille, a
sociologist at the Delhi School of Economics. ``Different castes
unite into coalitions, and the coalitions are always shifting.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most untouchables are now agricultural laborers, no longer doing
the polluted work associated with their kind. In the minds of many
others, however, that change means nothing. The stigma is
indelible, coursing from one generation to the next.
</P>
<P>
   The most villified remain the balmikis. There are roughly 4
million of them, and 500,000 still carry ``night soil,'' according
to Bindeshwar Pathak, a Brahman who has won international honors
for trying to free balmikis from inherited shame.
</P>
<P>
   That effort at liberation is complicated not only by age-old
biases, but also by India's immense poverty. Some 700 million
people, primarily villagers, still defecate outside, Pathak said.
Among the urban poor, dry latrines continue to be common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do the work a mother does for her children, but we are not
looked upon as mothers but as scum,'' said Suresh Richpal, a
balmiki. ``Our children go to school, but teachers have it in mind:
He is the son of a scavenger. He is worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   Richpal was Srichand's cousin. ``Why is he dead?'' he asked.
``The jatavs wanted to teach the balmikis a lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the teen-age couple, the boy goes by the single name
Amit, and by all accounts he is 19. The girl is Renu Rani and she
is variously said to be 20, 19, 17 or 15.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he eloped with her or abducted her is hard to know for
sure. Amit is in jail and Renu Rani is in Punjab, 200 miles away,
secreted with relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But while the truth is elusive, looking for it provided a lesson
in the combustible mix of caste prejudice and murderous
assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Amit's house in Bhagwat Pura was empty, but friends of the
family quickly gathered at the sight of strangers. They spoke of a
love affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both families knew of their feelings, and at times the girl
was beaten by her parents, but the girl said, `No, no, no, I will
go away with this boy, I love this boy,''' said Ravi Mehrol, 19,
one of Amit's friends.
</P>
<P>
   Amit's uncle lives near Renu, he said, and Amit had met her at
the uncle's house a year ago. Neither were minors. He is 19 years
and 3 months old. She is 19 years and 6 months.
</P>
<P>
   This version, with small variations, is what most balmikis
believe. Srichand's grieving family repeated much of it as they sat
in a park near the city commissioner's office, where they had come
to demand justice and were awaiting an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl made a statement at the police station,'' said
Srichand's daughter Seemar. ``She said, `It is not that the boy ran
away with me, but that I ran away with the boy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Because of skirmishes in the streets, Srichand was denied a
funeral procession, his body taken directly from a hospital to the
funeral pyre.
</P>
<P>
   The injustice of it angered Seema. ``Our troubles with the
jatavs are all caused by a misunderstanding,'' she said. ``And for
this my father has died.''
</P>
<P>
   Renu's home is behind her parents' tiny grocery. Her mother said
the family has lived there for 20 years, though, some months back,
they decided to move, to get away from the balmikis, and that is
where the roots of the conflict begin.
</P>
<P>
   A balmiki family had given them a down payment for their house
and store, but then had failed to pay the balance. Renu's family
believed it was their right to keep the initial money _ and that
infuriated the balmikis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my daughter to the Friday market, and four balmiki boys
snatched her away,'' said Prem Wati, 45. ``They had their faces
covered and put a gun to her head. They shouted that the same would
happen to other jatav girls, so our community is very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those boys was indeed Amit, Mrs. Wati said, but there had
never been any romance going on. Her daughter was only 15.
</P>
<P>
   Someone ran off to retrieve a two-year-old photograph. ``This is
Renu,'' said her brother Amar, pointing to a rather mature-looking
girl.
</P>
<P>
   This conversation, occurring in an open courtyard, had drawn a
small crowd. People egged on Mrs. Wati when she declared,
``Balmikis are beneath us, and we cannot tolerate it when they run
off with our girls.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman beside her added: ``Balmikis clear away the excrement.
We are not going to do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   But hadn't the jatavs themselves long suffered from caste
degradation _ and didn't they want it to die away?
</P>
<P>
   An older man standing near the open window of the grocery
answered earnestly: ``Discrimination against us may end. But
discrimination against the balmiki is right and it must go on.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at an old wooden desk in a well-pressed uniform, Police
Superintendent Dhom Singh Tomar said the investigation had gone
well. Six of the seven jatav men who had killed Srichand were in
custody and had confessed.
</P>
<P>
   As for Amit, he was being charged with kidnaping and statutory
rape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official statement of the girl is that she was lured
away,'' the superintendent said. ``As for anything she said to us
unofficially, that is no longer important.''
</P>
<P>
   A physician had examined the girl. While he had found her to be
``a sexually active female,'' Tomar reported, it was also the
doctor's opinion that she was only 15 or 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``So she is a minor, and the matter of her consent is
irrelevant,'' he said, ready now to put things to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Srichand's murder had not been a terribly urgent matter, but the
disturbances in the streets had required police manpower and he
wanted it stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must understand that these people are illiterate and poor,
and for them talk is cheap,'' the superintendent said.
</P>
<P>
   By birth, Tomar is a jat, a peasant sub-caste that ranks far
above the jatavs and balmikis, for whom he has little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people drink through the night,'' he said disdainfully.
``Generally, you cannot expect them to behave in a civilized way.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 20) 
(af) 
By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tip arrived at the rustic New Hampshire farmhouse of George
A. Schrader Jr. in a large manila envelope, postmarked Boston and
stuffed with the prospects of future riches.
</P>
<P>
   The contents told of a promising young drug company called
Seragen Inc., which was developing a new class of drugs that
scientists believed might someday be a ``magic bullet'' in the
fight against cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Seragen had good science, the papers said, and Wall Street
analysts predicted that with Food and Drug Administration approval,
it would quickly become a biotechnology superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader decided to buy about $6,000 in shares of Seragen in
that summer of 1992. A retired professor of philosophy, he did not
know much about biology or the stock market. But he knew the man
who had sent him the envelope _ John R. Silber, then the president
of Boston University, who had been a brilliant student of
Schrader's at Yale 30 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Combative and charismatic, Silber was a true believer in Seragen
and its drugs, and for a decade he was the company's most ardent
salesman. He persuaded scores of associates, friends, and family
members to buy in: his brother, sister-in-law and niece, and
friends on the faculty. His secretary plowed in more than $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   At Silber's behest, the university poured tens of millions into
Seragen, a sum that grew even in the face of a formal rebuke from
state regulators that the stake was too risky for a nonprofit
endowment.
</P>
<P>
   Silber himself sank $1.7 million, close to half his net worth,
into Seragen. To him, Seragen had not just a magic bullet against
disease, but also the cure for Boston University's chronic
financial needs; it was the wonder drug that would propel the
university's modest endowment into Ivy League ranks.
</P>
<P>
   He delved into the company's complex science much as he had
immersed himself in the ethics of Immanuel Kant.
</P>
<P>
   But as with so many infatuations, this one came to an ugly end.
</P>
<P>
   An FDA advisory panel recommended approval of Interleukin-2 this
year _ but not before Seragen, based in Hopkinton, Mass., ran out
of money. The stock collapsed, and the company, flirting with
bankruptcy, was sold in August for a pittance. Boston University's
stake today is worth just $8.4 million. Silber's holdings, which
had grown to $2 million, are valued now at $43,000. Some investors
did better, depending on when they bought in and whether they got
out before the crash. By the time Schrader died in May, his
investment had all but evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the debacle, the finger-pointing has grown
heated. Some shareholders have sued Seragen and Boston University,
among others, contending that in the scramble to keep Seragen
afloat, the university _ which took a controlling interest of the
company in 1987 _ engaged in ``sweetheart deals'' and
``self-dealing'' that benefited the university while whipsawing the
share price and ultimately undermining Seragen's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse has also served as an opportunity for Silber's
critics to resurrect accusations that he was blind to conflicts of
interest arising from Seragen, including his and the university's
financial dealings with trustees who both oversaw the university's
investments in Seragen and invested in the company themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Silber saw no conflict of interest. ``I advocated that the
trustees invest in Seragen, and I put my poke in Seragen,'' he
said. ``I think it would have been hypocritical if I said, `You
invest, but I won't.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He was, after all, in pursuit of what every investor wants: a
huge score. He just happened to pick one of the toughest ways to
make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotech is a graveyard,'' said Mark Simon, an analyst at
BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``This is a very risky area. It's
like wildcatting, oil drilling. But when you hit a well, it can be
very huge.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Silber likes to say that he has always been a risk taker.
In 1971, he took a risk on Boston University, a school that he
considered nearly bankrupt, academically and financially, and
transformed it into a bastion of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   He hired what he termed a ``murderer's row'' of top scholars,
bolstered the university's finances and gained notoriety as one of
the nation's highest-paid college presidents, with compensation of
more than $500,000 a year. In 1996, he was named chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   He first became interested in Seragen in 1986, when Dr. John R.
Murphy, a professor at the university, gave a talk about his
discovery of ``fusion toxins,'' genetically re-engineered proteins
that acted as guided missiles, aiming at diseased cells and
injecting them with a protein-destroying chemical. Murphy had
helped found Seragen, with other Boston-area scientists, and his
experimental drug, Interleukin-2, was later licensed to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him coming up to me after the talk, and he was very
interested in the nature of the science and the potential the
science had,'' Murphy said, recalling his first discussion of
Interleukin-2 with Silber. ``He was very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, when a Norwegian pharmaceutical company decided
to divest itself of its majority interest in Seragen, the
university's trustees, at Silber's urging, bought the stake for $25
million. He was not about to repeat the mistake Boston University
made at the turn of the century, when Alexander Graham Bell
invented the telephone _ while on leave from the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had just 5 percent of what eventually became Bell
Telephone,'' Silber explained recently, ``we would be richer than
Harvard today.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics at the university, however, questioned the Seragen
investment almost immediately. Michael Manove, a professor of
economics, complained that the school was putting ``too many eggs
in one basket.'' The school's total endowment at the time was
valued at $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   More serious questions arose when Silber, a conservative
Democrat, ran for governor of Massachusetts in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   William Weld, his Republican opponent, accused him of personally
profiting from the university's sale of a Seragen unit in 1989.
Silber denied owning stock in the unit, but in 1993, long after
Silber lost the election, the Massachusetts Attorney General's
office _ which regulates nonprofit institutions _ concluded that he
indeed had received $386,700 from the sale.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Silber said he had returned the payment as soon
as he recognized that it was improper. Investigators determined
that Silber had not broken any laws.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation into Silber was part of a criminal inquiry,
the attorney general said, which was begun after his office
received ``credible evidence'' that Silber had received a payment
that he had denied receiving in public statements. Meanwhile, a
separate civil inquiry examined the university's governance and its
large stake in Seragen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the university signed an agreement with the attorney
general's office pledging to ``significantly reduce'' its financial
exposure in Seragen. To spread the risk, an initial public offering
was planned.
</P>
<P>
   None of the criticism dampened Silber's enthusiasm for Seragen.
He was enamored with the company and its technology _ in part
because of the story of a Hingham, Mass., man named Bill Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, a form of cancer that
quickly covered his body with lesions. Chemotherapy had failed, and
in January 1990, when he was 60, he was told that he did not have
much time left. Smith was given a dose of Interleukin-2, then in
the early stages of its clinical trials, and soon after, his cancer
went into remission.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave me six months to live, and I'm still here,'' Smith
said in a recent interview. ``It's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   His account, videotaped for Seragen, became a centerpiece in
Silber's personal campaign to spread the word about the company.
Although Silber says he never ``touted'' Seragen's stock, he did
encourage people in his vast circle to invest once the company went
public in April 1992, at $12 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he believed in it, and because he's an intelligent and
persuasive person, I bought it,'' said Walter Lubars, a longtime
professor of public relations at Boston University who bought about
$30,000 worth. ``I was getting ready to retire, and he convinced
me, in '92, '93, '94, that by '97, Seragen would be at $64.''
</P>
<P>
   There was never any doubt about Silber's commitment _ or
compassion. In 1991, he wrote to Roger Shattuck, a longtime friend
who was a professor of modern languages at the university, that
Seragen was developing a molecule that might offer a treatment for
Shattuck's 40-year-old daughter Tari, a teacher, who was suffering
from CML leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Shattuck eventually invested in the company, but Interleukin-2
proved irrelevant to his daughter's disease; she died in April
1993.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Silber arranged for his son David, 41, an actor
infected with HIV, to be treated with the drug. ``Seragen is really
our only hope, because the doctors agree that the other chemo is
only slowing it down but cannot stop it,'' Silber wrote to a
friend. ``David is now in that difficult process for a young person
of coming to terms with the fact that he is very likely to die
within the next few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he died a month later.
</P>
<P>
   Silber's enthusiasm could not disguise the difficulties Seragen
was facing. The company raised $52 million through public stock
sales in 1992 and 1993, but like so many young biotechnology
companies, its cash needs were voracious.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, with FDA approval of Interleukin-2 still just a dream,
Seragen lost $26.3 million, pushing its cumulative losses to $200
million. The stock, which had reached a high of $15 in January
1993, ended 1996 at just over $1 a share. By then, Murphy, the
father of Interleukin-2, had severed his ties to Seragen. Though
his faith in the drug was undiminished, ``it was clear,'' he said,
``that the problems were business problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As tireless as he had been in promoting the public stock
offerings, Silber worked just as hard to bring desperately needed
money into the company when sales of common stock were no longer
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of deals. In November 1995, Silber
orchestrated a bailout of sorts that brought in $23.8 million
through a loan backed by the university and two affiliated
investors: Leon C. Hirsch, the chairman of the United States
Surgical Corp., who is also a university trustee, and Gerald S.J.
Cassidy, the university's Washington lobbyist. The loans were later
converted into preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the university, which had periodically poured new
money into Seragen, invested an additional $5 million through a
private placement of stock, bringing its stake to $84 million. (The
state, which had directed Boston University four years earlier to
reduce its holdings in Seragen, did not object, because with the
overall growth of the school's endowment to $470 million, its
relative exposure to the drug company's stock had diminished, said
Richard C. Allen, head of the public charities division of the
state attorney general's office.)
</P>
<P>
   In December, Seragen's board _ which included Silber, Cassidy
and Kenneth Condon, the university's treasurer _ voted to raise the
number of authorized shares in the company to 70 million from 30
million. It was an act of desperation that would dilute the value
of existing investors' holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a small group of investors began complaining about the
company's issuing what they termed ``exploding puts'': preferred
shares or options with conversion features that could result in
virtually unlimited dilution if the share price fell _ as, indeed,
it did.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to raise cash continued into 1997, but there were
no more deep pockets for Silber to plumb. In February, Seragen sold
its manufacturing operation to the university for $5 million. The
school leased services back to Seragen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deals like that one, critics said, indicated that Silber and the
university had crossed the lines of propriety in their struggle to
keep Seragen afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors complained that key backers of Seragen had
conflicting allegiances. Silber and Hirsch, for instance, were
trustees of the university, directors of U.S. Surgical and large
shareholders of Seragen.
</P>
<P>
   Among other transactions, U.S. Surgical paid $5 million in July
1997 for the worldwide rights to one of Seragen's drugs, a deal
that also gave U.S. Surgical warrants to buy 500,000 Seragen
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Silber owns 22,000 shares of U.S. Surgical, worth around
$900,000. He has also been designated a director in Cassidy's
lobbying firm, when it goes public.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbed by what they said was the appearance of a conflict of
interest, a group of U.S. Surgical investors called in May of this
year for a vote to remove Silber from the company's compensation
committee, citing an ``inter-locking directorate relationship''
with Hirsch and the men's business ties.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As Seragen collapsed, shareholders outside its inner circle also
began to look askance at the blur of transactions. In August, an
angry group of investors filed a lawsuit in Delaware contending
that the interests of minority shareholders were damaged by Silber,
the university and its associates, including Cassidy and Hirsch.
The suit says they engaged in ``sweetheart deals'' and
``self-dealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy and Hirsch declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas G. Griffin, a lawyer for the shareholder group, said the
``self-dealing'' included the $23.8 million bailout of Seragen in
1995. The ties between the various parties, he said, obscured lines
of fiduciary duty. ``Boston University and Silber are controlling
Seragen and saying, `You're going to do this deal with BU,' '' he
said. ``So they are both buyer and seller; they have these
arrangements with themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But R. Robert Popeo, a lawyer for the university who earlier
represented Seragen, denied that the university or Silber were
involved in any self-dealing or conflicts of interest. He said that
his office had drawn up strict conflict guidelines that were
closely followed and that Silber and other university officials did
not participate in votes when there were deemed to be conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   At times, though, he said Silber and others _ including himself
_ switched from representing the university to representing
Seragen's interest. ``Dual representation doesn't mean a conflict
of interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were there ``sweetheart'' deals, he added; rather than
damaging the company, he said, the university saved it from early
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seragen would have been out of business had it not been for
the university, Hirsch and Cassidy,'' Popeo said. ``Pick up a phone
and call Salomon or Lehman and they'll tell you for $23 million
they could have demanded 40 percent of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, of course, conflicts are a matter of perception. ``What
is improper about an officer of the university having business
dealings with trustees?'' Silber asked during an interview last
week. ``Far from being a conflict of interest, it is clearly in the
interest of the university to establish such business dealings.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, Silber's faith in Interleukin-2 has not faltered.
``The fact is, I was right about Seragen's science,'' he said
defiantly in a recent interview. ``For over 10 years, we've had
good results.''
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval for the
use of Interleukin-2 in the treatment of lymphoma. On final
approval, the drug, known commercially as Ontak, may live up to the
promise that Silber imagined for it when he heard Murphy's speech
12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Seragen, and Boston University, will not reap much of the
benefit. Out of money and delisted from the NASDAQ stock market,
Seragen was acquired in August by Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc., a
San Diego company whose shares promptly tumbled when the deal was
announced. Ligand paid $30 million for Seragen, now a wholly owned
subsidiary, and will pay an additional $37 million if Ontak gets a
final government O.K.
</P>
<P>
   To the university, that represented a loss of 90 percent on its
investment during a time when so many others were soaring. For just
the $50 million that the school had put into Seragen as of 1989, it
could have $175 million today had it instead put the money into a
mutual fund that tracked the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   The cry among critics all along was that Silber just could not
let go. They said the university refused to give up its majority
stake in Seragen, making financing difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Silber says that if the state had not restricted the university
from investing more heavily, Seragen would have flourished.
``Seragen has not fallen and Seragen has not failed,'' Silber said.
``You want to talk about the rise and fall of Seragen's stock?
Fine.'' Regulators say they saved the univeristy from losing
millions more.
</P>
<P>
   Silber's hope, now, is in Ligand, which may eventually bring
Ontak to the market. What remains of his and the university's
Seragen stakes have become Ligand shares.
</P>
<P>
   Silber's friends must hope now, too. Despite their losses, few
have soured on John Silber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry in a way for John, because he wanted to leave as
a legacy a gigantic endowment,'' said Lubars, the retired professor
who bought into Seragen on Silber's tip. ``And I hope people don't
think he's dumped Seragen on us, because he's done so many good
things for the university.''

STEINBRENNER DISCUSSES SALE OF YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees have already reached their magic number for
achieving the best record in the American League this year. Now it
appears they are searching for another magic number, one that would
persuade majority owner George Steinbrenner to sell the team to
Cablevision of New York, owned by Chuck Dolan and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe has learned that within the past two weeks,
Steinbrenner had a meeting with his minority owners and asked how
they felt about selling the team. This was the only time
Steinbrenner has broached the subject of selling the team, which he
purchased for $10 million in 1973. According to two sources, he
asked his limited partners, most of them old friends from his days
in Cleveland, if they would prefer to (1) sell all of the team, (2)
sell part of the team, or (3) not sell at all.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, the consensus was that Steinbrenner should agree to
sell all of the club if he feels he is getting what it's worth.
Stories in New York say Steinbrenner has been offered $500 million
by Dolan, also an old friend from Cleveland, in a deal under which
he would be allowed to run the team for at least five more years at
a salary of $5 million annually. That's in addition to his share of
the sale, perhaps almost $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner reportedly owns nearly 60 percent of the team.
Through Cablevision, Dolan has the cable television rights to
Yankees, Mets, Knicks, Rangers, and Devils games. The Yankee deal
is up in two years, but by purchasing the team, Cablevision would
own those rights for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Dolan came up short in his attempt to purchase
the Cleveland Browns NFL expansion team for $500 million. Al Lerner
won the bid with $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   The trend in sports is for major television companies to
purchase teams. Fox recently purchased the Los Angeles Dodgers. It
makes sense for these networks to buy teams because it would cost
less than the TV rights for a decade. Buy the team, then you own
your own rights.
</P>
<P>
   Part II: Could this be the way of the future for the Red Sox?
Reportedly, three major national television companies are
interested in the Sox' TV rights. Reportedly, Cablevision, Fox, and
Disney could be interested. One reportedly has spoken with the Red
Sox about paying $400 million for the rights over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' biggest contract was a few years back when they did a
seven-year deal with Channel 38 that topped out in the area of $16
million.
</P>
<P>
   However, the financial field in sports television has gone crazy
since those days, and the numbers are going out of sight. Last year
the NFL made network TV deals that total $18 billion over eight
years. For that money, that networks could have bought every team
in the league and owned the rights forever.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Rupert Murdoch, the Fox TV mogul, offered $1 billion
to buy Manchester United, the most popular soccer team in Europe.
Again, why pay all that money for the TV rights when you can buy
the team for the same price?

   Here is an up-to-date scouting report on the Tennessee Oilers
from an NFL head coach who has faced them frequently: ``They are
doing more on offense this season than they have since they put
(Steve) McNair at quarterback. They are throwing more and looking
more for the long ball. Last year they played it pretty
conservative and had a reduced offense. They have expanded that.
This is a very tough team physically. They knock you around and
beat you up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, they attack. They come at you and try to make
plays. Jeff (Fisher, the coach) trained under Buddy Ryan, and he
always has gimmicks and tricks that give your offense a lot of
trouble. When they have the ball, they want to pound it down your
throat with Eddie George. But he is not off to the start he's had
in the past. Their offensive line was outplayed by San Diego last
week. The Chargers' front just won that battle clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who you are, if you are not ready to play this
team or you take them lightly, you're going to lose.''

   There might be NBA games this year ... but maybe not until
Christmas. As the lockout continues, word is that commissioner
David Stern has rallied the owners into a tighter group than he's
ever had. They are ready to play hardball.
</P>
<P>
   How the labor strife plays out will depend upon a ruling by an
arbitrator who has conducted a hearing on whether some players with
guaranteed contracts have to be paid. If he rules no, which the
owners expect, the decision will be easy for them. They'll wait for
the rank-and-file to start missing paychecks and beefing to their
union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This lockout was triggered by the owners' desire to eliminate
the so-called Larry Bird Exception _ which allows a team to pay
whatever it wants to a free agent already on its roster, regardless
of the salary cap. At present, only 22 players fall into that
category.
</P>
<P>
   As a compromise, look for the owners to offer to grandfather the
Bird Rule players for three or four years. This way, most of them
will be covered for the rest of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the owners will try to do a deal without the Bird Rule that
would guarantee more money to the middle class and reserves.
</P>
<P>
   If the arbitrator rules in favor of the players, which means
that the owners would have to pay about half the players in the
league during the lockout (wouldn't that be a crazy scenario?),
then it would be harder for them to hang tough for a long period.

   A source in the Bruins' ranks says the surprise of training camp
is comebacking goalie Jim Carey. Carey was dismal in camp and the
exhibition season last year and finally was demoted to Providence,
where he complained and then underwent season-ending shoulder
surgery. Those around the team last year said Carey didn't seem to
care about anything. This year he appears to be back to the form he
showed when he was a standout for the Washington Capitals in his
first two NHL seasons.
</P>

   Among the newcomers, Jonathan Girard, a defenseman taken in the
second round, seems to have the best chance of sticking with the
big club.

   Don't be surprised if Glenn Foley does not start for the Jets
Sunday against Indianapolis at Giants Stadium. Foley has sore ribs,
so the Jets are thinking of resting him for two weeks. Like the
rest of the AFC East, the Jets have a bye next week ... You have to
root for Dean Sylvester of Hanson. Sylvester played hockey at BC
High and went to Kent State before it dropped the program. After
finishing at Michigan State, he went to the East Coast Hockey
League, played two seasons with Kansas City of the International
Hockey League, and just signed with the Buffalo Sabres. Most
college players don't have the stomach for spending that many years
chasing a dream ... And speaking of chasing a dream, Stephanie
O'Sullivan of Dorchester is still doing just that. She got plenty
of publicity when she was the last cut by the US women's ice hockey
team before the Olympics. Presently, she is working out with the
all-male Bay State Breakers, a junior team based in Rockland.
However, she first has to get a waiver to be an overage player in
the league, then must make the team. She wants to use this avenue
to launch a comeback toward making the national team and eventually
the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.

honored for winning the Heisman Trophy. Ruth will be honored for

... Tracy Stallard, who served up Roger Maris's 61st home run in
1961, has refused media interviews during Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa's successful quest for Maris's record. However, some members
of the Patriots that year remember vividly a train ride back to
Boston from New York the day of Maris's 61st. The Sox ended the
season in Yankee Stadium on a Sunday afternoon, the same day the
Patriots played the Titans (the original Jets) in the Polo Grounds.
By chance, both teams returned on the train, where Stallard
entertained those in the club car by several times announcing, ``I
don't know about you guys ... but I'm going to be in the Hall of
Fame.''

MANDELA GETS RARE DOCTORATE BEFORE 20,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TATSHA ROBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Nelson Mandela, the legendary South African
leader who has symbolized a commitment to racial justice, stood
before Harvard University Friday, honored by the school as only
George Washington and Winston Churchill had been before him.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the moment was not lost on Mandela _ nor on more
than 20,000 listeners in Harvard's Tercentenary Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It holds great symbolic significance: to the mind and to the
future memory of this great American institution, the name of an
African is now added to those two illustrious leaders of the
Western world,'' Mandela told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriateness of his words resounded through the crowd,
which responded with a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   With the stage of America's oldest college his, Mandela
challenged the world Friday to close the sweeping disparities
between rich and poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While in all parts of the world progress is being made in
entrenching democratic forms of governance,'' he said, ``we
constantly need to remind ourselves that the freedoms which
democracy brings will remain empty shells if they are not
accompanied by real and tangible improvements in the material lives
of the millions of ordinary citizens of those countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, 80, looking regal in a dark suit, came to Cambridge to
accept an honorary doctorate, one of only a few given outside of
June commencement. Although Harvard has awarded the degree to
several groups, Mandela, Washington, and Churchill are the only
individuals to receive such an honor.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting with that stature, Mandela's humility seemed to
strike the audience. At the end of the event, the former African
National Congress leader, the man imprisoned for 27 years during
his struggle for a nation's freedom, made a point to shake hands or
to hug every student in Harvard's two choirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may well be our last official visit to the United States
before retiring from office next year,'' Mandela told the crowd of
Harvard faculty, high school and college students, politicians, and
community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's second visit to the Boston area marks the start of a
weeklong tour in which he will meet with President Clinton and
address the United Nations next week.
</P>
<P>
   He first visited the United States in 1990, shortly after his
release from South African prison after years of worldwide
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Then, his recently gained freedom made the US appearances seem
almost magical and religious. Accompanied by his then-wife, Winnie
Mandela, he swept the multiracial crowds in Boston as he called for
the continuation of economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   There was similar anticipation for this event; Kevin Bryant,
among others, had been preparing for days. The 43-year-old Harvard
police and Honor Guard officer put in an early request to his
captain to carry Mandela's degree from 17 Quincy St., through the
Yard, and to the stage of the Tercentenary Theater. At exactly 3:53
p.m., he came down the brick path in front of Sever Hall, clutching
the degree with white-gloved hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in awe, I was just amazed,'' Bryant said of the degree
and the moment he will surely tell his grandchildren about. ``It's
an unbelievable feeling I can't even describe. He's like Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   On this visit, Mandela came with new power as president of a
multiracial South Africa. He also came with his new wife, Gracia
Machel, the former wife of Mozambican leader Samora Machel. And he
comes with victories _ fulfilling his principal goal of ending
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he faces many problems, such as unemployment, poor
housing, an economic morass, and the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission's findings of widespread abuses against blacks during
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   But, some said, the visit to America, a country that once
thrived from the business of enslaving Africans, symbolized an
eloquent lesson on the perils of a system of racial separatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done something within South Africa that has been
carried over the rest of the world, following the politics of
inclusion, which means that he reached out to people that had been
his enemies, providing a model of leadership everywhere,'' said
Robert Rotberg, development associate at The Harvard Institute and
president of the World Peace foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela emphasized Friday an obligation among the most powerful
countries to share in intellectual and economic wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates, meanwhile, announced that
his W.E.B. DuBois Institute of Afro-American Research, is creating
a fellowship program, which will allow visiting African scholars to
study at Harvard as Mandela Fellows.
</P>
<P>
   The project coincides with the Emerging Africa research project,
housed in the Center for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   That project, Mandela said, ``will serve to strengthen and build
African intellectual capacity to take charge of its reconstruction
and regeneration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that it will also strengthen and build our own
understanding of African reality and your capacity to analyze that
reality as part of a shared world.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Nia Stephens watched from afar _ from the highest
step of Widener Library, more than 100 yards from where Mandela
stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised with the idea of Mandela as a hero,'' said
Stephens, a Tennessee native whose parents both attended Harvard
during the turbulent 1960s. ``I was awakened very early in the
morning by my parents to watch him walk out of prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens said: ``My heart was really warmed by the optimism of
his speech. To know that people with a history of trying to make a
difference are not cynical, that they can still be committed to a
cause.''

   JAPANESE PARTIES AGREE ON ECONOMIC STRATEGY
</P>
<P>
   Japan's governing party said that it had reached agreement with
the political opposition on how to bolster the jittery financial
system and begin reviving the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi ended
weeks of deadlock that had intensified criticism of Japan for
dithering over how to solve its problems as economic turmoil spread
to financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. CONSUMERS ARE STILL UPBEAT
</P>
<P>
   Since the financial troubles in Russia, the tumble in stock
prices in the United States and elsewhere and the release of
Kenneth Starr's report, consumers have turned only slightly more
cautious, according to a major poll of consumer attitudes. The
willingness of consumers to spend is viewed as good news for the
economy and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL BANK FREES RUBLE RESERVES
</P>
<P>
   Russia's central bank said that the country's insolvent banks
could use $1.65 billion in precious ruble reserves to enable them
to make good on customers' bills and debts that are going unpaid.
The government hopes that freeing up the reserves will grease the
wheels of the payment system and get financial activity moving
again.

   RIGHT TO SUE HMOS UPHELD
</P>
<P>
   A provision in a new Texas law allowing patients to sue

   SHAREHOLDERS BACK CHRYSLER MERGER
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler shareholders strongly endorsed forming a huge new

   PRESIDENT OF UAL STEPS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   John Edwardson, the president and chief operating officer of
UAL, the parent of United Airlines, resigned under pressure from

which opposed him as the eventual successor to Gerald Greenwald,
the chief executive, who is expected to retire next year.

   SEC DROPS INSIDER-TRADING CASE
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped a three-year
inquiry into accusations of insider trading by ICN Pharmaceuticals
and its chief executive, Milan Panic. But the SEC will start an
enforcement action against the company and Panic for failing to

   AMP BOLSTERS DEFENSE AGAINST BID
</P>
<P>
   AMP stepped up its defense against Allied Signal's hostile bid

STRANGE DAY ON THE STREET  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Strange things happened on Wall Street Friday. Prices
of both bonds and stocks rose.
</P>
<P>
   A bond rally pushed the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
closer to 5 percent, the lowest level for long-term government
yields in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly, this flight by investors to the Treasury's
safe harbor did not come at the expense of stock prices, as has
been the case recently. Instead, stocks rallied too, as the Dow
Jones industrial average inched up 21.89 points to recover part of
its 216-point slide Thursday. The broader Nasdaq index jumped 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it made for one of the calmest days on Wall Street
and in other markets in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for the American stock market _ weak corporate
earnings, a recession in Asia, the threat of one in Latin America
and the spillover into the United States _ all remain.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast of IBES International, which collects analysts'
earnings estimates, for third-quarter earnings of the companies
that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is now a decline of
1.1 percent, compared with the third quarter a year ago. That would
be the first quarterly drop in earnings since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Douglas Cliggott, the U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities, sees something positive. Earnings forecasts, which two
months ago were for 8 percent growth in the third quarter, have
come into line with reality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given no growth in earnings and the yield on the 30-year bond at
5.25 percent, he said the stock market is now about 9 percent
undervalued. ``That is a very good cushion for an uncertain
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow finished at 7,895.66, up 0.3 percent for the day and 1.3
percent for the week, while the Nasdaq index jumped 17.52 points,
to 1,663.77, up 1.1 percent for the day and 1.3 percent for the
week. The S&AMP;P 500 rose 1.22 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,020.09,
putting its gain for the week at 1.1 percent, while the Russell
index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks climbed 7.97 points, or 2.2
percent, to 363.26, finishing the week up 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second consecutive week that all the major indexes
have climbed, and this week's rally came despite the deflating
comments Wednesday from the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
Alan Greenspan, who told Congress that ``at the moment there is no
endeavor to coordinate interest rate cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the finance ministers of the Group of Seven,
which comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain,
Italy and Canada, and a speech Monday by President Clinton both
raised expectations of an immediate global rate cut to help
stabilize world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The rush of worried investors into the Treasury market, which
may have been accelerated by Greenspan's comments, is threatening
to drive the yield on the 30-year bond below 5 percent, to levels
that have not been seen for 30 years. Friday the yield fell to 5.14
percent, from 5.18 percent Thursday, while the price, which moves
in the opposite direction, rose 18/32, to 105 15/32.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, are still split over whether the 5 percent
barrier, which has stood for the entire careers of most traders on
Wall Street, will be breached. Kevin Flanagan, a money market
economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said it would take a
deepening of the present global financial crisis to bring yields
below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan argued that the Fed will not cut its short-term
interest rate target when policy makers meet Sept. 29 because there
is no clear sign yet that the American economy is slowing down
enough. But he is still forecasting a Fed move by the end of the
year, by which time he expects the appearance of clear signals that
the collapse of economies abroad has begun to sap growth here.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for home
mortgage rates, dropped to 4.69 percent, from 4.76 percent,
presaging a continuing decline in mortgage interest rates.
Thirty-year mortgage rates at 6.6 percent are now the lowest they
have been in about 30 years and should help stimulate the housing
market.
</P>
<P>
   But interest rates on mortgages and high-grade corporate debt
have not fallen nearly as much as Treasury yields, and the interest
rates on junk bonds have risen. Because of this, the stimulus to
the economy from lower government rates will be muted.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, N.Y. SENATE RACE GETS NASTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add 15 grafs at end)   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To listen to Rep. Charles Schumer in recent days,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato is a liar: an untrustworthy, out-of-touch,
Republican relic who is soft on crime and a promoter of higher
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to D'Amato, Schumer is a liar: an ambitious,
out-of-touch, liberal Brooklyn congressman who is soft on crime and
a promoter of higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   It has been just four days since Schumer began the third attempt
by the Democratic Party to remove D'Amato from the Senate. But
already _ in television advertisements and press conferences, in
speeches and interviews _ the competition between Schumer and
D'Amato has attained a level of invective that usually does not
arrive until a contest's final days.
</P>
<P>
   In an unmistakable signal of how the race is going to be played
during the next six weeks _ rough and on television _ D'Amato
demanded Friday afternoon that Schumer withdraw ``blatantly wrong''
advertisements that end with the memorably harsh tag line:
``D'Amato: too many lies for too long.'' Schumer laughed him off.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Democrats and Republicans familiar with the political
histories of D'Amato and Schumer, and aware of polls showing that
D'Amato's re-election is not assured, had eagerly anticipated this
competition. They expected it to be hard-fought, fast-paced and
engaging.
</P>
<P>
   But few expected it to be this hard-fought and this fast-paced
so soon, even though Schumer had promised that he would ``take it
to'' D'Amato if he won the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of ferocity, I don't think I've seen anything like
this since the 1993 mayoral race in New York,'' said Richard
Schrader, a political analyst. ``Schumer is defining himself as a
stronger candidate than any other candidate D'Amato has faced
before.''
</P>
<P>
   That these two, of all candidates in New York, have engaged so
quickly and intensely is, in many ways, not a surprise to
politicians here. But the fact that the campaign has struck a
negative tone so soon, particularly after a primary that was
noteworthy for its civility, was unexpected by Democrats and
Republicans alike.
</P>
<P>
   And in an era when voters are known to dislike negative
campaigns _ no matter how effective such tactics prove to be for
some candidates _ there was concern among many Democrats and
Republicans about the risks Schumer and D'Amato were taking in
starting their campaigns at this level.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign so far is a reflection of both the personalities of
the candidates and the constraints of the race. With so little time
between New York's late primary and the general election, it was
essential, Schumer's advisers said, to begin building the case
against D'Amato quickly and harshly. And since he has far less
money than D'Amato, he needed to do it in the light of news
coverage that accompanied his defeat of Geraldine Ferraro and Mark
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer needed to show Democrats that he had, as he promised
during his primary campaign, learned from the mistakes of Robert
Abrams, who waged a relatively anemic challenge to D'Amato in 1992.
So rather than disappearing from public view to raise money,
Schumer began his campaign with a two-day swing across the state,
framing his differences with D'Amato through the issues of
anticrime measures and fiscal moderation, seeking to undercut any
attempt to paint him as left of center.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, 12 hours after D'Amato went on the air attacking
Schumer as liberal _ ``Chuck Schumer's a New York City liberal and
he proves it every day,'' the announcer says, a reprise in tone and
timing of what D'Amato did in 1992 _ Schumer's advertising
consultant, Hank Morris, had pulled the trigger on advertisements
attacking D'Amato's truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising, to many Democrats, was the sharp tone of
the advertisements. Typically, a challenger begins a campaign by
presenting his biography and record. The use of the word ``liar''
is explosive, even by the standards of New York politics, and it
gave Schumer's supporters some pause Friday, concerned that he was
risking a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk, in that if this stuff becomes too personal, it
can backfire on you,'' said Bill Lynch, a Democrat, who managed
both mayoral campaigns for David Dinkins. ``I would have gotten
Chuck's voting record first and had him campaign personally in the
upstate areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Mahoney, a political adviser to D'Amato, asserted that
Schumer would be hurt by the advertisement, which he compared with
attacks Abrams made on the senator in 1992. ``Abrams got out with
half his reputation,'' Mahoney warned. ``Schumer is not going to
have any reputation left. He's been lying about his record while
he's attacking D'Amato for lying.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morris said he had no apologies. ``I don't think this is so
tough,'' he said. ``We always said that the first time
election-year Al D'Amato mentioned congressman Schumer's name, we
were going to react to it. He's just been lying to people too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato has been no less aggressive. He has barraged Schumer
during these last three days, issuing a list of votes that Schumer
missed this year in Congress, calling him a ``liberal Brooklyn
congressman'' at every turn. Friday, the campaign described Schumer
as ``a liar'' because he had described D'Amato as ``a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   The early attacks are typical of D'Amato. They are calculated,
one adviser said, to undermine Schumer's attempt to position
himself as a moderate, and to delay him from finding his campaign
footing.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of the assaults by both Schumer and D'Amato are a
matter of dispute.
</P>
<P>
   It is, Democrats acknowledged Friday, debatable that D'Amato's
advertisement, which accuses Schumer of voting for more welfare and
for tax increases and against some crime measures, actually rises
to the level of lying. As is typical in politics, D'Amato has
picked out some of Schumer's votes to try to present him in the
worst possible light.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the notion of Schumer as a liberal, as D'Amato has
taken to describing him, is one that would surely be challenged by
many liberals in New York. Schumer, in anticipation of a statewide
run, has spent much of the last decade establishing himself as
anything but liberal. He has sponsored a number of crime bills,
including a federal death penalty, and voted for legislation
restricting welfare benefits and for a law aimed at restricting
marriages between homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But senior aides to both candidates said there is little doubt
that the campaign is going to fly at this level for much of the
next six weeks. Anticipating the criticism that no doubt awaits
them, advisers to both Schumer and D'Amato went to some lengths to
deny that they were responsible for the tone the race has taken so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney asserted that Schumer had started it with advertisements
he ran this summer, which, among other things, presented D'Amato as
a Republican partisan who had supported cuts in Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Morris did Mahoney 18 years better. ``D'Amato went negative
first when he unfairly destroyed Jacob Javits,'' responded Morris,
soberly referring to D'Amato's defeat of the longtime senator in
the 1980 Republican primary.

<P>
   WASHINGTON Giving a sharp partisan cast to deliberations over
impeachment, the Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee
voted along party lines Friday to release the videotape of
President Clinton's grand jury testimony, along with 2,800 pages of
documents from the inquiry into his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The materials were set to be made public on Monday, promising to
a nation that would like the scandal to simply go away televised
replays of an angry and legalistic President Clinton jousting with
lawyers over the definition of sexual relations. Several members of
Congress protested the decision to make the material public on the
Jewish New Year.
</P>
<P>
   The party divide over the release of material erupted into the
open minutes after the committee ended its final two hours of
closed-door deliberations Friday morning. Rep. Henry Hyde, the
committee chairman, began to describe the committee's two days of
meetings as ``civil'' sessions in which the ``spirit of
bipartisanship is alive and flourishing.'' But he was quickly
interrupted by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to say that this is a new concept, unfortunately,
of unilateral bipartisanship,'' Frank said. ``Bipartisanship can't
be unilateral.'' He said virtually every vote taken across two days
of deliberations had been along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde retorted, ``I may have a different definition of
bipartisanship. It doesn't include surrender to every single
Democrat's wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the four-hour videotape of Clinton, the documents to be
released add further detail to the report by Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, who accused the president of 11
acts that might constitute impeachable offenses. The documents
include FBI interviews with Ms. Lewinsky, her own testimony before
the grand jury and her proffer to Starr, outlining what her
testimony would be.
</P>
<P>
   The committee did agree to make about 120 deletions from the
materials on the grounds of sexual explicitness, national security
or privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the two days of debate in the ideologically polarized
committee was taken up with wrangling over things like whether the
committee should be meeting in public and the level of sexual
detail that would be made public. The closed-door deliberations
were followed by dueling news conferences, first by Democrats, then
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings of the House Judiciary Committee are the first
since the Watergate scandal in 1974 at which the House has
considered whether to open an impeachment inquiry into a president.
And the deliberations are taking place in an atmosphere made more
tense by recent news reports on sexual indiscretions on the part of
three Republican members of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said Hyde telephoned Speaker Newt Gingrich
earlier in the week and offered to relinquish his role in the
investigation after the online magazine Salon reported that he had
had an extramarital affair 30 years ago. Gingrich, however, gave
Hyde his full support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Speaker did not consider the resignation because there is
no person who has earned more respect and affection from the House
than Hyde,'' said Christina Martin, a spokeswoman for Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to ease some of the fears sweeping Congress, Sens. Mitch
McConnell and Bob Kerrey, the chairmen of the Republican and
Democratic Senate campaign committees, respectively, followed the
lead of their House counterparts and pledged in the Senate Friday
not to finance candidates who make personal attacks against
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digging through their record is one thing,'' said McConnell, a
Kentucky Republican. ``Digging through their garbage is quite
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The partisan acrimony over the release of Starr's materials has
grown since last week when Gingrich and Rep. Richard Gephardt, the
House minority leader, pledged to work cooperatively. The House
then voted 363 to 63 to make public Starr's report and backup
materials after scrutiny by the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the panel said Friday that they were carrying out
the will of the full House for maximum public disclosure and that
the documents would make clear whether Starr's report had put the
president's testimony in proper context. They also said that the
panel's Democrats were ideologues who are not representative of
their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent, maybe 70 percent of our colleagues on the
other side had a hard time accepting the mandate of the House,''
said Rep. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the panel.
``Whether that's a partisan fight I don't know. I feel we lived up
to the mandate of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said, ``There was a general view among the Democrats not to
reveal anything and there was a general view among Republicans to
reveal as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's Democrats accused the Republicans of trying to keep
up a steady stream of information embarrassing the president,
instead of releasing it at once on the Sept. 28 deadline for the
committee to have reviewed all the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to dribble out information for only one reason:
death by a thousand cuts,'' said Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla.

 WASHINGTON: Wexler, D-Fla.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His remarks were echoed by the White House. ``This appears to be
a rush to prejudgment and an effort to get out the most salacious
material at the speed of light, not at the proper pace of
justice,'' said James Kennedy, a White House spokesman. ``But in
the end it will have to be the American people who will have to see
if this indeed has been a fair process or a partisan effort to
embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee, the
Democrats had virtually no chance of prevailing on any vote, but
they did create a record across two days of roll call votes to show
the American public which party was voting to release the explicit
details of Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat on the committee who
just won his party's nomination to challenge Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato, was absent.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the votes ran along party lines from the moment the
session began on Thursday and the committee voted 21 to 15 against
a motion by Frank to make the meeting open to the public. Friday
the Republicans pushed through the motions for release of the
videotape and of 2,800 pages of transcripts and materials, in two
party line votes of 20 to 15.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said some Republicans Friday
morning initially voted against a motion by one of their Republican
colleagues to make the 17 roll call votes public but switched when
it became clear that the majority of the committee favored public
release of the roll calls. In the end seven Republicans continued
to oppose release of the roll calls.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the wrangling concerned sexually explicit materials. The
committee's Republican and Democratic staff members had drawn up a
list of 120 deletions to be made from the released materials.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., succeeded in having three of those
deletions, describing a particular sexual act, restored to the
public record. Rep. Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who is a
former federal prosecutor, broke with his party and voted against
Barr.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats tried but failed to win 27 additional deletions,
covering Ms. Lewinsky's description of phone sex with the
president, his manner of undressing her and other explicit sexual
details of their encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Bob Inglis of South Carolina, was
defeated 28 to 6 when he tried to amend a public log that will cite
the reasons for deletions. In this one case, he wanted the log to
include a graphic description of the sexual act contained in the
material that was being deleted. Five Republicans voted with him.
</P>
<P>
   Although some Republicans voiced concerns this week that the
release of more sexually explicit materials could boomerang against
their party, the Republicans on the committee Friday said last
week's House vote had carried the presumption of more openness, not
less.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he feared a public backlash, Rep. Stephen Buyer,
R-Ind., said, ``Well, maybe you should ask the question, `Will
there be a backlash against Democrats who seek to act like criminal
defense lawyers.'''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If someone doesn't want to watch this then don't
watch it. We have the responsibility to move this into the public
domain and give the president of the United States the benefit of
the doubt.''

U.S. SOLHEIM TEAM'S FAST START HAS EUROPE UP THE CREEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ From Friday's first match at the Solheim Cup, the
United States took command and left Europe playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Pepper and Juli Inkster set the tone by opening play with
a convincing victory. Kelly Robbins made a 5-foot putt on the 18th
hole that gave the United States a 3-1 lead heading into the
afternoon. Pat Hurst, playing like a cup veteran instead of a
rookie, was part of two victories. And Brandie Burton, despite
falling into a creek at No. 11, brushed herself off and went on to
win, making an embarrassing moment part of a satisfying afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Friday's first round had ended, the European team
was in trouble. The United States ended the day with a 5{-2{ lead
at Muirfield Village Golf Club, the largest first-day lead in
Solheim Cup history, and appeared well on the way to successfully
defending the cup. As the defending champion, the United States
needs 14 points to retain the cup, while Europe needs 14{ points to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Europe can take heart from the 1996 cup, when the United States
jumped to a 5-3 lead after the first day, only to see Europe storm
back for a 9-7 lead after Day 2. But the United States ultimately
won in 1996, 17-11, and a 3-point deficit today was not the start
Europe had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off to a horrible start,'' said Laura Davies, one of
Europe's top players, who managed just half a point in her two
matches. ``We lost by 3 points today, so we have to win by 3 points
tomorrow. That should be our goal. But no matter, it's not over,
but until they get 14 points, we won't give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe cannot afford to fall further behind before Sunday's
singles matches. The United States has an overwhelming 18-4 record
in singles play during the last two Solheim Cups, making a Sunday
rally by Europe unlikely. That puts extreme pressure on Europe to
play well Saturday, and it will be interesting to see how the team
captain, Pia Nilsson, maneuvers her lineup. Most of what Nilsson
tried Friday did not work as she had hoped, while Judy Rankin, the
American captain, saw her team perform steadily.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning foursome matches, Pepper and Inkster opened with
a convincing 3 and 1 victory over Davies and Trish Johnson. Nilsson
took a chance opening with Johnson, who has been bothered by a neck
injury, and Johnson did not play well. Nilsson may also regret not
playing Liselotte Neumann, one of the world's top players, Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam and Catriona Matthew scored the lone morning
point for Europe, defeating Donna Andrews and Tammie Green, 3 and
2. But the most dramatic morning matches both went in the United
States' favor, when Hurst and Robbins defeated Lisa Hackney and
Neumann, 1 up, while Burton and Meg Mallon rallied from a two-hole
deficit through nine holes to defeat Helen Alfredsson and Alison
Nicholas, 3 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon four-ball matches, Betsy King and Chris Johnson
of the United States halved with Charlotta Sorenstam and Davies;
Hurst and Rose Jones dominated Hackney and Sophie Gustafson, 7 and
5; Alfredsson and Maria Laure de Lorenzi defeated Robbins and
Sherri Steinhauer, 2 and 1, and Pepper and Burton defeated Annika
Sorenstam and Catrin Nilsmark, 2 up.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon highlights included de Lorenzi making a bunker
shot from 25 feet on No. 17 to end her match and earn a key point
for Europe. Then there was Burton's tumble into the creek at No.
11. Standing on the bank, Burton lost her balance on her
follow-through and tried to jump over the creek, but her right shoe
became stuck in the mud. Down went Burton, her right leg covered in
mud, and her right shoe came off after it was stuck in the mud.
Fortunately, she was not injured, and afterward her teammates could
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was classic,'' Pepper said. ``I go on record as saying
they should rename that Burton's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's morning foursome matches will feature Annika
Sorenstam and Matthew against Andrews and Steinhauer; Davies and
Charlotta Sorenstam vs. Burton and Mallon; Alfredsson and Laure de
Lorenzi vs. Inkster and Pepper, and Neumann and Nilsmark vs. Hurst
and Robbins.  &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: METS FIND WINNING CURES ALL ILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets' clubhouse doors opened Friday afternoon and
the reporters thundering in were greeted with a loud cheer from the
Mets' players. The cheers weren't for the news media. They were for
Reggie Sanders, whose home run had just given Cincinnati a one-run
lead over the Chicago Cubs in their game at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   The roar subsided and the Mets started to prepare for their game
last evening with the Florida Marlins. But now there was a
clubhouse-wide groan: the Cubs' pitcher, Steve Trachsel, had
singled. Then there was a louder groan as Sanders misplayed a fly
ball that allowed a run to score. Later, Turk Wendell, a Mets'
relief pitcher, spotted another Reds fielding error on television
as he was having an impromptu chat with reporters. That was too
much for Wendell, who suddenly yelled, ``Pick it up with your bare
hand, moron!''
</P>
<P>
   This is what the roller-coaster clubhouse atmosphere of a fight
for the final playoff spot feels like. At certain junctures of the
season, the Mets seemed uncertain where they fit; indeed, whether
they belonged at all with playoff-caliber teams, or were still in
that infernal period of growth.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Mets find themselves running right with the Cubs and
Sammy Sosa in a desperate battle to be the National League
wild-card team. The controversy that dominated the team in
midseason _ the trade for Mike Piazza, the unhappiness of Todd
Hundley _ has been overwhelmed by the chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an open wound and now it's starting to heal,'' said
Lenny Harris, the Mets' right fielder. ``Everybody's starting to
contribute. Nobody's worrying about what's happening here or there;
everybody knows they have a job to do to help this ball club win.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it amazing what winning can do for a relationship? Three
months ago, Hundley felt estranged from his team. Meanwhile,
Piazza, who started the season as a Dodger, then became a Marlin
and then a Met, was being jeered by fans who viewed him as a
mercenary and didn't appreciate all the outs he was making with
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Tony Phillips, who at 39 had one foot out of
baseball for half the season before suddenly returning and ending
up as the Mets' leadoff hitter. Now, with a little more than a week
to go in the season, Piazza, Hundley and Phillips are catalysts for
a surge that could push the Mets into the playoffs for the first
time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning makes it a lot more fun to come to the ball park,''
Hundley said before last night's game. ``It makes it a lot more
relaxed around the clubhouse when you're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has been through a lot this year and has lost a lot. But
a playoff surge turns winning players into good soldiers. Hundley
had surgery in the off season, saw his catching spot filled by
Piazza while he was still rehabilitating, saw a hail of fly balls
in an experiment in left field that ended in ruins. He has watched
the Mets prosper and has seen himself reduced to a backup at
catcher and a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get this close you don't want to mess it up,'' he
said. ``You don't want anybody to mess it up. So you've got to take
on a different mentality, a different attitude. Team is everything
and your personal stuff doesn't matter: sacrifice, get the guy
over, get the guy in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning answers a lot of questions and stops a lot of
questions,'' Hundley added. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, who began his major league career 17 years ago, said
that a transformation has taken place in the Mets' clubhouse that
went beyond winning or losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can win and still have a screwed-up clubhouse,'' said
Phillips. ``The Yankees won for a lot of years, had great teams,
but they didn't have a good clubhouse so they didn't win back in
the 80's. This is a special clubhouse. I hadn't been in a clubhouse
like this since I left Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of caring here. Everybody's calling each other
out, keeping each other in check . . . that type of thing. The club
is policing itself without a lot of animosity. Everybody in this
clubhouse is on the same level from Mike Piazza, who is in a league
by himself, to the lowest guy on the totem pole.''
</P>
<P>
   So each Met is talking team. In a climate of free agency, with
uncertainty and little loyalty, pragmatism ultimately takes over.
But not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wintertime is when this business turns into a $2
billion-a-year industry,''' Hundley said. ``That's when you got to
think about business. Right now, it's baseball. Play baseball, win,
get to the finish line. That's the bottom line. There have been
guys playing 20 years that don't get this close. When you're having
this kind of year, you don't want to mess it up, you want to treat
it like a diamond, like a baby. You want to take care of it.'' &QL;

LOOKING BACK, '98 LOOKS SPECIAL INDEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire has retired to a house on a golf course he
designed, complete with a 360-yard par 3 and Andro Shots at the
19th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Cute little Matt McGwire has grown up, died his hair blue,
pierced a nostril and become spokesman for the anti-logging
movement, rejecting his father's achievements as ``lumber abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa has been elected president of the Dominican Republic
and overthrown by Jose Offerman, but shrugs it off in typical Sosa
good humor, saying, ``When it comes to being overthrown by
Offerman, Eric Karros is still The Man.''
</P>
<P>
   And the battle over Sosa home-run ball No. 62 is going to the
U.S. Supreme Court, where the swing vote is to be cast by Chief
Justice Fehr, an appointee of President Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   When baseball's legion of historians look back at the 1998
season, how will they view it? As a quaint, innocent summer, to be
sure, one feel-good hit after another.
</P>
<P>
   As the greatest baseball season of them all? Oh, yeah, that too.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, considering it has produced only one close
division race _ and that American League West race might be (begin
ital)lost(end ital) by the Angels rather than (begin ital)won(end
ital) by the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, considering that in a year of further
expansion, under the most objective examination, the actual quality
of the average major-league ballplayer might be the lowest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, considering it began with the sport's
executives still fretting over the effects of the 1994 World Series
cancellation and embarrassed by the sell-off of the 1997 World
Series champion Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we should revise our standards.
</P>
<P>
   As difficult as this might be to appreciate in Los Angeles, this
season has made more people across the country happy than any I can
remember. McGwire and Sosa have only been part of it.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees will fall short of the 1906 Chicago Cubs'
116 victories, but by posting the major leagues' highest winning
percentage in 44 years with a team pleasantly devoid of superstars,
even the Yankees have been hard to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Cubs and the Boston Red Sox _ insert
``long-suffering'' in this sentence wherever you wish _ expect to
see both teams in postseason play for the first time since Boston's
Carl Mays outdueled Chicago's Lefty Tyler in game 6 of the 1918
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual continuity is demonstrated in the club standings, with
all six divisions led by 1996 or '97 division winners, and in the
individual leaderboard, where the right people are in front _ Ken
Griffey Jr., Juan Gonzalez, Alex Rodriguez, Roger Clemens, Larry
Walker, Tom Glavine, Kevin Brown, Greg Maddux, Curt Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention... the Randy Johnson resurrection... the Dennis
Eckersley farewell tour... the unanticipated fan-friendliness of
players who finally seem to (begin ital)get it(end ital)... and the
Dodgers' tumult, which has inspired greater mirth around the
country than L.A. fans will ever understand.
</P>
<P>
   And Cal Ripken Jr. is still going. Remember when he was the
single point of light in the baseball darkness?
</P>
<P>
   Now the darkness envelops the NFL, belted off its accustomed
place at the top of the sports pages on the first two Mondays of
the football season, and the NBA, should it still exist.
</P>
<P>
   You can compare one year to the next in baseball. The biggest
reason is that you can (begin ital)distinguish(end ital) one year
from the next.
</P>
<P>
   Try it in basketball: I say ``1979.'' Do you think of the year
of Dennis Johnson and the Seattle SuperSonics or the year of Magic
Johnson and the bearhug he threw around a stunned Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar on opening night? Same year, different seasons. Try it
in football: I say ``Heidi.'' That was 1968. I say ``Joe Namath.''
That was the 1969 _ Super Bowl III. Same season, different years.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans don't need Roman numerals. I say, ``1968,'' you
think, ``pitching.'' I say, ``1978,'' you think, ``Bob Welch and
Reggie Jackson.'' I say, ``1988,'' you think, ``shoe polish and
Kirk Gibson.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward a decade.
</P>
<P>
   I say, ``1998.'' You say, ``Still the greatest.''

TESTAVERDE KNEW THIS MIGHT HAPPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ For months, Vinny Testaverde has believed that
at some point this season he would become the Jets' starting
quarterback _ either because of his ability or because of the real
possibility that Glenn Foley would be injured. After all, almost a
third of the National Football League's 30 starting quarterbacks
have already missed some playing time.
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be a step closer to reality Friday as signs
continued to point to Testaverde's making his Jets debut at
quarterback against the Colts on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Foley has also practiced this week despite having painful torn
rib cartilage, but his effectiveness concerns Coach Bill Parcells.
Asked Friday about the lingering question of Foley's durability (he
had season-ending injuries in 1995 and last year), Parcells said:
``This isn't a test for Glenn Foley. His reputation has no effect
on me. Look, he doesn't want to be in this situation. I don't want
him to be in this situation. But he's in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who helped bring back the 1994 and 1996 New England
teams from an 0-2 start into the playoffs, must also make his
decision based on a league rule that is strict in limiting the play
of the third quarterback. Teams are permitted to dress two
quarterbacks and designate a third as an emergency. But if the
third quarterback comes in at any point before the fourth quarter,
then neither of the first two quarterbacks may return to the game
in any capacity. This rule is designed to allow a team to add an
extra man to the 46-man roster _ but only as the third quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is compounded for the Jets this week because
Parcells wants to use the Jets' third-string quarterback, Ray
Lucas, in his more prominent role as a fine special-teams
performer. Thus, Lucas has been listed as the No. 2 quarterback,
which has permitted him to play on the specials.
</P>
<P>
   But if Foley starts, then Parcells has said he would have to
list Testaverde as the second quarterback _ essentially taking
Lucas out of the game. In any event, Parcells said he would dress
all three quarterbacks on Sunday. But at this point it appears that
Foley will be the designated third quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Parcells admits that this has been an awful week for
him, after starting the season 0-2. ``You don't know whether you'll
ever win a game,'' he said. ``You stay at home. You go in the back
door of a restaurant so people don't see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity on Board for Colts
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning, the Colts' $48 million rookie quarterback, has
become such a larger-than-life figure in Indianapolis that the
team's president, Bill Polian, clears all of his speaking
engagements. The club's public relations department has been in
touch with the Broncos and Dolphins to determine how they handle
their celebrity quarterbacks, John Elway and Dan Marino. Some other
elements that make Manning, this year's overall No. 1 draft pick,
unusual:
</P>
<P>
   _ He is the Colts' 17th starting quarterback since they drafted
Elway in 1983 but were unsuccessful in signing him. Elway forced a
trade to the Broncos. Since the Broncos got Elway, only five other
quarterbacks have started for Denver.
</P>
<P>
   _ Manning attracted many fans who made the six-hour drive from
his college town of Knoxville, Tenn., to see his debut in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   _ Manning has the most interceptions in the NFL, six, after
having been the least-intercepted quarterback in Division I
history. He is being picked off once every 12 passes, compared to
once every 42 attempts at the University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Byars Starts at Fullback
</P>
<P>
   Keith Byars will return as the Jets' starting fullback for two
reasons: Jerald Sowell has been ineffective blocking for running
back Curtis Martin, and the team needs Sowell on kicking coverage.
It is part of the domino effect created by the loss of linebackers
Marvin Jones (for the season) and James Farrior (for at least two
games).
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major issues a lot of people don't understand is
that their loss has made us a little slower,'' Bill Parcells said.

   The oil billionaire DAVIDKOCH took the wraps off his newly
redecorated Fifth Avenue apartment, formerly owned by JACKIE
ONASSIS. And, the guest of honor was _ GEORGE BUSH. In rooms where
CAROLINE and JOHN JR. once played, Wall Streeters and former
Republican officials sipped Chateau Margaux and dined Friday on
gold-leaf china to honor one of Bush's favorite charities, the M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Tanned and fit, Bush asked:
``What do you do when you used to be president with the rest of
your life?'' His answer: ``Plug my causes,'' including charities
where ``I'm a big deal now.'' JOHN HENNESSY, chairman of CS First
Boston, and LIZ TILBERIS, editor of Harper's Bazaar, attended the
event as did BOB MOSBACHER, a former Commerce secretary; WALTER
CURLEY, a former ambassador to France, and JOSEPH ZAPPALA, a former
ambassador to Spain. Koch, who paid $9.5 million for the apartment
and spent three years redecorating it, quipped: ``If I knew what
Jackie's possessions would fetch at Sotheby's, I would have taken
the place furnished.''

   CHARLES B. WANG, the chief executive of Computer Associates, has
been under fire since May, when he and two aides were paid 20.25
million shares of the company, based in Islandia, N.Y. The stock
was worth $1.1 billion, but the price fell 30 percent a few days
later. Now the three executives and four company directors face a
novel accusation in Delaware Chancery Court.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Sanders, a shareholder, says the plan that shareholders
approved in 1995 authorizing up to six million shares for Wang and
the executives SANJAY KUMAR and RUSSELL M. ARTZT had no provision
to adjust for stock splits. The suit reasons that awards made after
1995 must be on presplit terms, and demands 9.5 million shares
back.
</P>
<P>
   So did Wang make a costly goof that will force him to give back
nearly half of his 12.15 million shares? Not according to Bob

COUNTDOWN TO BREEDERS' CUP PITS HORSES IN BIG RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty of the best race horses in the country will
gather at Belmont Park on Saturday for three races _ the Woodward
Stakes, the Ruffian and the Jerome _ in a countdown to the
Breeders' Cup that will match contenders against champions. And, in
a sequel Sunday, 11 star 2-year-olds will meet in two Grade I
stakes _ the Matron and the Futurity _ that will cast long shadows
into next year's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's stakes are dominated by the small but
distinguished cast entered in the 45th running of the Woodward, a
Grade I event billed as ``the race of the year'' with a purse of
$500,000 and a field of five running one mile and an eighth. The
favorite is Skip Away, the gray champion who has earned $9.2
million and who enters the race with a winning streak of eight. He
has not lost in a year since Formal Gold outran him in the 44th
Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   But Skip Away will be racing for the 36th time in a career that
has run nonstop for four years, and the experts keep looking for
signs of wear. In his last start, he ran with damaged front feet in
the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park last month and won by a nose
in a race that he was expected to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through all of that and still kept winning,'' said
Sonny Hine, who trains Skip Away for his wife, Carolyn. ``That's
how tough a horse he is.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Woodward, Skip Away will have to withstand a dream field
of Free House, who ran in the money in all three races in last
year's Triple Crown; Gentlemen, who has won $3 million, and
Coronado's Quest, the 3-year-old son of Forty Niner, who has won
his last five starts, including the Wood, Haskell and Travers. The
fifth starter is the English 4-year-old Running Stag, described by
his trainer, Frank Mitchell, as ``the best dirt horse in the United
Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ruffian Handicap, the race that precedes the Woodward, has a
field of nine fillies racing a mile and a sixteenth for a purse of
$250,000. It also comes with a superstar: Sharp Cat, the 4-year-old
daughter of Storm Cat, who won the Acorn at Belmont last year and
has won three straight this year since running second in the
Breeders' Cup Distaff.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Cat's chief rivals figure to be Stop Traffic, who won the
Ballerina at Saratoga last month, and Colonial Minstrel, who got
roughed up in the starting gate and finished fifth, although she
won five in a row earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of horses that may go with her,'' said
Wally Dollase, Sharp Cat's trainer. ``But that will just push her
on and make her more competitive. She's thriving here. I've never
seen her eat so well. Her coat looks nice, she loves Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   The day's third stakes race, the 130th running of the Jerome
Handicap, will take six 3-year-old colts one mile, most of which
may be spent trying to catch Secret Firm, who will be running for
his seventh straight victory. But his tactical speed will be
challenged by Scatmandu, Dice Dancer and Grand Slam, who won the
Futurity, Champagne and Peter Pan over the Belmont track.
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the dispute over in-home betting seemed to be in a
stare-down. The New York Racing Association, which stopped sending
television pictures of its races to the homes of Off-Track Betting
clients in New York City on July 22, was waiting for the next move
by the city OTB, which on Thursday won permission to bring in races
from out of state. But, there has been no action from the NYRA,
which could also pull the plug on OTB offices.

GEROLD FRANK, 91, AUTHOR OF CELEBRITY MEMOIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio, N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gerold Frank, a pioneer of the contemporary literary form of the
as-told-to celebrity biography, died Sept. 17 at the Logan Square
East Retirement Community in Philadelphia. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also wrote such well-reviewed books as ``The Boston
Strangler,'' which was made into a movie with Tony Curtis, and ``An
American Death,'' about the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But to some extent, those books were overshadowed by his
reputation as a ghostwriter for a succession of famous women. He
collaborated with Mike Connolly and the singer Lillian Roth on her
memoir, ``I'll Cry Tomorrow,'' which was made into a movie with
Susan Hayward, and with the gossip columnist Sheilah Graham on
``Beloved Infidel,'' the story of her relationship with F. Scott
Fitzgerald in Hollywood. That too became a movie, starring Gregory
Peck and Deborah Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also collaborated with Diana Barrymore on ``Too Much, Too
Soon,'' and with Zsa Zsa Gabor, on ``My Story.'' He was the author
of ``Judy,'' a biography of Judy Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Frank said in an interview in Life magazine in 1959 that he
thought ``the humiliations and yearnings of women are more dramatic
to us than those of men.'' He was so successful at the as-told-to
form, he said, that drunks and madmen implored him to write their
biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Barrymore said in the Life article that telling her story
to Frank made her feel that ``I have been reborn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him things I wouldn't have told a priest,'' she said.
``He was always there, like a sponge. I lied to him, and I am a
brilliant liar. But he'd know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same article, Zsa Zsa Gabor said she revealed to Frank
``more than I would ever tell a psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank always took his work seriously and never mocked the
travails of his famous subjects. ``I went around asking myself:
What could it be like to throw your life away? To actually,
literally roll in the gutter? To abandon hope?'' he said in Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or to know the ecstasy that most of us never know: to be
transfigured by love?' I had to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   He inhabited his subjects like a dybbuk, spending weeks
interviewing them and meticulously researching their lives.
</P>
<P>
   He also ghostwrote so many different books without credit that
his son, Dr. John L. Frank, said he was not sure how many his
father had produced. There were at least 17.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when his father had ghostwritten a book, said Dr.
Frank, there would be only an acknowledgment at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Frank was born in 1907 in Cleveland, where his father was a
tailor and owned a dress shop. After graduating from Ohio State
University he moved to New York's Greenwich Village, hoping to
become a poet.
</P>
<P>
   He failed at that, and got a job as a newspaperman in Cleveland.
He published pieces in The New Yorker and The Nation, and returned
to New York, working for The Journal-American.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934 Frank made a film about the lives of his parents and of
his wife, Lillian, in a Polish shtetl. It included rare scenes of
the Warsaw Ghetto, which he later donated to the Yivo Institute for
Jewish Research.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, who lived in an apartment on Fifth Avenue for 25 years
until he moved to a retirement home in Philadelphia in 1995, is
survived by his wife and son, both of Philadelphia; a daughter, Amy
Rosenblum of Richmond, Va.; a sister, Ethel Kaufman of Coconut
Creek, Fla.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Frank also wrote extensively about the lives of Jews of Eastern
Europe before the Holocaust. During World War II, he worked as a
war correspondent in the Middle East, and he collaborated on
Bartley Crum's ``Behind the Silken Curtain,'' an account of the
work of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine, which
was instrumental in the founding of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote about Israel again in ``The Deed,'' an account of the
assassination of the British diplomat Lord Moyne. He won an Edgar
from the Mystery Writers of America for the work, which was
published in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Frank won a second Edgar for ``The Boston Strangler'' (1966).
The New York Times called the book ``compulsively readable'' and
praised Frank for underplaying his sensational story.

GEORGE DANIELSON, 83; URGED NIXON'S REMOVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Neb.)  (js) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George E. Danielson, a California congressman who urged the
impeachment of President Richard Nixon in 1974, died of heart
failure on Sept. 12. He was 83 and lived in Monterey Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   During his 12 years in the House, Danielson became known
nationwide for the wit, brevity and dead-on accuracy of his
comments.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to obtain information from John Mitchell, the attorney
general in the Nixon administration who later became the head of
Nixon's re-election effort, the California Democrat said, was
``like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He made that remark in 1974, while sitting on the House
Judiciary Committee that was considering whether to begin
impeachment proceedings against Nixon. This was the heaviest and
most burdensome responsibility of his career, he said later.
Perhaps it was the sobering drama of the task that inspired his
eloquent descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   In calling for the removal of Nixon, Danielson made what an
article in The New York Times said at the time was ``the most
forceful argument'' for the abuse of power article of impeachment.
Nixon resigned before the full House could consider the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offenses charged against the president in this article are
uniquely presidential offenses,'' he said. ``No one else can commit
them. You or I, the most lowly citizen, can obstruct justice. You
or I, the most lowly citizen, can violate any of the statutes in
our criminal code. But only the president can violate the oath of
office of the president. Only the president can abuse the powers of
the office of president.''
</P>
<P>
   Before being elected to represent the 30th Congressional
District in 1970, Danielson was a state assemblyman and senator, an
agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and an assistant U.S.
attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Danielson earned a law degree from the University of Nebraska,
his home state. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he
started his own law firm before his election to the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, after 20 years in politics, Danielson resigned from the
House to accept an appointment to the California Court of Appeals.
He retired in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Danielson is survived by his wife of 45 years, Gladys, and a
sister, Sarah Danielson.

BIOLOGICAL WARFARE: MAYBE NOT QUITE AS OLD AS GOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it started with Moses. The biblical story of Exodus
mentions 10 plagues God inflicted on the Egyptians for the
pharaoh's refusal to free the Jews from slavery: blood, frogs,
vermin, flies, murrain, boils, hail, locusts, darkness and the
slaying of the first-born.
</P>
<P>
   Modern biology, which in the last century has produced almost
miraculous cures for some of man's most intractable diseases, now
may be harnessed to produce an ``Eleventh Plague,'' an image that
political scientist Leonard Cole seized upon in his book exploring
the politics of biological and chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike chemical and even nuclear arms, those other weapons of
mass destruction, biological agents are living weapons. And
although technology is making the creation of ever more deadly
strains possible, the idea of using germs in warfare has a long
history.
</P>
<P>
   Though historians and biologists dispute some of the more famous
stories linked to biological weapons in war, including some
biblical accounts of plagues and pandemics, the list of historical
attempts at such use is impressive. Here are a few of the more
celebrated cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical Management of Biological Casualties,'' a handbook
issued in 1996 by the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases at Fort Detrick, Md., says that two of the earliest
reported uses of biological weapons in war occurred in the sixth
century B.C. when the Assyrians poisoned enemy wells with rye ergot
(a fungus disease), and Solon used the purgative herb hellebore
during the siege of Krissa.
</P>
<P>
   Fomites, or objects that harbor and can transmit disease, have
been used deliberately to transmit disease since antiquity, said
another group of scientists from Fort Detrick, writing in an August
1997 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   They say that modern attempts to ``weaponize'' deadly biological
toxins like botulin and ricin were anticipated by aboriginal South
Americans with neolithic technology who used curare and
amphibian-derived toxins as arrow poisons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1346, during the siege of Kaffa, now Feodossia in Ukraine,
the attacking Tatar army had an epidemic of plague. The scientists
argue in the medical association journal that the Tatars,
``attempting to convert their misfortune into an opportunity,''
catapulted the corpses of plague victims over Kaffa's city walls,
touching off a plague among the inhabitants that eventually forced
them to surrender. Some infected people (and possibly
plague-infected rats as well) who left Kaffa, sailing off to
Constantinople, Genoa, Venice and other Mediterranean ports, may
have contributed to starting the Black Death pandemic that spread
through Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries, killing a
substantial percentage of the population.
</P>
<P>
   In 1710, Russian troops may also have used what the scientists
called the old ``plague-infected corpse tactic'' against Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox has long been a germ of choice among biowarriors. In
the 15th century, Pizarro is reported to have presented South
American natives with variola-contaminated clothing. The English
apparently did the same during the French and Indian War in
1754-67. According to the medical journal article, Sir Jeffrey
Amherst, commander of the British forces in North America,
suggested that smallpox be used to reduce American Indian tribes
hostile to Britain, and on June 24, 1763, Captain Ecuyer, one of
Amherst's aides, gave blankets and a handkerchief from the smallpox
hospital to the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will have the desired effect,'' he noted in his
journal. It apparently did, though the scientists argue that cause
and effect are uncertain since smallpox epidemics had been
occurring among Indians for more than 200 years after initial
contacts with Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century discoveries of modern microbiology led to
technological breakthroughs in biowarfare, especially the ability
to isolate and produce stocks of specific pathogens, or deadly
germs. World War I provided ample opportunities to use them.
</P>
<P>
   There is substantial evidence, say the scientists in the journal
article, that Germany developed an ambitious biological warfare
program and that German agents inoculated horses and cattle with
glanders in the United States before the animals were shipped to
France. The Bucharest Institute of Bacteriology and Pathology
identified germ cultures that were confiscated from the German
Legation in Romania in 1916 as B. anthracis and B. mallei.
</P>
<P>
   And German agents operating allegedly used Burkholderia mallei
in Mesopotamia to inoculate 4,500 mules and in France to infect the
French cavalry's horses.
</P>
<P>
   The use of chemical and biological weapons in World War I caused
public revulsion and helped bring about the 1925 Geneva Protocol,
which prohibited the use of germ or chemical weapons in warfare.
But the protocol did not ban basic research, production or
possession of such agents, and many countries that signed the
accord specifically preserved the right to retaliate if they were
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   While Germany tried to develop biological weapons in World War
II, the only known German use of them then was ``the pollution of a
reservoir in northwestern Bohemia with sewage in May 1945,''
according to the Fort Detrick scientists. Japan, however, used a
series of germ weapons on a vast scale, especially against
prisoners in Manchuria from 1932 until the end of World War II.
Thousands of prisoners died after being infected with B. anthracis,
meningitidis, shigella and yersinia pestis, to name but a few.
Japan also dropped germ-filled bombs, feathers and cotton wadding
from its fighter planes, infecting thousands more in at least 11
Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's program was huge, encompassing 150 buildings, 5
satellite camps and more than 3,000 scientists and technicians,
according to the Fort Detrick scientists. As many as 15 million
plague-infected fleas were released from aircraft during each
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and the United States both launched large offensive
biological warfare programs in the early 1940s, but Washington,
unlike Moscow, unilaterally abandoned all offensive biological and
toxin weapon research and production in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   By 1972, all stockpiles of biological agents and munitions were
destroyed. In 1972, the United States became a party to a treaty
outlawing the development, possession and stockpiling of germs and
toxins for offensive purposes. But so did Iraq and Russia, both of
which continued to produce germs to be turned into weapons until at
least 1990.

SYBIL HARRINGTON, 89, SUPPORTER OF OPERA AND MEDICAL CHARITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.Y., Texas)  (js) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sybil Harrington, a philanthropist from Amarillo, Texas, who,
besides supporting medical, education and arts charities, was the
largest individual donor to the Metropolitan Opera in the company's
history, died on Thursday in Phoenix, where she kept a winter home.
She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Grand opera was her passion, Mrs. Harrington once told an
interviewer from Town and Country magazine. ``It's all there _
beautiful sets, great costumes, great music,'' she said. ``What
more could you want?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Harrington liked her grand opera grand. Other patrons
could back productions of Berg's ``Wozzeck'' and Britten's ``Peter
Grimes.'' Her tastes went to Verdi, Puccini, Wagner and Mozart. She
made possible some of the Met's most lavish and popular
productions, like Franco Zeffirelli's ``Boheme,'' ``Tosca'' and
``Turandot'' and Otto Schenk's ``Meistersinger.'' She financed 16
new productions in total, most recently the Elijah Moshinsky
production of Verdi's ``Otello'' introduced in the 1993-94 season.
She also supported 13 ``Metropolitan Opera Presents'' television
broadcasts, and provided funding for the company's computerized
lighting board.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Mrs. Harrington made a gift of $20 million to the
Metropolitan Opera endowment fund campaign. In acknowledgement of
her extraordinary generosity, the company named the house's
auditorium after her. Marilyn Shapiro, the executive director for
external affairs at the Met, estimated that Mrs. Harrington's
donations to the Met totaled more than $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   As a director of the foundation she formed with her husband,
Donald Harrington, a Texas oil man, Mrs. Harrington also
contributed large sums to dozens of diverse charities and
organizations, including the Deafness Research Foundation in New
York and the Harrington Arthritis Research Center in Phoenix. She
was especially attentive to the needs of the Texas Panhandle,
providing money for everything from outdoor lights for softball
fields in small towns like Gruver to a cancer treatment center
outside Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harrington was a fierce defender of private philanthropy
over government support. ``We've got to have that free
enterprise,'' she once said. ``It's important in charitable
institutions as well as in business. Art has to have freedom.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harrington was born Sybil Buckingham in Amarillo in 1908,
the granddaughter of some of the first settlers in the remote
region. As a child, she liked to fish and shoot, but she especially
loved music and dance. She studied piano and organ, and ordered
ballet shoes from a catalog, persuading her mother to take her to
Fort Worth for dance classes. Later, she loved listening to the
first radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, which fired her
love for the art form and the company.
</P>
<P>
   A petite woman with a wry smile and quick wit, she married
Harrington in 1935. They bought a 15,000-square-foot home in
Amarillo built in 1914 by a cattle baron who, Mrs. Harrington often
recalled, had had the grand Ionic columns that supported the
portico hauled to Amarillo by mule train.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's philanthropy began with some scholarships to Texas
Tech University in Lubbock, and later with a ranch they bought and
turned into the Don Harrington Boy Scout Camp. They established
their foundation in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Mrs. Harrington suffered two blows, the deaths of both
her husband and, a few months later, their only child, Sally
Harrington Goldwater, the wife of Robert Goldwater, the younger
brother of Senator Barry Goldwater. Taking charge of the foundation
was one way she was able to cope with her loss.
</P>
<P>
   She had been a regular contributor to the Met but had not
thought of financing a production until it was suggested to her by
friends on the Met's board. Her first gift made possible the
production of Verdi's ``Don Carlo'' by John Dexter, introduced in
the 1978-79 season. Mrs. Harrington immersed herself in the
experience, attending rehearsals, talking with cast and crew,
dispensing advice. When someone suggested that a white horse and
some Irish wolfhounds in one scene were distracting, Mrs.
Harrington objected, and the animals remained in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Other productions she was responsible for, still in use by the
company, include Puccini's ``Manon Lescaut,'' Johann Strauss'
``Fledermaus,'' Wagner's ``Rheingold'' and Mozart's ``Don
Giovanni.'' She became a member of the Metropolitan Opera
Association in 1968, a director of its managing board in 1970 and
advisory director in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   She is to be buried in Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting once on her work as a philanthropist, Mrs. Harrington
said: ``Giving money away is hard work. But I got a kick out of it.
I felt important for once in my life.''

GOVERNOR CANDIDATE STRUGGLES TO EXPLAIN HER SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ U.S. Rep. Barbara Kennelly held a solidarity
lunch Friday to call attention to the novel presence of four women
on the Democrats' statewide ticket, but wound up trying to explain
her campaign's steep slide despite an ever-more-aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, the Democratic candidate for governor of
Connecticut, joked that in ``the year of El Nino,'' even the most
predictable phenomena are subject to drastic change. Nevertheless,
she acknowledged that her race against Gov. John Rowland has become
even more uphill than she had realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very strange year,'' Mrs. Kennelly said, referring
to the turmoil in Washington and to Connecticut voters' apparent
satisfaction with the status quo. ``It's a very strange time. It
has not been a fun time for me. But I know I ran for the right
reasons, and I know I would be an excellent governor.''
</P>
<P>
   The reflective reference to her campaign was a sign of the speed
and decisiveness of the reversal in her political fortunes. When
Mrs. Kennelly (pronounced ken-NELL-lee) entered the race a year
ago, polls showed her in a dead heat with Rowland, who at 41 is the
United States' youngest governor.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the University of Connecticut released a poll showing
that Rowland was leading by 37 percentage points. If every
undecided voter in the poll switched to Mrs. Kennelly, she would
still lose by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly's quest now becomes a test of whether a political
campaign can be salvaged in the final weeks when voters are paying
the most attention. Pointing to this week's Democratic Senate
primary in New York as an example that political perception is not
always borne out, she said: ``If you've seen my friend Geraldine
Ferraro, she was way up there. Guess what? She didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly, 62, whose Hartford-area seat is one of the most
reliably Democratic in Congress, is the widow of a lion of state
Democratic politics, James Kennelly, who was speaker of the state
House of Representatives, and the daughter of a former chairman of
the Democratic National Committee, John Bailey. Her decision to run
was greeted with euphoria by Connecticut Democrats who thought she
had the stature to undermine Rowland's formidable position.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Kennelly emerged from a diner Friday with the other
three women on the ticket, she was peppered again and again with
variations of one question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Mrs. Kennelly said. ``I don't know. I have
worked so hard all my life _ all my public life _ to absolutely
promote education for all young people. I ran for governor because
I thought every child in Connecticut should be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kennelly said she planned to begin television advertising
next week. Rowland has spent $1 million to broadcast six
advertisements over the last year characterizing his stewardship in
images of warmth and success. Mrs. Kennelly's aides admit that they
expect to be outspent 4-to-1 on television, but contend that voters
will move toward her after they hear her story. ``We have not yet
begun to fight,'' said her campaign manager, Jonathan Pelto.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, who served four years in Congress with Mrs. Kennelly,
discusses her respectfully but increasingly dismissively. Asked
Friday about complaints by Mrs. Kennelly's aides that he had an
``obscene'' lead in fund raising, Rowland said: ``I understand
their frustration, but I didn't tell her to get in the race. It was
her idea. Let the chips fall where they may.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Just two hours before what Mrs. Kennelly's campaign had billed
as a ``historic'' strategy session among the most women ever to run
together on a state slate, one of her running mates indicated that
with such a bleak outlook at the top of the ticket, it was going to
be every candidate for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Wyman, who is seeking re-election as the state
comptroller, refused to criticize Rowland when asked to during the
taping of ``CT '98,'' a political talk show to be broadcast Sunday
on WFSB-TV, Channel 3, the CBS affiliate in Hartford. ``My message
is what I have accomplished and what I have done,'' she said. Ms.
Wyman also said, ``Barbara Kennelly has not gotten the message out
_ yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The other two women on her ticket _ Denise Nappier, the
Democratic nominee for state treasurer, and state Rep. Susan
Bysiewicz, who is running for secretary of the state _ promised
Friday to use their energetic styles to help Mrs. Kennelly.
</P>
<P>
   Seeming to gain grit by having the three three female running
mates at her side, Mrs. Kennelly discussed her plight in feisty but
bald terms. ``I hate the poll today,'' she said. ``But I'm going on
television, and I am going to fight right to the day of election.
And it is not over. It is not over.''
</P>
<P>
   The importance of television advertising was underscored in the
fine print of the poll released Friday by the University of
Connecticut, which showed that fewer people claimed to know Mrs.
Kennelly than did so the last time the poll was taken, in June.
That can be seen as an opportunity for Mrs. Kennelly, since 50
percent of people said they did not know enough to rate her, while
just 14 percent made that claim about Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   Those polled said they preferred Rowland to Mrs. Kennelly by 60
percent to 23 percent, with 17 percent undecided. The telephone
poll of 505 Connecticut residents was conducted Saturday through
Wednesday and had a margin of error of plus or minus five
percentage points.

JUDGE RULES AGAINST ISLANDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York state judge Friday denied a request by the
New York Islanders to secure dates for home games at arenas other
than Nassau Coliseum. Supreme Court Justice Burton Joseph directed
the team to follow his ruling on Thursday that ordered the
Islanders to play their exhibition and home games at the Coliseum,
which is in Uniondale.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Islanders and SMG, the company that maintains the
Coliseum, were ordered by Joseph to appear in court next Wednesday
for a hearing on a preliminary injunction.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a lawsuit filed by the Islanders alleging unsafe
conditions at the 26-year-old building. The Islanders moved out of
the Coliseum a week ago, citing uninhabitable conditions and
alleging in the lawsuit that the hoist which holds up the 21-ton
scoreboard and speaker system is in danger of falling. The $10
million lawsuit also alleges that SMG knew of the unsafe status of
the hoist for several months without notifying the Islanders or
Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going on the assumption that the Islanders will be
playing at the Coliseum next Friday,'' said SMG president Wes
Westley, who added that the hoist is scheduled to be replaced.

just 75 minutes to fell a dying redwood tree, which for 1,000 years
had stood sentinel over Holmes Flat, along the scenic route that is
part of Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Three dozen awed spectators
watched as a special team of state loggers brought down a that
officials feared would fall onto motorists along the famed Avenue
of the Giants. (Kent Porter/Santa Rosa Press-Democrat Photos) *LITE

<P>
   WALDEN, N.Y. _ ``Here's the town the circus came to, when it
came to town,'' said Darren Hernandez, the village manager of this
postage stamp-size community straddling the Wallkill River in the
Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled with satisfaction. ``And then it decided to stay,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 12586, the Walden ZIP code, is the first permanent address
of the Big Apple Circus, a 21-year-old icon of street-smart
entertainment that is celebrated for pitching its one-ring tent in
the urban wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   The circus' new home is far from Gotham _ nearly 70 miles to the
north, actually _ in a former wire-extruding factory on 30 woodsy
acres. In a cavernous, 50,000-square-foot industrial space, the
circus has created a place to mount its new shows.
</P>
<P>
   So this all-American Orange County village, trumpeted as ``the
Sheffield of America'' for its knife manufacturing before the
factories closed, has been learning to live with an exotic,
extravagantly international invasion of more than 100 circus
tummlers, tumblers and big-top eccentrics, not to mention three
elephants, 27 dogs, eight horses and eight parakeets.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, a few residents who have made it known
that they think Big Apple should be contributing more to Walden's
diminished local tax base. Economic development aside, though, few
people would disagree that the arrival of the circus has done
wonders for Walden's self-esteem, which suffered mightily not long
ago when a radio shock jock from the other side of the Hudson
decided to make the village the butt of a bizarre guerrilla war of
the airwaves. The circus people might be a bit odd, but any
discomfort along those lines tends to pale against being known in
radioland as New York's version of Dogpatch.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, village residents say they have grown
accustomed to the sight of a dozen Chinese acrobats carrying off
35-pound bags of rice from the supermarket, to encounters with
juggling troupes in the laundermat and to glimpses of elephants and
horses taking their exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But grocery schleppers in the Thruway Shopping Center, near the
circus headquarters, still do a double take when they catch sight
of Bello Nock, the Big Apple's star clown, with his four-inch-high,
er, platform of stiffly sprayed reddish-blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``they ask to touch it.'' He lets them.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first we were concerned that they'd be carnival types, who
are pretty tough,'' said June DeBates, a waitress at the Walden
Diner. ``But we learned that circus people are really the salt of
the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hecht, a Walden tow-truck operator who has come to the aid
of Big Apple vehicles, put it this way: ``You know how some people
have dogs in their backyards? Well, these people have elephants.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of other stuff, too. While the clowny red-and-white
tent on Edmunds Lane is visible to any of the 6,500 townsfolk who
drive by, hidden away on the property is a tiny circus village of
40 house trailers and dozens of vehicles, including cars, trucks,
generator vans and the communal dining trailer that serves more
than 300 meals a day. Behind the old factory, the performers have
arrayed their mobile homes in a tidy grid of brand-new streets.
</P>
<P>
   This is the troupe's first season in the fully renovated $4
million building, although Big Apple first began leasing space in
Walden in 1995 before buying the factory last year.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades ``we'd been creating the show under primitive
conditions,'' said Paul Binder, Big Apple's 55-year-old founder and
artistic director. The first performances of the fledgling circus
in 1977 were mounted in the tiny Synod House at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Big Apple shuffled off to makeshift rehearsal spaces in
Manhattan and Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, ``where helicopters
took off in the middle of the night and the Concorde swooped over
us twice a day,'' said Katja Schumann, the show's star equestrian.
``Now that was noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by high city prices, and guided by a circus friend of
Binder who trains bears and lives in nearby Middletown, Big Apple
found Walden, where lower-priced properties were available.
</P>
<P>
   The compound has five indoor practice spaces and workshops to
restore the show's equipment, which takes a beating when the show
is on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever we traveled, we were always at home in the ring
surrounded by the family of the circus,'' said Michael Christensen,
creative director. ``But now, for the first time, we can feel at
home in a place.''
</P>
<P>
   Around Walden, the feeling is mostly mutual. ``They've been good
neighbors, and Big Apple has been a good thing for Walden,'' said
Carl Aiello, editor and publisher of the local weekly, The Wallkill
Valley Times.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, Big Apple has lent its performers to the
annual Walden Day celebration. And it has welcomed as many as 1,500
of its neighbors to its annual open house. When new shows are
ready, the circus also holds a dress rehearsal for 500 guests, many
of them suppliers and area residents.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Walden's redemption from that nasty business
with the disk jockey, Bob Wohlfeld, a.k.a. ``the Wolf,'' who made
the village the target of several years' worth of jokes on his
radio show. Despite complaints to the radio station, WPDH in
Poughkeepsie, and threats against Wohlfeld, the assault on Walden's
reputation subsided only a year ago, when Wohlfeld left for an
Albany station.
</P>
<P>
   If Walden's reputation is on the rebound, its economy had
already been doing a bit better when the circus settled in. It is a
hub for the region's dairy and apple farmers and has a mix of
manufacturing, retail and service businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a vocal minority is resentful that the circus, which
enjoys nonprofit status because of its children's educational
programs, is likely to remove a building that once represented the
village's sixth-largest source of property tax income from the
local, county and school district tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not opposed to circuses _ why, I even went to the circus
in Moscow a few years ago,'' said David Lustig Jr., 76, the owner
of Lustig Realty on Main Street and a longtime member of the
village Planning Board. ``But that building could have accommodated
another industrial plant.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Big Apple is still paying $45,000 in annual real estate
taxes to the Town of Montgomery, Binder said, although the circus
has challenged the payment under its tax-exempt status. Besides, he
said, ``the factory had been closed for years,'' adding, ``There
was little hope of reviving the site.''
</P>
<P>
   Lustig is hardly the only circus critic in Walden. ``Given their
tax-exempt status, the least they could do for the town is to put
on a show for us,'' said Frank Ciliberto, owner of a plumbing and
heating business. ``Big Apple travels all over the country, but
their hometown never gets to see the show.''
</P>
<P>
   The invitation-only dress rehearsal is limited to 500 because
Big Apple does not have parking spaces for enough guests to fill
the 1,980-seat tent, Binder said. But beyond this, the circus
people say, the point is that they aren't in Walden to entertain;
they are there to build new shows.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in one of the rehearsal spaces on a recent afternoon,
under the harsh factory lights, Todd Robbins, the comedic soloist
with the seven-member circus band, was giving a virtuoso
performance on washboard, cowbell, klaxon, duck call and, at one
point, the Knall 9-millimeter starter pistol. Robbins explained
that he is capable ``of the full range from high hokum to the
lowest form of hokum.''

SCHOOL BUS COLLIDES WITH TRUCK, INJURING 7 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ A school bus and a three-ton dump truck loaded
with topsoil collided at a busy intersection here this morning,
critically injuring the driver of the bus and one of the six
students aboard, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   With horn blaring and brakes squealing, the truck slammed into
the left front end of the bus about 7:20 a.m. as the bus was about
to turn from eastbound Route 520 onto northbound Route 34. During
the turn, the bus driver, Deirdre Pietrowski, 26, of Old Bridge,
N.J., was facing the rising sun, and the police are exploring
whether she was momentarily blinded by the glare and went through a
red light at the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may have been a contributing factor,'' Sgt. Donald Hughes
of the Holmdel police said of the possibility that Ms. Pietrowski
was unable to see the light or the truck bearing down on the bus
from her left.
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred moments after Al Taylor, an auto mechanic,
arrived for work at Holmdel Auto Body, which is at the
intersection. He said he heard the truck's brakes screeching, a
blow from its horn, and then the crash. He ran toward the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were screaming and hollering to get out,'' Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pietrowski was driving the six students, 7 to 16 years old,
from their homes in nearby Colts Neck to St. John Vianney High
School and an adjacent elementary school, St. Benedict's. Her trip
this morning was only her third over the route, said David Armitt,
a regional general manager of Laidlaw Transit, the owner of the
bus.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believed that one or more of the
children were helping to direct her to the schools, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw Transit hired Ms. Pietrowski as a part-time driver last
Tuesday, Armitt said. Previously, he said, Ms. Pietrowski had
worked as a bus driver from 1992 to 1997 for the Pocono Mountain
School District in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Usually, about 30 children, most of them students at St. John
Vianney, ride the bus each morning, said the school principal,
Joseph Deroba. Hughes said the previous bus driver usually arrived
at least 15 minutes late each morning. He said Ms. Pietrowski was
on schedule Friday and at least 24 students missed the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The critically injured student, Kyle DeRespinis, 7, was flown
from the crash site on a medical evacuation helicopter to Robert
Wood Johnson Hospital in New Brunswick. He had severe head and neck
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The other injured students were identified as Kyle's sister,
Kristen, 13; Ashley Merrigan, 16; Rebecca Stuart, 15; Emily Hodges,
no age available; and Sal Foran, 13, who suffered a broken
collarbone. Kristen DeRespinis was in satisfactory condition at the
Jersey Shore Medical Center in Neptune. All the other students were
treated at hospitals and released.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's compartment was crushed on impact and Ms.
Pietrowski suffered severe head injuries. She was taken to Jersey
Shore Medical Center, and the police had been unable to question
her as of late afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, Michael Cherence, 22, of Cliffwood, N.J., was
not injured, even though the truck flipped over after hitting the
bus. Police said he had told them he had a green light as he
approached the intersection.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned several motorists who witnessed the crash but
declined to say if they had confirmed Cherence's account. Hughes
said investigators were looking into the possibility that Cherence
was speeding as he came down an incline of about 170 yards toward
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The posted speed limit on that stretch of Route 34, a busy
north-south thoroughfare, is 50 miles an hour. But Hughes said
loaded construction vehicles, like Cherence's, are limited to 35
miles an hour on that stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, Cherence was given three summonses for
speeding or reckless driving in New Jersey, Hughes said. Ms.
Pietrowski has one moving violation in the last eight years, he
said. Neither driver was given a summons Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said accidents are fairly common at the intersection.
``We're used to hearing beeping and screeching,'' he said. ``It's a
bad intersection.''

EDITORIAL: PUNISHING AMERICORPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 19:
</P>
<P>
   Americorps is one of President Clinton's pet projects and thus a
tempting target for congressional Republicans looking for ways to
humiliate Clinton and gain a bargaining chip in budget negotiations
with the weakened White House. But GOP lawmakers risk looking
shabby if they persist in playing politics with the future of this
worthy, four-year-old volunteer program.
</P>
<P>
   Americorps members perform a host of needed tasks to help
strengthen communities, providing tutoring and mentoring for
thousands of at-risk children, for example, and working with local
nonprofit groups to restore blighted neighborhoods and clean up the
environment. The program will field some 40,000 members this year,
making it five times the size of the Peace Corps. Members receive a
modest stipend of about $8,000 and a $4,725 voucher to help pay
education costs in exchange for one year of full-time service.
</P>
<P>
   Much as Clinton promised, Americorps is a good deal for the
nation and for its workers. But while the Senate has approved
continuing the program's current $425.5-million funding level in
the next fiscal year, the House eliminates all funding. That leaves
resolution of the issue to a conference committee and the vagaries
of political horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should remain ready to wield his veto pen, if necessary,
to preserve his program. Americorps can show tangible
accomplishments in all 50 states and has earned renewal without a
messy and demoralizing fight.

A MIXED VERDICT ON TEXAS HMO LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A provision in a new Texas law allowing patients to sue
health maintenance organizations and other insurers for malpractice
was upheld Friday by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   But a second provision, allowing patients to appeal to an
independent panel when their employee health plan decides treatment
is unnecessary, was struck down.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, from Judge Vanessa Gilmore of U.S. District Court in
Houston, came in a lawsuit filed last year against the Texas
Department of Insurance by Aetna Life Insurance Co. and its Texas
subsidiaries. The suit challenged a state law that was passed that
May and took effect last September. It was the first law in the
nation that expressly gave patients the right to sue insurers over
quality-of-care decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hailed Friday's decision as at least a partial
victory and said they had not decided whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for patients and it upholds in the main the
Texas statute,'' said David Mattax, an assistant Texas attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   But Elton Bomer, the state's insurance commissioner, said he was
not pleased that the ruling eliminated the appeals provision for
most Texas patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are the losers, because they will be denied access
to the independent review process, which has been working very well
in Texas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bomer said he hoped the attorney general would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, in a written statement, also said it was ``very pleased''
with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   How much national significance the ruling will have is unclear.
Congress is considering federal legislation that could open
insurers to more suits or require independent reviews of decisions
denying coverage for treatment.

COURT BACKS GIULIANI'S WAY OF ASSIGNING HOURS FOR WORKFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state appeals court has upheld the way New York
City calculates the number of hours that welfare recipients must
work in its workfare program to receive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The state Appellate Division in Manhattan, in a ruling released
on Thursday, overturned a lower court decision that said the city's
method of calculation, which is based on the minimum wage, was
unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Giuliani administration created its version of
workfare in 1995, city officials have been calculating
participants' hours so that their benefits are roughly equal to the
minimum wage, $5.15 an hour. A welfare recipient who receives the
equivalent of $100 a week in benefits, for example, must work about
20 hours a week in workfare.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for several workfare participants challenged the city's
approach in court. In May 1997, Justice Jane Solomon of state
Supreme Court ruled that the city must base its calculations on
what it pays regular city workers for similar tasks, as much as $8
to $10 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   More than 32,000 New Yorkers are enrolled in workfare, known
formally as the Work Experience Program. Most of them sweep city
streets, clean parks or perform clerical tasks in return for their
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for workfare participants had praised Ms. Solomon's
ruling as a breakthrough that might mean workfare participants
would be treated more like other workers. They also said that if
the ruling was upheld the city would either have to reduce sharply
the number of hours workfare participants put in each week or
increase welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But in its unanimous decision, the Appellate Division noted that
state law specifically authorizes paying the minimum wage to
workfare participants. ``Moreover, there is a historical
recognition that public-assistance recipients performing tasks in
exchange for benefits are not public employees,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Levine, the deputy mayor for economic development, praised
the decision Friday. ``It's a very sound ruling, a common-sense
ruling, because it recognizes what the mayor has been saying for a
long time: Welfare is a temporary situation, unionization is a
permanent situation,'' Levine said.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Cohan, the lawyer for the workfare participants, could not
be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another court ruling on workfare, a state judge has
temporarily blocked the city's Human Resources Administration,
which oversees welfare, from changing its rules determining which
welfare recipients enrolled in college can be ordered into
workfare.
</P>
<P>
   The city agency recently decided that welfare recipients
enrolled in college work-study programs _ some of whom had been
exempt from workfare _ would now have to participate. Lawyers for
welfare recipients challenged the new rule, and on Wednesday,
Justice Richard Braun of state Supreme Court issued a preliminary
injunction against the city. Braun said the city must individually
assess students' skills and work history before assigning them to
workfare.
</P>
<P>
   The city will appeal the decision, said Debra Sproles, a
spokeswoman for the city agency.

EDITORIAL: UNREGULATED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Sept. 19:
</P>
<P>
   There is mounting evidence that Congress should revisit its
ill-advised decision in 1994 to insulate pills and powders sold as
``dietary supplements'' from federal regulation. The latest warning
appears in the New England Journal of Medicine, which on Thursday
published six reports of people who had become ill after treating
their ailments with remedies from health-food stores.
</P>
<P>
   The reports follow a monthlong controversy generated by baseball
player Mark McGwire's admission that he uses androstenedione, an
over-the-counter compound that is thought to elevate testosterone
levels and build muscle mass. Some experts asserted that the
compound gave McGwire an unfair competitive edge. Others were not
sure. But nearly all the experts agreed that because so little is
known about androstenedione's long-term effects on the body, it
would be wise to remove it from drugstore shelves pending rigorous
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, there is no regulatory regime that requires such
tests. The reason is the Dietary Supplement Health and Education
Act of 1994, which Congress approved after an industry-financed
scare campaign convinced health-minded Americans that the Food and
Drug Administration was about to ban conventional vitamins and
other popular products from supermarket shelves. The act greatly
weakened the FDA's ability to police the safety of hundreds of new
and exotic products advertised as nutritional supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994 the agency could withhold a product from the market
until the manufacturer had proved its safety, which required a
convincing case based on exhaustive research. The act shifted the
burden of proof to the FDA, which has limited resources. As a
practical matter, this means the FDA cannot clamp down on a
substance until someone is actually hurt by it, and even then the
product can remain on the shelves until the FDA finishes its
testing and makes its case in court.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Congress may be unwilling to challenge the political
power of the supplement industry, whose sales have grown from $8
billion to $12 billion in the four years since the law was passed.
But surely Congress can find a way to let ordinary, time-tested
vitamins remain on the market while reinstating the FDA's power to
require systematic testing of more exotic or risky products.

BEAVERS EYE UPSET OF TROJANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett walked around the practice
field the other day with a piece of paper in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Always an excellent monitor of Internet information, Hackett
finally pulled out the article, which picked Oregon State as an
``upset special'' selection over the Trojans tonight at the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's good-natured reaction to the prediction indicated that
it was nothing more than a well-timed source of motivational
material for his team.
</P>
<P>
   But considering how USC has fared in recent Pacific-10
Conference openers, anything that can be used to inspire his
players should be utilized.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans are just 4-4 in Pac-10 openers in the 1990s, and few
teams with Rose Bowl aspirations can afford to lose their first
conference game to an outmanned opponent.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a caveat. Only one of those opening games was
against Oregon State, which has become an institution of ineptitude
when playing the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   USC has not lost to the Beavers since 1967, a span of 24 games.
In fact, Oregon State has rarely beaten anybody recently. The
Beavers last had a winning season in 1970, and are 60-233-6 in the
previous 27 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure none of this information was relayed to the
Trojans by Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter who we're playing, and by that I'm
not being disrespectful at all,'' Hackett said. ``Our first issue
is that we have to be efficient and take care of our business.
Oregon State is a confident team, they're pumped up, but we can't
worry about history.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth is that this game is the finale of a three-game
stretch where Hackett tries to smooth out all the problems before
taking USC to Florida State next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hackett admitted that he still hasn't been around the
Trojans long enough to gauge his team's mood heading into a game,
just in case he has to guard against a letdown or looking past an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too early right now,'' Hackett said. ``I think
we've got to have more adversity before I know how we'll respond.''
</P>
<P>
   That should come next week.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Hackett is reminding USC that a loss to Oregon
State tonight is probably more devastating than a loss to Florida
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more important to beat Oregon State because it's in the
conference,'' Hackett said. ``It's more important than the other
two games (Purdue, San Diego State) because the goal is the Rose
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   That means eliminating penalties, avoiding missed tackles and
missed pass plays, according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   It also means that the Trojans will continue their
two-quarterback rotation, with freshman Carson Palmer possibly
getting a series or two in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also need to try to stay healthy. Five starters
(Chad Morton, Antoine Harris, Lawrence Larry, Grant Pearsall, Mark
Cusano) are nursing minor injuries and will not be in the opening
lineup. The team's top two centers (Matt McShane, Eric Denmon) are
out and left guard Jason Grain will start in their place. David
Pratchard of Canyon High School will start at left guard for Grain.
</P>
<P>
   Although second-year Beavers coach Mike Riley, a former USC
assistant, has begun rebuilding the Oregon State program, victories
over Nevada and Baylor probably don't warrant consideration for
pulling off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Even Riley has tried to downplay the Beavers' best start in 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple good games, not great, but solid,'' Riley
said. ``We're not a juggernaut on offense, but we haven't made
mistakes and only taken a couple of sacks.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense is a totally revamped group from the one USC shut
out 23-0 last year in Corvallis. The newest additions are
quarterback Terrance Bryant, a junior-college All-American, who has
passed for more than 200 yards in each of the first two games.
There is also a new tailback, redshirt freshman Ken Simonton, who
has rushed for more than 100 yards in each game.
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing less-than-imposing competition, it's still worth
something when the Beavers can boast such stats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our offense had a terrible running game last year. In
order to get better, we had to turn that around,'' Riley said.
``We've been efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Strong safety Grant Pearsall (strained knee) and
linebacker Mark Cusano (sprained ankle) expect to play sparingly
against Oregon State and fully return for the Florida State game.
``It's not worse, it's definitely better,'' Cusano said regarding
his ankle. ``I'm playing tentative on it now, not at full
speed.''... Freshman quarterback Jason Thomas has undergone surgery
to remove scar tissue around his ankle and has begun
rehabilitation.... Defensive end Lawrence Larry tweaked his
sprained ankle and is listed as possible. Freshman Lonnie Ford will
start at tight end, with starter Antoine Harris limited by a
sprained ankle.... A crowd of about 50,000 is expected for
tonight's game.

SOSA AND THE CUBS LACK PUNCH IN A LOSS TO THE REDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs left Wrigley
Field last weekend for the West Coast, Sosa had just tied Mark
McGwire in their home-run race by belting four in the three-game
series against Milwaukee, and the Cubs had staged two dramatic
come-from-behind victories.
</P>
<P>
   In their return home on Friday, Sosa and the Cubs lacked last
weekend's flair. Sosa went 0-for-4 in a 6-4 loss to the Cincinnati
Reds, and the Cubs managed just six hits, without a home run, let
alone any late-inning heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's performance, in front of more than 40 family members whom
the Cubs had flown in from the Dominican Republic as a surprise,
left him one behind Mark McGwire, who has 64 after homering in the
fourth inning Friday night against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa never hit the ball out of the infield even as 40,105 fans,
on their feet, chanted ``Sammy, Sammy'' and ``MVP'' during each of
his at-bats. He did reach base and scored a run in the first inning
after hitting a checked-swing grounder that second baseman Bret
Boone booted. Sosa then grounded out to third in the second inning,
struck out in the fifth inning after battling to a full count, and
popped out to Boone in the seventh. He was left in the on-deck
circle when the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   It was Reds shortstop Barry Larkin and left fielder Dmitri Young
who stole the show. Young was 4-for-4 with two RBIs, and his diving
catch on Micky Morandini's sinking line drive in the sixth inning
kept the Cubs from tying the score. It also ended the inning and
prevented Sosa from coming to the plate with two runners on. Young
then led off the seventh with a single and scored a run, putting
the Cubs away for good. Larkin was 4-for-5 with a double and a home
run, and he scored two runs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss drops the Cubs' lead over the Mets in the wild-card
race to just a half-game, with the Mets playing Friday night. The
two teams, whose play and dramatic games have mirrored each other
the last couple of weeks, have not been separated by more than one
game in the standings since Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Though fruitless on Friday, hundreds of ticketless fans again
flocked to Waveland Avenue, just past Wrigley's left-field wall, in
anticipation of a potentially lucrative home-run ball. Following
Sosa's two-homer game last Sunday, during which a fan claimed he
had possession of home-run ball No. 62 but lost it after being
bitten and mauled during the scramble for it, the Chicago police
have added officers and erected barricades for this series,
corralling the fans onto one sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's game, a collector who paid a fan $10,000 for
home-run ball No. 61 returned the ball to Sosa in exchange for some
of Sosa's autographed equipment. Sosa said after the game he
intended to donate the ball to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   And despite recent criticism that major-league baseball was not
giving Sosa the same attention that McGwire receives, Sosa said he
felt plenty of support from fans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are what motivate me every day,'' he said after the
game. ``The support here in Chicago and all over the country has
been wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   He then gave a parting word of encouragement to McGwire, his
friend and fellow slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't hit one every day,'' Sosa said before heading home to
celebrate his son's sixth birthday. ``I'm just going to go home and
relax with my family and watch Mark. I hope he hits one tonight.''

VICTIMS IN MEXICO MASSACRE HAD DRUG TIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENSENADA, Mexico _ Still baffled by the brutality of the act,
Mexican officials said Friday they are all but certain that 18
people were slaughtered near this seaside community because some of
the victims were linked to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motive appears to be problems between two or three groups
involved in drug trafficking,'' said Baja California state Attorney
General Marco Antonio de la Fuente.
</P>
<P>
   Police have detained 10 people for questioning about the
massacre, de la Fuente said. Marijuana and weapons that may be
linked to the crime have been seized in the town of Tecate along
the U.S.-Mexico border, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of an extended family _ including a 1-year-old baby in
diapers and seven children between the ages of 2 and 16 _ were
dragged from their beds before dawn Thursday, herded against a low
wall and shot with automatic weapons and pistols.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't begin to measure the brutality of the attack,'' de la
Fuente said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Attacks on rivals' family members are rare in the Mexican drug
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state authorities said the apparent target of the
attack was Fermin Castro, head of a small marijuana-smuggling gang
based in Ensenada that had loose ties to powerful gangsters in
Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, 38, a cattle rancher and rodeo promoter nicknamed the
``Indian Cowboy,'' survived the shooting but is in a coma with a
gunshot wound to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that Castro had apparently been tortured before
he and the others were shot.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Chavez, the top federal law enforcement official in
Baja California, said a chair in Castro's house was stained with
blood, as if someone had been interrogated there. There were
indications that Castro had been beaten, Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Those killed include Castro's wife and their 2-year-old son; the
sister of Castro's wife, her husband and their children; and
Castro's sister, her husband, and their children. One of the five
slain women was eight months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old nephew of Castro is hospitalized with bullet
wounds. A 15-year-old niece apparently hid from the assailants and
escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been violent here, but never like this,'' said Gerardo,
a neighbor of the victims who declined to give his last name. ``I
can't believe this. These were good people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fermin Castro was well known in El Sauzal, a suburb of Ensenada
about a 90-minute drive south of the U.S. border that is a confused
jumble of fish canneries, U.S.-owned electronics factories and neat
houses of wealthy retirees from California. Castro had put on a
rodeo Tuesday night not far from his home to help celebrate
Mexico's independence holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Members of his extended family lived in a small walled compound
of three houses tucked behind a ceramics factory.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers guarded the compound Friday, refusing access, as law
enforcement investigators went through the houses and the yards.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday that the Ensenada area, a favorite weekend
and vacation destination for people from Southern California, has
become increasingly caught up in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had indications that the problems here in Ensenada were
getting worse, that drug trafficking was getting worse,'' Chavez
said. ``This is all because of the proximity to the border. This is
a corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   Murder is a state crime in Mexico. The Mexican federal police
have become involved in the investigation of the Ensenada killings
because of suspected links to drug smuggling, a federal crime.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said authorities had been watching Castro's organization
but had failed to act on their suspicions. A recent article in
Zeta, a weekly newspaper in Tijuana, listed Castro's group among
about a half-dozen drug smuggling organizations that it said were
flourishing in the Ensenada area.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said Castro's small smuggling band unloaded
marijuana-laden planes on clandestine airstrips near Ensenada and
transported the drug to the border for sale in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many such small gangs operate in Baja California, paying fees to
larger drug organizations for the right to smuggle, Chavez said.
Castro's and other small bands in the Ensenada area paid protection
money to an associate of the powerful Arellano Felix drug gang in
Tijuana, Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chavez and other officials said there was no evidence that
members of Castro's group directly worked for the Arellano Felix
organization or were killed because of that gang's ongoing power
struggle with other smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts consider the Arellano Felix organization, headed by
four brothers from a well-to-do Tijuana family, as the most
important criminal organization in Mexico. U.S. and Mexican
authorities say the group smuggles tons of cocaine and other
narcotics into the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   The gangland killing of families happens rarely in Mexico.
Still, there have been 250 killings this year in Baja California,
most of them in Tijuana. Many have been linked to the drug trade. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; De la Fuente said Friday that although drug trafficking was
likely behind the Ensenada killings, there is no evidence linking
the deaths to a wider gangland power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Having federal police on the case may not assure some people in
Baja California. Critics say that widespread corruption has kept
many federal officials in the pockets of drug smugglers for years.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that witnesses describe the attackers as dressed in black
_ the uniform of the federal anti-drug police _ several Mexican
reporters pointedly asked Chavez on Friday about police involvement
with area traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The official said there was no evidence of any police
involvement in Thursday's massacre and vowed that the case will be
solved. He said, however, that the investigation may be hampered by
human rights concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't touch a hair on any detained person, because it would
be violating their rights,'' Chavez said. ``That's why this is so
difficult. (But) I think we're doing OK. We're working very
hard.'' &QL;

TYSON'S FATE ON ROPES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Mike Tyson will learn today whether he's been
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada State Athletic Commission will decide after a hearing
whether to restore the fighter's boxing license 15 months after he
bit off a portion of Evander Holyfield's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe his chances aren't good, particularly after he was
accused of punching one man and kicking another after a traffic
accident last month in Gaithersburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hearing took place before the incident, I would have
said he had a good chance. Now, I don't think so,'' said promoter
Bob Arum, who lives in Las Vegas and is familiar with the
five-member commission that will decide Tyson's fate.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson's application is rejected, he could reapply next
September.
</P>
<P>
   However, it appears he wouldn't wait that long. Shelly Finkel,
Tyson's adviser, said he will explore other options _ including
numerous offers from outside the country _ if he can't fight in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   If he gets his license, Finkel said, Tyson will fight before the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he isn't licensed, he has to earn a living and depending
what it is, of course, we'd consider other options,'' Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only concern now is Saturday. Hopefully, Saturday, it's a
fair hearing, it's a tough hearing, Mike stands up to what it is
and they do something that's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, 32, was eligible to reapply for a license in June, a year
after his fight with Holyfield. However, his advisers apparently
believed he would have a better chance to be granted a license in
New Jersey and applied with that commission. That angered Nevada
officials and could work against him today.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing there, he lost his composure _ which raised further
questions about his ability to control his temper. Political
pressure began to build against him to a point where it seemed he
would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   So he and his team returned to the scene of the crime and
applied there.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Nevada commission allowed him to reapply for his
license after a year to give him a chance to prove he could be a
good citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, he saw a therapist regularly and generally behaved
himself. However, the incident in Maryland could haunt him: If it
happened as Tyson's alleged victims say it did, it seems to
indicate the troubled fighter hasn't progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson denies that he attacked the two men. And Finkel said it
should have no bearing on the case, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say they don't license him as a result of that and he
fights it all the way. And he's cleared in two years, it's proved
he's innocent. Do you think he should be denied the right to make a
living for two years?'' Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's mission isn't complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The former champion refused to comment at a luncheon to honor
one of the commissioners on Thursday but will testify today. He and
his handlers will attempt to demonstrate he is remorseful over the
ear-biting incident and that it will never happen again.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also try to use financial hardship as leverage: He has
limited liquid assets and the IRS has several liens against
property he owns, Finkel said.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said emphatically that his client is stable and deserves
another chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he said. ``He would rather die than have that
happen again in the ring.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Friday failed to overturn a presidential veto of
the partial-birth abortion ban. The vote, 64-36, fell three votes
short of the two-thirds necessary to overturn a veto. The House
successfully voted to override the presidential action earlier this
year. Supporters of the override said that the procedure was
inhumane and did not belong in civilized society. Opponents said
that there were not sufficient protections for the health of the
mother. A ``yes'' vote supported the override.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: JUVENILES
</P>
<P>
   The House Tuesday approved, 280-126, a bill designed to toughen
the penalties on young offenders. The measure would allow the
government to spend a total of $500 million each year on states
that try anyone over 15 as an adult and adopt mandatory penalties
to ensure that no juvenile offender goes unpunished. The vote also
approved a measure combining several prevention programs into block
grants. Supporters said that there was a need for a policy that
holds juveniles accountable for their actions. Opponents said
emphasis should remain on the less costly and more effective
prevention efforts, not with punitive measures. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: DRUGS1
</P>
<P>
   The House Wednesday voted, 384-39, to expand and improve efforts
to stop the flow of drugs into the United States, spending $2.6
billion over three years. Supporters said that the spending was
necessary to improve upon the existing drug policy. They said the
existing policy favors education and prevention over enforcement.
Opponents said the bill was unnecessary and motivated by
election-year politics. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DRUGS2
</P>
<P>
   The House Wednesday voted, 396-9, to create programs aimed at
reducing illegal drug use in the United States. The measure would
include a program to use medication to treat addictions and an
anti-drug media campaign. Supporters said more is needed to fight
domestic drug abuse. At least one member opposed the bill because
questions about it could not be answered since no hearings were
held and it wasn't clear how the bill would help. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: IMF
</P>
<P>
   The House Thursday approved, 255-161, a bill that finances
foreign operations and would give $3.4 billion to the International
Monetary Fund, $14.5 billion less than what the Senate passed
earlier this year and what President Clinton had requested. The
bill also places restrictions on U.S. aid to foreign groups that
perform abortions. Supporters of the bill said they wanted the IMF
to undergo lending reforms, but said they may be willing to
compromise when the bill goes to the House-Senate conference
committee. Opponents said the IMF needs the full $18 billion to
prevent the global ``economic chaos'' from spreading. A ``yes''
vote favors the bill.

BROOKLYN FATHER ARRESTED AFTER GIRL, 9, DROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The father of a 9-year-old Brooklyn girl was arrested
Friday on suspicion that he drowned his daughter late Thursday
night because she was taking too long washing herself in the
bathtub, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Smith, a paroled robber who was once arrested but not
convicted in the scalding of one of his sons, called the police to
his Crown Heights home at 11:10 p.m., telling the operator that his
daughter had stopped breathing, the police said. When officers and
emergency medical technicians entered the apartment at 1226 Lincoln
Place, the police said, they found Antoinette Smith's nude body
resting in a tub of water, where the young girl appeared to have
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to revive Miss Smith failed. She was pronounced dead at
St. Mary's Hospital 20 minutes after the 911 call was received, the
police said. Smith, 35, was then taken into custody. He faces a
charge of second degree murder, which carries a sentence of 25
years to life in prison upon conviction, said Patrick Clark, a
spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that no charges were expected against Smith's wife,
Angela, saying it appeared she was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   According to one of the officials, Mrs. Smith, 35, had left four
of her children, ranging in age from 5 to 11, at home that night
when she went to visit a relative.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently Smith started arguing with Antoinette shortly after
she got home from school, and his anger erupted when she spent too
long in the bathroom, the official said. As the other children sat
in the apartment's living area, the police said, Smith drowned his
young daughter and then called 911.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became unhappy with the length of time it was taking her to
shampoo her hair,'' the officer said. ``So he held her head under
water and drowned her.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's killing came after a decade of reported abuse and
neglect in the family, according to Nicholas Scoppetta,
commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services. Five of
Mrs. Smith's children spent time in foster care from 1988 to 1995
due to her inadequate guardianship and drug use, he said, noting
that it did not appear that Smith was in the home during those
years. For most of that time, he was incarcerated on a robbery
charge, the police said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Smith gained custody of all of her children following the
completion of a drug treatment program in 1995. When Smith returned
to the family in 1996, the couple took classes in parenting skills
and received drug treatment and family counseling from
Graham-Windham, a social services agency that contracts with the
city, Scoppetta said. But reports of abuse continued to filter out
of the home.
</P>
<P>
   Scoppetta said that Smith was accused of inadequately caring for
and excessively punishing one of his sons in June 1996. In February
of the following year, he was accused of scalding the same son, who
the police say was 8 at the time. Both reports of abuse were
substantiated by the agency, Scoppetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was arrested after the scalding incident, according to
Clark of the district attorney's office. But he added that the case
was not criminally prosecuted because ``the evidence was legally
insufficient to sustain the filing of a criminal charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith remained in the home, as did the children. City officials
said that they were now conducting an investigation into
Antoinette's death that they hoped, among other things, would
explain why the children had not been removed from the home after
the 1997 scalding incident.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is awaiting arraignment in Brooklyn Criminal Court,
has a lengthy record of convictions dating back to 1992 for
criminal sale of marijuana, grand larceny, fraud and robbery,
according to the police.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Grant, a spokesman for the state Division of Parole, said
that Smith was currently on parole until May 24, 2000, for a 1990
robbery conviction. He said Smith had served six years of a 5-to-10
year sentence for the robbery _ his second in eight years _ and was
paroled in May 1996. If he had been convicted under the current,
stricter, sentencing guidelines, Smith would not have been eligible
for parole until the middle of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd still be in jail,'' Grant said.

XYLAN SHARES TAKE BEATING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; CALABASAS, Calif. _ Wall Street has hammered shares of Xylan
Corp., completing a two-month slide that has knocked off nearly
two-thirds of the value of the data-networking equipment
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's fall dropped Xylan $2.375 to $10.75 for a 19 percent
decline as concerns mounted that third-quarter profits will be hurt
by slowing sales to its largest distributors. Shares traded as low
as $9.625 before rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight session in which Xylan hit an
all-time low. Shares are now worth about one-seventh of their peak
value of $74.3125 in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10.3 million shares traded hands, or eight times the
average volume during the past six months, in the wake of
Thursday's profit warning by French telephone equipment maker
Alcatel SA. Based in Los Angeles suburb Calabasas, Xylan receives
about 20 percent of its revenues from Alcatel and another 20
percent from International Business Machines Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Marc Woodward of Van Kasper &AMP; Co. said investors have
overreacted to the developments, since Alcatel's problems are in
such areas as large telecommunications carriers with voice
networks, which are outside Xylan's core business. Xylan makes
switches that link computers to data networks and the Internet and
switching systems that enhance the performance of networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The declines have been wildly overblown,'' Woodward said.
``This is a fundamentally strong company and the current valuation
makes no sense. I'm not sure that investors are taking the time to
look into the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Xylan did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Xylan's troubles began July 20, when it warned that sales to IBM
would fall because the computer giant had too much Xylan inventory,
and that sales to Alcatel would fall due to the typical summer
slowdown in European business. During the following session, Xylan
shares lost 19 percent, dropping $6 to $25.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Shares stayed in that range for the next five weeks, helped by
an Aug. 3 announcement of a deal with Northern Telecom to sell
Xylan Omnistack and the flagship Omniswitch products, which are
used to link computers in large corporate networks. Xylan stock
began melting down in mid-August as part of the massive sell-off in
the high-tech sector amid fears of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xylan is obviously going to have some problems,'' said analyst
Stephen Frenkel of Drake &AMP; Co. ``A stock doesn't crater like this
for nothing. There's a global slowdown that's affecting telecom
networking.''
</P>
<P>
   Frenkel said Xylan's long-term outlook might be clouded because
the company's product line is less comprehensive than rivals.
Larger competitors include Cisco Systems Inc., 3Com Corp., Bay
Networks Inc. and Cabletron Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said Xylan's strategy of focusing on high-end
data-networking customers is sound and predicted the company will
meet Wall Street's expectations in the third and fourth quarters.
He forecast Xylan's Omniswitch router should generate strong sales
when it hits the market later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Xylan probably will report third-quarter earnings during the
second half of October. In its second-quarter report in July, the
company posted earnings of $9.6 million, or 20 cents a share,
beating Wall Street estimates by a penny as it more than tripled
earnings of $3.1 million in the 1997 quarter and generated an 85
percent sales gain to $83.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Xylan, which has more than 700 employees, went public in March
1996 in a $109 million offering at $26 a share. The issue more than
doubled in its first day of trading, closing at $58.375.

<P>
   If mobility is the core of the American dream, then there can be
no better expression of the dream than A Better Chance, an
educational program that celebrates its 35th anniversary this year.
</P>
<P>
   ABC plucks gifted minority students from poorly financed public
schools and places them in boarding schools or public high schools
in wealthy suburbs. Almost all the other students in these schools
are white and rich, so the ABC students are forced to confront
uncomfortable issues of being different at just the point in their
lives when teen-agers seek comfort in sameness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, the program claims success. Graduates
proceed to science- and math-related careers at a far higher rate
than do members of minorities overall.
</P>
<P>
   Probably every industry in the country is staffed with ABC's
9,000 alumni. Singer Tracy Chapman is one, as is William Lewis, a
Morgan Stanley managing director, and Francisco Borges, a former
treasurer of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   One ABC alumnus, Arnold Principal, 28, a stockbroker and
financial planner, has been coping with issues of mobility and
identity _ or been surrounded by people coping with them on his
behalf _ since infancy. That has helped him make it from a
crumbling Haiti to an ascendant Wall Street, via Brooklyn, New
Canaan High School in Connecticut and Holy Cross in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   And Principal further complicates and enriches his biography by
bringing Wall Street to the old neighborhood. His 100-odd clients
call him on an ``800'' number and probably imagine a Park Avenue
office suite, but Principal runs Principal Capital Management out
of the brick row house that his mother, Myrienne Jasmin, owns in
East Flatbush, Brooklyn. That gives him the financial flexibility
to chip in toward the repair of a fire-damaged rental property she
owns in Crown Heights.
</P>
<P>
   The family was in the vanguard of the great Caribbean migration
that transformed so many of Brooklyn's neighborhoods. When Arnold
Principal's older brother, Quedel, was in the fifth grade at a
Crown Heights elementary school, his teacher made it clear to Ms.
Jasmin that the family could find better schools in a better
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jasmin, a nurse's aide, made complying with the teacher's
guidance her obsession. In one year, using a series of bank loans,
she turned the $1,000 she saved working two full-time jobs into
$7,000, enough to buy a house in the then mostly Jewish
neighborhood of East Flatbush, where Quedel, Arnold and their
sister, Sauveta, would attend the then nearly all-white Meyer Levin
Junior High.
</P>
<P>
   (Quedel went on to St. Paul's School through ABC, then to
Stanford and Harvard Law School, and is now a lawyer in Westchester
County, N.Y.; Sauveta stayed in the local public schools, graduated
from Adelphi University and is now a nurse. And today East Flatbush
is nearly all black.)
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Principal is nostalgic for the days when ``you could go
to the corner store without getting shot by a cop'' _ a nearby
market, the Milky Way, was the scene of a police shooting last
Christmas. But he is probably the least qualified person to judge
how safe the streets of his own neighborhood were because he was
rarely allowed on them: The Principal children were under strict
orders to return home immediately after school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who you go with is who you are,'' Ms. Jasmin said, explaining
her fear of losing track of her children. As Principal gained more
black schoolmates, she invited them over for cake, soda and chips.
It was a setup: Observing which ones demanded more food and which
ones asked politely, she would say to her son in Creole: ``Keep
this one; drop this one; keep this one. The ones I tell you to
drop, they have no manners; they have no parents after them. The
ones I tell you to keep, they have manners; they have parents after
them.''
</P>
<P>
   She was prescient; some of her picks also went on to A Better
Chance, college and professional careers, and they remain
Principal's closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Principal graduated third in his class from Meyer Levin but was
as shy as he was smart. The ABC house in New Canaan helped change
that; for participants attending public school, the program
establishes dormitories that replicate something of the
boarding-school experience. And one of the girls in the family he
spent weekends with, Sarah Smith, now a writer for Facts on File in
Manhattan, made it her goal to loosen him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was afraid of offending people,'' she recalled. ``I talked
a lot, and he listened. Then finally I got him going, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The personality that emerged from living in two worlds is not
the back-slapping bonhomie of so many stock peddlers, but the truly
great salesman's trait of genuinely liking people.
</P>
<P>
   Svelte in a dark blue suit with gleaming black shoes and cuff
links shaped like bulls, he is able, in talking about even today's
roller-coaster market, to elicit a feeling that nothing would be
safer than assigning a nest egg to his care.
</P>
<P>
   While most of Principal's clients are blacks from Brooklyn, he
will make cold calls to anyone he thinks has money, and the better
part of the assets he manages are those of white classmates in
Connecticut and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Cash to be invested may be the crudest measure of the career
benefit Principal has reaped by injecting himself into the world of
privilege, but it is hardly the only one.
</P>
<P>
   Less concrete, but more important, is confidence, the belief
that he has every right to circulate among successful people.
Recalling his New Canaan days, he said: ``You learn to ignore the
fact that you are the only black student. You're there to learn and
be competitive.''

MCGWIRE BLASTS BACK INTO THE LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis.)  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ For the most part, the Milwaukee Brewers had been
smart this season when facing Mark McGwire. They had pitched him
low, high, inside, outside, whatever was necessary to avoid being
bashed.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy had been as successful as any against McGwire, the
St. Louis Cardinals' barrel-armed slugger, allowing him only two
home runs in eight games. But Friday night, rookie Rafael Roque
scrapped his team's plan and challenged McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a blast into the left-center-field bleachers,
estimated at 417 feet, that drove the crowd of 48,194 at Milwaukee
County Stadium into a frenzy, even though the two-run shot tied the
score at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Amid flashing cameras and screaming fans, Roque's fastball
rocketed off McGwire's bat, driving in Ray Lankford and increasing
McGwire's record-breaking season home run total to 64. It also
broke the deadlock that Chicago's Sammy Sosa had forged with his
63rd home run, a grand slam, on Wednesday night in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   It was McGwire's 451st career home run, and it moved him within
one of Carl Yastrzemski for 20th place on the career list.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who of late had been the hotter half of the
record-breaking duo, went 0-for-4 Friday at Wrigley Field in the
Cubs' 6-4 loss to Cincinnati and remained at 63.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday, McGwire had not homered in 18 at-bats since he
had surpassed Roger Maris' record of 61 on Sept. 8. Now, two homers
in four games have given him back the lead in a race in which he
trailed only once this season, and then for less than a game.
</P>
<P>
   While all of America, and much of the world, is keeping tabs on
the race between McGwire and Sosa, McGwire insisted before the game
that it meant little to him _ and that it would not bother him if
Sosa had more homers when the season ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it really matters,'' McGwire said at a news
conference. ``What he and I have been doing is fantastic. What
we've done nobody in the game has done for 37 years. I'm pretty
happy with the way things have been going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers were pretty happy until the fourth inning. Roque, a
left-hander, walked McGwire on six pitches in the first inning and
appeared to be heading that way in the fourth. But with the count
at 3-1, he threw a fastball down the center of the plate, and
McGwire got all of it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the ball and bat made contact, there was no doubt about
where it would land. Jason King, a 23-year-old Madison, Wis.,
native, was the lucky fan who retrieved McGwire's 64th home run
ball of the season. Diving from the stands into the exit well, he
tracked down the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd, salivating at McGwire's every stroke of the bat,
almost got another treat in the fifth inning when, after throwing
two balls high, reliever David Weathers put one in McGwire's power
zone. With one of his mighty cuts, McGwire drove the ball high and
into the upper deck, just 15 feet to the left of the left-field
foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Weathers' next pitch looked like No. 65 as well,
but McGwire's drive to right center field was caught by right
fielder Jeromy Burnitz at the front of the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire walked in the first inning and fouled out to the catcher
in the eighth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McGwire will have two more games to thrill Milwaukee's fans,
facing the Brewers on Saturday and Sunday. And then it will be
Sosa's turn. The Cubs play the Brewers on Tuesday and Wednesday,
and it's a safe bet that Sosa will put one, two or three balls over
the fences. In his 10 games this season against the Brewers, he has
homered 10 times.
</P>
<P>
   While some believe Sosa's success against Milwaukee could enable
him to pull ahead of McGwire in the final week of the season,
McGwire pays it no heed. The genuine respect and admiration that he
and Sosa share for one another might be one reason for McGwire's
professed couldn't-care-less attitude toward the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect each other tremendously,'' McGwire said. ``Here's
two guys from two different countries who have great sportsmanship,
really admire each other and really pull for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, McGwire said he would love it if he and Sosa
finished the race in a dead heat, and Friday he implied that Sosa
had received less attention from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's up to you,'' McGwire said to reporters. ``I would give
him as much publicity as I've gotten, and I encourage you to.''

INQUIRY LINKS RAUL SALINAS TO MEXICAN DRUG TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Adds 5 grafs at end. Other changes made throughout story for
clarification.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After a nearly three-year inquiry into drug
corruption in Mexico, Swiss police investigators have concluded
that a brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari played
a central role in Mexico's cocaine trade, raking in huge bribes to
protect the flow of drugs into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret, 369-page report, the investigators assert that
Salinas' elder brother, Raul, used his wide influence in the
administration to organize an elaborate network of protection for
drug smugglers. He also channeled drug money to his brother's
presidential campaign, the report alleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Carlos Salinas de Gortari became president of Mexico in
1988, Raul Salinas de Gortari assumed control over practically all
drug shipments through Mexico,'' the report states. ``Through his
influence and bribes paid with drug money, officials of the army
and the police supported and protected the flourishing drug
business.''
</P>
<P>
   From a low-profile position in the administration's
food-distribution agency, the report states, Raul Salinas
commandeered government trucks and railroad cars to haul cocaine
north. On what some of his reputed former associates referred to as
``green-light days,'' he arranged for drug loads to transit Mexico
without concern that they might be checked by the army, the coast
guard or the federal police.
</P>
<P>
   A partial copy of the report was obtained by The New York Times.
It appears to be based largely on interviews with almost 90 former
drug traffickers, reputed Salinas associates, and other, mostly
unidentified witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials said they expected it to be the basis for their
government's seizure in the coming weeks of more than $130 million
that Raul Salinas deposited in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Raul Salinas, who received a copy of the report
about two months ago, dismissed it Friday as the slanderous product
of a Swiss crusade to confiscate what they insist is a fortune that
their client earned by legitimate means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is absolutely false,'' Salinas' lead attorney,
Eduardo Luengo Creel, said in an interview. ``It contains
statements, assertions and situations that do not correspond to the
facts. It is a police report; it does not have the validity of an
evaluation by an investigating judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not even know who these people are,'' Luengo said of the
many confidential informants listed in the document. ``To accuse
someone with anonymous witnesses is unconstitutional in any country
that enjoys the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The report states that Swiss investigators were unable to
determine conclusively what involvement the former president, his
father and other family members might have had in the purportedly
illicit activities of Raul Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Some relatives, it implies, were among a group of people around
Raul Salinas who were implicated in criminal activities by
witnesses whom the report describes as ``principally credible''; it
does not name any of those people.
</P>
<P>
   The report also notes that the investigators did not look
further into the matter, because the people mentioned were
irrelevant to their inquiry into whether Salinas' Swiss funds came
from illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat obliquely, the report adds: ``We have to seriously
question the probability that a person with as much power as the
president of Mexico for years did not learn about criminal
activities of this extent, even if his brother was heavily
involved.'' Carlos Salinas has recently been living in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss report is by far the most exhaustive assessment to
date of Raul Salinas' reported dealings with the Mexican
underworld.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly a prosecutorial document, one that cites Salinas'
own version of events mostly to show how it appears to contradict
other facts. Because the seizure of Salinas' assets would be a
civil-court action, the report also aims at a considerably lower
threshold of proof than would be required in a criminal case.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Salinas was widely rumored to have grown rich on dubious
business dealings during his brother's presidency, but the
accusations were almost never public or specific. Shortly after
Carlos Salinas stepped down in December 1994, his chosen successor,
Ernesto Zedillo, shattered a long Mexican tradition of impunity for
presidential families by authorizing Raul Salinas' arrest on
charges that he ordered the murder of a leader of the governing
party who was Raul's former brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny maximum-security prison cell where Salinas has spent
the last three and a half years, he has been struck by wave after
wave of new allegations. Federal prosecutors in New York are
pressing ahead with a criminal investigation into the possibility
that he may have laundered illicit funds through his accounts at
Citibank headquarters in New York. And after a series of reversals
in their murder case, Mexican officials say they are close to
announcing new corruption charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Swiss evidence seems to come from witnesses who are
identified only by pseudonyms like ``Ludmilla'' and ``Juan,'' and
whose credibility is difficult to judge.
</P>
<P>
   Some claimed they had arranged the protection of drug shipments
with Salinas directly. Others, including bodyguards, chauffeurs and
secretaries, said they had attended meetings at which they saw
Salinas receive suitcases full of cash from smugglers. Still
others, including a U.S. drug-enforcement agent, testified to
matters they had learned about secondhand.
</P>
<P>
   As the true names of several of those witnesses have leaked out,
Salinas' lawyers have attacked their accounts. But even when the
informants are convicted criminals, the report often highlights
reasons that their claims are credible.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts in Switzerland and the United States predicted
that the confidentiality of the sources arrayed against Salinas
might well prove a weak point in the Swiss government's case. If a
seizure is ordered and lawyers for Salinas challenge it in court,
as they insist they will, the judge who evaluates the case will
have access to the witnesses' identities but the lawyers will not.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to law-enforcement officials in the United States,
who have studied Mexican drug corruption for years, the small team
of Swiss federal police investigators had virtually no background
in the subject. But since their arrest of Salinas' third wife,
Paulina Castanon, as she tried to retrieve phony passports with her
husband's picture from a Swiss safe-deposit box in November 1995,
the Swiss detectives managed to scour U.S. court files and jail
cells for anyone who might claim a link to their target.
</P>
<P>
   In at least a few such cases, U.S. law-enforcement officials
have acknowledged, those informants had been ignored or misused by
prosecutors in the United States until the Swiss sought them out.
The Swiss report also cites some confidential witnesses who are
described as people who once worked or socialized around Salinas,
and it contains what two American investigators described as a
meticulous analysis of his financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, what they have would be a triable case,'' said one
U.S. law-enforcement official who is familiar with the Swiss
evidence. ``It wouldn't be a slam-dunk, but you could definitely
take it to court.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   For the family of a former president who was once celebrated as
the bold architect of a new relationship between Mexico and the
United States _ the man who championed the North American Free
Trade Agreement and brought to power a new generation of
Ivy-educated technocrats _ the report paints a devastating
portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting unidentified former associates of the family, the report
contends that both Raul and Carlos were introduced to the drug
trade in the late 1970s by their father, Raul Salinas Lozano, a
former government minister. It did not make clear what that
introduction involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raul Salinas Lozano, with his political influence, would have
preferred Raul at the head of the government in Mexico,'' it
continues, quoting an informant close to the family to present a
dark new twist on an old story of brotherly ambition. ``But because
Raul Salinas de Gortari's infamous earlier life would not have
permitted him to hold a high-level government position, the father
decided to support his son Carlos instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Long before Carlos Salinas began to make his name in the
mid-1980s as Mexico's young, Harvard-trained budget minister, the
report suggests, his father had built a friendship with one of the
legendary figures of Mexico's northern-border drug trade, Juan
Guerra. Such a relationship has been reported in the past, and
angrily denied by Raul Salinas Lozano.
</P>
<P>
   The eldest son of the one-time border senator _ Salinas Lozano
was a dominant figure in the politics of his home state of Nuevo
Leon _ and a nephew of the trafficker, Juan Garcia Abrego,
inherited the connection, the report contends.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a series of former drug traffickers, the Swiss
investigators state that Raul Salinas began arranging protection
for both Garcia Abrego and traffickers of Colombia's Medellin
cartel even before his brother became president.
</P>
<P>
   One of those traffickers, identified as ``Giuseppe,'' appears to
be Jose Manuel Ramos, a former Colombian cocaine distributor who
operated out of northern Mexico and Texas until his arrest in 1990.
Three U.S. law-enforcement officials familiar with his case
described Ramos, who remains in prison, as highly credible.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ramos and his wife, Luz Salazar, (the ``Ludmilla'' of the
report) referred the Swiss detectives to payment ledgers and other
documents that had been seized at the time of their arrest.
According to the report, the documents helped to corroborate that
from 1987 to 1989 they paid Salinas $28.7 million on behalf of
their boss, Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha.
</P>
<P>
   Another convicted trafficker who gushes with information about
Raul Salinas, Marco Enrique Torres, has weaker bona fides.
</P>
<P>
   While the report notes some corroboration of Torres' account by
an FBI agent who pursued his case, Orlando Munoz, it fails to note
Salinas' denials that he ever knew Torres. Nor does it raise
questions about the more improbable parts of his tale of a long
criminal friendship between a midlevel drug smuggler and a member
of the Mexican political aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Once Carlos Salinas became president at the end of 1988, the
report states, his brother's power to ensure the safe northward
passage of drugs grew sharply.
</P>
<P>
   While Garcia Abrego was growing into the man whom U.S.
drug-enforcement officials considered the biggest cocaine
trafficker in Mexico, the report cites a series of witnesses as
stating that Raul Salinas was developing ties with a number of
other major Mexican and Colombian traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Juan'' and several other Swiss informants,
Salinas used his high-level posts at two Mexican food agencies,
Conasupo and Diconsa, to ship cocaine in government planes and
trucks and to launder drug money through government accounts. But
the report does not appear to offer any other evidence to document
those claims.

THOUSANDS ARE DELAYED AS CONRAIL FREIGHT TRAIN DERAILS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (js) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A double-decker car on a Conrail freight train
slammed into a railway overpass in the Bronx early Friday, causing
a derailment that severely disrupted service on the Hudson line of
the Metro-North commuter railway for much of the day and left
thousands of commuters scrambling to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Conrail officials acknowledged that the freight train should not
have been loaded with a double-decker car on that rail line, and
the accident underscored how any disruption on the heavily
overburdened rail lines can affect the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one was injured in the accident, which involved a
125-car Conrail freight train traveling into New York City from
Albany, it hobbled train service not only on the Hudson line but
also on the Harlem and New Haven lines, whose tracks were
temporarily closed because of the derailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get to work at the usual time,'' said Nadine C.
Johnson, a Manhattan lawyer who lives in Ossining, N.Y., and was
forced with hundreds of other riders on the Hudson line to get off
her train in the Bronx and transfer for a long subway ride into
midtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I considered not going at all,'' she said. And after being
``really rattled'' by a radio report that commuters might find no
service when they wanted to return home from Manhattan, she said
she was relieved to find that delays were the worst she would face
in her commute.
</P>
<P>
   Long delays continued into the evening for passengers on the
Hudson line, which the freight train was using when it derailed,
scattering twisted pieces of metal and other debris on the sidings
near River Avenue and 153rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Metro-North spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said service on all its
lines would resume normal weekend schedules Saturday, and was
expected to be running normally for weekday commuters on Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The delays Friday angered and frustrated riders from Stamford,
Conn., to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., but also gave many an excuse to
extend their weekend, or at least prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually helped me,'' said Elizabeth Nolan of Tarrytown,
N.Y., who works as an administrator at a Manhattan clothing
company, and who said she heard of the derailment on the radio at
5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   She seized upon the opportunity to postpone her early morning
commute, and stayed at home long enough to bake cookies and run
errands before boarding a train that deposited her at the Marble
Hill station, where she then transferred to a subway, at 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can leave Westchester with a clear mind,'' she said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Far less sanguine, however, were senior officials of Conrail,
Metro-North and the New York state Department of Transportation,
for whom the accident provided a glaring example of the dangers
inherent in an overburdened rail system.

   Ms. Anders said several government agencies, including the
National Transportation Safety Board, were investigating the cause
of the accident. ``This is a case where some poor soul simply put a
car on that train that was too big to get under the overpass,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responsibility for the freight train and the configuration of
its cars rests with Conrail, which for decades has used portions of
the track owned by Metro-North to haul freight on long trains that
make their way in and out of the city, mainly to Albany and
elsewhere in the country in the hours before dawn, when the tracks
would otherwise be idle.

 Bright Prospects Illuminate Dim Offices at Juniper Networks   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Walking into the Mountain View office of Juniper Networks, the
first thing I noticed was that it was nearly as dark as a movie
theater.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Being a startup, I wondered if Juniper was strapped for cash and
behind in its light bill.
</P>
<P>
   No, said chief executive Scott Kriens. Juniper has $35 million
in venture funding in the bank. Its engineers simply prefer working
in subdued light.
</P>
<P>
   And after listening to their story, I couldn't argue with their
quirks. Over the past two years, Juniper's 45-person engineering
team invented five microprocessors that were collectively far more
complex that a Pentium II chip.
</P>
<P>
   These special-purpose processors form the core of a new router
that Juniper announced last week. This router is designed to break
one of the Internet's bottlenecks _ the backup that occurs when the
data from slow copper wires must be translated into the speedy
light pulses that travel over fiber optic lines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Juniper announced the commercial availability of its
new router and said it can perform about 10 times faster than the
fastest box from market-leader Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juniper is the most credible threat to Cisco in the high-end
router space,'' said Aman Kapoor, an analyst with RHK, a
telecommunications market research firm in South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that bullish assessment goes back to those chips,
designed by a team led by Juniper founder Pradeep Sindhu and
colleague Bjorn Liencres.
</P>
<P>
   As Kriens explained it, today's routers _ the hardware boxes
that direct electronic traffic on the Internet _ are based on the
same microprocessors found in computers. When faced with the
compute-intensive task of translating digital bits into optical
pulses, they slow down.
</P>
<P>
   Juniper's chips were designed to expedite this
digital-to-optical conversion. Who would want such a
special-purpose router? Internet service providers, for instance,
who collect signals from copper phone lines and ship them
cross-country on fiber optic backbones.
</P>
<P>
   Several large ISPs, such as UUNET, have been testing Juniper's
$100,000 boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Kriens downplays Juniper as some sort of Cisco-killer. ``Some
day maybe we'll have to take money from Cisco to eat,'' he said.
But for the near term, he'd be content to pick at the crumbs in the
growing Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco declined comment on Juniper, much as Godzilla might ignore
a newt scampering at its feet.
</P>
<P>
   But Lin DeNoia, an analyst with Strategic Networks in
Massachusetts, said Juniper had the allies to help it get big,
fast. IBM is making its chips. Contract manufacturing giant
Solectron is assembling its routers. Juniper's investors, including
Lucent, Nortel, AT&AMP;T and WorldCom, can help it gain entree to key
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The real decision facing network startups in these days of
consolidation is whether to stay independent and go public, or sell
out to a larger firm.
</P>
<P>
   I put this question to Kriens, who co-founded StrataCom, another
network firm that Cisco acquired two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll stay independent,'' Kriens said. ``Not for the ego of
it, but because we can build more value than anyone would be
willing to pay for us now.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Failing grade?  &LR; A recent column about a possible tech-backed
initiative to do a ``hostile takeover'' of public education sparked
an avalanche of comments.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was TechNet President Reed Hastings' critique that
the column painted all Silicon Valley execs as being of one mind on
education reform.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, there are at least three schools of thought
among Valley execs on public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Some execs favor strong doses of privatization and competition,
perhaps through vouchers, to shake up public educators.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like TechNet and the American Electronics Association,
are lobbying for reforms in Sacramento, like letting parents choose
which public schools their kids attend, or ending automatic grade
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   A third strain, exemplified by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley,
eschews lobbying in favor of direct action _ putting volunteers and
money into selected schools to train teachers, wire classrooms, and
enrich reading and science programs.
</P>
<P>
   Into this complicated landscape I lobbed my literary grenade. As
punishment, I'll write 100 times: ``I will not oversimplify.''
</P>
<P>

MEGA-MANSION IN HAMPTONS IS MERELY A HOME, LAWYERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ A man's home may be his castle, but lawyers
and the public spent hours Friday night debating whether the
castle-size complex being built by Ira Rennert really is his home _
as defined by local zoning law _ or is actually a hotel, conference
center or religious school in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking publicly about the project for the first time,
Rennert's lawyers argued that the sprawling limestone mansion,
occupying about 100,000 square feet on 63 oceanfront acres, is a
single-family home and legally qualifies as such. They opposed
litigation seeking to halt its construction.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the angry neighbors contended that in its
entirety _ with 25 bedrooms, 39 bathrooms, a 1,100-square-foot
theater, a restaurant-size kitchen, an 80-foot-long pool, beach and
garden pavilions, bowling alleys, exercise and game rooms and
courts for basketball, squash and tennis _ the project adds up to
something far beyond a single-family home.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its legal status, experts say that the Rennert complex
_ called Fair Field _ would be the largest in the nation, exceeding
such grand residences as the White House, the Hearst castle in San
Simeon, Calif., and Bill Gates' mansion in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders on both sides of the issue faced off here at the third
and final hearing held by the Southampton Zoning Board of Appeals.
After overflow crowds of hundreds of opponents at the earlier
sessions, Friday night's meeting drew closer to 100.
</P>
<P>
   The board is considering the opponents' demand that it rescind
the building permits issued for the project. In the meantime, work
on the project continues apace.
</P>
<P>
   The official who granted the permits, Paul Houlihan, the town's
chief building inspector, defended his decision. ``This appeal is
based on the fact that the homeowners association feels the house
is too big, and that is the only issue before us,'' he testified.
``If a dwelling meets our definition of a single-family dwelling,
there is nothing in the town code to limit the size of the dwelling
or the number of bedrooms.'' He added that ``the Rennert dwelling
fully complies with those regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the zoning board is awaiting the lawyers' final briefs, and
no vote is expected before November. Whichever way the board rules,
both Rennert and his critics are prepared to file suit immediately
in state Supreme Court to overturn the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rennert, an investor said to be worth $500 million, runs the
Renco Group, a holding company with estimated annual gross revenues
of $2.5 billion. He paid $11 million for the Fair Field site, and
construction costs are estimated at several times that.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rennert's lawyers argued that the board must uphold the building
permits. ``The people are frustrated; the people want to stop the
work,'' conceded one lawyer, Anthony Tohill. But he said, ``There
is no basis on which you could grant the relief requested.'' The
critics are engaging in ``fantasy'' when they say the project is
really a hotel, conference center or school, he said, and the
courts bar premature enforcement against ``possible future illegal
uses.'' Instead, he said, ``the key is the actual use'' of the
property.
</P>
<P>
   His co-counsel, Martin Gilmartin, said: `` Rennert has been
viciously attacked. The level of hostility is almost palpable. He
has said in simple terms that this is to be his residence.''
Although ``no one knows what is in Rennert's mind, we think Rennert
has designed this mansion as his residence,'' he said. ``We believe
his stated intention.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition was led by the Sagaponack Homeowners Association,
which was formed to fight the project. That group's lawyer, John
Shea, told the board: ``If this is a one-family residence, then we
are headed for years of chaos in land development. This is, from
the ground up, commercial in nature. The complex cannot by any
stretch of the imagination be considered a single-family
residence.''
</P>
<P>
   One critic, David Worby, said the large, institutional nature of
Fair Field raised a legitimate question on its real use, ``and we
shouldn't be afraid of addressing that.''

FOR GIANTS, SUCCESS IS OFTEN SHORT ON THIRD DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ After two games, the 1-1 New York Giants
are last in the National Football League in one statistical
category: third-down efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bad one to claim as your own.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants have converted 3-of-26 third-down opportunities, an
11.5 percent success ratio in a league in which the average team's
third-down efficiency this season has been 36.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What has been going wrong for the Giants? Everything. Even luck
has not been on their side. But the biggest problem on third down
is the same one that has negatively affected every facet of the
Giants' offense: an anemic running game.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Giants have averaged only 2.9 yards a carry this
season, they have faced unusually long second- and third-down
plays. On average, the Giants on third down have needed 8.6 yards
to pick up the first down. Twelve of their 26 third-down plays have
been third-and-9 or longer. The Giants have had two third-and-24s,
a third-and-18 and two third-and-13s.
</P>
<P>
   That's the story on the bad play. Here's the lowdown on the bad
luck:
</P>
<P>
   Four times on third down, the Giants have fallen 1 yard short of
the first down, getting 14 yards when they needed 15, 10 yards when
they needed 11, 3 yards when they needed 4 and 1 yard when they
needed 2.
</P>
<P>
   Short-yardage situations have been no better. The Giants have
had two third-and-1's and one third-and-2. No first downs in any of
those attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third down hasn't been good because of first down,'' Giants
Coach Jim Fassel said. ``It hasn't been good because of penalties,
too, and a lack of execution. We had this trouble last year early,
and we corrected it by running the football better on first and
second down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made the third-down situations more manageable. We picked
up a few first downs and the confidence rose and we started to play
better. There's a momentum effect. The numbers improved
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finished last year with a third-down efficiency
percentage of 31.2.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery for Sehorn
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Jason Sehorn underwent surgery Friday to reconstruct
his anterior cruciate ligament, which was torn in a preseason game
Aug. 20. The surgical procedure, which calls for pieces of the
patellar tendon in the knee to be used to re-create the anterior
cruciate ligament, was performed by the team physician Russell
Warren at the Hospital for Special Surgery/Cornell Medical Center
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn's medial collateral ligament, also torn Aug. 20, has been
healing with rest and rehabilitation and was not a part of Friday's
surgery, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Warren told us the surgery was successful,'' Jim Fassel
said. ``There were no complications.''
</P>
<P>
   Galyon Listed as Doubtful
</P>
<P>
   Nickel linebacker Scott Galyon was downgraded to doubtful for
Monday night's game against the Dallas Cowboys at Giants Stadium.
Galyon, who has a sore Achilles' tendon and a calf muscle pull in
his right leg, has not practiced this week. Galyon, a key defender
in passing situations, had 12 tackles against the Cowboys in two
games last season.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Marcus Buckley and left guard Greg Bishop also did
not practice Friday, but coach Jim Fassel said he expected each to
play Monday. Bishop has started every Giants game the last four
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Wheatley continued to get plenty of work with the
first-string offense. It is very likely that he will be activated
for Monday's game, for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   All-Pro linebacker Jessie Armstead sprained his right ankle in
the season-opening game against Washington and has only four
unassisted tackles in the first two games. Armstead's ankle has
improved, and he is promising a strong performance against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to lead the team in tackles,'' said Armstead, who
grew up in the Dallas area. In 16 games last year, Armstead made
101 unassisted tackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of Jessie's game is seeing and reacting,'' Fassel
said. ``He goes by instinct and he goes at 100 miles an hour. You
take that edge off with an injury, and he can become a regular
guy.''

`LOS SUPER SEVEN': OF MEXICO, LAUGHTER AND TEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe it's a fond backward glance as the end of the
century approaches. Maybe it's a symbolic resistance to cultural
homogenization. Maybe it's the graying of a generation of rockers.
And maybe it's only a matter of musicians seizing a chance to
record songs they love.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, a confederation of Mexican-American
musicians _ including Freddy Fender, three members of Los Lobos,
country singer Rick Trevino and a longtime Tejano singer, Ruben
Ramos _ along with the Texan songwriter Joe Ely got together to
record an album of old songs as Los Super Seven, and they regrouped
to perform on Thursday night at the Bowery Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The only missing member was Flaco Jimenez, the great Tex-Mex
accordionist, who mysteriously chose to make a rare New York
appearance on Wednesday night at the Rodeo Bar instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Super Seven'' (RCA) is a glimpse into the past like
``Buena Vista Social Club,'' the collection of vintage Cuban songs.
But where the Cubans perform songs from their own generation, ``Los
Super Seven'' pays tribute to songs the musicians grew up hearing.
And while the album has some of the nostalgia that suffuses ``Buena
Vista Social Club,'' most of ``Los Super Seven'' is filled with
rambunctious affection that turned even more ebullient onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Tex-Mex or norteno songs balance laughter and tears. The singers
often pine for what they've lost: women, mostly, but also places
and times left behind. Their voices are filled with drama verging
on the maudlin, with aching vibrato and sobbing flourishes. But the
music doesn't let the singers wallow too much. Bouncy,
accordion-topped Mexican polkas, clip-clopping cumbias, sprightly
waltzes and propulsive, flamenco-tinged sones jarochos insist that
despair won't interfere with dancing.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bowery Ballroom, Los Super Seven actually numbered 11
musicians, including two invaluable members of the Austin band Los
Aztex: Max Baca on bajo sexto (acoustic bass guitar) or drums and
Joel Guzman on button accordion, whose solos darted and tootled and
raced. David Hidalgo, from Los Lobos, variously handled drums,
guitar, fiddle and requinto, a small guitar used for staccato
syncopations.
</P>
<P>
   With his pure, tender voice, Hidalgo also took his turn among
the lead singers, each conveying his own kind of ardency: Trevino
with a supple croon, Ramos with grainy authority, Cesar Rosas (of
Los Lobos) with a touch of a growl. Ely recharged folk-rock's
Mexican connections, singing Woody Guthrie's ``Deportee'' and Tom
Russell's ``Gallo de Cielo,'' a song about cockfighting.
</P>
<P>
   Fender sang a bolero from the 1930s, ``Piensa en Mi,'' in a
gently archaic style. Even Guzman took a lead vocal in ``La
Pajarilla,'' jumping and twirling with his accordion as Hidalgo's
drums kicked the music into an irresistible oompah.
</P>
<P>
   For encores, the time line moved forward, as Fender sang his
norteno-flavored mid-1970s hits ``Before the Next Teardrop Falls''
and ``Wasted Days and Wasted Nights'' and the whole group charged
into Sam the Sham's 1965 blockbuster, ``Woolly Bully.'' The songs
were reminders that rock has been hospitable to a Mexican tinge,
and could be again.

CHURCH GROUP ESCAPES TAX IN AREA ZONED FOR BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.M.)  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT PLEASANT, N.Y. _ An order of Roman Catholic priests is
entitled to a religious tax exemption on its 265-acre conference
and training center here despite town leaders' insistence that the
property was ineligible because it was zoned for business only, a
state judge has ruled in a decision announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Denis Donovan, of state Supreme Court in White Plains,
sided with the church group, the Legion of Christ, which bought the
sprawling property two years ago from IBM for about $35 million.
The order had sued the town for tax relief, and the town
countersued, asserting that the property, which is now a seminary
and religious conference center, was violating the zoning law and
depriving the town of tax money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to appeal,'' said Robert Meehan, supervisor of
Mount Pleasant, a town of 40,000 in central Westchester County.
``IBM took that property, and they turned it on its ear. Up until
that point, they were good neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the property was sold, IBM paid about $1.4 million a year
in local taxes, and provided 2 percent of municipal tax revenues
and 5 percent of the school tax base, Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   Judges have long held that towns cannot withhold religious tax
exemptions because of residential zoning, but this case may have
been the first test in New York state that concerned commercial
zoning, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Church-owned property is exempt in residential districts,''
said Jerome Kurtz, a professor of tax law at New York University
Law School. ``My impression is that if you have a church in a
business district, you still can't tax the church. I'm not
surprised at the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Marwell, the lawyer for the Legion of Christ, said the
town's lawsuit failed on the zoning issue because the religious
group uses the campus in precisely the same manner that IBM did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When IBM used this as a conference center, men and women in
business suits came and stayed,'' Marwell said. ``They studied
marketing, computer science and what have you. Now you have men who
wear black suits and different kinds of collars, and they study
theology and philosophy. The actual use of the property has not
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The legion is one of the fastest-growing Catholic orders in the
world, said Jay Dunlap, its communications director and a lay
follower. Founded in 1941 in Mexico City, it is a missionary order
that now has 400 ordained priests and 2,500 members.
</P>
<P>
   The order, which still draws most of its members from Mexico,
has two smaller schools, a high school seminary in New Hampshire
and a two-year novitiate in Connecticut. The campus here, called
the Thornwood Conference Center, has a gym, auditorium, classrooms
and 225 hotel-like rooms. It also has 163 acres of undeveloped
land.

WELLS IMPROVES RECORD, BUT PETTITTE'S A PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ David Wells was manager Joe Torre's conundrum a year
ago. With moods and habits Torre could not understand, Wells
dropped to the back of Torre's rotation in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Wells is the anchor of the staff. His record is 18-4 after
the Yankees beat Baltimore Friday night, 15-5, and Torre is
watching comfortably from the Yankees' dugout. Wells is almost
certain to start the Yankees' first game in the American League
playoffs, which begin Sept. 29, and Torre's puzzler this year is
what to do with Andy Pettitte, Orlando Hernandez and Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   Torre prefers postseason experience, and he remembers Pettitte
contributing a sensational performance against Atlanta to help the
Yankees win the 1996 World Series. But lately, Pettitte has been
the least effective of the five starters, and Torre acknowledged
Friday that he might not be part of the playoff rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a chance,'' said Torre. ``There's always a chance. It
comes down to the information you have and what you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells and David Cone are virtually assured of starts in the
playoffs, with Pettitte, Irabu and Hernandez vying for the other
two spots. Pettitte would probably be part of the Yankees' playoff
rotation if the postseason started Friday. But the playoffs are
still 10 days away, and Torre said he could not ignore what he had
been seeing and what he would see in the last days of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Torre has been seeing:
</P>
<P>
   _ On Monday, Hernandez pitched a three-hit shutout against
Boston, a potential playoff opponent, allowing no walks and
striking out nine. Hernandez, a rookie, is 10-4 with a 3.25 earned
run average, and he has demonstrated the ability to stifle lineups
thick with right-handed hitters, like the Texas Rangers, whom the
Yankees could face in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   _ On Thursday, Irabu pitched eight scoreless innings against
Tampa Bay, surrendering just two hits and two walks while striking
out five. The Devil Rays have the league's worst offensive team,
but Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach, said Irabu's
pitching was so good that he could have beaten any team, with any
set of hitters. Going into that start, Irabu had allowed 30 runs in
his last 201/3 innings, but all the while Stottlemyre was saying
Irabu was making solid adjustments in his bullpen workouts and was
capable of breaking out of his slump at any time. He did against
the Devil Rays. Irabu (12-9, 4.19 era) has no postseason
experience, and his performance Thursday could have been an
aberration. But Irabu may have two more starts to show he is for
real. His next outing is next week against Cleveland, another
possible playoff opponent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pettitte allowed six runs in six innings Wednesday against
Tampa Bay, the latest in a series of poor outings that began Aug.
9. Pettitte seems to be healthy, reflected in the velocity of his
fastball on Wednesday: 90 to 93 miles an hour. But he is pressing,
and as a result he is making crucial mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   He is 16-10 with a 4.27 era, and opponents are batting .274
against him, as opposed to .234 versus Irabu and .223 versus
Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte has the experience Torre loves, and he has shown he can
get better when he needs to get better. Pettitte seems to have
allowed his anxiousness to overcome his ability, but both Irabu and
Hernandez have had moments when they have permitted frustration and
inexperience to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Torre has another week to think about the decision and consult
with the coaches, considering any number of options.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte could start Game 2 of a series against Texas at Yankee
Stadium, but Torre must consider the possibility of resting his
hopes on Pettitte even after losing Game 1; Pettitte could start
Game 3 or 4 in Texas, but he has pitched terribly at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Torre also could use Hernandez in Game 2 and Cone in Game 3, and
perhaps, Irabu in Game 4 if Pettitte does not improve.

   LOS ANGELES _ When Merlyn Melendez found $300 in a money pouch
next to a soda machine, she thought of all the things she might
buy. After all, the 10-year-old doesn't get an allowance.
</P>
<P>
   But then Merlyn remembered what she had learned in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it's just not right to keep someone else's money,''
said Merlyn, a perky fifth-grader at St. Genevieve's Elementary
School.
</P>
<P>
   So she gave back the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother's friend said, Why didn't you keep it? But I knew
that was wrong,'' she said. ``You take it, and it comes back
because they'll find out who stole it _ and the Coca-Cola man would
have to pay for it if no one turned it in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, administrators at St. Genevieve's held a special
assembly to honor Merlyn in front of all her classmates for her
good deed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an example of what it means to live out our Christian
values, and that's what I told the students,'' said Sister Francina
Vivier, principal of the Catholic elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   With some 500 fellow students looking on, Merlyn was rewarded
with a certificate of appreciation, two tickets to Disneyland and
20 cases of Fruitopia juice drink to share with her classmates.
</P>
<P>
   All that was courtesy of the Coca-Cola distribution plant in
Sylmar because a driver inadvertently left the money pouch Tuesday
atop a pay phone next to vending machines at St. Genevieve's.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most proudest of Merlyn was her older brother, Mario
Melendez Jr., 17, a senior at the high school next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a little kid to see that much money, what a temptation,''
he said. ``If it was my situation, I don't know what I'd do or what
other high schoolers would do. I think she'll grow up to be
righteous, big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mario was in the middle of football practice when his sister
showed him the small blue bag, labeled ``No. 10'' and bulging with
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I didn't think it was anything, like $5 or $10,''
Mario said. ``I saw the stack of bills when my principal showed it
to me and I was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Greiner, cold-drink manager at a nearby Coca-Cola plant,
said Merlyn certainly deserved to be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We truly appreciate her honesty _ and getting the money
back,'' Greiner said.
</P>
<P>
   Merlyn's find came when she was standing near the gym after her
volleyball practice was canceled. She said she spied the money bag
on top of the pay phone and grabbed it with a quick hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the school's to buy books or for ice cream,
because they're always selling ice cream here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Merlyn said she did not think twice about giving the money
to one of the school's coaches for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Merlyn got the soda she had wanted that afternoon
but could not afford or bring herself to buy with the money she had
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked one of our volleyball coaches what she should do
because she wanted $1 to buy a soda, so the coach gave her a dollar
of his own because he was so proud of her for turning in a big bag
of money,'' said the school's athletic director, Thom Alvarez.
