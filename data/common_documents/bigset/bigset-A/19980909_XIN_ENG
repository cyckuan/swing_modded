<HEADLINE> ASEAN Not to Consider Cambodia's Membership Until </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Member nations of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have unanimously
agreed not to discuss Cambodia's membership until a new legitimate
government is formed in that country, Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local television station Channel 9 Tuesday quoted Surin as
saying that Cambodia's general election in July has yet to be
transformed into political solidarity and the situation in the
country is far from stable.
</P>
<P>
Surin said Thailand had discussed with other ASEAN nations
about Cambodia's membership. They agreed that it is not the right
time to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ASEAN countries hoped that the new Cambodian
government can be formed smoothly and be recognized by the
Cambodian people as well as the international community, Surin
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Thai Foreign Ministry confirmed that
Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen had submitted a letter to his
Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai, requesting the latter to ask the
ASEAN foreign ministers who will meet in New York at the end of
this month to allow Cambodia's entry.
</P>
<P>
Back in July 1997, ASEAN had planned to include Cambodia, Laos
and Myanmar into the organization to realize its ambition of a
greater ASEAN of ten countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue of Cambodia's membership was shelved after
bloody clashes broke out between the two ruling parties of the
country in the same month.
</P>
<P>
General elections were held in Cambodia in July 26, 1998, in
which Hun Sen's People's Party won a comfortable victory.
</P>
<P>
Despite allegations by the opposition Funcipec and Sam Rainsy
parties of election frauds in some areas, the ASEAN has announced
its acceptance of the election results.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups nine countries -- Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Laos, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Hard Currency Reserves Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The hard currency reserves
of the Romanian National Bank stood at 2.306 billion U.S. dollars
by the end of August, 11.85 percent lower than in July.
</P>
<P>
The largest hard currency reserve in the central bank was
registered in July 1998, while the lowest was seen in August 1998,
according to a report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Because of demands by foreign investors to have their capital
and profits repatriated as a result of the financial crisis in
Russia, the bank intervened in sales in the second half of August,
which contributed to a drain in the bank's hard currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
But Mugur Isarescu, the central bank's governor, said the
financial crisis in Russia will not seriously influence Romania's
currency. He further predicted that Romania's currency will only
depreciate by 1-2 percent monthly.
</P>
<P>
On August 31, the national currency unit, the leu, depreciated
by 2 percent compared to that of August 3, showing a higher
depreciation rate compared to the 0.76, 1.76 and 1.8 percent
depreciation rate registered in July, June and May this year.

<HEADLINE> Big Oil Field Found at Sea off Northwest Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A big offshore oil field has
been discovered 1,356 meters under the sea level in No. 17 Water
Region near the Cabinda enclave in the north, according to a
press release issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Angola National Oil Company announced in the release that
the Lirio I Well sunk in the Region has been pumping out an
estimated amount of 11,000 barrels of quality crude oil per day.
</P>
<P>
This is the second well found by Elf Exploration Angola, a
subsidiary of the French Elf Corporation.  On March 11 this
year, Elf Angola also sank a well capable of putting out 12,000
barrels of oil per day in No. 17 Water Region near Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The company will soon make further exploration to identify the
actual oil reserves in the area.
</P>
<P>
Angola is one of the biggest oil producers in Africa, turning
out 750,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a series of rich oil fields have been found
in the waters of northwestern Angola with a total identified
reserve of over five billion barrels. But currently, foreign oil
exploration companies such as AMOCO, EXXO, and Mobil are drilling
in these waters on lease.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has planned to greatly increase its oil
output, aiming to produce one million barrels per day by 2000 and
1.3 million barrels per day by 2003.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Call for End to Congo (K) Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of countries relevant
to the armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
have signed a joint communique in Zimbabwe Tuesday urging a
cease-fire to the five-week long armed conflict there.
</P>
<P>
The communique, reached by leaders of Rwanda, Uganda,
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, Zambia and Congo (K) was read out by
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity Salim
Ahmed Salim, Radio Uganda reported Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
It calls for end to hostility and an immediate cease-fire
between the two warring factions, urging withdrawal of foreign
troops from the war-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of the Tutsi rebels in Congo are said to
have left before the signing of the communique and they claimed
that the communique is not binding for them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The document also said defense ministers of the above
countries will continue to discuss the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Congo, Africa's third largest country in Ethiopia on
September 10.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Laurent Kabila has accused Rwanda and
Uganda of sending troops to back rebels in his country, but both
countries denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
With the escalating of the conflict, Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia sent troops to Congo to help embattled Kabila in
mid-August, turning the tide of war against the rebels since.
</P>
<P>
This summit was called by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
at the summit meeting of the Non-Alignment Movement held in
Durban, South Africa last week.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Prime Minister Accuses Syria of Hostility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz Tuesday blasted Syria for its hostility
towards Turkey by supporting the anti-Turkish Kurdish separatists.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who speaks hostility in the region with hostile
attitudes should focus on the policies of the Syrian government
that encourages separatist terrorism in the region," he said in
the West Bank city after meeting with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz's remarks came in response to claims by Syrian
newspapers that Turkey's military alliance with Israel was
bringing more tensions to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have been at odds over sovereignty issues,
water rights, and the alleged Syrian support for Kurdish rebels
fighting for independence in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Syria fears that the growing military cooperation between
Israel and Turkey could leave it encircled by an enemy coalition.
</P>
<P>
Trying to reassure its skeptical neighbors, Yilmaz has
reiterated during his visits to Jordan and Israel which preceded
his visit to Ramallah that his country's military ties with
Israel would not pose a threat to any other country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
early 1996 when they signed a defense cooperation deal.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has allowed Israeli pilots to use its air space for
training, and Israel has been upgrading Turkish fighter planes
with its advanced technologies. The two sides have also conducted
joint naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier in Jerusalem Monday after his talks with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Yilmaz brushed aside
Syria's criticism of his Israeli visit.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, I don't care how Syria comments on my visit (to
Israel). Everyone is aware of the hostile intentions of Syria
towards Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish leader confirmed Tuesday that Turkey and Israel
plan to conduct joint naval maneuvers in November this year. The
two sides held their first joint naval exercise in January.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Haaretz quoted security sources as saying
Tuesday that Egypt and Jordan have been invited to join the
Israeli-Turkish exercises, but Yilmaz refused to confirm this.
</P>
<P>
Asked about Turkey's position on the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, Yilmaz urged Israel to accept a U.S. plan that
calls for a 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
in exchange for Palestinian measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides must take constructive steps to get this peace
process out of the freeze it is in," he said.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has already accepted the U.S. plan but Israel said it
would endorse it only on condition that 3 percent of the land be
designated as a nature reserve, where Israel retains full security
control.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said Turkey and the PNA have signed cooperation
agreements in the fields of culture, education and the
environment.

ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Parliament Speaker
Hikmet Cetin said here Tuesday that Turkey is willing to promote
cooperation with China in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Cetin made the remark during a meeting with a visiting Chinese
women delegation headed by Li Xiaolin, vice-president of the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign
Countries (CPAFFC).
</P>
<P>
Cetin said Turkey always attaches great importance to its
relations with China and is ready to develop economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there is great potential in enhancing economic
cooperation between Turkey and China, which should be further
tapped through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament speaker said that the Turco-Chinese
ties should be promoted not only through official contacts of the
two governments, but also through the people-to-people exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Li Xiaolin, for her part, said that the Sino-Turkish relations
have been smoothly developing in recent years, laying a solid
foundation for the non-governmental contacts.
</P>
<P>
She said the CPAFFC will work for better understanding and
friendship between the peoples of China and other countries
including Turkey.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Annan's Reference to Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- India Tuesday rejected
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan's reference to Jammu
and Kashmir, asserting that there was no increase in tension with
its arch-rival Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his annual report on the eve of the U.N. General
Assembly session, said, "The rising tension between India and
Pakistan over Kashmir and other issues is also a major cause of
concern."
</P>
<P>
Sharply reacting to the reference, a spokesman of India's
External Affairs Ministry said that "there is no increase in
tension" between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman termed Annan's report as a "routine feature"
which is submitted every year to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"References to the Jammu and Kashmir have been included in the
U.N. Secretary General's report since 1993," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the U.N.'s work last year, Annan also clubbed the
Kashmir issue with the deadlocked peace process in Cyprus, the
turmoil in Afghanistan and the stalemate in the Middle East peace
process, and listed the issue as one of the causes of concern
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Indian foreign ministry spokesman said that both India and
Pakistan had arrived at an understanding on how to start their
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"The process is expected to be resumed after final instructions
are given by the prime ministers of India and Pakistan at their
meeting in New York on September 23," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif met for the first time in Sri Lanka at
the end of July which produced little results as both sides blamed
each other for the continued standoff.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled meeting between the two leaders during the recent
summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in South Africa was canceled at
the last minute because of "pressing engagements" at home of the
Pakistani leader.
</P>
<P>
There is no sign of softening of positions on Kashmir from both
India and Pakistan with New Delhi rejecting any third party
involvement in resolving the dispute while Islamabad wants an
internationally supervised referendum to determine whether the
region should be folded into India or the latter.

<HEADLINE> Convicts Appeal Against Death Sentence in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen people condemned to
death in Sierra Leone last month have appealed against their
sentences and waited for hearings of their cases at the Appeal
Court, Justice Minister Solomon Berewa said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said the 16 civilians including five
journalists were found guilty on August 25 of collaborating with
the army junta which overthrew President Ahmad Fejan Kabbah for
10 months.
</P>
<P>
Among those condemned to death are former junta spokesman
Allieu Kamara, junta's Central Bank Governor Christian Kargbo,
former Director-General of the Sierra Leone Broadcasting
Corporation and a female broadcaster who gave birth to a baby in
prison in July.
</P>
<P>
Under Sierra Leonian law, the convicts have 21 days to appeal
against their sentences and if the Appeal Court fails to hear the
cases, they can turn to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Failure there would force them to throw themselves on the
mercy of a special committee and ultimately the president of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since President Kabbah resumed office last March from exile in
Guinea, a total of 60 civilians and 38 junta soldiers were put on
trial.

ALMA-ATA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan's President

Addressing a press conference in the presidential residence,
Nazarbayev attributed his conclusion to the separation of the two

the end of August.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Raps Israeli-Turkish Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
Tuesday accused Turkey and Israel of attempting to besiege the
Middle East militarily and politically under the auspices of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries are trying to lay a siege in order to block
the region, Syria and Lebanese people's resistance movement,"
Hrawi said when meeting with representatives of a Lebanese
non-governmental party.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Arab people must be aware and keep alert
against this manoeuvre as they did in the past.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi highly praised Lebanon's anti-Israeli resistance
movement, saying that it is aimed at restoring Lebanon's land and
its legitimate right.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi's comments came as Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
is visiting Israel as part of his regional tour that also includes
Jordan and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the West Bank city Ramallah after meeting
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday, Yilmaz refuted the
Syrian criticism of his visit to Israel. He has reiterated that
Turkey's cooperation with Israel does not threaten any third party.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been enhancing its military cooperation
with Israel since early 1996 when they signed a defense
cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is allowing Israeli pilots to use its airspace for
training, and Israel in turn has been upgrading Turkey's F-4
fighter planes under a contract worth 630 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israel's growing military cooperation with Turkey and Jordan
has sparked harsh criticism and fears from most Arab countries,
especially Syria and Lebanon. Israel is occupying the Golan
Heights of Syria and a buffer zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its closes ally Syria feared that Israel, Jordan
and turkey could form a military alliance, which could threaten
the security and interests of other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement has been waging an anti-Israeli
guerrilla war in the 1,200-square-kilometer South Lebanon Security
Zone occupied by Israel in 1985 to allegedly protect its north from
Lebanese guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Russia Dissatisfied on TRASECA Cost-Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russia Tuesday criticized the
TRASECA project with regard to its cost-efficiency at the
international conference in Baku on establishing a transportation
corridor between Europe, the Caucasus and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted the head of the Russian
delegation Yevgeny Kazantsev as saying that given equal
conditions, transportation tariffs via Russia are 1.7 times lower
for grain, cotton and containers and 1.2 times lower for oil and
non-ferrous metals than via TRASECA routes.
</P>
<P>
Kazantsev, the Deputy Transportation Minister, noted that the
project are hindered by large investments into transportation
infrastructure, additional costs of two railroad-ferry links
through the Caspian and Black seas, hidden mountain passes and
technically dangerous zones through the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The Russian official pointed out that TRASECA should be linked
to the existing Central Asian-Siberian and Trans-Siberian
railroads to provide better terms for shipping cargo between
Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia cannot join the basic multilateral
agreement on TRASECA. Most participants in the project have signed
multilateral and bilateral agreement with Russia.
</P>
<P>
The agreements should be coordinated with regard to "previous
decisions adopted within the framework of numerous international
organizations", he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has designed an oil transportation project passing via
Chechnya and the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Optimistic About Success of Ross' Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Middle
East peace envoy Miguel Moratinos expressed optimism Tuesday about
the success of the upcoming visit to the region by his
U.S. counterpart Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Israel Radio, Moratinos said his
optimism was based on the assessment that both Israel and the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) are committed to making
substantial progress in their talks over clinching an overdue deal
on Israel's next troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy made the remarks after a low-profile two-day
visit to the region. He had held talks with PNA President Yasser
Arafat, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Uzi Arad,
senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes Ross will help Israel and the Palestinians
achieve a breakthrough in their negotiations over the second
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross is due in the region Wednesday for talks with Arafat and
Netanyahu in an effort to narrow their gaps over a U.S. proposal
calling for a 13.1 percent Israeli pullback in exchange for the
PNA's tougher measures to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said he had phoned Ross, who also voiced optimistic
over his upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Ross' visit, Netanyahu convened his Inner Cabinet
Tuesday to discuss the issue of the redeployment. No details of
the discussions were released.
</P>
<P>
Ross was dispatched to region by U.S. President Bill Clinton
last week amid reports that Israel and the Palestinian side was
closer to clinching a deal on the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In a positive sign, Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. security
officials will meet Tuesday night in Tel Aviv to review a
memorandum of understanding on security cooperation worked out by
the three sides in last December.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians signed the memorandum but
Netanyahu refused to approve it, saying it was not detailed
enough to be effective.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos also said that it was possible that a tripartite
summit will be held by Netanyahu, Arafat and Clinton later this
month when they are in New York to attend the General Assembly of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely speculated that Ross will try to arrange
such a summit to be held on September 23 in the White House to
celebrate the fifth anniversary of the historical signing of the
Oslo Accords.
</P>
<P>
For the past years, the EU has been trying to play a bigger
role in the Middle East peace process which is dominated by the
U.S. as the leading mediator.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Chief Urges More Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Chief of Staff Shaul
Mofaz warned Tuesday that Israel's security will face
unreasonable risks if defense budget is not increased.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz made the warning at a meeting of the Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee of Knesset (Parliament), which began Tuesday to
debate Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai's proposal on the 1999
defense budget, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Mordechai proposed an additional 2 billion
shekels (500 million U.S. dollars) of allocations for the 1999
budget to fund strategic projects.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz said that raising defense budget is essential to the
country's security in short as well as long terms.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Israel's defense spending has shrunk in recent
years amid mounting threat from other countries in the Middle
East, such as Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that the Israeli cabinet is still holding
marathon talks over the 1999 budget while a majority of ministers
has voiced opposition to Mordechai's proposal.
</P>
<P>
But Finance Ministry sources said that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman, who support the
budget increase, will finally pressure the cabinet to approve the
proposal.

KAMPALA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan parliament has
endorsed the continuation of the controversial privatization
process Tuesday after more than two weeks of hot debate.
</P>
<P>
The select committee reported to the House that it agreed with
the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development in
continuing the process, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that public enterprises whose privatization had
not ended should be finalized and those which were in earlier
stages will be subject to discussion between the minister and the
committee.
</P>
<P>
This agreement means the committee will proceed with the
privatization process with a right to examine the procedure.
</P>
<P>
A motion was moved two weeks ago over the suspension of the
privatization process due to alleged rampant corruption of
government officials in the process.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the privatization process should continue
while it is checked and examined at the same time while some
parliament members advocate immediate suspension of the process.

<HEADLINE> Fyodorov Outlines Government Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting Vice-Premier
Boris Fyodorov on Tuesday said that the government program to be
passed by the Cabinet is aimed at the resumption of genuine
reforms.
</P>
<P>
In his statement faxed to the Itar-Tass news agency Fyodorov
said that he is surprised that some renown economists, including
Yegor Gaidar, comment on the government program which have not
been seen by them with their eyes.
</P>
<P>
He said the concept of the program does not provide for "money
minting", it aims at the resumption of genuine reforms, which have
been actually stopped in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov outlined three sets of measures included in the
program: a tough monetary system; a well-ballanced budget and a
radical tax reform.
</P>
<P>
All that will encourage structural changes in the economy and
raise its efficiency, a policy of raising the labor productivity
and a more rational distribution of resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fyodorov meanwhile urged the Central Bank to stop ruble rate
games, and let the national currency to form freely on the market.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank should explain to the population that the
ruble rate is falling due to speculative pressure, with money
supply remaining practically unchanged, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the Bank should re-evaluate commercial banks'
mandatory reserves for hard-currency deposits at the ruble rate as
was quoted on August 14, 1998, and make them interest-bearing and
dollar-denominated.
</P>
<P>
He also said the state should give an unconditional guarantee
of populations' deposits as of August 14 to an amount of up to
5,000 dollars, using banks' reserves and property for the purpose.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Put Special Emphasis on Educating Women, Girls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday said that the 185-member
world body "will continue to place special emphasis" on the
education for women and girls all over the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement was contained in Annan's message marking the
International Literacy Day, which falls on September 8 every year.
</P>
<P>
"Recent years have seen significant gains in literacy rates,
school enrollment and spending on education. Yet, the twin goals
of universal literacy and equal access to education remain unmet,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
More than 960 million adults, two thirds of whom are women, are
illiterate, he said, adding that some 130 million children in
developing countries, two thirds of them girls, do not attend
primary school.
</P>
<P>
"In a fast-changing world, in rich and poor countries alike,
literacy demands continue to grow," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us remember that investments in literacy and education are
investments in health, in the environment, in labor, in the
development of human resources," he said. "Such investments can
yield the best of all returns: rewarding, prosperous lives for all
the world's people."
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the illiterate women live in the rural areas of
developing nations, particularly in Africa, the Arab countries and
East and South Asia, where the illiteracy rate for women is more
than 60 percent, according to Federico Mayor, the director-general
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Literacy, in the broad sense, is the foundation for life
skills, ranging from basic oral and written communication to the
ability to solve scientific and social problems.

UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The 52nd session of the

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Raise Efficiency in Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia should raise the
efficiency in judiciary so as to improve the delivery of justice
in the country, a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of a workshop on alternative
dispute resolution, Zambian Legal Affairs Minister Vincent
Malambo revealed that the Zambian government spent a lot of money
because cases took too long to be disposed of in the Zambian
courts, according to Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the inefficiency to the fact that Zambia's
Arbitration Act which had been in existence for several decades
had not been implemented in the country to date.
</P>
<P>
Malambo said the government would fully support efforts aimed
at creating efficiency in the delivery of justice in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The delivery of commercial justice should compliment rather
than hinder the wheels of commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Arlene Render, the U.S. ambassador to
Zambia, said the United States was working closely with the
Zambian government to establish an alternative mechanism for
resolving disputes.
</P>
<P>
She explained that the alternative dispute resolution would
not replace courts but only help to improve the administration of
justice in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Render added that the alternative dispute resolution mechanism
would provide a means for settling civil disputes timely and
allow the scarce resources to be spent on complex criminal
matters.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Calls for Dialogue in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday called on all Cambodian
leaders to resolve their differences through dialogue, and to
exercise utmost restraint in a bid to avert any further outbreak
of violence.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the U.N. chief, said in a statement
read to reporters here that Annan is following very closely and
with deep concern the developments in Cambodia, in particular the
weekend's events.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general has written on September 2 to Cambodian
leaders Hun Sen and Ung Huot, as well as to Prince Ranariddh and
Sam Rainsy, strongly urging all Cambodian leaders to "exercise
utmost restraint so as to prevent any further outbreak of
violence," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general, through Mr. Lakhan Mehrotra, his
personal representative in Cambodia, remains ready to assist
Cambodia in finding a solution acceptable to all and consistent
with democratic practice," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's post-election standoff erupted into turmoil and
gunfire on Monday as the nation's second prime minister, Hun Sen,
ordered the arrest of his opponents and as security forces fired
into crowd of protesters, killing at least one person, according
to reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation was touched off when three hand grenades were
thrown at Hun Sen's residence in the downtown area of Phnom Penh,
Cambodian capital.
</P>
<P>
After the outbreak of the latest confrontation, Sam Rainsy, a
candidate for the July 26 election, took refuge at the office of
the United Nations representative in Cambodia. Prince Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, who said irregularities marred the polls, has led
an increasingly assertive protest against the results of the
election, in which Hun Sen was declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general regrets the loss of life in these
events," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Little Hope for Israeli-Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said there is "little hope" of an agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians on Israel's long-delayed troop withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace process has been stalled for 18
months, though signs of some movements emerged last week when
U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross will fly to the
region Wednesday to push both leaders to reach agreement on a
U.S. initiative of another 13 percent West Bank withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"If we judge according to what we listen and read, the hope for
an equitable and just peace would be little," Moussa told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
He added that, however, "we should wait and see how the
situation would be like after Ross' arrival."
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, Israeli and Palestinian leaders gave
differing accounts of the outcomes of their contacts and blamed
each other for the gaps that remained.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said there are many proposals but they are "not all
reasonable or logical." So far, he added, the Palestinian and
Israeli sides have not reached any definite formula on the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is sending his envoys to Cairo to brief President
Hosni Mubarak on the Israeli stance on the possibility of reaching
an agreement with the Palestinians on the Israeli redeployment
plans, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
Asked on whether the envoy's visit is meant to break the
stalemate in the Egyptian-Israeli relations, Moussa noted that
relations between the two countries are contingent on the
progress achieved on peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
"In case the peace process moved in an equitable balanced way
and a just agreement was reached, some parts of the current
stalemate in Egyptian-Israeli relations could be tackled," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the first Arab country to have diplomatic ties with
the Jewish state, but the relationship has turned cool since
Netanyahu's election two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Vows to Stablize Economy, Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian second
Deputy Prime Minister Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz said Tuesday that
Saudi leaders were keen on safeguarding its economy and its
currency, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during a visit to the central region of
Al-Qaseem, Prince Sultan, who is also Defense and Aviation
Minister, said Saudi leaders were "taking action to protect the
economy from jitters or a meltdown."
</P>
<P>
"We are all seeking with steady and sound steps not to harm the
image of Saudi Arabia, the economy, exports and currency," Sultan
said.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government, in response to some rumors, announced on
August 31 that it had no intention to devaluate the Saudi currency
Riyal.
</P>
<P>
The rumors about Riyal's devaluation caused a panic on the
stock market prompting many dealers to sell their stocks for
U.S. dollars. But the market quickly restored stability as a
result of the confidence in the Saudi Riyal.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi currency has been under pressure as a result of
the sharp decline of oil prices in the world market since
last winter.
</P>
<P>
Although heavily hit by a sagging global oil market, the
oil-dependent Saudi economy has been growing steadily in the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
Saudi economy grew by 8.6 percent and 6 percent in 1996 and
1997 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The economy was boosted by the more active involvement of
private sector in local projects, higher government spending and
improvement in the overall financial situation.
</P>
<P>
However, structural economic problems, notably the double digit
unemployment, the economy's full dependency on the oil and the
state's hesitation to remove subsidies, have caused deep concerns
about the economy's instability.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Congo Truce Hangs in the Air (by Shang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The prospect of a
cease-fire in the war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
remains unclear Tuesday after Congolese rebels rejected outright
a truce accord thrashed out by heads of state in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebels said they would not observe the agreement
on a provisional cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops
which was hammered out by all the six governments embroiled in
the Congo conflict at a summit at Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"Because we were excluded (from the talks) we are not bound by
it," said rebel leader Bizima Karaha, former Congolese foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to fight on, saying the DRC and its allies "will only
know we exist when we start shooting".
</P>
<P>
After intensive behind-the-door talks which went into Monday
night, a cease-fire deal was finally struck by the DRC and its
allies, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on the one side, and Uganda
and Rwanda, who reportedly backed the rebels, on the other.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila accused Rwanda and Uganda of
invading his country by supporting the rebels, which the latter
two firmly denied.
</P>
<P>
Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, who chaired the summit,
said at a press conference Tuesday that the agreement would have
to be signed by the governments involved before it came into
effect.
</P>
<P>
"There must be a cease-fire so we can slowly but surely bring
peace to that country," Chiluba said, adding that all the
participants recognized Kabila as the DRC's legitimate ruler.
</P>
<P>
He said the cease-fire could only begin after defense
ministers from the six protagonists and Zambia meet later to draw
up a plan on the implementation of the deal.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers will meet at the OAU headquarters in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Thursday to explore cease-fire options.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said the pact included the identification of all the
forces involved and an exchange of prisoners of war. The
possibility of a regional peacekeeping force would also be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that the African countries were
considering asking the United Unions to help monitor the
cease-fire because the exercise was too costly for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Contradictory to Congolese rebels' claim that they were not
consulted on the agreement, Chiluba said the rebels had agreed to
a cease-fire after a one-hour meeting with him and Organization
of African Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
"They (the rebels) gave us a pledge voluntarily they were
going to respect the cease-fire. I hope they adhere to their own
word. If they refuse, it is pretty sad," Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group, apparently angry at the isolation treatment
by Kabila and his three allies at the summit, left the summit
venue Tuesday about half an hour before the announcement of the
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kabila had refused to meet face to face
with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no cease-fire before Kabila negotiates with us
directly," a rebel delegate said.
</P>
<P>
Rebel delegates were not allowed to address the meeting and
Karaha was only allowed to speak a few words at Tuesday's news
conference before he was whisked off to the airport. Chiluba said
it was because "they are not heads of state".
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Zimbabwean officials kept the eight-member rebel
delegation waiting for at least 90 minutes at the airport. When
they reached the conference venue later, they waited several more
hours while heads of state met in private.
</P>
<P>
Presidents at the summit emphasized the achievement of the
meeting, which has seen the biggest step yet taken towards
solving the crisis in the DRC. But they admitted that it was, as
always, difficult to implement cease-fire arrangements.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which did not attend the summit for reported
fears of offending Kabila and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
quickly welcomed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela hailed the deal as a
"tribute to the high quality of leadership which Africa has
produced".
</P>
<P>
South Africa has been insisting on a diplomatic solution of
the Congo crisis and has clashed with Zimbabwe over the latter's
military intervention in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a extensive regional bloodshed have been raised after
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent their troops to the DRC on
August 20 to prop up Kabila's embattled troops. The Banyamulenge
rebels now control large areas in the eastern part of the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
As the war continued unabated in the DRC, the hope to end the
five-week conflict hangs on further peace efforts by the region.
</P>
<P>
The efforts would start with Thursday's meeting of defense
ministers of the involved countries in Ethiopia, followed by a
summit of Southern African Development Community (SADC) heads of
state this weekend.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit in Mauritius is seen as a good opportunity for
a high-level discussion of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela said Tuesday that the summit of the
14-nation bloc would be "solely concerned with setting up a
mechanism" to ensure the cease-fire.

ANKARA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has weakened 40 percent
of the strength of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), a
senior Turkish official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Governor of the State of Emergency Region
Aydin Arslan, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted Arslan as saying that since the Turkish
government declared the state of emergency in the region in 1987,

civilians and 4,303 soldiers also lost their lives.

<P>
Commenting on the unlaterally-declared ceasefire by PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan on August 28, Arslan said that the PKK needs time
to reorganize and rearm itself.
</P>
<P>
The PKK, set up in April 1979, was declared illegal following
the 1980 military coup. It has staged armed struggle for
independence in southeastern Turkey since August 1984, while the
government troops launch frequent attacks on it.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reiterates Support for Creating Independent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan,
the Regent, reiterated Tuesday that Jordan continues to "exert its
uttermost efforts" to support the Palestinians to establish an
independent state with its capital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
All of Jordan's efforts and moves will serve the aim, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hassan made the remarks in meeting with Mahmoud Abbas,
Secretary General of the Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, is also regarded as the deputy
head of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Hassan said Jordan would spare no efforts to help the
Palestinian-Israel peace talks achieve a just, comprehensive and
durable result that will secure the rights of all parties
concerned.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Abbas asked Jordan to continue its efforts to
remove the obstacles facing the peace process and "guarantee
Israel's implementation" of a U.S. proposal on Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has proposed Israel withdraw from an addition 13.1
percent of the West Bank in the second troop redeployment. The PNA
has accepted the proposal, but Israel first rejected it citing
security reasons then accepted it on condition that 3 percent of
the proposed land be turned into a nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Abbas' Jordan visit came just ahead of the return to the region
by U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, who is expected to arrive in
Israel on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
There are mixed signals about the possible result of the Ross'
mission. Many predicted a breakthrough on brokering a deal on the
Israeli redeployment, while others doubted if Ross could achieve
it due to Washington's reluctance to exert further pressure on
Israel to soften its intransigence.

<HEADLINE> Udovenko on Intractable Blocks in Reforming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The working group on
reforming the Security Council of the United Nations has failed to
achieve substantive progresses, Hennadiy Udovenko, President of
the General Assembly, said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the concluding session of the 52nd session of the
General Assembly, the outgoing President Udovenko said the working
group held 65 lengthy meetings in the past year, but it was once
again unable to submit any agreed recommendations on any of the
substantive issues related to Security Council reform.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said while progress had been made in some areas, a
number of major stumbling blocks prevented the group from
fulfilling its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The President said among the most intractable ones is the
problem of finding a magic number that would increase the
representative character of the Council without impairing its
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He said beyond the question of the total size of an enlarged
Council, controversy is still brewing around the creation of new
permanent seats and rotational arrangements to fill those seats,
the highly charged problem of the veto right with respect to both
current and prospective permanent members.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said the reform of the Security Council is probably
one of the most difficult issues faced by the United Nations in
its history, any reform of the United Nations would be incomplete
without the reform of its main organ responsible for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko recommended to continue consultation on the matter
during the 53d session of GA and called on Member States to build
mutual trust and to move beyond marrow positions so as to reach a
common goal.

Senator Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, a Democrat, said: "We're fed
up. The behavior, the dishonesty of the president is unacceptable
and we'll see with the report what course the Congress will take."
</P>
<P>
The president "should have taken responsibility much earlier,"
said Senator Barbara Boxer.

<P>
Clinton reportedly tried to reach out to lawmakers by inviting
House Democratic leaders to the White House on Wednesday. On
Thursday he probably will see House and Senate leaders from both
parties. White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the Lewinsky
matter probably would be discussed. "That's certainly going to
occupy some time in the next six weeks, so I imagine it will,"
McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's attorneys, meanwhile, have asked that they be allowed
an advance view of Starr's draft report.
</P>
<P>
"Elemental fairness dictates that we be allowed to respond to
any `report' you send to the House simultaneously with its
transmission," Clinton lawyer David Kendall wrote Starr on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I request that you... allow the President's personal and White
House counsel to review any draft `report' prepared by your
Office... affording us one week to submit a written reply,"
Kendall wrote.
</P>
<P>
Kendall also said that "Nothing" in the law "authorizes your
office to prepare a `report' to the House that purports to
summarize and analyze evidence."
</P>
<P>
Kendall stated that "you have had unlimited resources at your
command and no practical restriction on your power to investigate
every aspect of the president's life for the past four and one
half years."
</P>
<P>
Several Democratic congressmen said Starr should accommodate
the president's request.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
along with the chairman and ranking Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee, were scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss
the procedures for handling any Starr report.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Thirty Rwandan refugees
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have arrived in west
Tanzania's Kigoma Region after rebels took arms to fight against
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, of Hutu origin, have taken shelter in three
camps in the DRC since 1994, according to a report by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They told Kigoma authorities that a number of their
compatriots are still stranded at Fizi area waiting for an
opportunity to cross the Lake Tanganyika to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan refugees claimed to come from Kajembo, Runingo and
Kagunga camps in the DRC's Uvira Region on the western shore of
the lake Tanganyika.

<HEADLINE> Airbus, Boeing Snatch Big Orders at Farnborough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Airbus Industrie, the major
European air consortium, and American air giant Boeing have both
won some lucrative orders at the on-going Farnborough
International Air Show.
</P>
<P>
Airbus Industrie, in buoyant form after recently wrestling a
plum British Airways contract from Boeing, Tuesday signed a
contract for six A340-500s with options for a further 10 with
Emirates Airline.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based International Lease Finance Corporation
also agreed to place orders for 16 Airbus aircraft in a deal worth
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the Airbus chief executive Noel Forgeard declined to
give a precise figure of the deals, the two deals were in total
worth up to 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Airbus's major global arch-rival Boeing Monday also
unveiled a $900-million order from International Lease Finance
Corp and a $230-million order from the Dutch airline KLM.
</P>
<P>
It is widely expected that Airbus and Boeing would take full
advantage of the Farnborough air show to announce more orders in
the following days, intensifying their the head-to-head dogfight
over global market shares.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Good Governance in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan Tuesday said African countries
affected by conflicts should create a positive environment for
investment by adopting good governance and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
In his annual report released Tuesday, Annan notes that in
view of the continuing negative impact of external debt on many
developing countries, the international community should convert
into grants all remaining bilateral official debt for the poorest
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also says the international community should ease the
conditions of access to multilateral facilities for the heavily
indebted poor countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the United Nations
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), in terms of the plight of
the world's developing region, Africa, with one-third of its
population not expected to live beyond the age of 40, receives
significant attention in the annual report.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the U.N. continues to consider the development of
Africa as "a matter of the highest priority".
</P>
<P>
Addressing the decline in official development assistance,
Annan notes that aid has declined over the decade to just 0.22
percent of the gross domestic products (GDP) of industrialized
countries as a whole and 0.19 percent of the GDP of the G-7
countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, all of sub-Saharan Africa received a mere 3 billion
U.S. Dollars of aid, compared to 4 billion Dollars for South
Asia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The report also gives special emphasis to conflicts. While the
world has been free from large-scale conflicts over the past
year, Annan said that a number of local wars broke out in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Annan said, in Africa, while the restoration of the
democratically elected government of Sierra Leone to power is
cited as a success story, the conflicts in Angola, Guinea-Bissau
and countries in Central Africa like Congo (K) are seen as a
manifestation of the extent to which peace remains precarious.
</P>
<P>
The emergency of conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the
first war between neighboring states for a decade, is also cited
by the report, according to the press release.

"If we judge according to what we listen and read, the hope for

<HEADLINE> English Status in World Goes Down, UK academic Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The exalted status of English
language may be degrading in an ever more integrated global
market, an academic said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are beginning to realize the implications may be moving in
a quite different way," David Graddol of the Open University told
a news conference at the annual science festival in Cardiff, the
capital of Wales in west Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of the global economy, and a trend
towards sophisticated service sectors, had initially favored
English, but now it was at the end of that wave.
</P>
<P>
According to his study, about nine percent of the world's
population spoke English as a first language in 1950, but by the
middle of the next century that will have fallen to about five
percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of people who speak English as a
second language is set to overtake the number of native speakers.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the United States, Spanish is becoming a far
more important language as the Hispanic population grows rapidly
and Latin America becomes a more important trading zone, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The rest of the world may speak English but they also speak
other languages and we may have to learn them if we want to reach
their markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
A report last year by the British Council -- whose role is to
promote Britain and English -- forecast rapid growth in the number
of young people around the globe speaking English as a first
language, putting it fourth behind Chinese, Hindi and Arabic by
the middle of the next century and closing the gap.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Lockerbie Lawyer's Call for Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
rejected a call from the chief defense lawer for two Libyan
suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie airline bombing to negotiate a plan
for the trial of them in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that this was
a "nonnegotiable offer."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the remarks by chief defense lawer Ibrahim
Legwell, who said U.S.-British proposals to try his clients in the
Netherlands did not assure them a fair trial and said further
negotiations were needed for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain proposed on Aug. 24 that the two
suspects in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie,
Scotland, would be tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges and
under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
But Legwell said there were a number of conditions which did
not meet the requirements for a fair trial. These included the
court that consists only of Scottish judges, the conditions of
detention of the suspects in the Netherlands before and during the
trial if they went there, and the choice of Britain as the place
of their imprisonment if they were convicted.
</P>
<P>
"Because it calls for a trial in a neutral venue, it is a
positive move. But it must be completed through negotiations,"
Legwell said.
</P>
<P>
"That was a nonnegotiable offer," McCurry said at a regular
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"That was not the basis upon which the government of the United
Kingdom and the government of the United States made the offer,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain Tuesday declined to comment on Legwell's remarks.
</P>
<P>
"We have no comment. We've told the Libyans we're not reacting
to matters discussed in the media," said a British official.
</P>
<P>
Both the United States and Britain have said in the past that
their proposals were not negotiable.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cyprus President
Yiannakis Omirou Tuesday criticized Turkey for its expansionism,
saying that it was a threat not only to Cyprus but also to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent statements by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz that Turkey would take all necessary measures if Cyprus
deployed Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Omirou said on
the northwestern Greek island of Corfu that the present time was
critical for Cyprus' national issues, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said that the dangers of a destabilization in the eastern
Mediterranean region were real as long as the present situation of
division and occupation remained in Cyprus,
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Cyprus had the right and duty to defend
itself.
</P>
<P>
As for the violations of the Greek air space by Turkish fighter
jets in the Aegean Sea Tuesday, he said that this was the sort of
activity which indicated that neighboring Turkey did not want to
contribute to defusing the situation but in fact provoked and
attacked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman emphasized that Greece was against the
formation of alliances and axes in the region and called for
multilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Yilmaz's official visit to Israel, he said that
Greece welcomed assurances from Israel and Ankara that their
bilateral cooperation was not directed at any third party, but he
added that Athens maintained its reservations until this was
proved in practice.

GENEVA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament
(CD) ended its 1998 session here Tuesday with no consensus on
admitting Ecuador, Ireland, Kazakhstan, Malaysia and Tunisia to
the 61-member conference.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of Morocco, Norway, Bangladesh, Algeria,
Sweden, Turkey, Ireland, Malaysia, Ecuador and Tunisia regretted
that the conference was not in a position to approve its expansion
although it was close to reaching a consensus and hoped this
decision could be taken at the start of its 1999 session.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Mark Hofer of Switzerland, the Special Coordinator
on the expansion of membership of the CD, recommended that the
conference appoint a Special Coordinator to continue informal
consultations on this issue in the 1999 session.
</P>
<P>
The conference also adopted the final reports of its Ad Hoc
Committee established to negotiate a ban on the production of
fissile material for nuclear weapons and its Ad Hoc Committee on
negative security assurances.
</P>
<P>
The Conference then adopted its annual report to the General
Assembly and concluded its 1998 session. According to the annual
report, the dates for the 1999 three-phase session will be from 18
January to 26 March, from 10 May to 25 June, and from 26 July to 8
September. The next public plenary would be held on 19 January

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Tuesday
urged Iran and Afghanistan to restrain themselves from taking any
steps in escalating tensions between them.
</P>
<P>
"We are urging restraint by all sides. We want Afghanistan's
neighbors to refrain from taking actions that could further
enlarge or inflame the conflict, and obviously, to respect its
international borders," State Department spokesman James Rubin
said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran and Afghanistan should solve a dispute over
missing Iranians in Afghanistan peacefully with United Nations
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also expressed concern over Iran's "significant numbers
of troops and equipment" on its border with Afghanistan and said
they should be left there following a military exercise.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, this is a matter of serious concern, and it's
something we're watching extremely closely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Washington could not confirm reports that a number
of Iranian diplomats had been missing or killed in an Afghan city
the Taliban recently captured.
</P>
<P>
But while stressing that holding diplomats "for any reason or
at any time" was unacceptable under international law, he made
clear "we do not support any interference in the internal affairs
of Afghanistan."

<HEADLINE> South Korea Needs 78 Billion Dollars to Fight New Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea needs 78 billion
U.S. dollars by September 1999 to fight another possible financial
crisis, said a spokesperson for a South Korean think tank.
</P>
<P>
In a report released Wednesday, Samsung Economic Research
Institute predicted that the nation can only accumulate a usable
foreign reserve of some 60 billion dollars by that time.
</P>
<P>
This is short of the currency reserve needed to hold off
another financial crisis possibly by the latter part of 1999.
</P>
<P>
South Korea will need 78 billion dollars, the think tank's
representative said, by next September to fulfill its
international obligations, including interest payments, and to
stem the outflow of foreign portfolio investments.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's usable foreign exchange holdings stood at 41.38
billion dollars last month. The country could be swept up in
another currency crunch if it fails to take the necessary
measures, said the institute.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has to pay 38.1 billion dollars back in foreign
debts, including 15 billion mid-term and long-term debts, 12.2
billion in interest and 10.9 billion in IMF bailout loans.
</P>
<P>
In addition, domestic corporations might be asked to repay
their short-term debts to foreign investment firms, which were
estimated at 26.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korean firms may have to reimburse their
locally-arranged loans worth 10.5 billion won. Some 2.9 billion
dollars in foreign portfolio investments is likely to flow out of
the country if international investors withdraw 30 percent of
their money.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Economic Research Institute urged the government to
boost international confidence by speeding up corporate and
financial reforms and finalizing the crisis-management system to
stem new waves of financial and economic woes.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian government
Wednesday banned opposition supporters and Buddhist monks from
staging further protests following three days of violent
crackdowns.
</P>
<P>
The state television quoted an interior ministry statement as
saying: "The meeting of groups cannot continue unless they respect
the principles of real democracy and legal implementation of
authorized law."
</P>
<P>
It said that the participation of Buddhist monks in protests
"is an act against both the Buddhist law and the political party
law."
</P>
<P>
The statement also denied reports that a monk was killed in
Wednesday's clean-up operation, when police fired shots and used
batons and water cannons to clear a gathering outside opposition
FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh's residence.
</P>
<P>
Angry crowds continued to gather late Wednesday, many chanting
anti-Vietnamese slogans aimed at Hanoi which they accuse of
backing Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Last week, mobs brutally killed five ethnic-Vietnamese, leaving
opposition leaders open to accusations of inciting racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a FUNCINPEC official, cabinet director Mu Sokhua,
said an official request to hold a demonstration Sunday had been
submitted to authorities.

<TEXT>
<P>
Following the tremendous success of the Standard Chartered '98
New Airport Marathon, organizers of the 64,000 U.S. dollars race
next year have taken a step further to ensure that an ever bigger
spectacle will occur with a new "urban" course for the February
28, 1999 event.
</P>
<P>
Starting at Chater Road in Hong Kong's Central district, the
42,195-kilometer race will take runners through the Western
Harbor tunnel, along the newly-completed Route 3 Expressway, the
Cheung Tsing Tunnel, across the Ting Kau Bridge and back,
finishing at the Shamshuipo Sports Ground.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a local marathon race will take
place in the urban streets of Hong Kong, which benefits the
public participation at the beginning and end of the race and
ensures that it will add a new experience for local runners.
</P>
<P>
And, apart from the grueling challenge of full marathon, the
popular 10-kilometer race will also be staged alongside the main
event. Runners will start at the Western Park in Hong Kong,
through the Western Harbor tunnel and winding up at the
Shamshuipo Sports Ground.

<HEADLINE> Russia Awaits Yeltsin's Decision on Premier Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia is waiting for President
Boris Yeltsin's decision on whether he will offer a compromise
candidate for prime minister to break the current political
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin met Wednesday with Acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov at his
residence outside Moscow, but he has not made a decision on the
prime minister's post, said sources close to the president.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was said to be focused on the current political
situation in the country and the international reaction to current
developments in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin's nomination for premier was rejected by the State
Duma in its second vote on Monday. Under the Russian Constitution,
if the nomination is rejected three times, the president will have
to dissolve the Duma and call new elections within three months.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass news agency quoted Chairman of the State Duma
Gennady Seleznyov as saying that it is a good sign that Yeltsin is
not rushing to nominate a candidate for prime minister following
the Duma's second rejection of Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, Yuri Maslyukov, a State Duma deputy from the
Communist Party and head of the Duma's Economic Policy Committee,
is the best candidate for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, several State Duma deputies have reiterated their
opinion that the appointment of Chernomyrdin as acting prime
minister is illegal.
</P>
<P>
Anatoly Lukyanov of the Communist Party faction noted the law
allows the president to select an acting prime minister only from
the group of deputy prime ministers of the dismissed Cabinet.

Luzhkov met the acting prime minister to discuss the results of

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tells Congressional Democrats He's Sorry for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday told congressional Democrats that he was very sorry for
causing pain in his family and throughout the country by his
affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
"It was an emotional meeting. He wants to carry on with the
business of the country but he clearly understands the deep pain
he has caused," said Representative David Bonior of Michigan,
second-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Bonior said there was no discussion of impeachment or
resignation. "I think the president will certainly be able to
continue in office," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The closed-door meeting in the White House came days before
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr delivers a report to Congress on
his four-year investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Bonior described Clinton's meeting with Democrats as
"emotional." "What we saw was a father, a husband, the leader of
our country who was contrite, who was very sorry for his actions,"
he was quoted as saying by news reports.
</P>
<P>
Bonior said the handful of Democratic lawmakers present forgave
Clinton for his actions. He said he advised Clinton he needs to
make clear to the American people his contrition and sorrow and
"he needs to address it on a continual basis. But he also needs to
get to the issues he was elected to address in this country."
</P>
<P>
"The American people do not want to see this president fail.
They want to see him succeed," Bonior said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- General Secretary Emilio
Gasbarrone of Italy's dope testing laboratory was suspended for
one month on Wednesday in the wake of a scandal over drugs
testing of the country's footballers.
</P>
<P>
The action against Gasbarrone came at an emergency meeting
here of the national Olympic committee (CONI), which governs
sport in Italy and which appointed the laboratory at Acqua
Acetosa near Rome.
</P>
<P>
The scandal broke last weekend when it emerged that Italy's
war on drugs was a sham. Only a fraction of 4,000 samples sent in
and paid for each year by Serie A and B clubs were ever tested
for steroids.
</P>
<P>
The laboratory, though working for the CONI, is run by the
Italian Sports Doctors Federation, of which Professor Giorgio
Santilli is president.
</P>
<P>
The CONI decided that Santilli should explain the goings-on
at Acqua Acetosa and that a CONI national council meeting on
September 17 should make a judgement on CONI's own president
Mario Pescante's actions in the affair.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urges All Parties in Cambodia to Avoid Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- In a statement issued
tonight, ASEAN urged all parties in Cambodia to exercise
restraint, avoid violence and resolve their problems through
dialogue and consultations in order to prevent a further
deterioration of the situation.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued by Chairman of the ASEAN Standing
Committee S Jayakumar, who is Singapore Foreign Minister, after
consulting with the other ASEAN Foreign Ministers, according to a
press release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The following is the full text of the statement:
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN Statement on Cambodia
</P>
<P>
In view of the increasing tension in Phnom Penh, ASEAN urges
all parties concerned to respect the results of the 26 July 1998
general elections which were generally recognized by the
international community as free and fair, as well as to exercise
restraint, avoid violence, including extremist acts, and resolve
their problems through dialogue and consultations in order to
prevent further deterioration of the situation.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, ASEAN reiterates its call in the ASEAN
Statement on Cambodia on 4 September 1998 on all parties concerned
in Cambodia to resolve their differences in the spirit of national
reconciliation and unity so that a new national assembly could
soon vote on a new government, thus contributing to the peace and
stability in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
It is to be recalled that at the request of the Cambodian
government, ASEAN -- through the ASEAN Troika -- has been engaging
with cooperation and support from the international community, in
efforts to assist in the restoration of political stability in
Cambodia. ASEAN thus hopes that all Cambodian parties will try to
build on the achievements that they themselves have made so far on
the restoration of political normalcy, internal order and the
national reconciliation process, especially after the 26 July 1998
elections.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN strongly supports His Majesty King Sihanouk's role in
solving the present situation so that Cambodia would soon form a
new government that fulfills the aspirations of the Cambodian
people and the desire of the countries in the region."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Autumn morning
sunlights are caressing the Peace Bell Pavilion in the complex of
the United Nations headquarters here. Standing in the breeze on
the front lawn, three women are singing for friendship and peace
for the globe.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. flag and national flags of 185 members are flying in
the sunny morning of the 1998 International Peace Day, which falls
on September 9. The audience, representing different cultures and
varying colors, applauded the performance.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan ringed the Peace Bell at 9:30
a.m. (local time), and the bell sang in a universal language --
peace for the world, peace for the mankind.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal, therefore, on the Day of Peace, to all the leaders
of nations in war to set aside their own ambitions and think of
their peoples, to resist the temptation to seek glory through
conquest, and to recognize that peaceful statesmanship alone will
bring them and their peoples the rewards they deserve," Annan said
at the brief ceremony.
</P>
<P>
As the bell rang in the U.N. headquarters, too many parts of
the world are at war. From the Balkans to Central Africa,
innocent men, women and children are the victims of indiscriminate
attacks and are left to a life of despair, dispossession and
exile.
</P>
<P>
The International Peace Day coincides with the opening of the
new General Assembly session, at which governments across the
globe are expected to tell the world how they will strive for
peace and development in the world.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy to sing songs for peace in the United
Nations headquarters," one of the three female singers from Japan
told Xinhua. She, together with her teacher and classmate, sang
Japanese songs, which are entitled "We are friends," and
"Beautiful Dreamer."
</P>
<P>
"We want the world to build friendship among different
cultures," she said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Makes 20-Million-Dollar Emergency Aid Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sudanese government has
declared a state of emergency and appeal to the international
community for emergency assistance amounting to 20 million U.S.
dollars, said the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shelter materials, food and medicines make up the priority
requirements following the floods affecting Sudan's states of
Khartoum, River Nile, Northern Nile, White Nile and Kassala,
leaving about 100,000 people displaced.
</P>
<P>
"Thousands of buildings - homes, houses, schools, roads,
bridges and agricultural assets - have either been washed away or
heavily damaged," said OCHA..
</P>
<P>
According to OCHA, The Sudanese Red Crescent Society, with
support from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red
Crescent (IFRC), will meet the emergency needs of 95,000 victims
in four states for a period of two months. The IFRC has launched
an appeal for food and non-food items, including water pumps,
sprayers, medical equipment, worth two million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program is transporting 17 tons of food to
Kassala from stocks in Gedarif to provide emergency rations to
about 8,000 people for one month.
</P>
<P>
Two UN assessment teams have been dispatched to areas in the
north and south where the situation remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
Funds to aid flood victims in Sudan should be transferred to
OCHA account No. CO-590.160.1, Swift code: SBCOCHGG12A at the UBS
AG. OCHA's website is http://www.reliefweb.int.

SEOUL, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ninety South Korean lawmakers
Wednesday urged the government to suspend the Kumgang Mountain
tour program, arguing that the Democratic People's Republic of

"The government should suspend the sightseeing project until

Grand National Party.

Meanwhile, the United Liberal Democrats, coalition partner of

threat it said posed by DPRK's launch of a missile or satellite at
the end of last Month.
</P>

Under an agreement signed in June this year by South Korean
Hyundai Group and the DPRK on developing the tour resources of
Mount Kumgang, Hyundai will send 1,000 South Koreans to tour the

<HEADLINE> Albright Fires Back at Critics of Iraq Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright made a counter-attack on Wednesday at critics
who accused her of easing away from U.S. tough policy on Iraq,
saying "they are sincerely wrong."
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the American war veterans in New Orleans,
Albright said the United States had been the strongest
international backer of U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for weapons inspections in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We have pushed and pushed and pushed some more to help UNSCOM
break through the smokescreen of lies and deception put out by the
Iraqi regime," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not taken any option off the table, including military
force... The bottom line is that if Iraq tries to break out of its
strategic box, our response will be strong and swift," she added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration, and Albright in particular, has
been faulted relentlessly in recent weeks by arms expert Scott
Ritter, who charged that the United States undermined the U.N.
Special Commission through "interference and manipulation."
</P>
<P>
The case made by Ritter, who resigned as a U.N. weapons
inspector in Iraq, has been used by senators and editorial writers
to fault administration policy toward Iraq and to question
Albright's credibility. Her speech to the annual American Legion
Convention, was her most sustained rebuttal so far.
</P>
<P>
"In recent weeks, some in Washington have suggested that the
United States has not done enough to support the U.N. inspectors.
It has even been suggested that we have tried to prevent from
doing job," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The critics are sincere... But they are sincerely wrong when
they blame America for the world's failure to uncover the full
truth about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program," she
added.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China military pentathlon
team is aiming to dominate in the upcoming CISM 46th Military
Pentathlon World Championships at home.
</P>
<P>
China boost their chance to collect half of the six trophies
as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) pulled out of
the military sport +event on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK, who took the silver medals in both women's team and
individual divisions last year, are the winners of the women's
obstacles relay race and still hold the world record of this race.
</P>
<P>
"Women athletes who have better marks in obstacles relays are
priors to our selection for the competition," said Jiao
Liming,China's team leader.
</P>
<P>
China brought home the women's team and individual titles last
year in Sweden, and their domination in women's races is
unmovable after Koreans' pull-out.
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential to sweep the 1-2-3 finish in the
individual contest," Jiao added.
</P>
<P>
"But we'll meet powerful challenge from Brazil's men's team,"
Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
China won the men's team trophy, Debrus Cup, for the third
time in row last year and also the men's relay race, but Brazil's
Carlos Silva stole the individual champoinship.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil is the biggest obstacle for us to defending the Debrus
Cup,with Silva and veteran (Ribamar) Bandeira also their hopes
for the individual title," Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
Bandeira won the men's individual three times in 1990, 1991
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's coach Helcio Botelho said, "We're better prepared for
the competition, and we're confident to beat China to win the
Debrus Cup."
</P>
<P>
"Silva is in a better form now than Bandeira, but both could
win the individual title. It all depends on the shooting,"
Botelho added.
</P>
<P>
"Besides Brazil, we have to keep eyes on other competitors,
like Syria and Russia," Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
Russia finished third last year behind China and Brazil in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"But Syria may be the surprise of the competition," Jiao
said."They didn't make any remarkable results in the pass years,
but they have the potential."
</P>
<P>
Jamal Hamadeh is the name Jiao mentioned as a dark horse in
the individual title chasing, who is still an unknown by now,
</P>
<P>
"If he (Hamadeh) manages to overcome his nervousness, he is
unbeatable."
</P>
<P>
The military sport gala will have the opening ceremony
tomorrow and the competition will start on Friday, with the
shooting competition the first contest of the seven-day event.

At present, nearly 300 business people from the Commonwealth of

goods worth 150,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to An Jianzhong, more than 20,000 business people can
make deals simultaneously on the market, which has a business area

Horgos had been an important station on the famous "Silk Road"
in the Sui (581-618) and Tang (618-907) dynasties. Russian
businessmen began trading with Yili in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region at the end of the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
Horgos Pass became a trade port between China and Russia in
1881, and turned into a silent place in the "Cold War" period with
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
However, it has begun a new phase of development in the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
Qi Xinghai, deputy head of the Horgos Pass Management
Committee, said there were only 58 civilians living there in
1984 besides soldiers guarding the pass, and only 120 people
passed the port every year.
</P>
<P>
Now, the permanent residents there exceed 6,000, with 15,000
people passing through each day.
</P>
<P>
The pass, 290 kilometers to the west of Alma-Ata, has an annual
handling capacity of 3 million tons. The pass is also
well-equipped in terms of infrastructure. It has been named as one
of the 500 best small towns in China by the Ministry of
Construction for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Horgos is not only an attraction to business people, but also
to travelers. Nearly 1,000 people visit the place for sightseeing

Development Bank (IDB) Ahmad Mohammad Ali said on Wednesday that
the bank is trying to raise the inter-member trade by 13 percent
over next three years, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting starting on Tuesday in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, about the bank's export-financing program, Ali expressed
confidence that the goal is attainable provided that strenuous
efforts are exerted to surmount obstacles to trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Jeddah-based IDB includes 52 Islamic countries in the
world. One of its top priorities is to promote inter-member trade,
which is estimated at 10 percent of their total external trade.
</P>
<P>
The bank's program is aimed at financing exports and imports
among the members, creating a portfolio to safeguard investment
and exports credits.
</P>
<P>
The bank announced last month to appropriate 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars to encourage commercial exchanges among member states,
including 830 million dollars for imports, 200 million dollars for
exports and 300 million dollars for the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Since the creation of the export financing program in 1986, the
IDB has earmarked a total of 13 billion dollars to finance trade.

<HEADLINE> Beckenbauer Rules himself Out for German Coach Job </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Franz Beckenbauer ruled
himself out for the job of Germany's soccer coach Wednesday and
suggested Holland's Johan Cruyff would be fitting for the post.
</P>
<P>
Berti Vogts resigned as the national team coach Monday after
the side's 3-0 loss to Croatia in the World Cup quarter-finals
and poor performances in last week's two friendlies.
</P>
<P>
Beckenbauer, a former star player who guided Germany to its
third and last World Cup title in 1990, said he had left the
coaching job for good.
</P>
<P>
But he recommended Cruyff, the most venerated Dutch soccer
star who was his greatest rival in 1970s, for the vacant job.
</P>
<P>
Cruyff turned down an offer to become coach of the Dutch
national team last month.

<P>
TIRANA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Albania's government approved a
contract with a Chinese company Tuesday to build the Bushat
hydropower station.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government believed that the proposal to build the
Bushat hydropower station over the Drin River by Hainan Science,
Technology and Trade Company of China, required the lowest
investment and had the most favorable loan terms.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese company won the contract through a competitive
bidding process, participated in by many international companies,
The Chinese company will provide a line of credit worth 149.66
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The station is located on the reaches lower than the Fjerze
hydropower station, which was also built by a Chinese company. The
Bushat will be another major hydropower station on the river. Two
sets of Chinese generators will be installed with a capacity of
80,000 kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
It will generate 350 million watt/hours of electricity when it
goes into operation and help alleviate the country's power
shortage.

<HEADLINE> S. Asian Countries Meet in Nepal on Women Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The second South Asia
regional meeting, which aims to identify follow-up efforts to the
Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing in September
1995, opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the two-day meeting include ministers for women
affairs and secretaries at the women's ministries of the seven
member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of U.N. agencies and leading non-governmental
organizations in the SAARC region are also present at the meeting
organized jointly by the Nepali government and the New Delhi-based
South Asian Regional Office of the United Nations Development Fund
for Women (UNIFEM).
</P>
<P>
UNIFEM said in a press release that the first South Asia
regional meeting held in September 1996 in New Delhi strongly
recommended that such meetings be held every alternate year as
there was a consensus that this process lends considerable
stimulus to the Beijing follow-up efforts in different countries
as well as negotiates space for women's movement.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the post-Beijing South Asia regional scenario,
there have been several initiatives which have been directed
toward the fulfillment of the commitments made at the Beijing
conference.
</P>
<P>
"All South Asian countries have ratified Convention on
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, and in addition to
the drawing up of national plans of action, there have been
important changes at policy, institutional, political,
programmatic, legal and plan levels," it said.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting will attempt to take a regional overview, share
experiences and best practices, identify gaps and chart actions
for the future, with respect to the Beijing consensus," UNIFEM
said.
</P>
<P>
"An effort will be made to facilitate networking and
inter-regional collaborations on the critical areas of concern,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
A UNIFEM report notes that the greatest burden of human
deprivation and poverty, illiteracy and health-related problems in
South Asia falls on its women.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Establishes Nearly 40,000 Enterprises on Mainland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Official figures show that
through June of this year, Taiwan business people had set up
39,821 enterprises on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of approved investment projects from Taiwan
dropped by 5.3 percent in the first half of this year compared
with the same period of last year, according to An Min, assistant
minister of the Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said at a forum held by the Taiwan Studies Society here
today that this could be attributed to the impact of the Asian
financial crisis and Taiwan authorities' policy which creates
obstacles for mainland-bound investors.
</P>
<P>
But he forecast a promising second half, saying that as the
tension between the two sides is relaxing and the investment
environment is getting better, Taiwan investment will increase to
some extent.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan last year
reached 19.8 billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 4.5 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
An said that the mainland is adopting active measures to
develop cross-Straits economy and trade, and the central
government is unwilling to see Taiwan business people miss such a
good opportunity.
</P>
<P>
He continued to say that the central government will continue to
use Hong Kong as a bridge for the improvement of cross-Straits
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Most economic and trade activities between the mainland and
Taiwan are now carried out via Hong Kong. However, costs have
increased because of this transfer, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Here Comes Ross Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross is due here Wednesday afternoon for another visit that
many hope could help make a miracle.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of his visit are the scope of the long overdue
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and the security cooperation
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Following more than a month of bargaining since their direct
talks resumed in July, Israel and the Palestinians have
reportedly reached a draft agreement over another Israeli pullback
after Israel made concessions on other interim issues such as the
airport, the industrial park and the safe passage between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
The draft suggests that Israel pulls back its troops from 13.1
percent more of the West Bank as a U.S. initiative demands but
turns 3 percent into a nature reserve where Israel will retain
full security control.
</P>
<P>
Although the Palestinians have denied lately the existence of
such a draft and called the Israeli proposals as unacceptable,
they are believed to have not backed off from their basic
understanding with Israel.
</P>
<P>
They are withholding a final approval for tactical purposes,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the most substantive gaps remain on the issue of
security cooperation, which constitute an important part of an
overall redeployment package.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians signed a U.S.-brokered memorandum
of understanding on security last December but Netanyahu rejected
it, saying it was not detailed enough to be effective.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Israel worked out a draft in early July and
presented it to the Palestinians, but the Palestinians snubbed it
because the work was done without consulting them.
</P>
<P>
U.S. security officials have held talks with the Palestinians
in the recent months, trying to reach common ground between the
Palestinian positions and Israeli demands. The issue will soon
prove to be a real challenge to Ross during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The belated visit, amid widespread pessimism over the peace
process and distrust of the U.S. after Washington's bombing of
Afghanistan and Sudan, seems all the more important for all sides
to achieve a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
For the past several months, Netanyahu has been swinging
between his left-wing and right-wing coalition partners, fearing a
decision on redeployment would cause his government famous for its
hardline stance. However, this indecision can not last long.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Oslo process is approaching its end. The accords
that started the peace process five years ago will expire next
May. The two sides have yet to begin the final-status talks, which
are more complicated and more difficult than all the previous ones.
</P>
<P>
Tensions are building up between the two sides the peace
impasse drags on. Last month, three Jewish settlers were murdered
in two incidents in the West Bank, violent clashes broke out
between the Palestinians and Israeli soldiers in Hebron, and a
bomb went off in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
More violence, even with greater magnitude, is in the offing if
no progress is to be made in the peace process soon, many people
warned.
</P>
<P>
And again, the freeze in the talks in the last few days
indicated the two sides have reached a point that they can not
resolve disputes by themselves and a third party is urgently need
to step in.
</P>
<P>
That's why both Israel and the Palestinians welcomed the
decision of U.S. President Bill Clinton to send Ross back to the
region. But for Washington itself, Ross' visit is also vital.
</P>
<P>
Since proposing its initiative on 13.1 percent Israeli
withdrawal early this year, the U.S. has entered a long but
fruitless wrestling with Netanyahu, who vehemently resisted it.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked with
Netanyahu on many occasions - in Israel, in London, and in
Washington, and Ross shuttled between Israel and the Palestinians,
but all these ended up in frustration.
</P>
<P>
This had prompted Washington to threaten to wash hands out of
the peace process. It rejected, more than once, appeals from both
Israel and the Palestinians to intervene since they resumed direct
talks. It insisted that it will not mediate until significant
progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
Small wonder that U.S. officials have been trying to downplay
Ross' visit, saying it could narrow much of the gap but an
agreement will not be imminent.
</P>
<P>
Observers predict that Ross will define as his main goal the
arrangement of a summit between Netanyahu and Arafat later this
month when the two are in New York for the General Assembly of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Whether the two leaders could resolve their remaining gaps and
clinch a deal until then is still not a safe bet.

WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton summoned the House Democratic leadership
to the White House Wednesday morning for an urgent meeting at
which advisers expect him to express regret for his actions
regarding Monic S. Lewinsky in an attempt to shore up political
support in the face of possible impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday opened a preliminary
investigation of President Clinton that could lead to an
independent counsel probe of allegations that he orchestrated a
plan to violate spending limits for his 1996 reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton dispatched an aide to Minneapolis to try
to break the deadlock between Northwest Airlines and its striking
pilots.
</P>
<P>
-- Stock prices continued their wild ride, as the Dow vaulted
380.53 points, or just under 5 percent, to 8,020.78. Broader
market averages also recorded hefty gains.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. sanction laws should be changed to give presidents
flexibility, including the right to waive penalties if that serves
the national interest, a State Department aide told a Senate
panel. Such changes have wide support, but prospects of passing
legislation this year is dim.

<HEADLINE> Market Witnesses Emergence of Entrepreneurial Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- While Chinese people have
traditionally regarded ancestral cemeteries as sacred, farmers in
Yi County, north China's Hebei Province, recently reinterred 35
ancestral graves to make way for the construction of a new market.
</P>
<P>
"Money trees won't grow in the graveyard, but it will
nonetheless in a bustling marketplace," according to villager Luo
Jiageng who recently reinterred the remains of his father.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese farmers have gained a greater awareness of market
functions and adapting to market competition, with a number
emerging as outstanding entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yufen, an entrepreneurial farmer from Xingtai County, Hebei
Province, expanded went into business selling brooms and has since
established a graphite company sales. Liu and another farmer from
Xingdong County, formed a joint venture with fixed assets of over
183 million yuan (22 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Local government support enabled me to succeed in overcoming
tough competition," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei government has introduced over 300 policies
encouraging the development of private enterprises since the
1980s, according to Li Jianchang, an official of Hebei Provincial
Industrial and Commercial Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The old management system for rural enterprises was based on
nepotism and greatly hindered the development of the
enterprises. Now, however, entrepreneurial farmers are introducing
scientific systems to their corporations.
</P>
<P>
Eight farmers in Hebei's Qinghe County invested 16 million yuan
to merge their enterprises into a Cashmere Processing Group. They
hired an expert from a state-owned company in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region to serve as general manager, and now have an
annual sales volume of 61.6 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Qinghe County enterprises currently employ over 500
professional staffers.
</P>
<P>
He Yuzhi, deputy secretary-general of the China Private
Enterprises Association, noted that the emergence of modern
entrepreneurial farmers will help to promote the Chinese economy.

<HEADLINE> ``Glaciological Research Aids Understanding of Climate, Environment'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Glaciological research has
provided people with valuable information about the global climate
and environmental changes for the past 50 years, said Dr. Jo
Jacka, vice-chairman of the International Glaciology Society (IGS)
here today.
</P>
<P>
The scientist, who is here for the Sixth International
Symposium on Antarctic Glaciology which closed today, said that
glaciological research will experience an even more fruitful era
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide scientific research on the subject started in the
1930s, and become a popular topic in global science circles in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jacka, an Australian scientist famous for his research into
glaciers in polar regions, said that glaciers are able to "record"
the changes of climate and environment in the past, like gigantic
data bases. Scientists can learn about geological, chemical and
climatic changes in ancient times by studying glaciers. Moreover,
from such research, scientists can forecast future climatic and
environmental changes.
</P>
<P>
"Scientists have claimed that the earth's climate is warming
up, and the reason for this phenomenon can be figured out
from glaciological research findings," the expert noted.
</P>
<P>
The temperature has risen by two degrees centigrade worldwide
in the past century, and it may rise at a more rapid rate in the
coming century, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He attributed global warming to the sudden increase in the
amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which is now about 25
percent higher than it was 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
This results from excessive burning of fossil fuels such as
coal and petroleum, he said, adding that this discovery has
aroused concern among the governments of many countries, which
are now making considerable efforts to control the emission of
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
The rising temperature has also broken the balance of water on
the earth, he said. He noted that research into this topic will
soon become a focal point for both Chinese and foreign
glaciologists.

<HEADLINE> China to Mark Teachers' Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese people are busy
preparing for activities on Thursday to mark the annual Teachers'
Day.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the
China Association for Promoting Democracy held a gathering in
Beijing today to celebrate the event.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the organizations expressed their greetings to
teachers nationwide, especially those suffered from the summer
floods.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education gave awards to the top 10 outstanding
teachers of the country and excellent teachers who achieved
exploits in the flood fight.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also issued a letter calling on teachers to change
outmoded ways. The old method of teaching involved feeding the
students in the way people feed ducks, which limits independence,
curiosity and creativity in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
On the campus of Nanchang University which is among the flooded
areas, students and teachers held a charity theatrical performance
to raise money for flood victims.
</P>
<P>
Another show will held by China Central Television and the
Ministry of Education Thursday evening to raise more money for
rebuilding damaged schools and providing subsidies for displaced
students.
</P>
<P>
China's first Teachers' Day was launched in 1985 in an effort
to create an atmosphere of respect for teachers, whose importance
was ignored in the chaotic Cultural Revolution (1966-'76).
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping cleared teachers' names and used them to propel
the modernization of China.

<HEADLINE> EU Concerned about Super-League Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
expressed its concern over the planned European super-league
soccer tournament and would like to make sure the planning is
compatible with its competition rules.
</P>
<P>
European Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert demanded
more detailed information about the plans from Milan-based Media
Partners, the consortium behind the ambitious and controversial
plan.
</P>
<P>
The take-off of the proposed super-league tourney needs
commission clearance.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners head Rodolfo Hecht has promised van
Miert,according to Wednesday's issue of the journal European
Report, to provide detailed information for the proposed league
of Europe's top clubs.
</P>
<P>
The journal quoted Hecht as saying that he planned to notify
the European Commission early on to pre-empt any competition
concerns about cartels and the collective sale of television
rights.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to brief the commissioner on such issues as
the potential exclusive long-term broadcasting contracts and
discriminatory membership rules.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners has claimed that their project would be fully
compatible with European Union's competition law and would give
all clubs in Europe the chance to take part.
</P>
<P>
Apart from free, terrestrial television broadcasts, the
consortium added, pay-per-view, digital and the Internet will
also be used to maximize access to the soccer fans and revenues
so generated to the clubs.
</P>
<P>
The Union of European Football Associations, the governing
body of the sport on the continent, has been worried by the
super-league planning and is desperate to retain its rights over
European club matches.

<HEADLINE> China Aiming to Dominate in Military Pentathlon Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China boost their chance to collect half of the six trophies
as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) pulled out of
the military sport +event on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK, who took the silver medals in both women's team and
individual divisions last year, are the winners of the women's
obstacles relay race and still hold the world record of this race.
</P>
<P>
"Women athletes who have better marks in obstacles relays are
priors to our selection for the competition," said Jiao
Liming,China's team leader.
</P>
<P>
China brought home the women's team and individual titles last
year in Sweden, and their domination in women's races is
unmovable after Koreans' pull-out.
</P>
<P>
"We have the potential to sweep the 1-2-3 finish in the
individual contest," Jiao added.
</P>
<P>
"But we'll meet powerful challenge from Brazil's men's team,"
Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
China won the men's team trophy, Debrus Cup, for the third
time in row last year and also the men's relay race, but Brazil's
Carlos Silva stole the individual champoinship.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil is the biggest obstacle for us to defending the Debrus
Cup,with Silva and veteran (Ribamar) Bandeira also their hopes
for the individual title," Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
Bandeira won the men's individual three times in 1990, 1991
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's coach Helcio Botelho said, "We're better prepared for
the competition, and we're confident to beat China to win the
Debrus Cup."
</P>
<P>
"Silva is in a better form now than Bandeira, but both could
win the individual title. It all depends on the shooting,"
Botelho added.
</P>
<P>
"Besides Brazil, we have to keep eyes on other competitors,
like Syria and Russia," Jiao said.
</P>
<P>
Russia finished third last year behind China and Brazil in
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"But Syria may be the surprise of the competition," Jiao
said."They didn't make any remarkable results in the pass years,
but they have the potential."
</P>
<P>
Jamal Hamadeh is the name Jiao mentioned as a dark horse in
the individual title chasing, who is still an unknown by now,
</P>
<P>
"If he (Hamadeh) manages to overcome his nervousness, he is
unbeatable."
</P>
<P>
The military sport gala will have the opening ceremony
tomorrow and the competition will start on Friday, with the
shooting competition the first contest of the seven-day event.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Further Ease Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided
Wednesday to further ease its grip on credit by guiding short-term
interest rates lower to quell fears about the country's financial
system, BOJ Governor Masaru Hayami said.
</P>
<P>
With this new monetary stance, the Japanese central bank will
seek to keep the unsecured overnight call money rate at around
0.25 percent per annum on a weighted average basis, down from the
current 0.4-0.5 percent, Hayami told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Our primary concern is the further worsening of the real
economy... We judged that easier credit is appropriate to help
stabilize the country's financial health," he said.
</P>
<P>
The overnight call money rate is the rate at which financial
institutions lend surplus funds to other financial institutions
that need money to fund their activities.
</P>
<P>
The call money market is where financial institutions lend each
other money and take out call loans maturing in the short term.
</P>
<P>
The market is the most important place where commercial banks
can raise funds to finance their daily lending and
deposit-refunding activities, while allowing financial
institutions with surplus funds to capitalize on interest accruing
from the call money they lend.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's decision to guide short-term money market
rates lower is the first monetary relaxation move the BOJ has
conducted in three years.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ's latest decision is aimed at preventing global stock
market turbulence induced by the Russian financial turmoil from
disrupting Japan's banking system, while providing additional
monetary stimuli to the stalled domestic economy, financial
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of the BOJ's easier monetary policy,
the U.S. dollar surged 3 yen to the upper 136 yen level Wednesday
evening in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
In London, the dollar jumped more than 4 yen to hit the mid-137
yen level at one point in early trading.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Accused of Meddling in Somali Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- One of Mogadishu's main
political figures Wednesday accused Egypt of meddling in the
internal affairs of Somalia by backing the new leaders of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Hajji Bod, the main rival of Ali Mahdi, blamed the
Egyptian government for financially supporting the
recently-created alliance of Mahdi and Hussein Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The two men led their main factions in north and south
Mogadishu to join hands last month in setting up an
administration of the capital Mogadishu in which Mahdi becomes
its new governor. Bod does not recognize the administration.
</P>
<P>
For this Egypt is further fueling the flames of the political
crises in Somalia, Bod told reporters in his residence in North
Mogadishu. Rod is one of the factions in Somalia which oppose the
establishment of an administration to manage the capital.
</P>
<P>
As a faction leader Bod characterized the political shuttle of
Egyptian diplomats between leaders of the above-mentioned Somali
factions as "a deliberate intervention into Somalia's internalM1%IM9j$$HJ++++$X.
H1een without a central government since 1991 when
former dictator President Siad Barre was toppled in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bod called on the Arab League, the Organization of the African
Unity (OAU) and the international community to condemn Egypt for
its "sinistral activities" in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Similar accusations against Egypt have also been voiced by
Osman Ali Atto's faction.
</P>
<P>
These attacks occurred at a time when Egyptian Ambassador to
Somalia Mohamud Mustafa was touring the operation of the
administration of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, accompanied by Mahdi and the capital police
commander, visited the camps where hundreds of militiamen were
being demobilized. They will be trained to become policemen in
the capital.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Denies Arrest of NLD Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government denied
Wednesday that it has arrested members of the National League for
Democracy (NLD), according to an official Information Sheet issued
here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In response to Tuesday's remarks of James Rubin, spokesman of
the State Department of the United States, regarding Myanmar's
detention of opposition figures, the information sheet claimed "no
member of the NLD has been arrested or charged with any crime.
Some members of the NLD have been invited by the government to
help ensure a peaceful transition to a multi-party democracy."
</P>
<P>
It added that "the NLD members have been very cooperative and
are being comfortably housed in government guest houses."
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government also denied that it has threatened to
deport Aung San Suu Kyi, general secretary of the NLD.
</P>
<P>
"The government has an obligation to protect the rights of all
Myanmar citizens to a safe, secure environment," the Information
Sheet said.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Myanmar welcomes any efforts by the U.S. and
the international community to help Myanmar maintain the current
stability during its transition to a multi-party democracy," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The NLD has repeatedly demanded the convening of a parliament
elected in the 1990 General Election in accordance with the then
Election Law and on June 23 set a deadline for the ruling State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to hold the parliament within
60 days.
</P>
<P>
After it received no response from the government on the expiry
of the deadline on August 21, the NLD declared its intention to
convene the parliament by itself in September.
</P>
<P>
The government had also warned earlier that "it would amount to
the NLD making herself a parallel government which no government
in the world would accept."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NLD charged on Wednesday's statement that the
Myanmar government has detained 187 parliament
representatives-elect and 334 organizers of the party since May
27, the 8th anniversary of Myanmar's General Election.
</P>
<P>
Of them, 58 NLD parliament-representatives-elect and 160 party
organizers have so far been detained after the party declared to
hold the parliament by itself on expiry of the deadline.
</P>
<P>
The NLD won the majority vote in the 1990 General Election,
participated by 93 political parties, with 396 out of the 485
parliamentary seats.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
that the government will continue to encourage foreigners to
invest in and renovate the country's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We especially welcome foreign investors in east China to
participate in the improvement of big and medium-sized state
enterprises in middle and west China," said Meng Xiangang, deputy
secretary-general of the State Economy and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
He told participants at a forum on attracting overseas
investment held here today that China is adopting a policy
encouraging state enterprises to actively use overseas capital to
readjust their strategy and reorganize their estates.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has allowed overseas investors to buy, rent
or run small state enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has 14,800 large and medium-size state enterprises, and
480,000 small ones. Many of them are running in the red, he
said. The Chinese government has vowed to solve their difficulties
within three years.
</P>
<P>
Meng said that the reform of state enterprises presents
opportunities for overseas investment. In the coming years, the
government expects overseas businesses to update the technologies
of China's old industrial bases and conventional industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that direct overseas investment will be the main
channel in the renovation, in addition to overseas loans and stock
issues in an adequate and cautious way.

<HEADLINE> EU Delays Decision Against Italy's Airport Sharing Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
Wednesday delayed a decision against Italy for its plan to share
airline services and traffic between two airports in the city of
Milan.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, told the Italian government that it would meet again next
Wednesday to see what kind of decision needed to be taken.
</P>
<P>
European Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said: "It is my
duty to uphold European law and to protect the competitive
interests of European air carriers and their passengers."
</P>
<P>
The commission was scheduled to decide against the Italian
sharing plan Wednesday, but changed the schedule after Kinnock
received a phone call from the Italian transport minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Italian government decided to distribute airline
traffic between Milan's existing airport Linate and the new
airport Malpensa, which is due to open on October 25.
</P>
<P>
Under a decree by Italian authorities, all carriers with more
than two million passengers each year will continue to fly in and
out of the easily-accessible Linate. Other flights will have to
fly out of Malpensa, which is 53 kilometers away from Milan.
</P>
<P>
Nine European carriers, including British Airways, Iberia, TAP,
Sabena, Lufthansa, Air France, Olympic, Austria Airlines and SAS
have complained to the European Commission that the plan is
discriminatory and disproportionate.
</P>
<P>
The carriers argued that due to the lack of sufficient
infrastructure between Milan and Malpensa, passengers would
continue to choose to fly Italy's national carrier Alitalia, out
of Linate, which is close to downtown Milan.

<HEADLINE> Runaway Consumption Widens Gap Between Rich, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Runaway consumption in the
world has been widening the gap between rich and poor and gross
inequalities in consumption opportunities have excluded over one
billion people who fail to meet even their basic consumption
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The report for 1998, commissioned by the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and launched Wednesday worldwide, says
that 86 percent of expenditures of personal consumption are made
by just 20 percent of the world population.
</P>
<P>
These rich people consume 45 percent of all the meat and fish,
58 percent of total energy, and 84 percent of all paper, and have
74 percent of all telephone lines and 87 percent of the world's
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the poorest one-fifth of the world population
consumes only 5 percent of meat and fish, less than 4 percent of
energy, and 1.1 percent of paper and have 1.5 percent of
telephone lines and less than 1 percent of cars.
</P>
<P>
The unequal income distribution translates into social
exclusion when the social values place too much importance on
what a person possesses rather than what a person is or can do,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
It warns that when social standards rise faster than incomes,
consumption patterns become unbalanced. Household spending for
conspicuous consumption can crowd out such essentials as food,
education, health care, child care and saving for a secure
future.
</P>
<P>
Runaway growth in consumption is placing unprecedented
pressure on the environment and putting those who consume least
in double jeopardy. Poor people benefit least and suffer the
most painful consequences of the unsustainable consumption
habits.
</P>
<P>
"The poorest one-fifth of the world's population, who are
responsible for just three percent of carbon dioxide emissions,
live in low-lying regions that are most vulnerable to the rising
sea levels associated with global warming," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Consumers, civil society and governments are urged to forge
alliances for new patterns of consumption and the world needs
patterns of consumption that share resources, not divide
societies, that strengthen people's capacities, not diminish
them, Richard Jolly, the principal coordinator of the report was
quoted by a handout as saying here.
</P>
<P>
The key goals of the report are: raising the consumption
levels of more than one billion people who have been left out of
the consumption boom; moving to more sustainable consumption
patterns; protecting and promoting the rights of consumers;
achieving more equitable burden-sharing among nations to reduce
and prevent damage to environment and reduce poverty itself.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Appeals for Emergency Aid for Bangladeshi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) on Wednesday made an appeal for emergency assistance
of 8 million U.S. Dollars for Bangladeshi women and children
affected by the current devastating flood.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF representative in Dhaka Shahida Azfar, who made the
appeal at a press conference here, said the appeal concentrates on
providing emergency relief to the most vulnerable - children and
women - particularly the landless and homeless during the floods
and in the immediate post-flood period.
</P>
<P>
Of the funding requirements, 1 million-dollar emergency aid is
for food, 4.35 million dollars for health, 2.2 million dollars for
water and environmental sanitation and the rest for replacing
school textbooks and others, she said.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the appeal by UNICEF as part of the wider UN
appeal is to solicit contributions for emergency relief and
rehabilitation of people affected by the flooding in Bangladesh,
the country representative said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the ongoing flood as "the most severe floods in
living memory," Azfar said the already poor nutritional status of
children and women will deteriorate even further as the situation
in many districts is continuing to deteriorate even after at least
of seven weeks of the severe flooding.
</P>
<P>
More than 21 million people are severely affected - either
displaced or made homeless, while some emergency shelters, which
have been set up mostly in schools, are overcrowded, she said.
</P>
<P>
The overcrowding, combined with shortages of food, safe
drinking water and adequate safe sanitation facilities, is almost
the "perfect breeding ground" for the outbreak of major diseases
and public health crisis, she said.
</P>
<P>
She cautioned that the chances of one or more epidemics will
increase even further when the flooding water begins to recede.

bringing the sensitive index down to around its last closing level
on the stock market today due to late profittaking by operators

</P>

"All of my colleagues are determined to continuously develop
the strong points and overcome shortcomings so as to greet new
challenges towards the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper office has received congratulatory messages from
central government departments in which they all spoke highly of
the paper's contributions to deepening mutual understanding and
common prosperity between Hong Kong and the mainland by adhering
to loving the country and loving Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> SADC Reiterates Demilitarization of Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Kaire Mbuende,
Executive Secretary of the Southern African Development
Community, reiterated here Wednesday the demilitarization of
politics in the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"Soldiers belong to the barracks and not to the competence in
parliament," the executive secretary said at a press briefing
here in the north of Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in peace and tranquility in that country
(DRC), therefore, we'll do everything possible to assist the
process by supporting and encouraging the government to negotiate
to be accommodated and to set a very clear timetable for
transition to democracy," said Mbuende, who is also Deputy
Minister of Agriculture of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The SADC would like to see democratization in Congo as soon as
possible, he said, adding the regional grouping will encourage
its member states to support materially or financially to
facilitate the process of transition to democracy in the vast
central African country.
</P>
<P>
According to him, if the rebels are clarified in their
attempts of demands, then it is easy to ask the government to
meet the demands, and "the only demand that will make sense if
you are attempting to overthrow the government is to make a
demand for transition to democracy. But that is not their
demands."
</P>
<P>
"What they are trying to do is to take over power through
force and this cannot be allowed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende has confirmed that a delegation led by Congolese
Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo are coming for the two-day
meeting of Council of Ministers starting Thursday and that
President Laurent Kabila will attend the SADC summit scheduled on
September 13-14.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no representative from the rebel side," he
said. "Congo has a government which is led by President Kabila.
That's the government we are supporting," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Kabila agreed Monday to a cease-fire, but refused
to meet face-to-face with the rebel movement known as the
Congolese Democratic Coalition, leaving peace prospects in the
air.
</P>
<P>
"The source of the Congolese problem is three decades of
protracted dictatorship since independence," Earnest Wamba dia
Wamba, head of the rebel coalition, said earlier.
</P>
<P>
The rebels started an armed revolt on August 2 in Goma, east
Congo, against Kabila's government. They accused Kabila of
corruption, nepotism and authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
The rebellion soon spread to the west of Congo, even on the
verge of capturing capital Kinshasa, before Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia intervened militarily and turned the tide over.
</P>
<P>
The Congo crisis will be on the SADC summit agenda, with
Kabila expected to brief the heads of state from the 14 member
countries of SADC on the developments in his country.
</P>
<P>
Congo (K) joined the regional organization last year.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Rise on Singapore Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
rise for the Third consecutive trading day on Singapore Stock
Market Wednesday as the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) gained
16.78 points to end at 885.46 points.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover shot up to 592.30 million units valued at
280.76 million Singapore dollars (162.83 million U.S. dollars).
Advancers outnumbered decliners by 256 to 94 with 237 counters
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Renong was the most active stock of the day with a volume of
38.35 million stocks traded. It was followed by MBF Cap that had
28.52 million units done. Public Bk F was next with 22.77 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH topped the gainers of the day as it gained 80 cents to
close at 13.40 Singapore dollars. Genting 200 rose by 56 cents to
finish at 2.55 Singapore dollars. M Bank 200 moved up 51.5 cents
to end 1.42 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>

cents to close at 1.60 Singapore dollars. Shell was down 26 cents
to end at 1.44 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said today's rally was encouraged by Wall Street's
gains overnight.
</P>
<P>
They also noted that trading today was dominated by CLOB, which
was resumed for one week after days of suspension and thereafter
trading of Malaysian stocks will cease in the over-the-counter
market in Singapore
</P>
<P>
CLOB stocks accounted for about three quarters of today's heavy
volume, they said.
</P>
<P>
The week is actually the last chance for local brokers to churn
commission in Malaysian shares before ceasing transactions of
Malaysian stocks and giving the business to Malaysian brokers.
</P>
<P>
Although uncertainties still existed over how the shares will
be transferred to Malaysia, dealers said retail investors were
picking up the deeply discounted CLOB shares for profits.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 9 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni will lobby for a cease-fire in Democratic Congo (DRC),
South African President Nelson Mandela said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told reporters at his residence in Cape Town that the
U.N. chief and the Ugandan president will try their best to
persuade rebels in Congo to agree to a cease-fire, saying that
there had definitely been progress in efforts to seek peace.
</P>
<P>
"But the question of the rebels still has to be considered.
It's no use for us talking about a cease-fire if the rebels don't
consider themselves bound by that decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he had received a briefing on Tuesday's peace
talks at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe from Summit Chairman Zambian
President Federick Chiluba, Museveni and Organization of African
Unity Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Congo rebels, who denied a direct role in the
peace talks, have vowed to intensify their struggle.
</P>
<P>
"We are going back home now to do one thing only, to intensify
our campaign against (President Laurent) Kabila," rebel
delegation leader Arthur Z'Ahidi Ngoma told reporters after
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's seven-nation peace summit
ended Monday without a cease-fire.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
announced here today that China will further open its market to
overseas investors.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Report: 15 Percent Live in Poverty in Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- About 15 percent of the
British population live in poverty and nearly 10 percent are not
expect to live to 60, according to a U.N. report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued by the United Nations Development Program,
says deprivation, unemployment and low literacy levels make
Britain one of the most poverty-stricken countries among developed
nations.
</P>
<P>
UNDP's poverty index shows that Britain is ranked 14th --
behind countries such as Germany, Japan and Australia, and only
the Republic of Ireland and the U.S. suffer higher levels of
poverty than Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than a fifth of adults in Britain are
considered functionally illiterate while 13.5 percent were living
below the recognized level of the poverty line - half the median
personal disposable income.
</P>
<P>
After taking in to account life expectancy, knowledge
deprivation and social exclusion, the report says 15 percent of
the British population live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
The report also points out that the gap between rich and poor
is growing across the world, with 20 percent of the world's
population consuming 86 percent of goods and services.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N., global consumption will top 24 trillion
U.S. dollars this year, six times the figure for 1975, as people
consume more food, energy, transportation, communications services
and entertainment.

<HEADLINE> HK to Host 17th Festival of Asian Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Provisional Urban
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
announced here Wednesday that the 17th Festival of Asian Arts will
be held between October 23 and November 14 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The event organized by the Provisional Urban Council biennially
was "not only a wealth of Asian arts, but also a tribute to Asian
cultures by showcasing their rich heritage, while at the same
time, juxtaposing the old and new, traditional and contemporary to
explore new dimensions," said Patrick Ho Chi-ping, provisional
urban councilor of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
This year's festival features over 16 performing groups from 13
Asian countries and regions to present a spectrum of art forms
including dance, music and theater, he said.
</P>
<P>
The programs this year have been tailored-made and based on
four themes -- Ethnic Traditions, Cross-Cultural Highlights,
Contemporary Theater and Splendor of Local Arts, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of Ethnic Traditions, he said, would feature
performing groups which strive to nurture age-old art forms so as
to enrich the experiences of modern audiences and cultivate their
interests in cultural history.
</P>
<P>
The theme of Cross-Cultural Highlights would showcase
productions by groups with different cultural backgrounds working
together to achieve common goals, Ho said.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Echoes of the Silk Road is a joint project
by music scholars of China and Japan to reconstruct and restore
ancient Chinese instruments transported to Japan via the Silk Road
over a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
The third theme is Contemporary Theater that builds on
combining classical and modern dance and music forms with
contemporary staging.
</P>
<P>
Splendor of Local Arts assumes the fourth theme which is a
feast of Hong Kong productions in various art forms.
</P>
<P>
During the Festival, an exciting outdoor program "Asian Arts
Parade" will be staged over three weekends to give a colorful
extravaganza of dance, music, drama and traditional arts performed
by expatriates in Hong Kong from across Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Festival will be complemented by a series of talks, lecture
demonstrations, exhibitions, workshops and outdoor presentations
by participating groups for the Festival.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Investigate on Car Mafia Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Finance
Fouad Siniora Wednesday said the country will soon open an
investigation into an alleged mafia network smuggling stolen
European cars into Lebanon, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He said to the radio that "there is definitely a mafia network
smuggling stolen cars into Lebanon and we will follow up the case
all the way to the end."
</P>
<P>
He added that more details of the story will be known after he
returns from a three-day visit to Cairo beginning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese minister's comments came a day after the country's
largest Arab-language newspaper An Nahar revealed that there was
a mafia in the country which is smuggling sedan cars stolen
in various European countries, especially Germany, to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted well-known sources as saying that Lebanese
political figures are using their influence to make sure
the stolen cars to pass through customs without any problems.
</P>
<P>
It also obtained a copy of a report of the international
Police (Interpol) Organization addressed to the Lebanon's customs
management, saying Lebanon has the highest rate of car theft
in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
But the report added that the cooperation of the Lebanese
customs authorities with Interpol has made it possible to
intercept some of the stolen cars before or at their arrival in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Lebanese customs authorities, in
cooperation with Interpol, have recently seized some 75
Mercedes-600 sedan cars allegedly stolen from European
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have beefed up
security at Entebbe International Airport following two telephone
threats to bomb the area, a senior police commander told Xinhua
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chris Bakesiima, the central regional police commander, said
in a telephone interview that more than 100 policemen have been
deployed in the area to guard against any possible bombing.
</P>
<P>
"We will not leave anything to chance because of the recent
bus bombings in the country" which claimed some 30 lives and
injured many others, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The police deployed at the airport in the southern city of
Entebbe have been on full alert since the threats were received.
</P>
<P>
A road block has been set up just two kilometers ahead of the
airport terminal to check every person and vehicle heading for
the airport.
</P>
<P>
The reinforcement of the police force will be there
permanently to take care of the area and the international
airport in particular, the police commander added.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan police have tried various means to sensitize civilians
on the dangers of suspicious objects and given tips on what to do
in every kind of emergency cases.

<HEADLINE> PTA Firm Urged to Finance Against Capital Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has challenged its regional
reinsurance company to step up its efforts to mobilize financial
resources to stem cash outflow from the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Times of Zambia newspaper published here
Wednesday, Kabeta Muleya, director of administration and finance
of the Lusaka-based regional group, made the challenge in a
message released to the paper Tuesday reacting to the performance
of the PTA Reinsurance Company,
</P>
<P>
PTA which stands for the Preferential Trade Area for Eastern
And Southern Africa is the predecessor of COMESA, a 20-member
regional body aiming to achieve a free trade area by the end of
2000.
</P>
<P>
Muleya said that for a long time the COMESA region had
depended on foreign institutions to mobilize financial resources
which should not be left unchecked as substantial resources had
been siphoned outside the region.
</P>
<P>
The PTA firm and other financial institutions should,
therefore, work toward mobilizing more financial resources for
the region to end capital flight, said Muleya.
</P>
<P>
"Regional financial institutions ought to play an important
role in stemming the outflow of resources from our region," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Muleya commended the recent ratification of the protocol on
the relaxation and eventual elimination of visa requirements by
some member countries.
</P>
<P>
He observed that regional trade could only be increased if
there was free movement of people within the region.

<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's efforts to attract
foreign investment has yielded dividends over the past two years,
with the declining trend giving way to rebounding growth during
the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
China signed foreign investment contracts valued at 28.18
billion US dollars during the period, up 7.25 percent on an annual
basis, according to Shi Guangsheng, minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, who is attending the Second China Investment
and Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, China adopted a series of measures to
encourage foreign investment, including granting duty-free status
to imported equipment and related tariff exemptions.
</P>
<P>
The main goals of the efforts centered on attracting
multinational corporations and consortia from the United States
and Europe, and offsetting the negative effects the Asian
financial crisis has had on China's use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China continued to lead the world in spite of the marginal
rebound, especially when compared with the dramatic currency
devaluations and economic recessions in many Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
The trade fair had yielded more than 1,200 contracts valued at
5.6 billion US dollars by this afternoon, with the volume
indicating the continuing great interest foreign investors have
for doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
Predictions of the foreign media made earlier this year that
the Asian financial crisis would adversely affect the flow of
foreign capital into China have proved erroneous.

<HEADLINE> ESCAP Head Proposes to Set Up Regional Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Given the prevailing economic
situation in Asia, it is time to establish a regional institution
to finance and promote trade through export credit and credit
guarantee, Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of United Nation's
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP),
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at the tenth meeting of the Steering Group
of the Committee for Regional Economic Cooperation of ESCAP, which
was held here from Wednesday to Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The idea was to help developing countries with risk
assessment, improve their access to quality information and
financial resources, and achieve economies of scales," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current economic crisis across the region,
Mooy said any sustained recovery was unlikely to begin before the
end of 1999, even on the most optimistic assumptions.
</P>
<P>
He said the crisis significantly dampens the prospects for the
region's industrial development and technology transfer as it
changes the expectations with respect to profits, forces a premium
on investment in the emerging markets and reduces the supply of
foreign direct investment from developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, opportunities still exist and one needs to reach
beyond the obvious and see what the implications are for the
future, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting of the Steering Group will deal with
various aspects of intraregional and interregional trade, trade
facilitation and the integration of transitional economies.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Group is a "think tank" of the ESCAP's Committee
on Regional Economic Cooperation comprising representatives of
governments, the private sector and academia. Its main task is to
develop innovative approaches to topical issues relating to
economic cooperation and make specific recommendations.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Has Poor Consumption Pattern: UNDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's consumption pattern
is among the poorest in the world and needs radical restructuring
for improvement, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)
says in its latest Report for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report, officially launched here and in more than 100
cities around the globe Wednesday morning, puts Uganda in the
160th position of the 174 countries listed in order of life
expectancy, educational attainment and adjusted real income.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, some 30 billion Ugandan shillings (30 million U.S.
Dollars) was spent on basic education while 75 and 145 billion
shillings (75 and 145 million Dollars) were used to buy
cigarettes and alcohol, UNDP Resident Representative in Uganda
Babatunde Thomas told audience at the launching ceremony of the
report.
</P>
<P>
Because of increasing pollution in Lake Victoria, fish catch
has been declining sharply since 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to the Poverty Eradication Action Plan in 1997, 66.3
percent of Uganda's population were living in abject poverty and
86.2 percent living in relative poverty.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy of less than 50 years reflects a national
waste and the nearly 40 percent of illiteracy describes low
social development.
</P>
<P>
Francis Ayume, Uganda's Parliament speaker, said in a keynote
speech at the ceremony that Ugandans should be more aware of the
impact of consumption on the environment and human development.
</P>
<P>
The government's poverty eradication action plan will focus on
roads, land, agriculture, employment and labor productivity, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP has started to publish its annual report since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Upper Reaches of Yangtze Prone to More Natural Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The State Forestry
Administration revealed today that an increasing number of natural
disaster are occuring in the Three Gorges Dam area and upper
reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing frequency can largely be attributed to
deforestation in the related dam area and upper reaches of
the Yangtze," according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan and Guizhou provinces in the upper reachs of the
Yangtze River have suffered from frequent flooding in recent
years, with the annual 1.93 million hectares of flooded areas
recorded for the two provinces in the 1990s rising by as much as
one-fold in the 1980s and a dramatic nine-fold on figures for the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
The report indicted that the forest coverage in the upper
reaches of the Yangtze in Yunnan Province has dropped dramatically
from 50 percent during the 1950s to only 24 percent today. Soil
erosion has jumped dramatically from only 6.3 percent of the total
land coverage in 1956 to the current 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated that some 100 counties in the upper
and middle reaches of the river have completed afforestation
efforts on barren mountains since China initiated the shelterbelt
project in 1989. The extensive project has greatly improved the
ecological environment and enabled related areas to initially
control soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
"It will extremely difficult to reach the percentage of forest
coverage in the 1950s," said the report, adding that over half of
the total number of counties in the Three Gorges areas and upper
reaches of the Yangtze have not as yet introduced the shelterbelt
project."

<P>
"Many foreign investors have turned to China despite low
investment costs in Southeast Asian countries. They, in fact,
believe that China's stable economic and political environments
will offer long-term benefits," according to Wang Zhile, a
research fellow with the China International Trade and Economic
Cooperation Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute the continuing influx of foreign
investment mainly to the favorable policies China has adopted this
year. They cite the central government's deliberate investment
guidance for the central and western regions and the booming
service sector as examples.
</P>
<P>
Various United Nations trade development experts contend that
China's market continues to offer vast potential for foreign
investment in spite of perceived market saturation and
insufficient domestic demand. They also note the country will
continue to use large amounts of direct foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
China recorded seven percent growth in GDP for the first seven
months of the year, a mere one point below the annual target. The
country continued to rank first in the world with a foreign trade
volume reaching 179.49 billion US dollars, a year-on-year rise of
4.2 percent, according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have exhibited great confidence in China's
long-term and sustainable economic growth, said economists, adding
that the country will maintain GDP growth of at least seven for
the next 12-odd. They also point out that China total investment
scale of 1.2 trillion US dollars will continue to offer vast
business opportunities for foreign investors.

Rabbani came to Iran following his participation in the recent

</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Rabbani told Kharrazi that the Afghan

</P>
<P>
He accused the Afghan Taliban militia, which has seized most of
the Afghan territory, of massacring people in northern part of
the country.
</P>
<P>
With the revealing made to the world by the Amnesty

respect for Islamic, humanitarian and international principles,
the Afghan president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kharrazi expressed regret over continuation of
crisis in Afghanistan and massacre of Afghan people, stating that
Iran has always denounced policy of resorting to force in
Afghanistan and today severely condemns massacre of innocent
Muslim people in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taliban by attacking the Iranian consulate in
Mazari Sharif and kidnaping Iranian diplomats have shown to the
world that they do not believe in any Islamic and international
principles.
</P>
<P>
Iran holds the Taliban responsible in this connection,
Kharrazi said, expressing hope that through efforts of the United
Nations, the crisis will soon come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that the Taliban forces kidnaped 11 Iranian
diplomats and an IRNA correspondent from Mazari Sharif. However,
reports reaching here said that the group of Iranian have been
killed by the Taliban when they occupied the city.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Rabbani's visit to Tehran is aimed at
encouraging Iran to arm Afghan refugees in Iran and to support
his group to fight against the Taliban forces which drove his
forces out of the capital Kabul in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Carry out Projects ensuring Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has planned to carry out
a number of projects over a period of 14 years to counter the
problem of water scarcity, a Water and Irrigation Ministry report
obtained on Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The projects estimated to cost 3.5 billion Jordanian dinars (5
billion U.S. dollars) are aimed at extracting water from the
Jordan Valley and tapping water potential in eastern desert oases,
the report released to a meeting of Jordanian businessmen late
Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Jordan's water demand is predicted to
stand at nearly 1.7 billion cubic meters annually by the year
2020. But its current water facilities can only meet 85 percent of
the demand by then.
</P>
<P>
"These projects will ensure that the chronic water problem
will not worsen," the ministry secretary general, Qusai Quteishat,
said.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the private sector would invest in
the projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a water-poor country below the international level of
annual consumption of 1,000 cubic meters of water per capita.
</P>
<P>
Limited resources have caused the water scarcity in the
kingdom, which lacks major surface water sources and depends on
restricted shares of international waterways.
</P>
<P>
Rapid population growth has also aggravated the problem of
water supply of Jordan, which has 4.6 million people with an
annual growth rate of 3.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Third Longest River to Grow Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese textbooks may have to
rewrite their accounts of the Huaihe River in a few years later,
because this third longest river of China is expected to become
163.5 kilometers longer.
</P>
<P>
China plans to invest nearly four billion yuan (about 482
million U.S. dollars) to dig an east-west water course in east
China's Jiangsu Province, enabling the water of the Huaihe River
to empty into the Yellow Sea instead of flowing into the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official recently announced that the trial dig
will start this winter, and once completed, the Huaihe River is
expected to become longer than it is today.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe, 1,000 kilometers long, originates in the Tongbai
Mountain in central China's Henan Province, and has a drainage
area of 187,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a century ago, the Yellow River, China's second longest
river, overflowed and took over the Huaihe River's course to the
sea, forcing it to crowd into the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the river has threatened the life and property of
people living along its middle and lower reaches, and in 1991, a
flood there caused heavy losses in Jiangsu province and the
neighboring Anhui and Henan provinces.
</P>
<P>
Experts have conducted many field studies in the region and
submitted several draft resolutions to the central government.
</P>
<P>
The State Development Planning Commission recently approved the
building of this new water course.
</P>
<P>
Several more water conservation projects will also be built in
the region to assist flood control, the official added.

<HEADLINE> China not Decided over Soccer Side to Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China has not yet made a
final decision on whether to send the young Olympic team or the
national team to play the Bangkok Asian Games in December, a
spokesman of Chinese Football Association (CFA) said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nan Yong, excutive president of CFA, denied that China has
decided to send its under-23 soccer team to compete in the Asian
Games, which had been widely reported by some home newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"It's just a rumor," said Nan in a rutine news brief of CFA.
"Until this moment, CFA has not decided which team will represent
China to play the Asian Games."
</P>
<P>
However, Nan said it will not take a long time before CFA's
decision comes out.
</P>
<P>
"We are pondering on it seriously," Nan said. "But our
decision has to be approved by the State's General Bureau of
Sports, China's sports governing body."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, national team boss Bob Houghton also said that China
will send its under-23 team to play the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has recommended young
sides compete in the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
Peter Velappan, secretary general of AFC, said in July that
the soccer competition of the Asian Games should be a showcase
for the continent's young talents.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has announced to field its Olympic to the Asian
Games but Japan, another main contenders for the Games, has yet
to make the final decsion, Nan said.

<HEADLINE> Consumption to Be Adjusted for Human Development: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The global consumption
patterns have to be restructured for better human development, a
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report has said.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 UNDP report, which has been launched Wednesday in
more than 100 cities around the world, was officially launched
here by Ugandan Parliament Speaker Francis Ayume, UNDP Resident
Representative in Uganda Babatunde Thomas and other senior
officials of the U.N. agency.
</P>
<P>
The international community has to adjust the current
consumption pattern in order to better help develop the quality
of human beings.
</P>
<P>
There are glaring distortions in the consumption patterns, the
report points out. People now spend so much on entertainment and
on other purposes while very little money is spent to meet their
basic needs.
</P>
<P>
The world spends some six billion U.S. Dollars annually on
basic education while a total of 50 billion Dollars are spent on
cigarettes in Europe alone.
</P>
<P>
The international expenditure on water and sanitation is nine
billion Dollars while Europeans and Americans spend 17 billion
Dollars on pet foods.
</P>
<P>
Media organizations are therefore urged to do more to educate
people in this aspect by promoting information flow to the
grassroots.
</P>
<P>
The impressive impact of consumption on environment is also
stressed in the report. The developed countries, who produce more
pollutants, should work together with poorer countries in
fighting environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Only when the current consumption pattern is properly adjusted can
sustainable consumption and hence sustainable development be
achieved, it added.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Central Bank in $9M Forex Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Zambia in August
recorded a deficit of about nine million U.S. dollars in the
amount of foreign exchange that came into Zambia compared to
outflows.
</P>
<P>
While in-coming foreign exchange amounted to only 2.2 million
dollars, about 10.9 million dollars was spent on outstanding
foreign obligations, leading to a total deficit of 8.7 million
dollars, according to a treasury letter for the month of August
released by Citibank.
</P>
<P>
The amount spent by the central bank on debt-servicing during
the month plunged from 20.7 million dollars in July to 3.5
million dollars, which suggested a reduced capacity to service
debt due to inadequate foreign exchange for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of the deficit in foreign exchange flows,
Citibank estimates that Zambia's foreign exchange reserves has
declined by eight percent during the month to 105 million
dollars. This means that the Zambian government is approaching
dangerously low levels for maintenance of debt-servicing and
other government operations.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the situation at the central bank, August
statistics on inflows and outflows through commercial banks shows
a surplus of 6.7 million dollars with the consolidated foreign
exchange position increasing to 45.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the surplus situation in commercial banks, the
volume of foreign exchange traded dropped by 27 percent to 92
million dollars from July to August, said the newsletter.

HANOI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The bank for foreign trade of
Vietnam has suspended the settlement of import-export payments to
Russian banks at the request of Russian companies, a newspaper
report said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Due to current difficulties in Russian financial institutions,
several Russian firms have asked to freeze trade payments to
Russian banks, a Vietnamese bank official was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, no import-export payments for Russian businesses have
fallen due, said the official, adding that the annual trade
payments are just a few million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the foreign trade between the two countries valued
at about 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Russian central bank suspended the trade on the
electronic system of the Moscow Interbank currency exchange as
demand for the U.S. dollar was exceeding supply, which sent the
ruble plummeting.

<HEADLINE> Report Emphasizes Relationship Between Consumption and Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Human Development
Report 1998 released this morning emphasized the relationship
between consumption and human development.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report, which
was simultaneously released in The Hague and the capitals of more
than 100 countries, focuses on the consumption of goods and
services, and examines whether related trends will promote or
otherwise hinder human progress.
</P>
<P>
The report, which measured human progress and deprivations,
revealed unprecedented growth in consumption during the 20th
century in terms of both scale and diversity. It also pointed out
that the rapid growth of consumption has widened the gap between
the rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
The document showed that a mere 20 percent of the world's
population accounts for some 86 percent of total consumption, and
noted the glaring inequality in consumption opportunities excluded
over one billion people from meeting their basic needs.
</P>
<P>
Canada ranked the first in overall human development for the
fifth consecutive year, with France and Norway following closely
behind in second and third place, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report indicated that China's human development index
ranks 106th amongst 174 countries, compared with its ranking of
108th out of 175 countries in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, UNDP resident representative in China,
expressed hope that the report will serve as an important
reference for Chinese policy makers, scholars, the media and
external partners for development.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed hope that it will make people think more
about the consumption pattern in China and prompt global society
to aim for the future in order to fulfill the vision centered on
seeking equitable and sustainable consumption.
</P>
<P>
Visiting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson
said that "China can be commended for its efforts to eliminate
poverty and to meet the basic needs of all citizens."
</P>
<P>
She said she will join the Chinese government in efforts to
ensure the full realization of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Robinson also noted the signing of a memorandum of intent
to promote the development of technical cooperation with China.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Local Oil Firm to Begin Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A local oil company Atlas
Petroleum Nigeria Ltd. is scheduled to begin production in
October this year with a capacity of 15,000 barrels per day
(bpd), raising combined production of local oil companies to
64,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
Atlas Petroleum Nigeria is one of 48 local companies granted
oil prospecting licenses since 1991 when the Nigerian government
introduced an indigenisation program, The Guardian reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Other indigenous oil producers like Nigerian Petroleum
Development company, Dubri Oil, Express Petroleum and
Consolidated Oil have already begun their production.
</P>
<P>
Two others such as Yinka Folawiyo Petroleum and Cavendish
Petroleum are also expected to come on stream before the middle
of next year.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old indigenous program implemented by the
Nigerian government is aimed at breaking the monopoly of foreign
companies in the vital oil sector of the country's industry.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is a major oil producing country in the world with a
capacity of 2.5 million bpd mainly produced by multi-national
companies of Shell Petroleum, Mobil Producing, Chevron Nigeria
Ltd. and Elf Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The growing oil production by local companies may force the
major oil companies to cut down their production to cope with the
quota allowed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC).

held in detention without trial since 1994, in connection with
turmoil in the Ogoni area in south Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Their release was granted Monday by the High Court Seven, Port
Harcourt, Rivers State.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the release, Justice A.C. Woryi said their detention
without trial was unconstitutional, unlawful, illegal, null and void.
He said the release was unconditional.
</P>
<P>
The 21 youths, except Mrs. Daughter Dilosi, who was arrested
in September 1997, were arrested together with nine others
following the turmoil in May 1994, which claimed the lives of
four Ogoni leaders who were said to be pro-governmental.
</P>
<P>
The turmoil was a result of the tension between the government
and the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) over
environment protection and community development issues in the
oil-producing Ogoni area.
</P>
<P>
Nine persons, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa were sentenced to
death for murder by a special tribunal and eventually hanged to
death in November 1995, sparking off international sanctions
against Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
A statement signed by the State Information Commissioner
Medileine Tador and broadcast over the state radio said the
government released them in the spirit of the national
reconciliation policy of General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who had
ordered the release of all political detainees since his
assumption of office in June.
</P>
<P>
The statement appealed to all Ogoni people to henceforth work
for peace in the state.
</P>
<P>
The release of the 21 persons was confirmed Tuesday morning by
MOSOP's self-exiled leader in London, Ledum Mitee.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
floundered Wednesday in line with weaker Asian markets, despite
Wall Street's biggest ever daily rise on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The Australian share market rose sharply at the open but all
gains were wiped out by midday as news hit that the Japanese
market was suffering.
</P>
<P>
A lower Hong Kong market also dampened buying sentiment,
ensuring volumes were kept at modest levels.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index finished 12.7 points softer
at 2542.5, off an intra-day low of 2536.8. In morning trade, it
reached a high of 2581.7.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials slipped 8.0 points to 4472.2 while the
resources index tumbled 19.2 points or 1.9 percent, to 984.8.
</P>
<P>
Resources stocks were mostly lower with giant BHP losing 25
cents to 12.65 Australian dollars and global miner Rio Tinto,
which unveils its interim profit Thursday, slipping 10 cents to
18.40 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold stocks also lost ground as the spot price for bullion was
trading in Sydney 2.90 U.S. dollars per fine ounce cheaper at
284.50 U.S. dollars by late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The gold index forfeited 27.1 points, or 2.65 percent, to
994.8.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks recorded mixed fortunes, with National Australia
Bank rising 22.4 cents to 21.681 Australian dollars, Westpac bank
shedding 18.6 cents to 9.18 Australian dollars, ANZ bank fell nine
cents to 8.72 Australian dollars, Commonwealth Bank of Australia
closed 12 cents lower at 19.78 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker Under Pressure From Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
Wednesday lower as market focus returned to Asia and the ailing
Japanese banking system.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed the session in Sydney at 58.81 U.S.
cents, from 59.34 U.S. cents on Tuesday night. It traded as low as
58.75 U.S. cents and as high as 59.30 U.S. cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nick Volanakis, senior foreign exchange dealer at Colonial
State Bank, said the Australian dollar faced some selling off from
Europe and was starting to see a decline.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen had been
affected by the rumors of a derivative loss for Japan's Fuji Bank
Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the market was swept with rumors the bank had lost
up to three trillion yen on derivatives deals. But the bank was
quick to deny the losses.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar gained a little ground against the
Japanese yen Wednesday to close at 78.66 Japanese yen from 78.48
yen.
</P>
<P>
It was also buying 1.0215 German marks from 1.0276 marks.

<HEADLINE> United Nations to Send Fact-finding Mission to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will send
a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan to determine the fate of the
Iranian diplomats who went missing after the fall of
Mazar-e-Sharif to Taliban troops last month, U.N. sources here
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"(U.N.) Secretary General's office is organizing a mission," an
U.N. official told the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
"You have to contact the Secretary General's office in New
York," the official was quoted as saying when asked about the
composition of the proposed U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
An U.N. spokesman in New York announced Tuesday that Secretary
General Kofi Annan has engaged in discussions regarding the status
of 10 missing Iranian diplomats and a correspondent of the Iranian
official news agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
Iran accuses Taliban of holding dozens of its nationals hostage
since capturing Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km north of Kabul, from
the beleaguered northern alliance.
</P>
<P>
Taliban authorities confirmed that some 40 Iranian drivers were
in their custody but denied that they had detained Iranian
diplomats and IRNA reporter.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban regime last week released five Iranian prisoners as
a mark of good gestures following hectic diplomatic efforts by
Pakistan to stave off possibility of any military confrontation
between the two neighboring Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
Taliban and Iran had agreed on a tripartite mission including
representatives from both sides and Pakistan to visit
Mazar-e-Sharif to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
Tension escalated between Iran and the Taliban with the
deployment of 70,000 Iranian troops for military exercises along
the Iran and Afghanistan's border.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 9 (Xinhua) -- One more monk was shot dead
in clashes between Cambodian police and protesters on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred demonstrators gathered at the U.S. Embassy to
protest government's crackdown on protesters and Buddhist
monks. They also called on the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hun Sen
and his regime.
</P>
<P>
When riot police tried to disperse the demonstrators, clashes
burst into violence. One Buddist monk was shot dead and an AP
press photographer seriously injured in the head.
</P>
<P>
At least three protesters, including two monks and one cycle
driver have been killed and scores of others injured since
September 7.

King Norodom Sihanouk Tuesday said he was "saddened to receive
the news about the deaths and injuries of the monks and Buddhist
people, which make me worried."

<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, leaders of two main
opposition parties strongly condemned the violence.

never accept and assist a new government which is formed by
force.

<HEADLINE> Skin Cancer May Signal Other Cancers, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A study released Tuesday
said people with non-melanoma skin cancers had about 25 percent
higher annual risk of death from other cancers compared to persons
who did not have skin cancer at all.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers at Emory University and the
American Cancer Society and published in the September 9th issue
of The Journal of the American Medical Association, focused on the
1982-1994 health outcomes of more than 1.1 million adults taking
part in the Cancer Prevention Study II. Nearly 48,000 study
subjects died of cancer during the 12 years.
</P>
<P>
The researchers found that men and women with non-melanoma
skin cancer faced increased risks for lung cancer (up 37 percent
for men, 46 percent for women), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (32
percent for men, 50 percent for women).
</P>
<P>
Men with non-melanoma skin cancers had increased risks for
cancers of the testes (12 times the risk) and salivary glands (3
times the risk), as well as increased risk of prostate cancer (27
percent), bladder cancer (41 percent), and leukemia (37 percent).
</P>
<P>
Women with a previous history of non-melanoma skin cancer was
associated with 34 percent increase in their long-term risk of
developing breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said right now they do not know the reasons
behind all these associations, speculating that the increased
exposure to ultraviolet sunlight that can trigger skin cancers
might also have a role to play in the development of other cancers.
</P>
<P>
"If the common link between these cancers is ultraviolet light,
then taking steps to reduce the risk of skin cancer would also
help reduce risk of other cancers," said Michael Thun, a cancer
society researcher who co-authored the study.

<HEADLINE> Israel Pledges to Work out Deal with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official on
Wednesday pledged Israel's determination to work towards striking
a redeployment deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Danny Naveh, personal envoy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu who arrived here earlier in the morning, made the pledge
following talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
In a short meeting with reporters, Naveh said he "updated" the
Egyptian leader on the recent negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians on the long-overdue second Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
For the past six months, Israel has been resisting an American
initiative calling for a 13 percent Israeli pullback. The
Palestinians had already accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Naveh indicated that Netanyahu has made up his mind to reach a
deal with the Palestinians on the U.S. idea. "The prime minister
is ready to do all he can to reach an agreement with the
Palestinians based on reciprocity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to go back to negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Observers here still doubt if a deal is really around the
corner, for Netanyahu has repeatedly declared that Israel and the
Palestinians are "near, very near" an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's political advisor, Osama el-Baz, on the other hand,
told reporters that Mubarak gave the Israeli envoy "some advices"
as to "what Israel's position should be" during the talks.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that a failure in the peace talks would lead to
instability in the region and no party should apply pressure on
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian press, Israel has been accusing Cairo of
trying to obstruct an Israeli-Palestinian agreement, because it
repeated that any deal has to be fair and balanced, instead of
sacrificing the interest of either party.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Israel to Accept U.S. Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Wednesday urged Israel to
accept the proposal made by the United States calling for further
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank in a bid to advance the
peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians have accepted the American initiative
unequivocally without any conditions. (But) Israel has not done
so...," Egyptian presidential advisor Osama el-Baz told Xinhua
before a meeting between President Hosni Mubarak and Israeli envoy
Danny Naveh.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has reportedly proposed that Israel withdraw from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in a move to salvage the
stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz criticized Israel for setting new conditions on
accepting the proposal by suggesting that 3 percent of the areas
be changed into "nature reserves" where the Palestinians have
limited powers.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that "it is for the Palestinian jurisdiction
and authority to decide without any pressure from any other side"
whether to agree to the Israeli suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Naveh, Israeli cabinet secretary, who arrived here early in the
day, will brief Mubarak on the results of the latest talks between
the Jewish state and the Palestinians on the overdue Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Woman Taken Away for Security Reasons: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao said here today that security guards removed a woman from
the entrance of the Hilton Hotel because she was disturbing order
at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question raised by a reporter, the spokesman
said that the woman, later identified as Chu Hailan, this morning
blocked the entrance of the Hilton Hotel where a meeting of the
representative office of the United Nations Development Program in
China was planned. Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for
human rights, would attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of Ms. Robinson, who is also an
ex-president of Ireland, the hotel's security guards took the
woman away and asked her to leave on her own, said Zhu.

<HEADLINE> Australian, NZ Breast Implant Victims to Get </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 4,000 Australian
and New Zealand women stand to receive up to 125,000 Australian
dollars (75,000 U.S. dollars) each under a compensation payout for
injury from silicone breast implants, the Australian Associated
Press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the women said Wednesday U.S. company Dow Corning
has reached an in-principle agreement to pay 39.5 million U.S.
dollars to settle Australian and New Zealand claims against it,
the wire service said in a report released from Brisbane, capital
of the state of Queensland, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement represents a victory for the women who have
fought a seven-year battle for compensation for the pain and
disease they claim have been inflicted from the implants.
</P>
<P>
Law firm Slater and Gordon said the deal is far better than
anything previously offered and would deliver more money, more
quickly than any other option.
</P>
<P>
Most claims should be paid within three years.
</P>
<P>
However, while claimant Gail Jackson said the likely payout
would be "very nice," it would hardly reimburse her for the pain
and suffering caused by implants over 26 years.
</P>
<P>
Paula Shelton, from Slater and Gordon, said the Australia-New
Zealand deal is one of the first foreign settlements to be made
with Dow Corning, which is facing claims by more than 170,000
women around the world.
</P>
<P>
She said the agreement would ensure that women receive their
compensation within seven years under a U.S. bankruptcy plan being
approved, with most waiting no longer than three years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Bankruptcy Court has been overseeing compensation
payouts since Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy protection in 1995,
enabling it to close off liabilities and continue to trade.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of women claim to have suffered auto-immune and
connective disorders as a result of silicone implants, 80 percent
of which were for cosmetic purposes.

<HEADLINE> Liupan Mountain Emerges as Green Island on Loess Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A barren mountain 40 years
ago, Liupan Mountain in northwest China is now nearly covered with
trees, and has emerged as a green island on the loess plateau.
</P>
<P>
The annual rainfall on the mountain located in the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region exceeds 700 millimeters, and the mountain now
plays a vital role in water and soil conservation for the loess
plateau, where average rainfall is 300 millimeters overall.
</P>
<P>
Located over 400 kilometers south of Yinchuan, the regional
capital, Liupan Mountain covers an area of about 70,000 hectares
and is surrounded by the loess plateau.
</P>
<P>
According to Lin Jianguo, deputy director of the Liupan
Mountain Forest Administrative Bureau, the mountain had turned
desolate by the end of 1950s due to human destruction and a
worsening environment, but has been saved by enhanced forest
protection measures in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the mountain was designated by the state as a national
nature reserve. At present, the mountain's forest reserve
encompasses 1.5 million cubic meters, and is increasing at an
annual rate of 270,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Liupan Mountain is home to 788 plant varieties and 213 animal
species.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: SADC Summit to Dwell on Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Ma Guihua)
</P>
<P>
GRAND BAIE (Mauritius), September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Southern
African Development Community (SADC) summit due to open here on
September 13-14 will again dwell on the political crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be briefed by heads of state or government
from the DRC, Angola and Lesotho on developments in their
countries and examine possible long-term solutions to the
political problems in these countries, said SADC Executive
Secretary Kaire Mbuende Monday in his preview of the meeting in
the Mauritian resort of Grand Baie.
</P>
<P>
The DRC, which joined the regional grouping last year, has
seen much turbulence in the past month when the Tutsi-led
Banyamulenge rebels took up arms against Laurent Kabila's
15-month old government.
</P>
<P>
The fighting soon spread from the east of the third biggest
African country to its west, with three other SADC members,
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, pouring in troops and arms to help
prop up the Kabila government.
</P>
<P>
The 14 SADC member states have thus been divided in their
approaches to the Congo crisis, with those led by South Africa
advocating for diplomatic solutions whereas Zimbabwe and some of
its allies are in for military intervention.
</P>
<P>
But South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki denied any
differences between his government and Zimbabwe over the
Congolese issue at the 12th Non-Aligned Movement summit in South
Africa's east port city of Durban earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries want a cease-fire immediately. Both countries
want a withdrawal of foreign troops," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
In Angola, the faltering peace process has been stranded as
the opposition movement National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) failed to fully comply with the 1994 Lusaka Peace
Protocol.
</P>
<P>
The recent announcement by the Angolan government to expel
UNITA members from the government of national unity and the
parliament has led to discrepancies within the former rebel UNITA
movement, with some of the expelled ministers and MPs voicing to
defect their leader Jonas Savimbi who they said is more
interested in war than peace.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the increasing rivalry between the Angolan
government and the UNITA might trigger off yet another civil war
in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, the summit will review the performance
of member states in the past twelve months as well as examine the
negative impact of the Asian and Russian financial crisis on the
region's economies.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will evaluate both national and regional
strategies being put in place to ensure financial stability and
continued socio-economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
The SADC heads of state and government will also receive an
updated report on the food security situation against the
background of erratic and below-normal rainfall in some of the
southern African countries and excessive rains and flooding in
other parts of the region such as Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Production forecasts in the region indicate a decline of about
six percent in maize harvest of 16.10 million tons against last
year's 17.05 million tons, which will also be noted during the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the region has an overall cereal deficit of 510,000
tons, a shortfall of 1.35 million tons of millet, according to
the SADC executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also expected to consider new protocols for
signature relating to tourism, facilitation of free movement of
peoples in the community and the establishment of the SADC
Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
A Statement on Violence Against Women and Children; a
Convention Against Corruption and a Declaration on the Status of
Refugees in the region are also on the cards.
</P>
<P>
The SADC, the most influential organization in southern Africa
which was established in 1992, now comprises Angola, Botswana,
the DRC, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia,
Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A three-day meeting of the SADC Standing Committee of
Officials and a two-day Council of Ministers conference will be
held before the annual summit proceeds.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish Jets to Hold First Joint Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli and Turkish air
forces are to hold a first joint air maneuver in Israel from
September 13 to 18, the Jerusalem Post newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say how many Turkish jet fighters would take
part in the exercises, the first since the two countries signed a
military cooperation agreement in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jet fighters from the two countries have trained in each
other's airspace over the past two years, but they have never
flown together.
</P>
<P>
A squadron of Turkish F-16s was in Israel last June to receive
training on testing grounds jointly-run by Israel Air Force (IAF)
and Rafael, the Armaments Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
The IAF and Rafael have put together an "Air Combat
Maneuvering Instrumentation Range" in the Negev desert, south
Israel, where the jets trained to evade surface-to-air missiles,
possibly similar to the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles Greek
Cypriots plan to deploy in November to balance Turkish air
superiority over the Island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974, when Turkey landed
troops on the island and took over the northern third in the wake
of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey also planed to conduct another joint naval
maneuver in November this year. The maneuver, called Reliant
Mermaid II, is a continuation of last January's Reliant Mermaid I,
allegedly for search and rescue purposes.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan would again be invited to participate in the
new naval exercises, as they were for January.
</P>
<P>
The January's naval exercises were condemned by Egypt, but
Jordan sent an observer aboard the Turkish ship.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea to Revise National Security Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung Wednesday said his government will revise the National
Security Law to take out items which violate human rights.
</P>
<P>
It will not be long before the revision is made, Kim said when
he met Pierre Sane, Secretary-General of Amnesty International,
who arrived here for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kim said that he will never abuse the security law
to prolong his power.
</P>
<P>
During the 15th presidential race last December, Kim Dae-jung,
then opposition candidate, said he would revise the law after he
became president of the country.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, President Kim, who was regarded as a prisoner
of conscience by the Amnesty International during the military
governments, told Sane that he agrees, in principle, with Amnesty
International's campaign to abolish death penalty worldwide.
</P>
<P>
But the president did not say whether his government will scrap
capital punishment in South Korea as there has yet been no debate
on abolition of death penalty in the country, said presidential
spokesman Park Jie-won.
</P>
<P>
Kim said he is interested in considering the possibility of
releasing political prisoners when the Amnesty International
secretary-general asked whether Kim will set free the remaining
political prisoners, many of whom have been behind bars for nearly
40 years.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Teachers to Update Methodology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Education
issued an open letter today urging teachers nationwide to update
outdated instructional methodology in order to improve student
creativity.
</P>
<P>
The letter points out that the next century will represent a
new information age featuring a high technology revolution which
will influence the entire world. Meeting new challenges require
adjustments in China's traditional educational theories and
methods.
</P>
<P>
China's Teachers have for thousands of years been affected by
doctrines in which Confucius defined teachers as fountains of
knowledge and reliable sources of information. Students have, in
fact, been required to believe everything put forward by their
teachers.
</P>
<P>
The letter refers to the tradition as a "duck-feeding" model
which detracts from the independence and creativity of students.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers should change role as simply instructors to guides,
and students should become more actively involved in the learning
process," according to the letter.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that teachers should enaged in self-improvement,
and notes that the ministry is currently devising a related
reeducation program.
</P>
<P>
China celebrates Teachers Day on September 10.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Great Opportunities Await Infrastructure Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Enlarged expenditures this
year provides great opportunities for companies dealing with
public utilities, project contracting and real estate development,
according to some of China's stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
Companies in these three sectors can expect steady business
growth during the second half of the year, as the national economy
turns stronger as a result of the government's stimulation
policies, predicted analysts with the Shenyin-Wanguo Securities
Co. Ltd., the largest in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has emphasized on increasing investment
demand this year to offset the impact of waning export trade and
consumer demand, two other major national economic factors, in the
wake of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Economists have projected gross investment in infrastructure at
about one trillion yuan for this year, which are expected to go
mainly into infrastructure, including construction of bridges,
highways, urban utilities, water conservation and environmental
protection projects, industries using new and high technologies,
technical renovations in state enterprises, and real estate
development.
</P>
<P>
"The huge investment demand created by the government is
expected to provide great market potential for companies in
public utilities, project contracting, and real estate sector,"
said a stock analyst with Shenyin-Wanguo Securities.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure sector is already receiving a good share of
the money. To cite an example, the Ministry of Finance issued 100
billion yuan worth of special treasury bonds on September 4 for
infrastructure projects, demanding another 100 billion yuan in
credit support from commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Companies in related industries maintained growth momentum
during the January-June period. Public utility companies, for
example, reported an average growth of 30 percent in business
volume and 50 percent in net profit.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech firms are also expected to register higher growth
during the second half, according to some stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
Economic recovery depends heavily on such companies, and they
have already registered an average net profit growth of more than
20 percent during the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
By the same analysis, companies manufacturing machinery,
household electric appliances, chemicals, and the power industry
are expected to come out of their current predicament as the
national economy starts to recover.
</P>
<P>
Also, importers may enjoy a turn for the better during the
later half of the year as a result of increasing import volume.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Backs Probe of Human Organ Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday hailed proposals to conduct a congressional
probe into the alleged murder of overseas Filipino workers by an
international syndicate and the sale of their vital internal
organs.
</P>
<P>
"The president will support all efforts to unmask the leaders
and members of this syndicate. A congressional inquiry may unearth
vital information that will help the government put a stop to this
despicable racket," Press Undersecretary Lcasiano Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
Quzon City House representative Dante Liban Tuesday filed a
resolution for a joint inquiry by the foreign and labor committees
of the House of Representatives into the alleged report. The
resolution is supported by some congressmen.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez said the president is determined to stop these
"depraved and abominable" crimes and bring to justice their
perpetrators, adding that Estrada wants "the full might of the
government thrown against these criminals."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine government is also mounting a
crackdown on illegal recruiters of overseas Filipino workers, the
alleged partner of the international syndicate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada ordered law enforcement agencies along with
the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration and the Overseas
Workers Welfare Administration to make aggressive efforts to
unmask and bring to justice the illegal recruiters.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also ordered the concerned departments to launch a
massive information campaign in the provinces so that those
planning to seek employment abroad could be forewarned against
dealing with the illegal recruiters.
</P>
<P>
"President Estrada considers illegal recruitment as a crime
more heinous than kidnapping because it victimizes the poor whose
dream to give their children a better life ultimately ends in
tragedy in foreign lands," Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has about 6 million overseas contract workers
in more than 100 countries and regions. It was reported that every
day there is at least one death of overseas Filipino workers for
various reasons.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Over one thousand cataract
patients in the Tibet Autonomous Region are expected to regain
their eyesight within a month, thanks to a state-sponsored medical
team that is providing free surgery in the region.
</P>
<P>
As part of Sight First China Action launched in 1997 by the
Ministry of Health, the Chinese Disabled Persons Federation and
Lions Club International, the team began working in Tibet on
August 25 and has so far performed 340 operations on local
cataract sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Due to high altitudes and excessive exposure to ultraviolet
rays, Tibetans have a cataract incident rate double that of other
parts of the country. Yet most counties and townships in Tibet are
without ophthalmological hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the medical workers are touring four prefectures in
the region though seasonal flood waters have brought many
difficulties and inconveniences to their endeavor.
</P>
<P>
China has some four million cataract patients, and Sight First
China Action has pledged to cure 1.75 million of them by the year
2001.

<HEADLINE> Heilongjiang Grain Reserves Intact from Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Grain reserves in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province, an area known as the nation's major
rice bowl, have remained basically intact in spite the most severe
flooding recorded this century.
</P>
<P>
The province's 700-odd grainaries have a combined storage
capacity of 25.8 million tons. Heavy flood waters which threatened
grain reserves of over 3.55 million tons are slowly receding, and
the security of an additional 3.5 million tons is now guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
"Strong support for the province's flood relief efforts has
contributed greatly to maintaining a stable grain market,"
according to a provincial official in charge of grain reserve.
</P>
<P>
He added that the success can be largely attributed to the
substantial manpower and massive funding devoted to protecting
state grain reserves.
</P>
<P>
The Xindian grain depot was virtually an intact island during
the flooding, with strengthened levees holding back flood waters
rising as much as two meters above ground level.
</P>
<P>
The city of Tongjiang raised 2.29 million yuan, including
provincial government funding, over a 10 day period to extend
levees by some 5,700 meters in order to adequately protect two
threatened grain depots.

<HEADLINE> Reported Jordanian Land Sale to Jews in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Ambassador in Amman
Omar Khatib has denied reports that Jordanians were involved in
selling lands in Jerusalem to Israelis, the Jordan Times daily
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Khatib's denial came as Jordanian media reported that Faisal
Husseini, minister for Jerusalem affairs of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), has presented Jordanian Prime Minister
Fayez Tarawneh a list of names of Jordanians who have allegedly
sold their land in Jerusalem to Jews.
</P>
<P>
"Husseini has met with Tarawneh (earlier) and discussed with
him several issues, including those related to Jerusalem, but no
list was given to Tarawneh," the paper quoted Khatib as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added some Israeli firms attempted to deceive Palestinians
and Jordanians into selling properties in Jerusalem to them, but
the PNA has uncovered such attempts in coordination with the
Jordanian side.
</P>
<P>
"Until this moment, no case was recorded of land sale to
Israelis by Jordanians," he said, adding that attempts have been
headed off.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War,
and declared in 1980 that the whole city is its eternal and
undivided capital. It has been accused of trying to judaize the
holy city ever since.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of their future
independent state.

<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Tourism departments from China
and the United States will join hands to build the world's largest
national park in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The park will cover 66,800 sq.km. in 15 counties in the

region is located south of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
Three major rivers -- Jinsha, Lancang and Nujiang -- will flow
through the park for distances ranging from 70 km to over 3,000
kilometers. The park will offer rare natural scenery and will be
the world's Top Ten regions in terms of biodiversity.

<HEADLINE> Forest Top on China's Resource Shortage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A shortage in forest coverage
is now the number one natural resource problem in China, according
to the State Forestry Administration (SFA).
</P>
<P>
A report released today by the SFA said that green coverage per
capita in China is now only 11.7 percent of the world's average.
</P>
<P>
"With a coverage of 13.92 percent, forest shortage is even more
severe than other resource-related problems, such as water, arable
land and mining resource," the report said, adding that the
shortage of forest has caused a series of economic, social and
environmental problems to the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, soil erosion covers 3.67 million
square kilometers, or 38 percent of China's land area. This figure
continues to grow at a rate of 2,460 square kilometers per year.
</P>
<P>
Six major cities including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are
now listed among the ten most polluted cities in the world, the
report said, adding that this is to some extent related to lack of
greenery in Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the increasing incidence of natural
disasters in China in recent decades is largely caused by the
forest shortage.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, China was hit 70 percent more by natural
disasters than in the 1970s, and 110 percent more than in the
1950s, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Handles Financial Crisis Well: World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has praised the
Philippines for handling well the ongoing Asian financial crisis
and expressed optimism about the country's future economy,
Presidential Spokesman Fernando Barican said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The policy response of the Philippine government to the crisis
situation has, on the whole, been appropriate and the Philippines
is correctly perceived by investors at home and abroad as having
weathered the crisis better than many of its neighbors," World
Bank country director Vinay Bhargava was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting with President Joseph Estrada at the
Presidential Palace, Bhargava also expressed full confidence in
the Philippines' capability to sustain economic growth despite the
fact that the financial crisis is getting worse, Barican said.
</P>
<P>
He said Bhargava informed the president that "the prospects are
good" for the Philippines to achieve 1 percent growth in the gross
domestic product in 1998, and 3.5 percent in 1999 and over 5
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Bhargava said the World Bank would help the country revive its
economy by, among other measures, restructuring the
2.6-billion-U.S.-dollar portfolio of ongoing projects and quickly
approving about 1 billion dollars in new loans to the Philippines.

BELGRADE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic Tuesday condemned the European Union (EU) over
its recent decision to ban the landing of Yugoslav planes in EU
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic made the remarks here while meeting with visiting
Belgian Foreign Minister Eric Derycke, Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision is a new and unacceptable discrimination, which
has crudely violated bilateral agreements and international air
transport accords.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which is illegal and has no appropriate political
reasons, is aimed at harming Yugoslav air companies and citizens,
Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the decision is also "a direct support to the
splittism and terrorism in Kosovo, which runs counter the EU's
announcement to promote cooperation with Yugoslav federation and
strengthen regional stability," he added.
</P>
<P>
It "will have a serious negative impact on the situation in the
region," said Jovanovic.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Silent on Reported Talks with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
refrained from commenting on media reports that its intelligence
chief was in Israel last week for talks on forming a military
alliance with Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We do not usually comment on the movement of our security
officers," said Minister of Information Nasir Judeh, quoted by the
semi-official Jordan Times newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Ma'ariv newspaper had reported that Samih Batikhi,
Jordan's top intelligence officer, held talks on Sunday with
senior Israeli intelligence and military officers on the prospect
of building the three-way alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Judeh reiterated Jordan's position of rejecting "the
concept of alliances and pacts," adding that "our approach to
security in the region is comprehensive, inclusive of all and
exclusive of none."
</P>
<P>
Jordan has bilateral security arrangements with both Turkey
and Israel and plans to beef up military cooperation with Ankara
next year. Tel Aviv and Ankara have signed a couple of defense
pacts and enjoy close military ties.
</P>
<P>
Arab states are concerned about the growing cooperation among
the three parties.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Hails China As Good Investment Example </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 9 (Xinhua) --China is the most successful
example of absorbing direct foreign investment among all
developing countries, said a senior U.N. official here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of the U.N. Conference on
Trade and Development(UNCTD), made the remark at a news
conference, referring to the fact that the flow of direct overseas
funding into China has undergone an unprecedented increase in the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero is here for the Second China Fair for International
Investment and Trade. He said that China acquired total direct
investments of 45 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, about half the sum
for all of Asia.
</P>
<P>
That figure is also twice the total volume of foreign
investment in Africa, and central and east Europe, and accounted
for 11 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero expressed confidence in the prospects for direct
investment in China, citing China's economic conditions, business
convenience and policy framework.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that financial opportunism such as that sweeping
some Latin American countries will never happen in China.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced the belief that the Asian financial crisis will
not have much effect on overall direct investment. According to a
world-wide survey conducted by the UNCTD, most of the world's top
500 companies have no intention of postponing or cancelling direct
investment in southeast Asia, and most of them even plan to
increase such funding. Those which have having reduced investment
account for fewer than ten percent.

<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's railway departments
are going all out to consolidate railroad tracks, bridges,
crossings, signals, and telecommunication facilities in
preparation for higher speeds which will begin on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Fly-overs have been built on rail crossings on lines with
speeds exceeding 140 km per hour, and high-speed lines will be
fenced off in the future, a ministry official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Trains with speeds of 140-to-160 kilometers per hour will run
on three key lines linking Beijing with Guangzhou, Shanghai, and
Harbin. Train speeds will also be raised on railway lines from
Hangzhou to Zhuzhou, Houma to Yueshan, Baoji to Zhongwei, Nanning
to Kunming, and Wuwei to Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
Tests on the Beijing-Kowloon railway show that the journey from
Beijing to Shenzhen will require only 24 hours, 11 hours shorter
than current travel time.
</P>
<P>
A high-speed train also will soon be introduced on the
Guangzhou-Shenzhen line capable of maintaining speeds up to 200
kilometers per hour under existing track conditions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Ministry of Railways will increase the number
of fast trains, overnight trains and daytime trains, and arrange
more special trains for tourists, non-local workers and football
fans.
</P>
<P>
Railway transport has been challenged by express highways and
civil aviation in recent years. Faster trains are just one way
railway departments have adopted to sharpen their
competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Activate Standby Loan Program with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Central Bank Governor Gabriel
Singson said here Wednesday that the Philippines is activating a
standby loan program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
which will enable the country to draw 13.5 billion U.S. dollars
from IMF.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the country can draw the first tranche of 260
million dollars by October 23 if the economic review report made
by an IMF panel is approved by the IMF Executive Board.
</P>
<P>
The panel visited the Philippines from August 20 to September 8
and held a number of discussions with Philippine economic
managers. Both parties agreed on a revised economic program for
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Among the major revisions are the gross national product (GNP),
the gross domestic product (GDP), inflation and balance of
payments projections.
</P>
<P>
Singson repeated that the GNP targets have been cut to 1.5
percent for 1998 and 4.1 percent for 1999 while the GDP targets
have been revised downward to 1 percent and 3.5 percent for the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
Drawing on the IMF facility would allow the Philippines to have
enough foreign exchange reserve to combat speculative attacks on
the local currency of peso and help rebuild the economy battered
by the Asian financial crisis, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and the IMF agreed on the standby loan program
in April this year in case that the country's financial situation
would suddenly get worse.

<HEADLINE> 25 People Die of Cholera in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people died of
cholera in Iran by Tuesday morning, and thousands more are
infected, the Zan (Women) newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reza Qasemi, director general for preventive affairs in the
Health Ministry, told the daily that so far 3,290 people have been
infected with the disease throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that most patients were in the four provinces of
Tehran, Isfahan, Qom, and Sistan and Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
Qasemi believed that main reason behind the widespread of the
disease this year was hot weather and excessive rain in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that hygiene education would be the basic way to
prevent further incidences.
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Health Minister Ali Akbar Sayari, cholera
last hit Iran in 1997, when more than 1,100 people were infected.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Expected to Sell More State-Owned Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley has signaled further sales of state-owned assets and
government spending cuts after the National Party-led minority
government won a confidence vote in Parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Shipley Wednesday told the Evening Post, a Wellington-based
newspaper, that the confidence vote gave the government "some
clear air" to advance its policy program, including privatization.
As well, in response to the country's economic downturn and
forecast budget deficits, the government would also look closely
at its proposed spending.
</P>
<P>
According to a Treasury Forecast, which was submitted to the
Parliament Tuesday, the unemployment rate in New Zealand will rise
to 8.5 percent early next year from the current 7.7 percent, the
economic growth will fall by 0.5 percent in the year ending March
1999, and the government accounts will be plunged into the red in
the years of 1999-2000 and 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said that the only way to turn around looming deficits
is to cut spending or adopt measures to boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We will look at both sides of that ledger," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury forecasts were based on current government policy,
she said, adding that the government now has to look at projected
spending programs and decide which would be continued, which would
be delayed and which would be canceled.
</P>
<P>
Selling assets would also help the government through a
difficult period. Money from sales would add to the operating
balance of the government and allow it to continue repaying debt,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
Shipley said she expects some state-owned assets, which have
been rated as "strategic assets," would be sold.
</P>
<P>
She made it clear that she prefers privatization, saying
private owners are better able to make the capital investment
companies need.

<HEADLINE> Incoming Overseas Investment up in Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
in northwest China now obtains one-fourth of its construction
financing from overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that direct overseas investment in
Ningxia--home of the Chinese Muslims-- has topped 300 million
U.S. dollars, with foreign aids amounting to 170 million
U.S. dollars and foreign loans exceeding 200 million
U.S. dollars. The region has gained investors from 26 countries
and regions around the world.
</P>
<P>
Though the amount of overseas investment is relatively small in
comparison with coastal regions, inland Ningxia has managed to use
its money efficiently, said an official of the foreign trade and
cooperation office.
</P>
<P>
The local government has already made effort to attract
overseas money to the area of infrastructure construction badly in
need of improvement, and to pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
For example, foreign funds have been used for airport
construction, trans-regional natural gas pipelines, agriculture,
water conservancy, and for improving rural telephone facilities.
</P>
<P>
With the help of investment from Singapore, the Yinchuan Rubber
Factory has developed eighteen new products to become the third
largest rubber-tire producer in China.
</P>
<P>
Under preferential policies announced by the government,
overseas investors can invest in shares or participate in
enterprise mergers and acquisition, and enjoy tax breaks in
Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have also been made to improve investment
management. For example, all of the 28 completed projects
involving foreign loans were carried out under a system of strict
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 60 percent of all overseas-funded
projects have been successful.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Sets to Achieve 11 Percent Growth Rate </HEADLINE>

<P>
JINAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Shandong Province, one of the
economic powerhouses in east China, has been striving for an
annual growth of 11 percent to help the country fulfil its target
of 8 percent, which has been threatened by the devastating floods
this summer.
</P>
<P>
Despite the adverse impact of the Asian financial turmoil and
weak domestic market demand, the province realized 324 billion
yuan in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first half of the
year, up 10.3 percent from the same period of 1997, and 3.3
percent more than the national average.
</P>
<P>
"We are ensuring a yearly growth rate of 9 percent, and aiming at 11
percent," said provincial Governor Li Chunting.
</P>
<P>
In the remaining months of the year, the province will inject
221 billion yuan into fixed assets, 23 percent higher than last
year, to stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Much of these funds will go into rural infrastructure to
promote agricultural industrialization and the rapid development of
village and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The province will also pursue healthier and more efficient
industrial growth focused on improving the management of some 130
key enterprises and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Shandong also intends to step up efforts to turn its
non-government businesses and the service sector into new growth
areas.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Maritime Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is
making great efforts to protect its maritime environment, not only
to curb maritime pollution, but also for the strategic development
and utilization of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
The serious pollution in China's Bohai Sea, for example, has
become a major issue brought to the attention of the government
and experts.
</P>
<P>
Ding Dewen, a scholar at the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
warns that pollutants in the Bohai Sea has caused a sharp drop in
marine organisms, and deterioration of the marine environment
could turn the Bohai Sea into a "dead sea."
</P>
<P>
The region around the Bohai Sea is filled with developed
economies, concentrated cities and townships, and flourishing
industries. However, the sea is suffering from pollution
discharges from a large number of sources, including rivers.
</P>
<P>
The Bohai Sea, with a water area of 77,000 square kilometers,
accounts for only 1.6 percent of China's four sea areas, but it is
inflicted with 32 percent of the total waste water, and 47 percent
of all pollutants, discharged into China's seas.
</P>
<P>
Chinese marine experts have suggested that a special committee
be set up to promote protection of the Bohai Sea. They also
suggested that a law on Bohai Sea environmental protection be
adopted, and a Bohai Sea ecological improvement pilot zone be
established.
</P>
<P>
Provinces, cities and enterprises along the Bohai Sea have
already taken a series of measures to reduce pollution of its
waters.
</P>
<P>
The cleaning up of polluting sources on land and centralized
disposal of waste water are the two major steps China has taken to
deal with waste water.
</P>
<P>
The region along the Bohai Sea is not the only
example. Provinces and cities along the country's coastline also
pour huge amount of money into fighting sea pollution.
</P>
<P>
The four cities of Dalian, Qingdao, Yantai and Shanghai have
invested 10 billion yuan into controlling water pollution.
</P>
<P>
Other efforts include closing polluting enterprises and
establishing sewage treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has clearly stipulated that all
enterprises should discharge their pollutants within the standard
set by the state by year 2000 by establishing sewage treatment
facilities.

<P>
The region will lease more uncultivated wet lands to farmers
for fish breeding.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has provided
Sri Lanka with a further 50 million rupees (7.58 million U.S.
dollars) for the second phase of a coast conservation project by
preventing sea erosion, bank sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank made this move after considering Sri Lanka's progress
in the ongoing coast conservation activities, the sources told
Xinhua by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, sea erosion will be prevented by laying
boulders on the coastal belt. At present the first phase of this
project has already been completed during which the bank has
provided 100 million rupees (15.2 million dollars), the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
Sea erosion, particularly along the southern coast, has become
a major problem for Sri Lanka where several miles of coastline
have been eroded in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The erosion has been mainly attributed to illegal coral mining.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan President Rejects Unconditional Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga has declared that she would never have unconditional
talks with the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE), the official Daily News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Kurunegala District Convention in North Central
Province Tuesday evening, Kumaratunga referred to demands by
opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and LTTE representative
Thamil Chelvam that the government negotiate with the LTTE without
conditions.
</P>
<P>
She insinuated that there was a tie-up between the opposition
and the LTTE and stressed that one of the main conditions for
talks is that the country should remain undivided.
</P>
<P>
By calling for unconditional talks the opposition leader was
asking for the division of the country, she said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said there was understanding between the
LTTE and the United National Party to work together with the aim
of toppling the People's Alliance government.
</P>
<P>
She said that if the opposition does not support the
government, she would go direct to the people and get their
support to bring peace to the country.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga won the 1994 elections on a pledge to establish
peace through negotiation and immediately launched unconditional
talks with the LTTE. However the LTTE rebels reneged on the peace
talks and resumed their war against the government.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga has demanded that the LTTE lay down arms for any
negotiations with her government.

<HEADLINE> Italian Senator Clears Misconceptions About Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Many Italians and other
Westerners have profound misconceptions about Tibet, said Italian
Senator Renzo Gubert.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Xinhua after a recent trip to
Tibet, Gubert pointed out that the misconceptions have hindered
these people from understanding correctly the tremendous
development of the Chinese autonomous region over the past decades.
</P>
<P>
A five-member Italian parliamentary delegation including Gubert
visited Tibet from August 21 to 31 at the invitation of the
Chinese Association for International Understanding.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is stable and its people there enjoy broad religious
freedom and a happy life. The exploitation and social unequality
that existed when Tibet was ruled under the serf system have been
eliminated, said Gubert.
</P>
<P>
The allegation that Tibetans do not have religious freedom is
totally untrue, said the senator.
</P>
<P>
Gubert said he was told by the Tibetan locals that the central
government of China or the local government of the autonomous
region never interfere with their religious freedom except during
the chaotic Cultural Revolution era from 1966 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan lamas he met said it is one's own choice to be or
not to be a lama.
</P>
<P>
Gubert said that Tibetan culture is well protected and it is
absolutely untrue that Tibetan culture has suffered irreparable
destruction.
</P>
<P>
China has made great efforts to protect and maintain the
numerous monasteries.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan language is being taught in all schools in the
autonomous region, said the senator.
</P>
<P>
China, which carries out one-child policy to curb the booming
population, allows Tibetans to have two or more children, said
Gubert.
</P>
<P>
The senator said the members of the delegation he led have
decided to hold a press conference in Rome about what they
saw and felt during the Tibet trip in an effort to remove the
misconceptions of some people.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal appeals
court upheld Tuesday the conviction and death sentence of Timothy
McVeigh for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing which killed 168 people.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, rejected all
McVeigh's arguments for a new trial in a 3-0 ruling.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh, 30, was convicted last year of the bombing of the
Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City and was
sentenced to death by the same jury.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh was also convicted of murder in the deaths of eight
federal agents in the bombing. Nineteen children who were in the
building's day care center were also killed.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said McVeigh was angry over the way federal agents
raided the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas in 1993 where
more than 80 people were killed and that he carried out the
bombing to spark a general uprising in the country.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh's co-defendant and former army buddy Terry Nichols,
who was convicted for his role in the bombing earlier this year,
is in the early stages of appealing his conviction.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh's lawyer Robert Nigh said McVeigh's next step will be
to ask all the 12 judges of the appeals court to reconsider the
three-judge panel's decision.

Public Finance Minister Jose Angel Gurria Trevino said here on

According to Gurria, the Mexican authorities will adjust
public financing so that it would not be necessary to contract
further debts to achieve balance between national revenues and
spending.

who are facing liquidity problems by matching them with foreign
partners.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment will serve as an information center and

DHAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The flood situation in
Bangladesh may take an alarming turn in the central districts
including the capital city of Dhaka in the next three to four
days, according to the Flood Forecasting and Warning Center.
</P>
<P>
The center sent a special alert signal Tuesday night to the top
authorities, saying the situation in and around Dhaka city "needs
special attention from all corners" as the flood there might
assume a serious proportion, press reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Narayangaj District, 16 kilometers southeast of here, the
administration Tuesday started looking for ways to evacuate people
in case the 34-kilometer-long Dhaka-Narayangaj-Demra embankment
collapses.
</P>
<P>
Breaches have developed at 36 points of the dam and the water
level is rising further threatening the embankment, the reports
added.
</P>
<P>
In the event of an evacuation, the district administration has
asked the army, police and Red Crescent volunteers to participate
in the effort.
</P>
<P>
All efforts are being made to save the embankment, which
protects some 600,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Roads and Highways Department officials and employees were
working round the clock to save the embankment, which became most
vulnerable at three points, the Press Information Department said
in a press release Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The current devastating flood, which began early July when the
monsoon season started in the country, has affected nearly 30
million people in 47 of the country's 64 districts, with the

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that some progress has been made in talks with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on several issues.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that
issues on which progress were made included the 1994 U.S.-DPRK
agreement, missile proliferation, terrorism and a resumption of
talks aimed at reducing tensions and achieving a lasting peace on
the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said U.S. and DPRK negotiators who met in New York last
week have returned to their capitals for consultations. And
Washington was also consulting with its allies, including South
Korea and Japan, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Pentagon said the United States was continuing
to investigate DPRK's claim that it launched a satellite into
orbit on August 31, but not a ballistic missile alleged by the
United States, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we cannot confirm that they have successfully launched
a satellite," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, Space Command has not observed any object orbiting
the earth that correlates with the orbit announced by the North
Koreans in their public statements," Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said the intelligence analysis could take some time and
"it would be premature to make firm statements about the exact
equipment that was used and the exact purpose of the launch or the
degree of success that they realized in their launch at this
state."

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Auction Huge Assets of Closed Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Financial Sector
Restructuring Authority (FRA) has announced that the largest
auction of core assets of 56 closed finance firms, worth billions
of U.S. dollars, would take place on December 2.
</P>
<P>
The auction of the assets, estimated at 460 billion baht (11.5
billion U.S. dollars), would not only be the largest in Thai
history, but also in the world, FRA chairman Amaret Sila-on was
quoted by Wednesday's Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sale of the core assets would mean that more than 90
percent of the total assets of the closed firms would be sold and
the rest would be gradually sold before the year's end, Amaret
said.
</P>
<P>
The asset sale comprises 2,000 business loans from all 56
closed firms. Lehman Brothers is serving as financial adviser to
FRA for the sale.
</P>
<P>
The auction of business loans follows the successful completion
of sales of hire purchases contracts and residential mortgages by
the FRA.
</P>
<P>
The business loan portfolio alone contains more than 50 percent
of the total assets of the finance companies when they were
suspended last year.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary sales information, including bidding procedures,
will be available on the FRA Web site (www.fra.or.th) or at FRA
office building from next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The FRA has to complete its mission of selling assets of the 56
closed firms this year, as instructed by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government closed the 56 debt-ridden firms late last
year in a major step to streamline the trouble-stricken financial
sector.

<HEADLINE> Mexican President Urges Fiscal Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tight fiscal discipline is
essential in the Mexican banking system if the country is to fend
off international financial turbulence, Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Discipline was needed to consolidate the financial, fiscal and
structural strengths of the economy in the long term, the
president said at a ceremony for certified public accountants.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo also said that it was important for economic sectors
and political forces to act with the highest responsibility and
patriotism in order to promote the necessary unity to enter the
year 2000 with a stronger and better prepared nation.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's participation in international trade had been one of
the pillars with which Mexico had overcome 1995's economic crisis,
Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
Whenever the international financial system became highly
unstable, Mexico's achievements were put to test.
</P>
<P>
"Towards external instability, we'll maintain internal
strength. Thus we will come out well from the current
international situation," the president said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Import 3.42 Million Tons of Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia plans to import 3.42
million tons of rice from the international market in the
1999-2000 fiscal year beginning April, State Logistic Agency
(Bulog) Chairman Rahardi Ramelan said.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to import 3.42 million tons of rice if our domestic
procurement can reach 1 million tons. If domestic procurement is
lower, imports will be raised," Rahardi said at a hearing of the
House of Representative's Commission III for agriculture, forestry
and plantations, transmigration and food affairs.
</P>
<P>
Domestic rice procurement this fiscal year is especially low,
projected at 138,000 tons, because of failed harvests in many
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post Wednesday quoted Rahardi as saying the
government hoped that half of Bulog's rice imports for the next
fiscal year could be financed through a mixture of foreign grants,
soft loans and deferred payments.
</P>
<P>
For this fiscal year, Bulog has planned to import a total 4.1
million tons of rice, of which 2.44 million tons had been imported
by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Rahardi said Bulog would use 3.5 million tons of rice this
fiscal year in market operations to control the soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
Bulog's market operations thus far have failed to arrest the
rising price because of poor distribution networks, hoarding and
smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund, which is currently conducting
a review of its economic program here, has said it will look into
the reasons why rice prices have been rising.

BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved
a proposal by the permanent secretary of the Prime Minister's
Office on limiting the engine capacity of motor vehicles for
high-ranking officials, a government press release available
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The Budget Bureau suggested that the engine capacity of the

</P>
<P>
For cars of the officials of other committees and independent
agencies, their capacity will be decided on the basis of the
officials' salary, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the cabinet has revoked a regulation which allowed
government agencies to buy cars confiscated by the Custom
Department.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flourishing Silk Trade on Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 9 (Xinhua) --Silk trade is still flourishing
on the world-famous ancient Silk Road. However, today this is
different story.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 years ago, camel caravans carried China's silk
and other goods along the Silk Road to central and western Asian
and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Today, trucks transport silkworm cocoons and raw silk produced
in the republics of Uzbekistan and Kyrghyz into China through
Kashi, an ancient Silk Road city in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, and the silkworm cocoons and raw silk are
later sent to the cities of Suzhou and Hangzhou, two major silk
producers in east China.
</P>
<P>
The old road was more than 7,000 kilometers long, began in
Chang'an (now Xi'an, capital city of northwest China's Shaanxi
Province), the ancient capital of the Western Han Dynasty
(B.C. 206-24), passed along the Gansu Corridor, and the Tarim
Basin in Xinjiang, ran through Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Afghanistan,
Iran and Iraq, and ended at the sea ports of the Mediterranean in
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Guli Bahan, a leading official of the Kashi Prefectural Foreign
Trade Bureau, called this modern-day "flow-backwards" on the
ancient Silk Road a new phenomenon resulting from China's
implementation of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The silk trade is assuming a leading position in commerce
between China and central Asian countries. Among Kashi's imports
from Uzbekistan and Kyrghyzstan, some 50 percent are natural silk
which is then transported to Suzhou and Hangzhou for further
processing.
</P>
<P>
Guli Bahan said that many central and western Asian countries
have mastered mulberry planting and silkworm raising, especially
Uzbekistan and Kyrghyz. But these countries are still lacking in
processing techniques.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, with the rapid economic development in the
Suzhou and Hangzhou areas, silk processing and cloth manufacturing
have became major industries, replacing the traditional mulberry
planting and raising of silkworms, so they require more raw
materials, Guli Bahan said.
</P>
<P>
The Turugart Pass on China's western frontier, bounded by the
Republic of Kyrghyz, has become a new and important trading center
along the Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
In the January-July period this year, the pass has handled
2,540 tons of silkworm cocoons and raw silk, valued at 2.03
million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Unveils Overhaul of Tax System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has
introduced a new land tax system in a bid to boost annual revenue
and enhance land efficiency, according to a press release
available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The system, which would provide a legal basis for revamping the
current land tax structure, was sponsored by the Finance Ministry
and approved by the cabinet late Tuesday and would be tabled in
the parliament in its current session.
</P>
<P>
Akapol Sorasuchart, the government spokesman, said the system
provides for progressive tax rates on land left unused and
empowers local administrations to collect land and building tax in
areas under their jurisdiction for their own use.
</P>
<P>
Five tax structures, each with three tax rates, would be
introduced under the bill. Rates vary according to stages of
development of respective areas which are set as mostly,
moderately and least developed.
</P>
<P>
The first structure would be applied in Bangkok. In mostly
developed zones, the rates would be 0.095 percent of estimated
land prices, 0.075 percent in moderately developed zones and 0.055
percent in least developed zones.
</P>
<P>
The second, third, fourth and fifth structures would apply
outside Bangkok. Land in mostly developed zones would be charged
at between 0.045 and 0.08 percent of estimated prices, 0.035 and
0.065 percent in moderately developed zones and 0.025 and 0.05
percent in least developed zones.
</P>
<P>
Local administration bodies could use only one of the four
structures applied to areas outside Bangkok. Representatives of
state agencies concerned in each area would jointly decide which
structure to go for.
</P>
<P>
On enactment, the 1932 Household and Land Taxes Act, the 1965
Land Development Act and the 1986 Land Median Prices Act would be
abolished.
</P>
<P>
Akapol said taxes would be calculated on the estimated prices
of vacant land and the combined value of land and buildings on it
without reductions for depreciation.
</P>
<P>
He said vacant plots which are not exploited would be subject
to progressive tax rates. If the land left unused is for
residential purposes, the rates would double every three years. As
for land considered suitable for agriculture, the rates would
double every year.

<P>
SOFIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The interior ministers of
Bulgaria, Greece and Romania Tuesday signed a protocol on

international crime, according to the Bulgarska Telegrafna
Agentsia.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Increase Budget for Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday urged Congress to spend 5 billion U.S. dollars to support
the nation's public schools that have a record enrollment of 52.7
million children this fall.
</P>
<P>
"Let's get people out of the house trailers and get them out of
the falling-down buildings and give our kids something to be proud
of," Clinton said at Silver Spring, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Because of the impact from the Baby Boom, 500,000 more children
will enter public and private schools in the United States this
year. College enrollment will also jump by 240,000 students, to
nearly 14.6 million.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that all the indications show that the
increase of enrollment will continue for years to come. Because
of the hike, schools are facing serious shortages in teachers and
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
After the peak Baby Boom years of the late 1950s and early
1960s, births fell sharply. As a result, classrooms were
underused and school buildings across the nation closed.
</P>
<P>
The president requested budget from February to provide 5
billion dollars over five years in building and repairing 5,000
schools.
</P>
<P>
He also called for funds to help school districts hire another
100,000 teachers to lower the class size, averaging 18 students in
the early grades. And he proposed to provide scholarships to
35,000 young people who will agree to go out and teach in
educationally underserved areas.
</P>
<P>
"This ought to be an issue where we can all say that it's a
national priority," Clinton said. "There is no more important
long-term objective for America than world-class education for all
our children," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
fanned out to other schools in observation of the administration's
"School Modernization Day."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said about 40 members of Congress and the Cabinet were
out all across the nation on Tuesday to campaign for education.

<HEADLINE> World Internet Server Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide Internet
server market will grow considerably as more users look to
purchase full-featured servers, rather than upgrade their current
systems with Internet software, according to a U.S. market
analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest, an information technology advisory service company
based in California, released a new study Tuesday, predicting that
revenue of the worldwide Internet server market will reach 13.27
billion U.S. dollars in 1998, up 114 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
The market grew 276 percent in 1997, with revenue reaching 6.21
billion dollars, Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the worldwide Internet server market was led by the
Silicon Valley company Sun Microsystems, whose revenue accounted
for 22.3 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
"It's important to remember that the Internet server market is
still in its infancy and has the kind of dynamic qualities that
promise not just change, but very quick change," Dataquest said in
a report. "As a result, significant opportunities exist for
vendors that do not currently in the upper reaches of the revenue
and shipment picture."
</P>
<P>
Although the market was dominated by a relatively small number
of vendors, Dataquest analysts said it is not too late for vendors
to succeed in this thriving market.
</P>
<P>
Midrange servers accounted for more than 63 percent of the
worldwide market in 1997, with revenue reaching 3.97 billion
dollars. Dataquest predicted that midrange Internet servers will
continue to dominate the market through 2002.
</P>
<P>
Midgrange systems are often found in such applications as
Internet database, Internet compute and high-end Internet file
serving.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia
lost his temper and threw his racket in frustration during his
four-set loss to Patrick Rafter of Australia in today's match at
the U.S. Open tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
"It was everything. I was a chance to get me back into the
match. I hit a couple of good returns in the fourth set, and that
was the chance," said the 14th seed. "Then I came up with three
bad returns, and then I got the penalty point."
</P>
<P>
Rafter continually frustrated Ivanisevic in the fourth set,
causing the Coatian to fling his racket, which just missed a
ballboy.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, third seed and defending champion, enter the
quarterfinals but faced tougher fights than last year.
</P>
<P>
"I came into 1997 and I had a tough draw. I'd done really well
the couple of weeks before and I was 14th in the world. Now this
year, I came in with a good attitude again. I've learned to deal
with the pressures. I just came to this tournament and whatever
happens, happens."
</P>
<P>
Rafter will face Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman in the quarterfinals.
"Obviously I'm going to serve and volley. We've played each other
a lot. He knows my game inside out. I know his game pretty well.
It's going to come down to who can exploit weaknesses better that
day," said Rafter.

<HEADLINE> Peru to Extend Trade with Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori said here Tuesday that Peru will extend its trade
with Eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
The South American head of state told a group of Romanian
entrepreneurs that promoting foreign trade was one of the
priorities of Peru's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Though trade exchanges between Peru and Romania amounted to
only 10 million U.S. dollars last year, it allowed for great
potential to further develop bilateral trade relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori met with Romanian President Emil Constantinescue the
same day. The two agreed on strengthening cooperation and
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian leader will also hold talks with the Romanian
premier, chairman of the Senate and chairman of the Chamber of
Deputies. They will sign agreements on tourism, culture,
technology and measures to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori arrived in Bucharest Monday evening. This is the first
time a Peruvian president has visited Romania since the two
countries established diplomatic relations 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori will leave for Hungary Wednesday to continue his
Eastern Europe tour.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Trade Deficit With Mercosur Countries Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's trade deficit
with other Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur) members went
down during the first half of this year, press reports said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's total trade deficit with Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay dropped by 70 percent, from 621.7 million U.S. dollars
between January and July last year to 217.9 million dollars during
the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
During the first seven months of 1998, Brazil's trade deficit
with Argentina went down from 963 million dollars to 608 million
dollars, as a result of the country's 3.63 percent year-on-year
export increase, from last year's 3.56 billion dollars to 4.82
billion dollars, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1998, Brazil had a trade surplus of
500 million dollars with Paraguay, 70 million dollars more than
that of the same period of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Total trade volume between Brazil and its three Mercosur
partners between January and July increased by more than 6
percent, from 10.24 billion dollars of the same period of 1997 to
10.86 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, established in December 1994 to promote free trade in
the region, is the biggest commercial bloc in South America. It
consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Chile and
Bolivia are its associate members.

<HEADLINE> Starr Turns Down Clinton Lawyer's Request for Report Preview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Independent counsel Kenneth
Starr Tuesday told U.S. President Bill Clinton's lawyer he opposed
letting him see the report in advance.
</P>
<P>
"You are mistaken in your views as to ... your right to review
a report before it is transmitted to Congress," Starr wrote
presidential attorney David Kendall.
</P>
<P>
Starr, responding to Kendall's letter Monday asking for access
to the report a week early, wrote, "I suggest you address your
concerns to the House of Representatives" after any report is
delivered under seal there.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's attorneys are concerned that Starr's report will be
one-sided and include extensive conclusions and legal analysis
instead of simply a listing of facts gathered in the seven-month
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Elemental fairness dictates that we be allowed to respond to
any 'report' you send to the House simultaneously with its
transmission," Kendall wrote Starr.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority leader Trent Lott said there might have been
"more sympathy" for Kendall's argument if the White House had not
shown a pattern of belated disclosure on other congressional
investigations.
</P>
<P>
"Why is it fair that no one else in the world can get it, but
they can?" Lott said. "I really don't think presidents should be
entitled to this."
</P>
<P>
Lott made the comment after discussing the matter with House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, who is to go over the logistics of possible
hearings with Democratic leaders on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with other Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle urged Clinton to elaborate on his recent apology, saying,
"I think that it's important that he continue to find appropriate
forums in which to add to the comment that he's already made."
</P>
<P>
Reaching out to lawmakers, Clinton invited House Democratic
leaders to the White House on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lott, in reference to the arrival time of Starr's report, said,
"We don't know for sure."
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders are still discussing procedural
issues, including how much authority, including the right to
subpoena, the House should grant the Judiciary Committee if senior
members decide enough evidence of impeachable offenses exists for
a full-blown inquiry after Starr's report is submitted.
</P>
<P>
In the House of Representatives, tensions are mounting over how
much of the report is to be made public and whether Democrats will
have a saying in the distribution and investigation of the
evidence it contains.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich and Minority Leader Richard Gephardt are scheduled to
talk for the first time Wednesday about the logistics of a
congressional investigation. Joining them will be Majority Leader
Dick Armey, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, who
would head any inquiry into Clinton's conduct and John Conyers of
Michigan, the panel's ranking Democrat.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled state visit by
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to Russia on Sunday will be
postponed, announced the president's office in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The postponement is agreed by both sides and a new date
will be decided soon, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Russia is now experiencing a serious economic and political
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin planned to bring Viktor
Chernomyrdin back to the post of prime minister to save the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia's State Duma, or the lower house of parliament,
overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin as prime minister for the
second time on Monday and is very likely to reject him again in
the third and final round of voting if Yeltsin insists on
nominating Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin invited Scalfaro during his own state visit to Italy in
February.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro's three-day state visit would have been the first to
Russia by a head of state since that of U.S. President Bill
Clinton earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Defense Minister Criticizes Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cyprus Defense
Minister Yiannakis Omirou Tuesday criticized Turkey for its
expansionism, saying that it was a threat not only to Cyprus but
also to Greece.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on recent statements by Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz that Turkey would take all necessary measures if Cyprus
deployed Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Omirou said on
the northwestern Greek island of Corfu that the present time was
critical for Cyprus' national issues, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said that the dangers of a destabilization in the eastern
Mediterranean region were real as long as the present situation of
division and occupation remained in Cyprus,
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Cyprus had the right and duty to defend
itself.
</P>
<P>
As for the violations of the Greek air space by Turkish fighter
jets in the Aegean Sea Tuesday, he said that this was the sort of
activity which indicated that neighboring Turkey did not want to
contribute to defusing the situation but in fact provoked and
attacked.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman emphasized that Greece was against the formation
of alliances and axes in the region and called for multilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Yilmaz's official visit to Israel, he said that
Greece welcomed assurances from Israel and Ankara that their
bilateral cooperation was not directed at any third party, but he
added that Athens retained its reservations until this was proved
in practice.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Son-in-Law Questioned Over May Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former chief of the
Army's Strategic Reserves Command Prabowo Subianto Tuesday was
asked questions about the country's May riots which caused the
death of more than 1,000 people, national newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Fact-Finding Team investigating the May riots met
with Prabowo, son-in-law of former President Soeharto, to find out
what he knew about the country's worst outbreak of violence in
decades, Bambang W. Soeharto, who leads the team's subcommittee on
testimony, said.
</P>
<P>
The questioning took place at Prabowo's residence in Central
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"Prabowo welcomed us and (the questioning) lasted for about one
hour," Bambang said, adding that he was accompanied by team
members Bambang Widjojanto, who is a human rights activist, and
businesswoman Rosita S. Noer.
</P>
<P>
Bambang said Prabowo was questioned because he was chief of the
Army's Strategic Reserves Command when the riots broke out. His
troops were deployed on the streets of a number of Indonesian
cities.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo has denied allegations that he was behind the riots in
which thousands of shops and buildings were looted, damaged and
burned, Bambang said.
</P>
<P>
"There are rumors that I was behind the riots... that's not
true," Prabowo was quoted by Bambang as saying.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Defense and Security and Armed Forces Chief General
Wiranto has previously admitted that members of the military were
involved in the looting and burning. Many pundits suspected
Prabowo was behind the riots.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto discharged Prabowo from the military last month for his
involvement in the abduction and torture of political activists.
</P>
<P>
The government established in July the Joint Fact-Finding Team
which includes representatives of the Armed Forces, government
agencies, the National Commission on Human Rights and
non-governmental organizations to investigate reports that the
riots were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Prabowo is the fifth prominent government official questioned
by the team, following former Jakarta Regional Military Commander
Major General Sjafrie, Jakarta's Governor Sutiyoso, former Jakarta
Police Chief Major General Hamami Nata and Chief of the Armed
Forces' intelligence unit Major General Zacky Anwar Makarim.
</P>
<P>
The team's chairman, Marzuki Darusman, said the team would soon
question Marines Corps chief Major General Soeharto to collect
more information about the riots, during which security was
allegedly non-existent.

NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Ninth seed Karol Kucera of
Slovakia spoiled Andre Agassi's chances of a quarterfinal
showdown with top seed Pete Sampras of the United States as he
held off the eighth seed American in five sets today at the U.S.
Open tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
In a match that started Monday night and featured gamesmanship
by both players, Kucera completed a 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 1-6, 6-3
victory to earn a berth in the next round with Sampras, whom he
defeated in the quarterfinals at the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
Kucera came out strong today, holding at love in the fourth
game. After Agassi saved two break points in the next game to
hold serve, he broke Kucera to take a 5-1 lead, and held to force
the deciding set.
</P>
<P>
Agassi went up a break in the first game of the fifth set
after Kucera double-faulted on break point. But after Agassi held
serve,Kucera utilized brilliant shot-making to win the next five
games. Agassi held in the eighth game and missed a break point
opportunity in the next game.
</P>
<P>
Kucera forced match point in that ninth game on a running
forehand winner and prevailed when Agassi hit a backhand return
long.
</P>
<P>
Kucera seemed ready to close out Agassi on Monday night after
going up a break in the second game of the third set, but Agassi
fought back in the seventh game on a crosscourt backhand winner.
</P>
<P>
After some spirited gamesmanship between the two and a bizarre
lobbing strategy employed by Agassi in the ninth game, both
players held serve to force the tiebreaker. Agassi won the first
four points, lost the next five, then won the final three.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Kucera fired 18 aces and broke Agassi seven times to
overcome 65 unforceed errors. Agassi committed 81 unforced errors
as he lost in the fourth round for the second straight year at

groundstrokes into the net or spraying them around the court.

<P>
Kafelnikov appeared to get back in the match in the fourth set
when he took a 4-1 lead. But, beginning with the third point of
the sixth game, the Swede ran off 11 straight points to knot the
set at 4-all.

<P>
Sky Television News and The Times newspaper, both controlled
by the media magnate said the board of Britain's leading soccer
club accepted an offer of 240 pence a share, a total of 50
million pounds more than the satellite broadcaster's original bid.
</P>
<P>
The club is the largest in the United Kingdom in terms of
support and wealth. Its popularity has meant that it earns as
much from merchandise sales and advertising as from gate receipts.
</P>
<P>
The board stayed late on Monday night locked away in a London
business suite holding talks on Rupert Murdoch's bid, amid
opposition from fans and the likelihood of an Office of Fair
Trading investigation.
</P>
<P>
The club's share price soared on the UK stock market after
satellite television company BSkyB confirmed its interest on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders added more than 100m to the club's value, apparently
believing Murdoch would invest his millions in new talent for the
side.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Postpone Activities of Some Embassies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
considering postponing the activities of its embassies in some
countries for the sake of efficiency due to the uninterrupted
economic crisis, The Indonesian Observer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The plan to postpone the activities of some embassies has been
suggested to the president, but there is no agreement yet,"
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told a working meeting with the House
of Representatives here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alatas explained that the government will declare "temporary
closure" for some embassies and will reopen those embassies when
the economic condition improves.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will neither reduce the number of existing
embassies nor permanently close them, because it will take more
money to reopen them.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from that matter, the existence of our embassies is
needed to maintain and improve relations with other countries and
international organizations," Alatas said.
</P>
<P>
For the sake of efficiency, he said, his ministry will also cut
the spending of Indonesian envoys in foreign countries. "And we
will keep our work running optimally," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized that his office will continue reducing
the number of staff. "Reduction of the number of home staff and
local staff at our embassies will be continued in accordance with
the effort to improve human resources," he said.

<HEADLINE> New Finding: Ancient Village Arranged in Celestial Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The people of Yuyuan Village,
in east China's Zhejiang Province, have been told that the
buildings left by their ancestors were designed in accordance with
the positions of stars in the sky.
</P>
<P>
The small village in Wuyi County is surrounded by mountains,
and there is an S-shaped stream flowing through. Researchers
recently found that the stream was a man-made one, making the area
look like a Daoist talisman.
</P>
<P>
In the village there are 395 old buildings, which were placed
in positions corresponding to the 28 heavenly constellations.
</P>
<P>
There are seven ponds which were dug up for fire control and
drought relief. They are arranged in the shape of the Dipper, and
inside is located the village's ancestral hall.
</P>
<P>
Researchers discovered in the local archives that the village
was designed by Liu Bowen, a Daoist who was good at fortune
telling and helped Zhu Yuanzhang found the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
"Such a design is aimed at praying to the gods to ward off
calamities and send blessings," the researchers explained.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Beats Ivanisevic at U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion and third
seed Patrick Rafter of Australia continued to look strong as he
completed a 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1 triumph over 14th seed Goran
Ivanisevic of Croatia here today at the U.S. Open tennis champions
hips.
</P>
<P>
Nine men's seeds and four women's seeds were scheduled as the
day's schedule was crowded by Monday's postponements. Rafter
broke at love to take a commanding two-set lead, Ivanisevic went
up a break in the ninth game of the third set and served it out.
</P>
<P>
But Rafter continually frustrated Ivanisevic in the fourth
set,causing the Croatian to fling his racket, which just missed a
ballboy. Rafter broke Ivanisevic in the second game and again in
the sixth before grabbing the match.
</P>
<P>
Rafter was successful on 75 percent of his first serves, broke
Ivanisevic five times and won 110 points to Ivanisevic's
87.Meanwhile Ivanisevic landed only 40 percent of his first
serves and committed 26 unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
"He wasn't making mistakes at all and I just had to win a
couple of points to get my confidence back," said Kucera, who
capitalized on the fifth break point.
</P>
<P>
Rafter will face number 12 Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden in the
quarterfinals. Bjorkman, a semifinalist last year, closed out a
6-4, 2-6, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Dutchman Jan Siemerink.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, 33rd-ranked Thomas Johansson of Sweden
advanced to his first Grand Slam quarterfinals when he beat 11th
seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia 3-6, 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (8-6).
</P>
<P>
There are just two women's matches today, but all four players
are seeded. Third seed Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic beat
No.11 Patty Schnyder 6-2, 6-3. Schnyder knocked off five-time
U.S. Open champion Steffi Graf of Germany on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis of Switzerland has to be on top of her game
when she faces two-time champion Monica Seles of the United
States in the quarterfinal tonight. Hingis won all five meetings
with Seles last year, but has dropped both matches this year.In
their most recent meeting, Seles rallied for a three-set win in
the semifinals of an international tournament three weeks ago.

<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- An overwhelming victory over
Southampton propelled Leeds United to the top of the English
Premier League on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its fourth match of the season, Leeds blanked Southampton
3-0 at Elland Road.

The victory sees Leeds go top -- a point above Liverpool who
entertain Coventry on Wednesday -- while Southampton stay rooted
at the bottom of the table, still without a point.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's other match, Everton scored their first goals of
the season as they beat Nottingham Forest 2-0 away.
</P>
<P>
Two goals from Scottish center forward Duncan Ferguson
finished off Forest who, had they won, would have gone top of the
league.
</P>
<P>
Ferguson broke the stalemate with a trademark header in the
72nd minute and finished matters six minutes from time with a
left foot shot from the edge of the area.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Falls on Possible Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell Tuesday
against most major currencies on the pessimism about the
possibility that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The dollar slipped to a four-month low against the Japanese yen
and a nearly 10-month low against the German mark. The Mexican
peso fell to another historic low against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar dropped to 132.10 yen,
down from 133.57 yen late Friday. During trading, the dollar fell
as low as 131.20 yen, a level not seen since late April.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency also declined to 1.7285 marks, down from
1.7304. During the trading day, the dollar fell to 1.7230 marks, a
level last seen in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico City, the dollar rose to a record 10.2700 pesos, up
from 10.2600 pesos Monday. In late trading in New York, the dollar
rose to 10.2400 pesos, up from 10.2100 pesos Friday.
</P>
<P>
Global stock markets rebounded after Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan Friday night hinted that the Fed is considering
lowering rates to fight the international economic illness.
</P>
<P>
While the Dow Jones industrial average soared 380 points
Tuesday following the three-day holiday weekend, U.S. Treasury
bonds and dollars fell. Traders believed that lower rates would
make bonds and dollars less attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Traders also were worried that the economic problems of Asia
and Russia would hit Latin America, causing the United States to
bail out its trading partners as it did with Mexico in 1994-95.
The peso fell to another low while Mexican equities rallied behind
the Dow Jones industrials.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
1.4142 Swiss francs, down from 1.4237; 5.7950 French francs, down
from 5.8029; 1,706.35 Italian lire, down from 1,708.00; and 1.5218
Canadian dollars, up from 1.5215.
</P>
<P>
The British pound was quoted at 1.6548 U.S. dollars, down from
1.6722 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Merson Completes Transfer to Aston Villa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Paul Merson completed his 6.75
million pounds (11.28 million U.S. dollars) transfer to Aston
Villa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said after the transfer that his decision to leave
Middlesbrough had nothing to do with Paul Gascoigne.
</P>
<P>
"Gazza is one of my closest friends," said the 30 year-old
England international after agreeing a deal that will keep him at
Villa Park for the rest of this season and the following three
years.
</P>
<P>
But Merson admitted: "There were problems behind the scenes at
Middlesbrough that I am not prepared to talk about.
</P>
<P>
"Things have got a bit out of hand over the last week because
I was stitched up by someone I thought was a friend who has made
money out of all this.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise I would have sorted everything out amicably with
Bryan Robson. He understands my problem, and would have let me
go. I can't speak highly enough of him."
</P>
<P>
But Merson acknowledged his concerns went "much deeper" than
the fear of being lured back into "booze and betting" which
almost destroyed his career at Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"The last year or so has been a roller coaster time for me and
I basically needed some stability, which I believe I will get at
Villa," he added.
</P>
<P>
But his signing was not completed in time to make his debut in
Wednesday night's premier league game with Newcastle at Villa
Park.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the league's registration's department said:
"The transfer missed the noon deadline by about three hours."
</P>
<P>
Villa manager John Gregory believes Merson's arrival will have
the same affect on Villa as Eric Cantona's did on Manchester
United.
</P>
<P>
"He is that important a signing to me," said Gregory. "I know
for certain that everyone in our dressing room will look up to
Paul Merson.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wrote him off when he left Arsenal for
Middlesbrough. But he has overcome all his problems and is now
playing as well as ever again, as his selection for the England
team in Sweden proves.
</P>
<P>
"I admire him for the way he has put his life and career back
together. It takes a strong man to do that the way he has.
</P>
<P>
"He was Boro's outstanding player last season and I have no
doubts he is going to be a major asset for us."
</P>
<P>
Merson revealed Boro had tried to persuade him to return to
London to join Tottenham instead of moving to the Midlands.
</P>
<P>
"They might have had it mind to swap me for one of Spurs'
players," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But I played for Arsenal for 13 years which is a good enough
reason for not joining Tottenham.
</P>
<P>
"Villa are a massive club who are going places, with a great
manager who has done unbelievable. So everything about the move
is right for me."

<HEADLINE> Arsene Wenger Denies to Take Over England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
confirmed on Tuesday that he would not take the post of England
team manager at any price.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman's clear message for the English Football
Association was that it would be a waste of their time coming for
him even if Glenn Hoddle walked out -- or was pushed out.
</P>
<P>
Wenger has still not signed the new four-year Arsenal deal
which has been on the table for him for two months, but insists
it is a formality.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not interested in any national team job -- especially the
England one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any benefits in it. The job is so sensitive and
it is not coherent. How can you enjoy it? I have never been very
keen on international football in any case.
</P>
<P>
"You get no time to build up any consistency and only a short
time to change things because after practically every tournament
like a World Cup it is nearly impossible to survive in the job.
</P>
<P>
"Look what happened this time. Half the national coaches have
now gone and those who survived are all under pressure. Two bad
games and you could be out -- like Berti Vogts with Germany."
</P>
<P>
Wenger, who convinced Hoddle to take up management when he had
the former Tottenham star as a player at AS Monaco in France, has
seen his protege bombarded by flak since England's exit from
France 98 -and the publication of Hoddle's controversial "World
Cup Diary".
</P>
<P>
Wenger said: "I'm sorry, of course, for what is happening to
Glenn. I have respect for him as a player and a person but he has
built his team of people around him with England and doesn't take
advice from outside.
</P>
<P>
"I am like that at Arsenal. If I want advice I turn to people
around me who know about the club."
</P>
<P>
And Wenger insists that Hoddle, on whom pressure has become
even more fierce since England's defeat in Sweden on Saturday,
was guilty only of naivety when he published his World Cup book
while still England boss.
</P>
<P>
Wenger admitted he would personally only ever consider writing
a similar type of book after retiring from the game, but he
insisted: "Knowing Glenn I don't think he could have imagined
this book would have brought him so many controversial situations.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure he just wanted to make an honest report in the book
and, after all, it has been done before by an England manager,
Bobby Robson without creating any trouble.
</P>
<P>
"I still think you have to be judged as a manager on how your
team plays and nothing more. If he had won the World Cup and
still written the book who would have noticed? Nobody."
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal boss is adamant he will eventually sign the new
deal-- thought to be worth one million pounds a year -- which is
on offer for him at Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
"It will keep me here until the year 2002 and everything is
agreed," he said, adding: "Since I have been at Arsenal there
have been many possibilities to go to other clubs in Europe but I
was never tempted. I have freedom to do the job I want to do here
and I have been assured there is the opportunity to build
something more over a length of time.
</P>
<P>
"I know for instance that I will have to replace my older
players in defense some time over those four years but that is
part of the challenge. There is a strong youth policy in place
which will continue.
</P>
<P>
"You can never say never. In this game we are finding that
managers are being sacked after just two or three games now.
</P>
<P>
"But right now I want very much to stay at Arsenal for a long
time and the only reason I have not yet signed the new contract
is simply that I am so busy that there has been little time to
actually go to Highbury, apart from match-days, to do it, " he
said.

<HEADLINE> Rolls-Royce's Orders Show UK Aerospace's Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Rolls-Royce plc, a
global aerospace company, announced a total of 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars worth of orders at the on-going Farnborough Air Show
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The orders were for Trent 500 and the AE3007 engines, according
to a news release made available to the press at Farnborough,
southwest of London. The Trent 500 is the only engine available
for the Airbus Industrie A340-500/600.
</P>
<P>
Also, orders and options for up to 26 aircraft were announced
Tuesday from the Emirates, the Dubai-based airline, and
International Lease Finance Corporation.
</P>
<P>
That brings the total order book for Trent 500 to nearly 5
billion U.S. dollars. In addition, six aerospace companies from
the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain and Japan
Tuesday took a 24 percent state in the program.
</P>
<P>
John Rose, Rolls-Royce chief executive and president of the
Society of British Aerospace Companies, said at Farnborough,
"Today's orders reflect the strength of the breadth of our product
range and the advantage we have in being the sole engine supplier
for 17 of our 32 civil aircraft applications. It also demonstrates
the strength of the UK aerospace industry."

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Pleads for Admission to TRACECA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu Tuesday evening returned from Baku, capital of
Azerbaijan, where he attended the international conference on the
"Rebirth of the Historic Silk Road" alongside with representatives
from 31 countries and 13 international organizations.
</P>
<P>
President Constantinescu had pleaded for Romania at the Baku
conference, saying that his country wants to and can become a
turntable through the TRACECA (Transport Corridor
Europe-Caucasus-Asia) project due to its important crossing
position.
</P>
<P>
The president reminded among other advantages offered by
Romania its adequate infrastructure that is already available.
Thus, the Constanta harbor is the largest of the Black Sea's ones,
with a capacity of about 120 million tons freight a year, and
hosting oil ships of over 180,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"Romania also availed of a refining capacity of over 30 million
tons, with all its refineries being linked through conducts to the
Constanta port," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the national Rompres news agency, the two-day
International Conference on "Rebirth of the Historical Silk Road"
Tuesday ended in Baku after the signing of the Baku Statement and
the basic Multilateral Agreement on Europe-Caucasus-Asia
Transport.
</P>
<P>
The conference initiated by the presidents of Azerbaijan and
Georgia is trying to prove that the reconstruction of the old silk
way is the most direct and advantageous way for the circulation of
goods from Asia to Europe, as well as for the oil from the
Caucasus to Western Europe.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate to Fight over Campaign Finance Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- With campaign finance
overhaul legislation being resurrected in the U.S. Senate this
week, Republican leaders say they have the votes to kill it for
good but supporters pledge a strenuous fight.
</P>
<P>
Senators John McCain, a Republican, and Russell Feingold, a
Democrat, will offer their bipartisan bill as an amendment to a
fiscal 1999 Interior Department spending bill, McCain's office
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A vote on whether to allow such an amendment to proceed to a
final vote, which requires the support of 60 senators, is expected
to occur Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In February, supporters of the bill failed to get 60 votes
needed to cut off debate. But it was given new life a month ago
when a companion bill in the House of Representatives, sponsored
by Representatives Christopher Shays, a Republican, and Marty
Meehan, a Democrat, overcame considerable odds and passed.
</P>
<P>
Both bills ban "soft money" -- unlimited and unregulated
donations to political parties -- regulate issue ads that purport
to educate voters but are actually often used to influence
elections, and expand disclosure requirements. Opponents consider
the legislation an assault on free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said Sunday that McCain
promised in February that he wouldn't try to revive the issue this
year, but now claims that the House vote changed the situation and
another vote was warranted. "I think that under the circumstances,
we should do that," Lott said.
</P>
<P>
But Lott, who opposes the legislation, said he didn't think
McCain had the votes to move the bill to passage.
</P>
<P>
Senator Mitch McConnell, who chairs the Senate Republicans'
money-raising effort and leads the opposition to McCain-Feingold
bill, said that with this week's vote, "we are hoping to
demonstrate that there has been no movement since February."
</P>
<P>
In February, all 45 Democrats and seven Republicans voted to
end the filibuster and move to a final vote. While well short of
the 60 needed to do that, supporters said that showed they have a
majority for passage.
</P>
<P>
Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat and a leading McCain-Feingold
advocate, said he is pushing for a more hard-line strategy in
which supporters refuse to give in even if they fail to get 60
votes.
</P>
<P>
Levin said that as long as they have 50 votes to keep an
amendment on the floor, floor managers must either continue debate
or pull the bill, something that's not feasible on a spending bill
that must be passed before the fiscal year begins October 1.

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
Tuesday called Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to discuss a
wide range of issues, White House officials said.
</P>
<P>
They would not describe what issues they discussed in their

Clinton's possible visit to South Asia, Asian economic problems,
India-Pakistan tension over the disputed Kashmir, and the
importance of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton originally planned to visit India and Pakistan in
November, but the plan was put on hold after the two countries
conducted nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that a
possible Clinton visit to the two countries was "still under

<HEADLINE> Chinese Lawmaker Tables Out Task </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Chinese legislator
Tuesday urged the world community to rectify erroneous tendencies
in the international human rights field and chart a clear course
for future efforts.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Jianhui, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Chinese National People's Congress, told the on-going 100th
Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in the Kremlin
that efforts should be made to earnestly review the experience and
lessons of the past 50 years since the birth of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"Review the past and you will know better the present," Zeng
said by quoting an old Chinese saying.
</P>
<P>
He urged the North and the South to end confrontation and
strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zeng also called for rectification of the tendency of placing
civil and political rights ahead of economic, social and cultural
rights and the right to development.
</P>
<P>
"Equal importance shall be attached to all these rights, paying
earnest attention to the needs of the people of developing
countries and taking concrete measures to help these countries out
of poverty and attain development so as to create conditions for
them to fully enjoy all human rights," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
When handling human rights issues, Zeng said, the international
community should, first and foremost, address the cases involving
massive and gross violations of human rights triggered by all
forms of racism, colonialism and hegemonism and remove the
impediments to the materialization of economic, social and
cultural rights in developing countries caused by the inequitable
international economic order.
</P>
<P>
In his opinion, another major task facing the international
community in the field of human rights is to rectify the tendency
of politicizing and ideologizing human rights and obtain a correct
understanding of the relationship between the universality and
particularity of human rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is the common ideal and objective of mankind to achieve
universal human rights, and human rights should be practiced and
realized in light of the actual conditions of each country," Zeng
said at the meeting, held on the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"Given their differences in historical, cultural, economic and
political development, countries are bound to achieve human rights
in different ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the world community to "recognize the disparity and
particularity of the conditions of various countries, respect the
choice of their people regarding the roads to development and be
fully affirmative and supportive of the efforts by all countries,
the vast number of developing countries in particular, in the
promotion and protection of human rights."
</P>
<P>
"It will only give rise to confrontations to regard the human
rights model and policy of one's own country as universal and
impose them on others, to interfere in the internal affairs of
other countries under the pretext of the universality principle of
human rights and even to resort to sanctions or threat of
sanctions against other countries," Zeng warned.
</P>
<P>
He called on the world community to redouble its efforts at the
international and national levels, in the spirit of mutual respect
and unity, to build a world in which people all over the world
will be able to fully enjoy human rights and democracy and achieve
development and common prosperity.

LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Defense
Headquarters has warned of a possible military confrontation at
the oil-rich Bakassi Peninsula, which was both claimed by Nigeria
and Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters said in a statement Tuesday in Lagos
that authorities in Yaounde last week deployed more troops to the
disputed areas along its border with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
It noted, however, it was not clear if the Cameroonians had
deployed heavy weapons to back the deployed troops.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Nigeria believes that there should be no
confrontation to escalate the tension there and that it will
stick to the judgement of the International Court of Justice
(ICJ).
</P>
<P>
It said that Nigeria plans "to maintain a peaceful stance in
conformity with the ICJ, and we do hope that Cameroon would
follow suit, but we are there watching their action."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroon have clashed for several times in the
last few years at Bakassi, a peninsula in the Guinea Gulf in West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The dispute have been filed to the ICJ but the judgement is
being expected.

UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) has created a new trust fund in
Indonesia to collect and target donor contributions for the
country's Community Recovery Program, a release from UNDP said

As a result of Indonesia's severe economic crisis, there is a
strong need for funding and community development projects for
poor communities, with special emphasis on women and children.

<P>
The aid provided through the fund is being channeled to
community organizations and to local projects that support
income-generating activities, small enterprises and education and
health services for rural children and women.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
mixed on Tuesday, with London remaining basically unchanged while
Frankfurt and Paris soaring ahead inspired by Wall Street's strong
opening.
</P>
<P>
Shares on the London stock market had a subdued day despite the
surge which swept through Wall Street this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Despite a flood of good results from several FTSE 100
companies, the index wobbled throughout the day. At one stage, it
peaked up 52.8 at 5,399.8.
</P>
<P>
Even a dramatic rise on Wall Street during the afternoon failed
to stir the FTSE 100 Index which ended the day down 2.8 points at
5,344.2.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices on the Frankfurt stock exchange
rocketed ahead, hyped up by Wall Street's strength in the first
part of the New York session.
</P>
<P>
The Dax index gained a hefty 3.67 percent on the day to finish
at 5,103.84 points, against 4,923.37 at the end of trading on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Traders noted that Wall Street was up almost 4 percent in the
first half-hour. But Frankfurt operators remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
One trader said: "In the short term, we are going to continue
to see high volatility, as long as things in Russia are up in the
air."
</P>
<P>
In Paris, share prices closed sharply higher in heavy trade as
Wall Street's strong opening and merger speculation in the banking
sector sparked a wave of buying.
</P>
<P>
The Cac 40 index finished 108.39 points, or 2.9 percent, higher
at 3,803.74. After a relatively flat morning, the index shot
higher in the afternoon, spurred by Wall Street's initial rally.
</P>
<P>
"Basically we were in line with the rest of Europe, and people
had been expecting Wall Street to open higher all day," said one
dealer.
</P>
<P>
Worries about the international picture were temporarily eased
by gains made in Asian markets overnight.
</P>
<P>
"The markets have been oversold, it's been good overnight in
Asia and there's still money to be invested," the dealer added.

<HEADLINE> Dow Roars Back on Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dow industrials soared
380 points Tuesday, setting its biggest point gain ever after the
Federal Reserve signaled it might lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 380.53 points at
8,020.78 -- the market's first returning above 8,000 points since
its 512-point drop on August 31. The blue-chip barometer gained 5
percent for the day.
</P>
<P>
However, the Dow is still sharply below its mid-summer peak.
The market is 1,300 points, or 14 percent, below its July 17
record of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
The buying frenzy followed comments Friday evening by Federal
Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan indicating that the financial
turmoil in Asia and Russia may pose more of a threat than
inflation.
</P>
<P>
With the fiscal trouble abroad now threatening Latin America
and Canada, Greenspan said the Fed is becoming more concerned
about the world crises' drag on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was up 42.85 at 1,016.74, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite jumped 81.63 points at 1,648.15.
</P>
<P>
Advancers beat decliners by more than a 4-to-1 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 810.57 million
shares, compared with 777.65 million shares Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index was up 22.28 at 508.59, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 22.02 at 624.73.
