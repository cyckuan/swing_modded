<HEADLINE> India, Germany Adopts Agenda for Partnership  in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh and visiting
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer formally exchanged the
document at a joint press conference here on Thursday evening
following nearly one hour of talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda, steps to be taken to improve the
relations between India and Germany include enhanced political
exchanges, including increased exchange of high-level visits, a
security dialogue, increased bilateral trade and more German
investments in India, enhanced cultural exchanges, and bilateral
cooperation to combat international terrorism, drug trafficking
and illicit trade in arms.
</P>
<P>
Singh described his talks with Fischer as "very fruitful,
constructive and wide-ranging."
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who is paying his first visit to Asia since taking
office, said that Germany regarded India as "a regional power of
stability," which will become one of the major players in
international politics in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"We will improve our relations and we have good reasons for
that," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' questions, Fischer said both Germany
and India agreed there is a need for the United Nations Security
Council reform, but conceded this is a "very complicated" issue
and refused to directly comment on whether Germany supports India'
s claim for a permanent membership in the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of nuclear disarmament, Fischer said Germany would
be "very happy" if India could "find a way to support" the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived in India on Wednesday, first visited
Bangalore, a south Indian city renowned for its booming high-tech
sector, where he had discussions with the local business community
and young information technology (IT) professionals.
</P>
<P>
A major mission of Fischer's India visit is to promote the
newly-adopted German green card system, through which the German
government hoped to lure some 20,000 IT specialists from eastern
Europe and India to work in Germany. The issue of the green cards
is expected to start on August 1.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival here on Thursday morning, Fischer had a very
tight schedule with a series of short meetings with Indian
President K.R. Narayanan Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and
Opposition leader Sonia Gandhi. He is expected to leave for
Germany at around midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The originally scheduled length of Fischer's visit to India was
5 days, but was cut short to 2 days for some unannounced reasons,
a source within the German foreign minister's entourage revealed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Govt Rushes New Weapons to Jaffna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has sent
some of the newly acquired weapon systems to the northern Jaffna
peninsula where government troops have been locked in intense
conflicts with Tamil Tiger rebels for several weeks, a government
statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The weapon systems "will become operational very shortly," said
the statement issued by the government's Special Media Information
Center Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
However, it did not reveal the details of the weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels, fighting
for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north
and east since 1983, are engaged in a ferocious offensive in a bid
to retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar said Tuesday
that the government had held talks on arms purchases with seven
countries earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's defense spending this year would expand
by about one fourth to 880 million U.S. dollars due to emergency
shopping of arms to fight LTTE rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government statement said sporadic fighting continued
Thursday in Ariyalai, Tanankilappu and Navatkuli sectors as a
small group of LTTE rebels infiltrated into the populated areas of
Valikamam East.
</P>
<P>
It said four soldiers were killed in action while 21 were
wounded due to confrontations on Thursday. The wounded were
evacuated by air to Colombo National Hospital and the Military
Hospital for treatment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Behind Pan Am Flight Bombing: Arafat's Adviser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- An Intelligence agent of Iran's
Revolutionary Guard Corps was behind the Lockerbie bombing in 1988,
said Abu Sherif, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's political
adviser.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sherif was quoted by Israel Radio Thursday evening as saying
that the Iranian regime had links with a Lebanese Shiite faction,
which carried out the attack in retaliation for the downing of an
Iranian passenger plane over the Persian Gulf by the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
Neither Libyan nor Palestinian official agencies had any link
with the bombing of the Pan American Flight 103, Abu Sherif
stressed. But he did not give details.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyan intelligence officials were accused by the U.S. and
Britain of planting bombs on the New York-bound Boeing 747, which
exploded in mid-air, killing 270 people both on board and on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi, 48, and Al-Amin Khalifa Fhimah, 44,
have been tried by a Scottish court at Camp Zeist, a former U.S.
air base the Netherlands since May 3.
</P>
<P>
Their defense lawyers said from the beginning of the trial that
they could provide evidence about the involvement of a Palestinian
group opposed to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
However, the leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC), Abu Nidal, rejected the claim
and instead held the head of the Libyan secret service, Abdullah al
Sanussi, responsible for the attack.

<HEADLINE> SADC Meeting to Prepare for U.N. Special Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) met here on Thursday to
prepare for the special session of the United Nations that will
take place in Geneva in June.
</P>
<P>
The two-day Maputo meeting is to assess the level of
implementation, among the member countries, of the guidelines for
the eradication of absolute poverty defined by the last U.N.
meeting in Copenhagen five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva meeting is to take place at a time when most
developing countries still have high poverty rates, and where the
Copenhagen commitments are far from being met.
</P>
<P>
According to a document presented to the Maputo meeting, the
developed countries had committed themselves in Copenhagen to
meeting the U.N. suggested target of 0.7 percent of their
individual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for assistance to
development programs, and an allocation of 20 percent of this aid
to social programs. But this target has never been met.
</P>
<P>
Another commitment undertaken by the developing countries in
Copenhagen, was that they were to allocate 20 per cent of their
national budget to basic social services, and give priority to the
eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Available data shows that social expenditure has been growing
during the last four years, and that foreign investments have also
been growing with the undertaking of mega-projects that are
expected to generate thousands of new jobs, thus contributing to
the reduction of poverty.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Joint Combating Terrorism in Central Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Friday in Uzbek capital of Tashkent urged former soviet republics
in central Asia to make joint efforts to fight against religious
extremism and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"It is common knowledge that attempts are underway to carve up
the post-Soviet lands along criminal lines with the aid of
religious extremism and international terrorism," Putin told
reporters at the end of his one-day visit in Tashkent, where he
met with his Uzbekistan counterpart Islam Karimov on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"An arc of instability has emerged in the republics on Russia's
doorstep," Putin said, and Russia supports Uzbekistan's effort to
promote security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Combating international terrorism was high on the agenda of his
talks in Uzbekistan, the president continued. Cooperation in this
field will be expanded and may go as far as taking preventive
steps,he said, mentioning two recently conducted joint Russian-
Uzbek military exercises.
</P>
<P>
"Large centers of international terrorism are at work against
us.We seek and find help in Russia, especially with the advent of
Putin,who can formulate goals and find ways to achieve them, and
whom I trust completely," Karimov said in his turn.
</P>
<P>
Putin arrived in Tashkent on Thursday for a working visit.
</P>
<P>
At the over-three-hour meeting Thursday evening, Putin and
Karimov discussed the prospects of their countries' relations, the
situation in the Central Asia and efforts to combat religious
extremism and international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Both presidents expressed confidence that Russia and Uzbekistan
"are ready to build a strong economic foundation for the further
advancement of relations between the two countries," said the
Kremlin on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Karimov, Putin and he found broad mutual
understanding in the course of the summit and the bilateral
cooperation is assuming a stable fundamental nature.
</P>
<P>
"The complete coincidence of our views on bilateral cooperation,
regional security, the matter of Chechnya and combating
international terrorism should not be called into doubt," he told
the press Friday.
</P>
<P>
During Putin's trip, the Russian gas monopoly Gazprom signed an
at-least-five-year- term agreement with Uzbek side on gas supply,
under which Russia will annually import 5 billion cubic meters of
natural gas from Uzbekistan.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced Friday

Turkey to support the government's reforms in public expenditure
management, social security, agriculture and infrastructure.
</P>

endeavor to improve the profile of the region as a single
investment destination and, above all, in its actions to promote
peace and security in this part of the world."

<P>
"To succeed, we must work in an environment of peace and
political stability under participatory forms of government," he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Foreign Minister Calls for Poor Nations' Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Foreign Minister
Jakaya Kikwete Friday urged developing countries to enhance their
economic cooperation and not to lag behind the developed world in
the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of a general assembly of Tanzanian grass-root
organizations here, Kikwete said unless the poor countries work
out viable economic strategies, they can not catch up with the
rich countries.
</P>
<P>
He called on the developed countries to create an environment
which will ensure not only a fair playing field but also equal
strength of players.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, Kikwete said, opportunities for globalization
are concentrated among a few rich countries, keeping the poor
nations out of the process.
</P>
<P>
He said as such, globalization has created vulnerability to
poor nations, which can lead to serious economic instability and
other social problems.
</P>
<P>
"We should not sit back and watch this, but lay strategies to
enhance cooperation and regional networks such as SADC (South
African Development Community), EAC (East African Cooperation) and
ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) to make poor
African countries jump into the globalization band wagon," Kikwete
stressed.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Between Palestinians, Israeli Soldiers Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 Palestinian demonstrators
in the Gaza Strip were throwing stones at four jeeps near a Jewish
settlement carrying Israeli soldiers, who rammed the jeeps into the
crowd, injuring two protesters.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli helicopter was flying overhead dropping tear gas to
stop demonstrators as 200 Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
policemen were trying to restore calm near the Netzarim settlement
in the south of Gaza city.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian coordinators for settlement affairs have arrived at
the scene, while Palestinian polices were pushing back the
demonstrators who tried to hurl stone at the Israeli soldiers, a
Xinhua correspondent reported.
</P>
<P>
This followed a gun battle between Palestinian police and
Israeli soldiers moments earlier, during which six people were
reported injured on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the live-ammunition clash erupted after Israeli
soldiers fired rubber bullets at Palestinian protesters who were
hurling stones and firebombs at Israeli army outposts near the
Netzarim settlement in the south of Gaza city.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police responded with live rounds at the Israeli
troops, who then fired back, witnesses said, adding that four
Palestinian policemen and an officer were injured.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli soldier was also wounded in the head, witnesses said.
But Israeli soldiers denied they had suffered any casualty.
</P>
<P>
Medical personnel at the scene said at least 15 people were
injured during the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza
Strip and West Bank threw stones at Israeli troops in several
clashes, who were met by Israeli soldiers' rubber bullets. Dozens
of demonstrators were injured, including several in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have declared Friday and Saturday as "days of
rage," during which protests are staged to demand the release of
the remaining 1,600 Palestinian security prisoners, who had been on
hunger strike in Israeli prisons since the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials have warned of increased violence in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent days during the "days of
rage" demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Condemns Israeli Attacks on Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Friday condemned the recent Israeli attacks against the
Palestinians and called on Muslim countries to support the
Palestinian people in their struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
The experience gained in the past shows that Israel cannot
stifle the Palestinian calls for justice by intimidating them or
suppressing their protests, Khatami said, quoted by the official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also stressed the necessity of support from Muslim
nations to the Palestinians to stop "the Zionists" from continuing
their "atrocious assaults."
</P>
<P>
The sole way to establish peace, calm and security in the region
is giving back to the Palestinians their lost rights, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security forces shot dead a Palestinian policeman and a
teenage demonstrator and wounded more than 300 people on Monday
when the Palestinians took to the streets in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip to mark the "Nakba," or catastrophe, referring to the
establishment of the state of Israel 52 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Iran refuses to recognize Israel and has always called for armed
struggle against the Jewish state for the return of occupied Arab
territories.

BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes raided twice the
region of Iglem Tufaah in south Lebanon with air-to-ground missiles
Friday afternoon, Lebanon's Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
No casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in south Lebanon this week as Israel sped up
the dismantling process of its positions in the region to prepare
for the implementation of its pledged withdrawal from south Lebanon
by July.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, five Lebanese civilians have
been killed and 61 others wounded in the midst of intensified
military conflicts between Israeli forces and Lebanese resistance
groups fighting to end Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Eight Israeli soldiers and 24 militiamen of the pro-Israel South
Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed, and 25 Israeli soldiers and 37 SLA
militiamen were injured in south Lebanon in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God,
guerrilla group were also killed and eight others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Bin Laden Supporters Put Off in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The trial of 29 people facing charges
of belonging to the terrorist group of Osama Bin Laden has been
delayed, a Lebanese military tribunal said.
</P>
<P>
Those people were accused of planning terrorist attacks against
American and Jewish interests in Jordan, smuggling and storing arms
and ammunition with the aim of launching terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Only five of the 29 suspects have been arrest and sent to
prison, and the others are still at large in Lebanon and Syria,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese court said the Islamic group was founded in the
last few years, with some of its members having been to Afghanistan
to meet Bin Laden and receive his orders.
</P>
<P>
A military investigation had earlier found Ayman Kamaluddin,
Mohamed Itani, Ahmed Obeidi and Sabrin Kamaruddin guilty of forming
the terrorist group which was involved in terrorist acts, armed
robberies and various attacks on people and properties.
</P>
<P>
The group was also found to be dealing with counterfeit
currencies and forged passports which were allegedly used by 10
foreigners for illegal entry to Lebanon, the An Nahar newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, formerly a Saudi, is wanted by the United State in
connection with bomb attacks on U.S. embassies in East African that
killed more than 200 people in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Talks to Resume Soon: Jordanian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh has expressed optimism over the outlook of the stagnant
peace talks between Syria and Israel, saying the talks will restart
in two months, Lebanon's As Safir newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also expected that the region will see positive
peaceful resolution by the end of this year. There were under-the-
table contacts between concerned sides because "everyone is keen on
peace," he was quoted by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh said the coming visit of United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to the region in mid-June will boost the
Middle East peace process on both the Palestinian and Syrian
tracks.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordanian King Abdullah II, who will visit Damascus
on Sunday for talks with Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad, has
reaffirmed Jordan's support to the Syrian and Lebanese positions in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also said that Jordan supports Lebanon's claim to the
controversial Shebaa farms.
</P>
<P>
The highly fertile farms, seized by Israel from Lebanon in the
1967 Middle East war, are located on the Lebanese side of Mount
Hermon, Syria's highest mountain, which is under Israeli
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
Israel argues that the Shebaa Farms belong to Syria, and that a
withdrawal from this area will be considered in peace talks with
Damascus when they resume. 
</P>
<P>
According to the British-French agreement on the Lebanese-
Palestinian border in 1923, the Shebaa Farms are not included in
the Lebanese side. But Beirut retorted that the area was bequeathed
to Beirut in a 1951 agreement between Lebanon and its major power
broker Syria.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Criticizes Turkish Reaction Over Cyprus- Greece Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus government spokesman Michalis
Papapetrou said Friday the "concern" expressed by Turkey over the
recent joint Cyprus-Greece military exercises is totally "
unjustified."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Papapetrou claimed that
the security and stability in the region is jeopardized, in stead,
by the presence of the Turkish troops in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Local media earlier reported that Turkish Foreign Ministry said
the "Vergina-Toxotis" joint manoeuvre, which was held on May 16-18
between the Cyprus National Guard and the Greek air and naval
forces, might escalate tensions and disturb stability in the
region.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the exercises do not contribute to favorable
conditions for the third round of United Nations-sponsored
proximity talks on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In response, Papapetrou said he hoped the Turkish reaction was
not aimed to create a pretext ahead of the upcoming talks.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The two sides of the island have already held two rounds of U.N.
-sponsored indirect talks on a Cyprus settlement, but no
significant achievements have been made. A third round of talks is
scheduled for July 5 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece agreed in 1993 on a joint defense doctrine,
providing air, sea and land cover to the island by the Greek armed
forces in the event of another Turkish offensive.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Egypt expressed its support to
Lebanon's claim for the controversial Shebaa Farms in an Egyptian-
Lebanese joint communique signed by Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss and his Egyptian counterpart Atef Obeid here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries stressed in the communique that Israel "must
implement a full withdrawal in line with U.N. resolution 425,
including Shebaa Farms."
</P>
<P>
The highly fertile Shebaa Farms, seized by Israel from Lebanon
in the 1967 Middle East war, are located on the Lebanese side of
Mount Hermon, Syria's highest mountain, which is under Israeli
occupation.

to Beirut in a 1951 agreement between Lebanon and its major power
broker Syria.
</P>
<P>
The communique called Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon,
scheduled by July, a "development and victory for Lebanon" and "
serves Arab interests."
</P>
<P>
It also called for the resumption of peace talks between Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed memorandums and executive programs
for bilateral economic cooperation in the fields of tourism,
education, commerce, housing, industry and information.
</P>
<P>
Obeid arrived here on Wednesday for a three-day visit, in which
he also held talks with President Emile Lahoud, Parliament Speaker
Nabih Berri.
</P>
<P>
He also inaugurated a new electricity relay station that was
damaged in the Israeli air raids in February and reconstructed by

<HEADLINE> UNICEF:Humanitarian Crisis Looms in Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. children-oriented
agency Friday warned of a looming humanitarian crisis in Eritrea,
where the government estimates that as many as 1 million people
have been displaced within the last week due to conflict with
neighboring Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
With an additional 300,000 people already suffering form
drought-related hunger and illness, nearly half of Eritrea's
population of about 3.1 million people may be in need of an
international humanitarian lifeline.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit regions are Shambuko, Tokombiya, Molki,
Haykota, LalayGas, Tesenei and Barentu, UNICEF said in a press
release issued here.
</P>
<P>
"In the space of one week we've seen an overwhelming
humanitarian crisis develop," said Carol Bellamy, executive
director of UNICEF. "I can't recall another instance when such a
serious natural disaster was followed so quickly by a man-made
disaster. And it's the innocent civilians -- including a quarter
of a million children under the age of five -- who have their
backs against the wall."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said that UNICEF, along with other relief
organizations, had not yet received full donor funding for the
drought relief effort in Eritrea and elsewhere in the Horn of
Africa. But she said relief agencies had no choice but to seek
even more assistance.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is also providing ongoing humanitarian support to some
340,000 people in Ethiopia who had been displaced during earlier
phases of the conflict, she said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, UNICEF provided some 1.8 million U.S. dollars to
support health, nutrition, emergency education, and water
initiatives for war-displaced populations in northern Ethiopia's
tigray region.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF will continue that work, albeit within the security
constraints of the present situation, she said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.N. agencies and the government-run Eritrean
Relief and Refugee Commission (ERREC) jointly organized a donor
conference to review the humanitarian situation and jump-start
relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said a number of international donors had pledged to
support the heightened relief effort, but added that far more
support would be required.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said a flash appeal would be launched soon.
</P>
<P>
"The first step is to provide full funding to relief efforts
for conflict-affected and drought-affected communities across the
Horn of Africa, including Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia,
Djibouti and Sudan," she said. "The second step is to work with
the two governments to bring about an immediate and peaceful cease-
fire and a lasting peace. Without one, the humanitarian situation
is only going to worsen."
</P>
<P>
Created in 1964 by the U.N. General Assembly, UNICEF is the
only U.N. agency dedicated exclusively to children, and works for
child protection, survival and development within the framework of
the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Turkmenistan Move to Expand Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin,
who is visiting Turkmenistan, on Friday concluded with his Turkmen
counterparts Saparmurad Niyazov a package of pacts to boost the
cooperation between their countries.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Niyazov in Turkmen capital of Ashgabad,
Putin told the press that he attaches great importance to
cooperation with Turkmenistan in all directions at the global and
regional levels,calling Turkmenistan one of Russia's main partners.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the efforts by both sides to significantly
improve bilateral ties and strengthen interaction on issues of
common concern succeeded during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Besides regional security problems, cooperation in the fuel and
energy sector, communication and transport was also discussed, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The sides reached an agreement to increase Turkmen gas supply
to Russia by 10 billion cubic meters to 50-60 billion cubic meters
annually, said Putin.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have "significantly narrowed their
differences"on Caspian issues, said Putin, suggesting to form a
joint bilateral working group on the issue.
</P>
<P>
At the end of their talks, the presidents signed a joint
communique and a declaration on cooperation in the humanitarian
sphere.

<HEADLINE> IMF Suggests No Shore-up of S.African Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The decline of the value of
the South African currency rand is temporary and does not warrant
a corrective interest rate hike, said an official of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The rand is inherently stronger than its present level,"
Michael Nowak, head of a visiting IMF delegation told members of
the finance committee of South Africa's parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said the rand's fall was temporary and the situation did not
warrant intervention by the country's monetary authorities.
</P>
<P>
Nowak said an increase in rates could harm the country's
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official made the suggestion at a time when the South
African Reserve Bank, the country's central bank, is expected to
make an announcement later on Friday on the outcome of its two-day
meeting on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The rand has depreciated about 15 percent against the U.S.
dollar this year, and was trading at 7.16 rand to one dollar on
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Nowak said foreign investors were concerned about the fact that
the instability in Zimbabwe might have impact on the value of the
rand.
</P>
<P>
About 20 people have been killed in political violence during
the run-up to the parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe. The
violence was triggered off when the country's former war veterans
took over more than 1,000 white- owned farms.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investors are very nervous that something similar
could happen here (South Africa)," he said.
</P>
<P>
In principle, conditions in Zimbabwe should have had little
effect on the South African currency, as trade with the
neighboring country accounted for less than 5 percent of South
Africa's total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
However, anticipation that similar problems could emerge in
South Africa was worrying investors.
</P>
<P>
Nowak recommended the country's monetary authorities to refrain
from intervening to shore up the rand, and improve situation in
Zimbabwe through diplomatic channels.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Launch Regional Integration Support Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The just concluded
Fifth Summit of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) has decided to launch a support program to facilitate the
regional integration, official sources said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The regional integration support program will be undertaken by
the COMESA's Bureau of Finance Ministers, in liaison with the
Special Ministerial Committee on the implementation of the COMESA
Free Trade Area, said a Final Communique released after the
conclusion of the two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
The involved organizations will collaborate to negotiate with
the sub- regional body's cooperating partners to provide
neccessary support for the COMESA's regional integration
arrangement and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The communique "urged countries in the region that were not
members of the Regional Integration Facilitation Forum (RIFF) to
consider joining the RIFF".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the 9th Meeting of the COMESA Council of Ministers
observed that despite the progress made by the member states in
implementing economic reforms, there are still some sticky issues
remaining to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for innovative mechanisms for dialogue with
multi-lateral institutions to assist in the provision of balance
of payment support to allow COMESA member countries to continue
the process of trade liberalization, despite short term budgetary
and current account deficits," said the communique.

KAMPALA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
on Friday called for acceleration of development of electricity
facilities in order to modernize the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the call when addressing the opening ceremony of

megawatts (MW) to the national grid.
</P>
<P>
Another 40 MW will be created when the Unit 12 launches in July
this year.
</P>
<P>
The additional 80 MW to the existing 180MW generated by the old

to only 20MW.

<P>
The extension project include five generators with a designed
capacity of 200 MW.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Reinforce Its Own Peacekeeping Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The demand for international
peacekeeping forces has increased over the past few years due to
the rising number of conflicts, a United Nations official said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Operations Director Leonard Kapungu said Africa, which was
hardest ravaged by such conflicts, should reinforce its own
peacekeeping efforts on regional and continental basis.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 10 years, there have been about 20 serious armed
conflicts within African countries, many of which are yet to be
resolved," he told a graduation ceremony of Southern African
Development Community (SADC) peacekeeping forces training course.
</P>
<P>
"International concern about the successful resolution of
these conflicts has led to no less than 11 peacekeeping missions
on the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
While the U.N. assisted in specialized training, he said, it
remained the primary responsibility of member states to train
their personnel.
</P>
<P>
He said the training of forces for U.N. peacekeeping missions
in Zimbabwe was a demonstration of the commitment of the SADC
region to contribute more meaningfully to international
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
The graduation was for more than 25 company commanders from
SADC who completed the second two-week U.N. peacekeeping course.

GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius Prime
Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam Friday called on the member states
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to
attach more importance to the building of partnership on the road
to achieve regional development.
</P>
<P>
"Technological advancement and human resource development are
vital for all economies, but more so, for our developing and
small-island economies," he said when speaking at the closing
ceremony of the fifth COMESA summit here.
</P>
<P>
"Equally important is the process of building partnerships,
right from the grassroots level, involving the various
stakeholders," he said, explaining that "this partnership, when
practiced in each of our member states, will take us a long way in
our regional integration agenda and, finally, in our quest for the
African Economic Community."
</P>
<P>
"We need to remind ourselves constantly that a factor critical
to our success is to use our strengths and resources judiciously,"
he said, calling the member states to work collectively to
overcome the scourges of internal conflicts, disease and
underdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that "the COMESA Free Trade Area, high
on our agenda for quite some time and now within sight, is but one
major stride in our way forward."
</P>

"It is too early to claim final victory in spite of the

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Intervene in Zimbabwe's Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) is mandated to explore the possibility of
facilitating a renewed land reform program in Zimbabwe, the U.N.
Information Center said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP was well placed to play such a role because of its
experience as a trusted partner in Zimbabwe, the center said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP worked together with the Zimbabwean government in
organizing the 1998 International Donors Conference on land reform
and resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The unanimously endorsed principles and processes established
at that conference remain the basis for a sustainable land reform
program, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The UNDP's role would involve working with the government, the
 international community and those involved on the ground to set
up a mutually acceptable plan of action," it said.
</P>
<P>
By initiating such a process, the U.N. hopes that it would help
defuse the confrontation and pave the way for a just and equitable
resolution to the land issue.
</P>
<P>
About 4,460 Zimbabwean white commercial farmers own 11.2
million hectares of fertile land while more than six million
people in communal areas occupy 16.4 million hectares of poor
soil.
</P>
<P>
This has resulted in over 1,000 white farms being occupied by
former freedom fighters and other landless peasants in the past
three months.

the Southern African Development Community (SADC) together, he
said.
</P>

"COMESA is more advanced in a number of areas than SADC," he
said. "SADC, from a political point of view and security, is more
advanced than COMESA."

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Police, Israeli Troops Exchange Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers
exchanged fire on Friday near a Jewish settlement in the Gaza
Strip, leading to injuries on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the gun battle erupted after Israeli soldiers
fired rubber bullets at Palestinian protesters who were hurling
stones and firebombs at Israeli army outposts near the Netzarim
settlement in the south of Gaza city.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police responded with live ammunition at the Israeli
troops, who then fired back, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Four Palestinian policemen and an officer were injured in the
battle. An Israeli soldier was also wounded in the head.
</P>
<P>
A reinforcement of scores of Palestinian policemen were seen
rushing to the scene. There were no clashes at present, but the
atmosphere remained tense.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians across the Gaza Strip and West Bank
threw stones at Israeli troops in several clashes, who were met by
Israeli soldiers' rubber bullets. Dozens of demonstrators were
injured, including several in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have declared Friday and Saturday as "days of
rage," during which protests are staged to demand the release of
the remaining 1,600 Palestinian security prisoners, who had been on
hunger strike in Israeli prisons since the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials have warned of increased violence in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip in recent days during the "days of
rage" demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Israel Promises to Study Palestinian Prisoner Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel informed the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) on Friday that it will study carefully the
further release of the Palestinian prisoners from Israel jails.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities concerned will consider cutting short
the prison terms of certain Palestinian prisoners and putting the
others onto the release list, the Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee for Palestinian prisoners will meet in the
coming days to discuss the prisoners issue, the office added.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has submitted a list of 230 Palestinian prisoners,
awaiting an answer from Israel to its request to release them.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza strip
demonstrated Friday to urge Israel to release the Palestinian
prisoners. At some places, the demonstrators clashed with Israeli
soldiers and border police.
</P>
<P>
Israel beefed up security since Friday morning in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip in preparation for mass Palestinian demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials on Thursday called on the Palestinian
public to participate in the demonstrations Friday and Saturday,
declared as "days of rage" in support of the hunger-striking
Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
However, the officials asked the demonstrators to refrain from
using live ammunition and act with restraint.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians began mass demonstrations last Friday in the
territories to demand the release of Palestinian prisoners from
Israel jails.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes erupted on Monday between Palestinian police and
Israeli soldiers, leaving at least six Palestinians dead and
hundreds more wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops in the last few days have arrested 22
Palestinians, accusing them of shooting at Israeli soldiers and
border police and throwing firebombs and stones.
</P>
<P>
Releasing more Palestinian prisoners is one of the sensitive
interim issues the two sides have to settle. The Palestinian side
said that over 1,600 Palestinian prisoners are still being held in
various Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators held several rounds of talks
recently to discuss this issue but no progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it will not release such Palestinian prisoners
with "blood on their hands," meaning they had killed or wounded
Israelis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New High in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit surged to
an all-time high of 30.2 billion U.S. dollars in March as a record
foreign oil bill overwhelmed a rebound in American exports of farm
products and autos, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The overall deficit increased by 5.1 percent from a revised
February figure of 28.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In March, U.S. exports showed a sharp rebound, rising by 2.9
percent to a record high of 87.3 billion dollars. The advance was
powered by big gains in sales of autos and auto parts, computer
chips, telecommunications equipment and industrial machinery.
</P>
<P>
However, that increase was overwhelmed by a 3.5 percent rise in
imports, which also set a record at 117.4 billion dollars, with
large gains in imported oil, foreign autos and auto parts and
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Imports of crude oil climbed to a record high of 7.6 billion
dollars as the average price rose to 26.38 dollars per barrel in
March, the highest level since oil was going for 29.51 dollars in
November 1990 during the Persian Gulf crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, the U.S. trade deficit
totaled 86.3 billion dollars, 59 percent higher than the trade gap
of 54.2 billion dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
For March, America's deficit with Japan rose 1.4 percent to 6.8
billion dollars in March, the largest imbalance since a 7-billion-
dollar gap in December as imports from that country set a record.
For the first three months of this year, the deficit with Japan is
running 16.5 percent ahead of the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Canada, America's largest trading partner,
rose to 3.85 billion dollars in March as both U.S. exports to
Canada and imports from that country set records.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Western Europe jumped 66 percent to 5.86
billion dollars as record U.S. exports to that region were swamped
by record imports from Europe.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Prime Minister Vows to Win Another Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has formally announced that he is looking forward to
winning another mandate from an election within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"We will have an election within 12 months and I intend to win
the next election," said the 66-year-old prime minister at an
election-style rally of 1,500 cheering supporters Thursday in
Baden,Ontario.
</P>
<P>
About three and a half years into his second term, Chretien
enjoys a lead as much as 40 percentage points in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Liberal insiders have indicated that they are encouraging the
prime minister to have an early call to avoid any shrinkage of
that lead over the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
But Chretien declined to comment on a definite date for the
call,saying only "anytime from now until the period of four years
there's an election that can be called."
</P>
<P>
Chretien led his Liberal Party to power in 1993. He was re-
elected prime minister in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Decides to Strengthen U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone (Updated with more information) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Friday unanimously adopted a resolution to expand the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) "to a maximum of 13,
000 military personnel," including the 260 military observers
already deployed in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted following the deterioration in
security conditions in Sierra Leone, where rebels have been taking
500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage since the start of May. Despite the
release of some detainees, more than 270 troops are still being
held by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
"The deterioration in security conditions on the ground
necessitates the rapid reinforcement of the military component"
UNAMSIL "to provide the mission with additional resources to
fulfill its mandate," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council decides that the military component of
UNAMSIL shall be expanded to a maximum of 13,000 military
personnel, including the 260 military observers already deployed,"
said the resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its appreciation to all States
who, in order to expedite the rapid reinforcement of UNAMSIL, have
accelerated the deployment of their troops to UNAMSIL, made
available additional personnel, and offered logistical, technical
and other forms of military assistance, and calls upon all those
in a position to do so to provide further support," the resolution
said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution approved the efforts to raise the force ceiling
from 11,100 to 13,000, covering troops offered by India,
Bangladesh and Jordan, who are expected to arrive in Sierra Leone
shortly.
</P>
<P>
Another 3,000 troops have been proposed by West African
countries, which previously fielded an intervention force that
kept rebels from RUF out of the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations peacekeepers were deployed in the West
African country to help enforce a peace accord, signed in Lome,
capital of Togo, in July last year, which was intended to end an
eight-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
One requirement was disarming rebel groups. However, many RUF
fighters refused to do so and instead captured some 500
peacekeepers, more than half whom have been now released.

<HEADLINE> 95 Myanmar Opposition Members Put In Prison: NLD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has detained
and imprisoned a total of 95 members of the opposition National
League for Democracy (NLD), according to a statement of the NLD
available here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NLD members, who were held between May 12 and 15 by the
military intelligence units, include 12 parliament representatives
of the party elected in the 1990 general election and 83 other
organizers of the township branches of the party.
</P>
<P>
Of them, some have been sentenced to imprisonment for a term of
ranging from 7 to 9 years, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The NLD has lodged strong protest to the government over the
move.
</P>
<P>
The government's move came more than 10 days before the NLD is
to mark the 10th anniversary of the general election on May 27.
</P>
<P>
The May 1990 general election, contested by 93 political
parties, was sponsored by the Myanmar military government after it
took over the power of state on September 18, 1988 when the
country was at the height of a political and economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the election, the NLD won 396 parliamentary seats out of 485.
</P>
<P>
The NLD blames that the government is still refusing to
implement the result of the 1990 general election, saying that the
government, on the contrary, applies various means to stop and
disturb all efforts aimed at demanding the emergence of the people
's parliament.
</P>
<P>
The NLD unilaterally formed on September 16, 1998 a Committee
Representing the People's Parliament (CRPP) Elected in the 1990
General Election after its demand to the government to call the
parliament within 60 days was ignored.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier statement of the CRPP, secretary of the
CRPP U Aye Tha Aung was arrested by the government last month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government regarded itself as a "transitional or
caretaker government," frequently repeating that it has "no
intention" to hold on to power for long.
</P>
<P>
According to a high-ranking military official of the Myanmar
government, only 169 parliament representatives-elect out of 485
remain valid as of Thursday. The other 316 include those who
resigned, died and disqualified or canceled. Of the 169 parliament
representatives who remain valid, 110 are from the NLD.

<HEADLINE> France Urged to Back German Plan on European Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Former German Foreign Minister Hans-
Dietrich Genscher Friday urged France to back the plan of Germany
to build a European federation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French daily Le Figaro published
Friday, Genscher, who was Germany's foreign minister from 1974 to
1992, said that he fully supports the initiative launched by
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer on a European federation.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is the responsibility of France and Germany to
make sure that enlargement of the European Union should not water
down the role of locomotive of the two countries in European
integration.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, we should give (Franco-German locomotive) a
push," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Franco-German cooperation will be decisive to implement
the Fischer plan, with the support of Italy and Benelux countries,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Genscher said that a multipolar world is replacing a bipolar
world of the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
"Europe should not be left behind ... This plan of Fischer
makes up a European face against the background of globalization,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Genscher praised Fischer for "looking far" and said he "is well
on his way to success."
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will meet Friday evening
in the castle town of Rambouillet, 50 kilometers southwest of
Paris, to discuss the possibility to build a European federation.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said on May 12 that he believed a European federation
with a strong executive and a two-chamber parliament is the only
way to build a strong Europe.

<P>
PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- President of the European Commission
Romano Prodi said Friday that he hopes France and Germany can
launch a new initiative for a new phase of European integration.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Monde published Friday, Prodi
described the German initiative for a European federation as "an
invitation for a Franco-German initiative."
</P>
<P>
He said that he prefers not to emphasize too much the word "
federation," because different countries have different
interpretation of it.
</P>
<P>
"But it is clear that this invitation to resume a Franco-German
initiative is welcome," he said.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder are to meet Friday evening
in Rambouillet outside Paris to discuss the German proposal on
federation.
</P>
<P>
"We need it because Europe is no more Europe without a strong
initiative of the two countries," Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said on May 12 that a
European federation, equipped with a European constitution, a
directly elected executive and a two-chamber parliament, is the
only way for building a strong Europe.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that he has always been supportive of the ideas of
European federalism.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy not to be the only one to defend these ideas. I am
with many others now," he said.

investment houses from China, the United States, and Canada
gathered here today to discuss venture capital operations at
present and in the future.

During the seminar, some experts said that venture capital has
played a key role in stimulating economic development in the

capital operations in China.

Experts also noted that China is trying to become one of the
world's most vigorous venture capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Hu Ying, chief executive officer of the Venture Capital Union

developed rapidly in recent years, and statistics show that the
country now has about 7.4 billion yuan (892 million U.S. dollars)
of these funds.

He predicted that as China perfects regulation and policies
concerning venture capital, this market will attract additional
funds.

The seminar has invited the president of the SCI company of the
United States to address the seminar, in a bid to help domestic
venture capital organizations learn more about this field.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China, EU Sign Agreement on China's WTO Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China and the European Union signed
a bilateral agreement here this afternoon on China's accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi
Guangsheng and the trade commissioner of the European Commission
Pascal Lamy signed the agreement on behalf of each side.
</P>
<P>
This agreement is another step forward in China's bid to join
the WTO, and will also lend great impetus to the development of
bilateral ties between China and the EU.
</P>
<P>
During the signing ceremony, Shi said this agreement, after
five days of equal and friendly consultations and negotiations,
shows the spirit of equality, friendship, and mutual-benefit, and
has demonstrates the friendly ties between China and EU.
</P>
<P>
Shi said he believes the implementation of the agreement will
inject vitality into Sino-EU relations and bring great
opportunities to Sino-EU trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Shi also noted that the signing of the agreement signifies that
China's bilateral negotiations has come to the concluding phase.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has yet to sign agreements with five WTO members
who demanded bilateral talks with China. Shi stressed that
China will play a positive and constructive role in promoting the
development of the global economy and trade, and the establishment
of a new international economic order.
</P>
<P>
Trade between China and Europe dates back some 2,000 years, but
never has its scale been this large, both in terms of trade volume
and investment, said Lamy.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is good for China, for European companies, and
for bilateral relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the EU hopes that China will deepen its reform,
further develop its economy, and establish a market economy as
soon as possible, said Lamy.
</P>
<P>
The EU is convinced that China's WTO accession will provide new
impetus to the country's reform, and in that sense, the signing of
the agreement is of special significance, added Lamy, emphasizing
that the agreement is beneficial to both sides.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation led by Lamy arrived here on May 15 to begin
this round of bilateral talks with the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, China and the EU conducted three rounds of
negotiations, one in Brussels and two in Beijing.

<P>
Meanwhile, it pointed to Algeria's satisfaction with the UN
Secretary Council Resolution 1297 on May 12 and Resolution 1298 on
May 17 which demanded an immediate unconditional cessation of
hostilities and resumption of negotiations between Ethiopia and
Eritrea to be sponsored by the OAU.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Fights to Clear New Assault Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson's lawyer
said that his client is determined to clear his name following
allegations that the boxer hit a stripper in a Las Vegas nightclub.
</P>
<P>
The dancer, Victoria Bianco, has filed a report on the alleged
incident with local police who are now investigating her claim,
according to the BBC reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bianco claims the former world heavyweight champion punched her
in the chest and hurled expletives at her in a club where she was
working as a topless dancer.
</P>
<P>
Police were called to the scene, but after interviewing
witnesses, including Tyson himself, they decided not to press
charges.
</P>
<P>
Miss Bianco, however, has persisted, filing a police report.
</P>
<P>
The nightclub's owner said Tyson was in a bad mood on the night
in question and raised his arm before telling the girl to go away.
</P>
<P>
But he denied there was physical contact.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's lawyer, Jim Jimmerson said the allegations were totally
false.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, convicted of rape in 1992, has been allowed into Britain
next month to fight Italian-American Lou Savarese, which will be
held in Scotland next month.
</P>
<P>
But the decision has sparked outrage among some
parliamentarians and women's groups.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is currently in training in Las Vegas for next month's
fight in Scotland, and Bianco's allegations may only serve to fuel
the controversy over his re-admission to the UK.
</P>
<P>
The row rages on over Home Secretary Jack Straw's decision on
Thursday to allow Tyson into Britain for the fight.
</P>
<P>
Scotland's home of football, Hampden Park in Glasgow, looks set
to host the bout on June 24.
</P>
<P>
The promoters still have to secure a licence from Glasgow City
Council but that is seen as a formality.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The second-phase joint development
of China's first offshore group of oilfields has completed in
Bohai Sea in north China.
</P>
<P>
The group of oilfields are expected to go on stream in mid-June
this year and will pump out a combined output of 300,000 tons of
crude and 45 million cubic meters of natural gas a year.
</P>
<P>
This will help ease the pressure on energy demand by the
developing eastern part of the north China port city of Tianjin,
local industrial sources say.
</P>
<P>
Altogether six oil-bearing structures have been discovered in
the area where the group of oilfields locate, some 41 km away from
the coastal Tanggu of the city and the proven oil and natural gas
reserves are 50 million tons and over 10 billion cubic meters,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
During the first-phase construction of the group of oilfields
which began in June 1995, two small offshore oilfields and three
offshore platforms were built, three seabed oil and gas pipelines,
totaling 110 km, were laid in addition to the completion of 50
supportive facilities.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase construction was completed at the end of 1997,
costing 1.7 billion yuan (about 200 million U.S. dollars The first-
phase projects produce 500,000 tons of crude a year and 380,000
cubic meters of natural gas a day.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The municipality of Beijing today
took a new move in the reform of its pension system, enabling
social insurance institutions to take full responsibility to
collect, manage, and distribute pensions.
</P>
<P>
In the past, those retired can only receive pensions from their
work units. If the unit closed down, they often lost their pension.
</P>
<P>
According to You Lantian, director of the Beijing Municipal
Bureau of Labor and Social Security, starting from June, all
pensions will be distributed by designated social institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Those retired can receive their pensions directly from nearby
banks, post offices or community service centers," You said.
</P>
<P>
"This will help all retired workers, regardless of work unit
they belonged to. They will receive their pension fully and
without delay."
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Beijing's pension system covered 1.09 million retirees,
and the average monthly pension for a retired Beijinger was 677
yuan (some 80 US dollars).

<P>
The Beijing-based chief representative of Standard Life, a
British insurance company, told Xinhua that his company is
delighted at the signing of the deal, which means that China has
come to the very doorstep of WTO.
</P>
<P>
After China's accession to the World Trade Organization, its
insurance industry will probably face much more intense
competition than before, which at the same time endows the
industry with brand new opportunities for development, he said.
Foreign insurance companies will bring to China their expertise
accumulated through centuries of practice, as well as solid
capital and advanced technical know-how.
</P>
<P>
"If you look at it with foresight, this is the inevitable trend,
" he said, prophesying that under appropriate guidance and proper
handling, China's insurance industry will survive the shock and
enter into new phases of development.
</P>
<P>
The chief representative of Gerling, a German insurance company,
voiced similar optimism. The signing of the agreement is a victory
to both sides, and he believes that the European Union wants to
support China's entry into the WTO, he said.
</P>
<P>
European insurance companies, rich in experience in industrial
insurance, risk management and credit insurance, will greatly
benefit their Chinese counterparts through cooperation in these
areas, he said, pledging that European companies could play a "
complementary but vital role in the overall structure of China's
insurance industry."

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Hali, a five-year-old Siberian
tiger, has become a "heroic mother" for giving birth to 14 baby
tigers within 32 months.
</P>
<P>
Hali has created the record among all other Siberian tigers
living in the zoos across China when she gave birth to four more
cubs on April 17 at Luoyang City, central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tigers usually give birth once a year to only one cub,
said Pang Hongwei with the park where Hali lives. Human-controlled
lactation enables Hali to become a heroic mother. Her children are
now living in zoos in east China's Jiangxi, north China's Hebei
and central China's Henan and Hubei provinces.
</P>
<P>
The four new babies are all female. They are now able to lap
meat gruel mixed with vitamins, fish liver oil, and Calcium
tablets. They are expected to stop sucking their mother's milk
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Hali made her way from Beijing Zoo to Luoyang when she was only
three months old in 1995. Hali and her husband, "Huzi" who is from
Hubei Province, first became parents on December 1, 1997 when Hali
gave birth to three lovely cubs.
</P>
<P>
Hali became well-known nationwide only seven months later when
she gave birth again to four more cubs.
</P>
<P>
Hali and Huzi now have six sons and eight daughters.
</P>
<P>
Siberian tiger, mainly living in northeast China and Russia, is
an endangered wild animal under the State-level protection in
China. There are about 300 wild Siberian tigers in the world today.
The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) has listed the animal as one of the
world's 10 endangered species.

China allows more foreign investment shares his airline will be
possible to relieve its debt and become more competitive.

<P>
Southern Airlines is expected to open up its transportation
goods globally, said the CEO. A base will be set up in Shenzhen of

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore Tourism Board (STB)
has undertaken measures to develop agri-tourism as part of its
efforts to enhance attractiveness of Singapore, according to an
STB media release Friday.
</P>
<P>
The release said the STB and Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority
of Singapore (AVA) have collaborated to turn five urban farms
within the Singapore's Agrotechnology Parks into tourism sites and
help these farms provide visitors with a memorable alternative
nature-based and nature-sensitive experiences.
</P>
<P>
It defines the agri-tourism as seeking to provide a tourism
component in existing farm operations, in the form of educational
and authentic farm experiences for visitors.
</P>
<P>
It said these farms will showcase to visitors a unique brand of
intensive modern city farming technologies, in a rare and rustic
Singapore setting, and offer New Asia elements of traditional
livelihood and modern technology. Home-grown agri-tourism products
in Singapore include the breeding of exotic and endangered birds,
environmentally friendly and pesticide-free vegetables, ornamental
fish farms and tropical orchids.
</P>
<P>
The AVA now manages 1,500 hectares or 2.5 percent of the island
's total land area for agrotechnology farming and the shortage of
land in the country has contributed to the development of some
highly specialized and intensive agri-enterprises in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> aaa051990--Dossiers of Soeharto's Case to be Submitted in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Attorney General
Office (AGO) will submit dossiers of Soeharto's case on corruption
charges to the court in August this year, Attorney General Marzuki
Darusman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We will submit dossiers of Soeharto's case on corruption
charges in August this year, or before the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) hold its annual convention," Darusman told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He asked the former president and his family to cooperate with
the AGO for a settlement of soeharto's case.
</P>
<P>
"The government demands former president Soeharto and his
family be cooperative with us. We also urge him (Soeharto) and his
family to return his fortune allegedly amassed illegally to the
state," Darusman said. But he did not specify how much of Soeharto
's fortune has to be returned.
</P>
<P>
"We actually have no exact number on that point," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that if Soeharto does not do so, "the security
protection (for Soeharto and his family) will be reduced to the
minimum level," Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
The government has an obligation to provide security protection
for former presidents and former high ranking officials, Darusman
said.
</P>
<P>
"And the government has done such an obligation (providing
security protection) to Soeharto. This is not a threat, we just
want that the former president will be cooperative with
prosecutors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who stepped down in May 1998 amid the political and
economic crisis in the country, has been put under city arrest
since early April and underwent several investigations at his
residence for corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
He is suspected of abusing his power and authority by issuing
decrees and government regulations to amass funds through seven
tax-free charity foundations he set up and chaired during his 32
years in power.
</P>
<P>
AGO officials said that if Soeharto's health remains stable, he
is expected to be grilled by prosecutors every Monday.

<HEADLINE> Manila Reiterates No-Ransom Policy for Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators tasked by Philippine
President Joseph Estrada to secure the release of 21 hostages in
Jolo made it clear Friday that the government will not pay any
ransom to the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Robert Aventajado, chairman of the Presidential
Flagship Committee, reiterated this policy following reports that
the Abu Sayyaf extremist group wanted 2 million U.S. dollars for
the release of an ailing German woman hostage.
</P>
<P>
"The government does not pay ransom as a policy. Perhaps if
they want livelihood and development programs, I will relay them
to the president for consideration. Otherwise, I'll tell them
outright that the government will not address demands that are not
legitimate," Aventajado said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the negotiating panel has yet to receive a
demand for 2 million dollars from the hostage takers.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado, who had been tasked by President Estrada to head
the new negotiating panel, stressed that he will abide by his
policy of considering only demands put in writing.
</P>
<P>
"We will address the demands only after they are given to us in
the format we've requested," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the negotiating panel would do everything in its power
to fulfill the president's order to "resolve the situation
peacefully as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, most of them foreigners, were abducted by the
Abu Sayyaf on April 23 from a diving resort in Malaysia and then
taken to the southern Jolo island.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) - The six largest Thai-owned banks
said Friday that they have agreed to jointly offer cross-banking
electronic cash transfer.
</P>
<P>
In a joint announcement, Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Thai
Farmers Bank, Siam Commercial Bank, Bank of Ayudhya and Thai
Military Bank unveiled their plan to enable their automatic teller
machine (ATM) card holders to transfer money among the six banks.
</P>
<P>
The joint electronic banking service, named "On-line Retail
Fund Transfer," will become available from June 19 and will cater
to 13 million ATM card holders through 4,000 ATMs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a major cooperation effort in the battle to
protect Thai banks' market shares from being encroached by so-
called "hybrid banks."
</P>
<P>
Thai banks are considered to be at a disadvantage compared with
"hybrid banks," whose majority had been taken by foreign banks and
seen as major players in the banking arena with advanced
technological means.
</P>
<P>
Thai banks' advantages currently lie in their large consumer
base and investments in ATM networks.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Earn Less in 1999 Despite Better Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss earned less in 1999
despite strengthening economy in the country, according to the
latest figures made public on Friday by the Federal Statistics
Office.
</P>
<P>
Real earnings declined by 0.6 percent, while nominal income,
wages that have not been adjusted to take account of inflation,
was virtually stagnant, compared to rises of 0.5 percent in 1997,
and 0.8 percent in 1998, when inflation was virtually zero.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1990s, real incomes in Switzerland declined in
four years out of the 10, but these falls mostly came in the first
half of the decade when the country was in recession.
</P>
<P>
This latest drop in wages comes against a backdrop of record
low unemployment and strong economic growth. This suggests that
workers in Switzerland are coming under the same pressure as their
counterparts in many other industrialized nations, where the link
between wage levels and employment no longer applies.
</P>
<P>
Between 1998 and 1999, workers in Switzerland's services sector
saw their nominal incomes rise by an average of 0.4 percent. This
was offset by a smaller rise in the industrial and agricultural
sectors of just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, in banking and information technology, wages rose by
between 1.5 and 2 percent, while builders and public sector
workers saw declines of 0.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> French, German Leaders Meet to Discuss European Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac,
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder will meet on Friday in the castle town of Rambouillet 50
kilometers southwest of Paris to discuss the German proposal for a
European federation.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who first announced
the proposal last week, and his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine
will also attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a speech on May 12 in Berlin, Fischer said that a federation
of European states is the only way to realize a strong Europe and
to harmonize the interests between national states and the union.
</P>
<P>
A federation will include a directly elected president of the
European executive and a two-chamber parliament representing all
member states of the European Union (EU), according to the German
proposal.
</P>
<P>
France, which will take over the EU presidency on July 1, has
so far refrained from fully supporting the proposal in fear of
causing division among EU countries and triggering protests from
sovereignist parties at home.
</P>
<P>
But French leaders could seize the chance to renewal the "
Franco-German locomotive" in the process of the European
integration, said observers.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Finland have expressed opposition to the German
proposal.

<HEADLINE> North China City Sinking By 1.7 Meters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Cangzhou, a city located near
the Grand Canal in north China's Hebei Province, sank by 1.7
meters in the past three decades owing to excessive pumping of
underground water.
</P>
<P>
The city is facing serious water problems. The amount of water
per capita is 205 cubic meters, far below the basic requirements
set by the United Nations for regions which suffer from extreme
shortages of water.
</P>
<P>
A funnel-like sinking region enlarged to 4,860 square
kilometers, has caused the ground to sink by 1.7-meters in the
past three decades. As a result, some old buildings in the city
have begun to tilt and others to collapse.
</P>
<P>
The water conservation office in the city warned the
possibility of water from the ocean pouring into the funnel,
leading to worsening quality of water. It has urged that emergency
measures are needed to tackle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of China's 668 cities are facing water
shortages in various degrees, and that 100 face serious problems.
</P>
<P>
Chinese cities have a total annual water shortage of six
billion cubic meters (about 210 billion cubic feet), while per
capita water resources for Chinese is less than one-quarter of the
world's average.
</P>
<P>
China has called for the introduction of the water saving
concept and implemented a program to protect the country's water
resources.

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Open Insurance Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China is accelerating the opening-
up of its insurance industry in an active, safe and cautious
manner, with preparations underway for four more Sino-foreign
insurance companies and one solely foreign-funded insurance firm.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC)
said that the country has allowed 15 insurance companies from the
United States, Britain, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, Germany,
France, and Australia to enter its insurance market.
</P>
<P>
And a total of 111 insurance institutions from 17 countries and
regions have set up 196 representative offices in China.
</P>
<P>
Insurance is one of the fastest-growing sectors since China
kicked off the reform and opening-up drive in 1979.
Experimentation with the insurance business started in Shanghai in
1992 in a bid to draw advanced technology and experience from
overseas insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, foreign-funded insurance companies in China
had 4.4 billion yuan in total assets, accounting for 1.7 percent
of the total of the country's insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
And their insurance revenues reached 1.82 billion yuan last
year, representing 1.3 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
CIRC noted that the widening of the insurance market is still
in a trial stage; on one hand, the industry will continue to open
up in an effort to spur its development, and on the other, the
country will ensure the healthy development of its own insurance
business in accordance with the competitiveness of the industry
and the market demand.

<HEADLINE> mee051905hke-- Abu Dis Could Be Palestinian by Sunday: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel will try to complete the
handover of Abu Dis and two other Arab villages near Jerusalem to
full Palestinian control before Prime Minister Ehud Barak leaves
for a U.S. visit on Sunday, the Israeli daily Ha'aretz reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak's plan to transfer the three villages, Abu Dis, Azariya
and Swahara, now under Israeli security control and Palestinian
civilian control to full Palestinian control, managed to win the
cabinet's approval and parliamentary endorsement on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The move, dubbed an "advance payment" ahead of the third and
final West Bank redeployment set for June, was also intended as a
confidence-building step to boost the stagnant negotiations aimed
at reaching a framework agreement for the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
The handover, however, was not immediately implemented as Barak
called Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to take measures to restore
order in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which witnessed the worst
violence in years.
</P>
<P>
But Barak intends to handover the villages before he heads for
Washington on Sunday night for what was a decisive meeting with U.
S. President Bill Clinton on the peace process with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz quoted a U.S. source as saying that Clinton is hoping
to seal an Israeli-Palestinian framework peace agreement before the
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in early July and will seek "
far-reaching" concessions from Barak on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The handover decision, though endorsed at both the cabinet and
parliament, has met strong opposition from the right-wing factions
in Israel. On Monday night, a rally of 70,000 people was held at
the Zion Square in downtown Jerusalem in protest against the
handover of the three villages to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
A recent on-line poll conducted by another Israeli daily the
Jerusalem Post showed an overwhelming majority of 74 percent of the
respondents opposed to the handover of the villages. Only 26
percent of the 4,732 people polled voiced backing for the decision.
</P>
<P>
Whether Barak can make the trip to Washington itself is now in
question as reports say that he wants to cancel the trip due to
worsening security in south Lebanon and the territories in the West
Bank and Gaza. He put off the trip by one day on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fighting in south Lebanon on Thursday left three Israeli
soldiers, three soldiers from South Lebanon Army, one U.N.
peacekeeper and three Lebanese civilians wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, angry over the slow pace of the release of
prisoners jailed in Israeli prisons, are prepared to stage mass
demonstrations in West Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- International Monetary Fund (IMF) Turkey desk chief
Carlo Cottarelli said that Turkey's economic performance in the
first quarter this year is satisfactory, reported the Anatolia News
Agency on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cottarelli, now in Ankara on a fact-finding mission, said a 25
percent year-end consumer inflation target will be achievable if
inflation remains at the current trend, adding that April's
inflation was the lowest in 13 years.
</P>
<P>
IMF executive directors in Washington are expected to review the
mission report and Turkey's supplementary letter of intent in July,
to decide whether the Fund will release the third batch of a 4
billion U.S. dollar stand-by loan.
</P>
<P>
On December 22, 1999, IMF executive directors approved a three-
year stand-by deal with Turkey designed to back the government's
disinflation program to lower inflation to 20-25 percent by the end
of 2000 and into single figures by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Anadolu Efes, a merger of four Turkish brewery
companies, will create Turkey's biggest brewer with an 80 percent
market and boost Turkey's competence in world markets, reported
Turkish Daily news on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the four companies to the Istanbul
Stock Exchange Thursday, Anadolu Efes will be running five brewing
and two malt factories in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Its international subsidiary Efes Sinai Yatirim Holding A.S.
will manage the group's Coca-Cola operations in the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) and Efes Breweries International will
remain in charge of brewing operations in the CIS and Romania.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish electronic company Eltem Elektrik A.S. has
been awarded 62.2-million-U.S.-dollar worth of contracts to restore
Turkmenistan's national grid, reported Turkish Daily News on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first 59-million-dollar-worth two contracts entail the
erection and restoration of an energy distribution system in
Turkmenistan, along with a connected system that will transmit
electricity to Turkey in the future.
</P>
<P>
Under another 3.22-million-dollar contract, Eltem will purchase
and assemble high-voltage substation centers and electro-technical
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Eltem, based in Istanbul, was founded in 1984 to provide
services and products in the electrical engineering field.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman and Iran have agreed to promote bilateral trade
and economic cooperation, reported the Arabic daily Al-Haiyat on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of a three-day meeting of the Joint
Commission's 7th Session, the two sides agreed on establishing an
Omani Trade Representation Bureau in Iran's Bandar Abbas to be
followed by an Iranian Bureau in Muscat in a bid to further and
activate trade exchanges between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Omani Minister of Commerce and Industry Maqbool Bin Sultan
expressed the hope that the move would be conducive to promoting
Oman's exports to Central Asian countries via the railway lines
linking Iran to this region, the report added.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Amin Samir Fahmi said
his ministry is considering international bids to export Egypt's
natural gas to promising non-traditional markets, including Spain,
Portugal, Greece, Italy, France and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He told a symposium on gas, organized by the Egyptian Gas
Association, on Wednesday that the latest findings proved that
Egypt holds a verified natural gas reserve of 43 trillion cubic
feet and a potential reserve of 77 trillion cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
And such a big reservoir covers Egypt's current and future
demands for fuel, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Egypt's gas exports to Europe, Petero Kafana, chairman of the
Italian-Egyptian Foundation, said Europe's gas demand will rise
from the present 87 billion cubic feet per year to 503 billion
cubic feet annually in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian gas is one of the best alternatives for Europe's future
needs of gas since it is close to European markets, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian Social Fund has helped create about 7,000
jobs by financing a number of development projects in Southern
Sinai, northeastern Egypt, with 24 million Egyptian pounds (about
6.9 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fund is expected to finance several other schemes including
an animal husbandry project with 6.4 million pounds (1.8 million
dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's judicial institutions
gained independence on Friday when key laws concerning the
separation of local courts from the Justice Ministry took effect.
</P>
<P>
Thai Justice Minister Suthas Ngernmuen was quoted by Thailand
News Agency as saying that the laws became effective Friday after
they were recorded in the Royal Gazette on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With the separation, the justice minister will no longer have a
mandate to supervise judicial institutions, including all courts.
Instead, they will be under the supervision of the president of
the Supreme Court, he said.
</P>
<P>
All courts will be under a newly-established body, the office
of judicial institutions, as of Friday, Suthas said.
</P>
<P>
Other departments, including the legal execution department,
the probation department and juvenile observation and protection
centers will still be under the Justice Ministry, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Continue Falling, Nikkei Hits Year's Closing Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices continued falling in
Tokyo Friday, led by weakness in high-priced information and
technology issues, with the benchmark Nikkei index closing at the
lowest level for the year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 173.46 points, or 1.02
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 16,858.17.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 27.77 points, or 1.73 percent, to 1,
578.37.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section increased to 670.22 million
shares from Thursday's 638.80 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Electric was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Low-and medium-priced issues drew buying, but information and
high-tech issues faced selling after New York's NASDAQ composite
index closed sharply lower Thursday, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Brokerage houses were the biggest losers, plunging 8.22 percent
as a group, reflecting the recent weakness in share prices.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale, consumer finance and drug issues also saw declines,
while food, paper and steel issues drew buying.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers narrowly
outnumbered losers 627 to 619 despite the falls in the Nikkei and
TOPIX, with 147 issues closing unchanged.

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- In a few weeks, 22-year-old Andan
will give birth to her eighth baby, setting a record as the most
prolific giraffe in a Chinese zoo.
</P>
<P>
These days, she stands quietly in front of her house at Taiyuan
Zoo in north China's Shanxi Province, eyeing zoo-goers with the
unblinking gaze of a female who has been pregnant for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
Liu Liming, one of Andan's caretakers, said the giraffe is due
in early June. A giraffe pregnancy usually lasts 14 to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists have worked out a health regimine for Andan, who in
addition to her daily meal of tree leaves must consume fruit and
vegetables for breakfast and supper. At noon, she gets millet
porridge and milk. She also takes calcium, iron and Vitamin E
supplements every day.
</P>
<P>
Before her delivery, Andan's cage will be carpeted with thick
straw, as giraffes give birth standing up.
</P>
<P>
The zoo will also form a special medical team to watch her
round-the-clock.
</P>
<P>
Andan was born at the Beijing Zoo in 1978 and was moved to
Taiyuan Zoo in 1981. Since 1983 she has had two sons and five
daughters.

<HEADLINE> Space Breeding Expected to Help Improve Chinese Agriculture (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's space and agriculture
departments are considering launching a satellite specially
designed for seed-breeding in space.
</P>
<P>
Industry insiders said this will be the world's first satellite
used solely for seed-breeding.
</P>
<P>
As part of its massive efforts to modernize agriculture, China
has been accelerating research and application of space seed-
breeding techniques, aiming to raise both the yields and quality
of crops by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
"Space seed-breeding is expected to become a strong driving
force behind Chinese agriculture in the 21st century since it can
bring about high-yield and high-quality crops that are hard for
ordinary breeding methods to obtain," said Liu Luxiang, director
of the Aerospace Breeding Center under the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Under the innovative process, seeds are sent into space in
recoverable space vehicles or high-altitude balloons, where they
then mutate in space conditions that feature micro-gravity and
cosmic radiation.
</P>
<P>
Back on earth, the seeds are planted and used for breeding fine
strains that are disease-resistant, early-maturing, high-quality
and high-yield.
</P>
<P>
China, the only country to apply the new agrotechnique to
agricultural production, has already sent more than 70 varieties
of crop seeds, including those of rice, cotton, oil, vegetables
and fruit, into space on 13 occasions since 1987, producing a
large number of fine strains.
</P>
<P>
Comparative figures show that the per-unit yields of rice
strains which are grown from space-mutated seeds are 10 to 20
percent higher than ordinary seeds.
</P>
<P>
Space-bred seeds have also produced tomatoes as heavy as 800
grams each and bell-peppers weighing 750 grams each, five times as
heavy as the ordinary average.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, the quality of space-derived crops has been
significantly improved, with the vitamin content of bell-peppers
rising 20 to 25 percent, according to Liu.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Industrial Base for Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China has targeted the northeast as
the site of its second sci-tech industrial base to intensify
research of traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Province, home to one-third of China's traditional
medicine resources, will become the second center for development
of the herbal medicine, following southwest China's Sichuan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The new base expects to score an annual output value of 12
billion yuan (about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars) and turn in 2.4
billion yuan (about 289 million U.S. dollars) in tax by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shuying, vice-governor of Jilin Province and a chemist,
said that the base will contribute to the growth of the province's
developing biological and environmental friendly economy in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Modern scientific theory and technologies will be applied to
study, develop and produce traditional Chinese medicine.
</P>
<P>
Mount Changbai, in east Jilin, Mount Emei in Sichuan, and
Xishuangbanna in southwest China's Yunnan Province, are known as
China's three banks of natural medicinal resources.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized development of traditional Chinese medicine
brought Jilin Province 770 million yuan (about 92.8 million U.S.
dollars) in tax last year.
</P>
<P>
The annual output value of Chinese medicine production is
estimated to represent 10 percent of the gross national product of
Jilin in 2010.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, Chinese have used mixtures of plants
and animal bones to cure diseases with a success rate that
continues to baffle modern science.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jubin, a doctor prescribing traditional Chinese medicine
in Hebei Province surrounding Beijing, said that traditional
Chinese medicine has played an important role in preventing and
curing influenza, an illness which used to be common in Europe and
the Americas.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have found
more than 70 ancient tombs which can be dated back to the Western
Zhou Dynasty (C.1100-771 B.C.) and the Warring States Period (475-
221 B.C.) in the urban area of Zhengzhou, capital of Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
An archaeologist commented that the tomb site was used as an
ancient graveyard for a noble family in the period. There are a
dozen tombs of a noble family with coffins buried in large square
pits and 50 tombs of commoners in small simple pits.
</P>
<P>
The archaeologists also unearthed over 10 historical relics
from the tombs, including shell ornaments, bronze weapons and
ceremonial articles.
</P>
<P>
The tombs and relics, the first of their kind in the province,
will provide valuable clues for archaeological research on the
history and culture of the Western Zhou Dynasty.

To date, rice and vegetable seeds bred in space have been
planted on about 66,660 ha in China. Some 40,000 ha more will be
added this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that space seeds are easy to plant because they have
no special growing requirements.
</P>
<P>
Li Jinguo, an associate research fellow with the Institute of
Genetics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, ruled out the
possibility that farm produce grown from space-bred seeds may be
hazardous to human health. He stressed that space crops undergo a
mutation of their own genes, without involving any gene from other
species.
</P>
<P>
Tests also indicate that no radioactive substances have been
found in the seeds.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Agriculture said that China
must make use of various high and new technologies to breed both
high-quality and high-yield crops to feed its growing population.
</P>
<P>
High-quality farm produce is still in short supply in China,
although the country no longer has a shortage of grain. It is
predicted that by 2030, nationwide demand for agricultural produce
will have increased more than 30 percent from the present level.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Prisons Safe &AMP; Stable: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China has seen successive sharp
drops in the number of escapees from and crimes committed inside
prisons and education-through-labor camps in the past three years,
Justice Minister Gao Changli said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Chinese prisons and jails are safe and stable thanks to the
great professional vigilance of wardens and their political
awareness," he said at a ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Especially last year when the nation experienced a great number
of major events and encountered many unstable factors, wardens
have worked to maintain the safety and stability of prisons and
education-through-labor camps, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Those in custody at these camps are mainly minor offenders who
committed offenses but are exempt from prosecution because of
their young age or those who have yet to be sentenced.
</P>
<P>
There are 1.4 million inmates serving terms in prisons across
the country and another 300,000 held in education-through-labor
camps.
</P>
<P>
"Providing effective education and reforming them are an
important task for the central authorities" Gao said, stressing
that the justice departments must take all necessary measures to
prevent incidents in prisons.
</P>
<P>
"Any incidents or possible breakouts must be nipped in the bud,
" he said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Security Forces Braces for More Palestinian Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Israel has beefed up its security
since Friday morning in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in preparation
for more mass Palestinian demonstrations planned for Friday and
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian demonstrations are being called to demand the
release of all security Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials called on Thursday the Palestinian public
to participate in the demonstrations, dubbed the "days of rage,"
but asked the demonstrators to refrain from using live ammunition
and act with restraint.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Force (IDF) and border police have been
deployed in areas considered "trouble spots," such as road
junctions near the West Bank cities of Ramallah, Bethlehem and
Nablus.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians began mass demonstrations last Friday in the
territories to demand the release of Palestinian prisoners from
Israel jails.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes erupted on Monday between Palestinian police and
IDF, leaving at least six Palestinians dead and hundreds of others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
For the past few days, the IDF has arrested 22 Palestinians,
accusing them of shootings on IDF and border police and throwing
firebombs and stones.
</P>
<P>
Releasing more Palestinian prisoners is one of the sensitive
interim issues the two sides have to settle. The Palestinian side
said that over 1,600 Palestinian prisoners are still being held in
various Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators held several rounds of talks
recently to discuss this issue and no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side suspended the talks over the prisoner
issue, wanting an answer from the Israeli side to its request to
release 230-300 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
But Israel rejected this demand, saying it will not release
these prisoners with "blood on their hands."

JERUSALEM, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians are stopping all interim agreement talks
until Israel agrees to release a group of security prisoners,
according to Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian source said the Palestinian National Authority
wants an answer from Israel to its request to release 230-300
prisoners, most from Fatah, a political faction of Palestine
Liberation Organization led by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Israeli Prime Minister's Office rejected the
demand, saying that for it to take place, the criteria for
releases, set by the security cabinet, will have to change and this
is not possible.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants to cancel his planned
visit to the United States next week, because of worsening security
in Lebanon and the territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said earlier that U.S. President Bill Clinton
was hoping to seal an Israeli-Palestinian framework peace agreement
before Israel withdraws from Lebanon and would seek "far-reaching"
concessions from Barak on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Barak was slated to leave Sunday night, a one-day postponement
from original schedule, for what was expected to be a decisive
meeting with Clinton on the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli security forces have beefed up their presence in
Judea, Samaria (the West Bank) and Gaza in preparation for mass
Palestinian demonstrations planned for Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The protests are being called to press for the release of all
security prisoners from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and Border Police Forces have
been deployed in areas considered "trouble spots". In recent days,
the IDF has arrested 22 Palestinians involved in violence.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians on Thursday called on the public to participate in
mass demonstrations, dubbed the "Days of Anger," but asked
demonstrators to refrain from using live ammunition and act with
restraint.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Three Israeli Defense Force soldiers were wounded on
Thursday, in South Lebanon, two of them seriously, in heavy
Hezbollah shelling of outposts across the security zone to north
Israel. Shell also fell inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
Three soldiers from the South Lebanon Army, a U.N. peace keeper
and three Lebanese civilians were also wounded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army is scheduled to complete most of its
preparations for the withdrawal by June 1. Senior officials said
the withdrawal could take place as soon as a week or two after
that.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, however, is sticking by his
position that there is no reason for a significant change in the
timetable. He insists on withdrawing the forces in accordance with
the U.N. Resolution 425.

Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has promised to continue to help
Tanzania to develop areas, where numerous international refugee
camps are located.
</P>

These helps would be geared to translate the concept of burden

<HEADLINE> WHO to Hold Hearings on Tobacco Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
will hold public hearings on October 12-13 in Geneva on tobacco
control, according to a WHO press release.
</P>
<P>
"This is an historic opportunity for everyone, including those
in the tobacco industry, to present their views on a major public
health issue that is of great concern to us," WHO Director-General
Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
WHO statistics show that tobacco currently kills 4 million
people annually. By 2030, that toll will rise to 10 million deaths
per year with the developing world accounting for over 70 percent
of those deaths.
</P>
<P>
WHO has identified global tobacco control as a priority for the
world's leading public health agency. The multi-sectoral Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the world's first public
health convention, is expected to be open for signature in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The hearings come just two days before the start of formal
negotiations, the parameters of which were set forth in a
resolution adopted by consensus by the World Health Assembly in
1999.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in its 51-year history that the WHO's
Member States have embarked on the negotiation of a convention.
The hearings are also a first in WHO's history and are widely seen
as an opportunity for the tobacco industry to make its own views
known before the international public health community.
</P>
<P>
"Today we invite all interested parties to send in their views
on global tobacco control This is an open invitation and we will
listen carefully," said WHO Executive Director Dr Derek Yach, who
heads WHO's tobacco control program, the Tobacco Free Initiative (
TFI).

<HEADLINE> Abandoned Golden Monkey Seeks Company of Human Beings (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- An abandoned golden monkey living
in the Laojun Mountain Nature Reserve of Yunnan province for the
past three years has befriended local tourists and bonded with a
tractor.
</P>
<P>
Animal experts said they are surprised by the bold streak in
the golden monkey, a generally timid species.
</P>
<P>
This golden monkey romps around tourists and eats fruit they
toss to him. At night, he sleeps next to a tractor used by a local
hotel to haul firewood.
</P>
<P>
Every morning, he follows the tractor as it heads into the
dense forest for wood, and stays at its side at night. The tractor
driver said that he has been attacked by the monkey several times
when starting up the vehicle to generate electricity in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan golden monkey is under top state protection and is
included on the world list of endangered species. Like the giant
panda, the golden monkey is considered a state treasure in China.
</P>
<P>
A French clergyman found a golden monkey on a snow mountain-
surrounded Deqin County in 1890, providing the first known record
of the species.
</P>
<P>
No more traces of the golden monkey were reported for the next
70 years until 1962, when a group of Chinese scientists discovered
eight golden monkey carcasses in Deqin County. The first photo of
the golden monkey was taken by Xi Zhinong in the county in 1992. (

<P>
Chinese zoologists who have gone to the Laojun Mountain Nature
Reserve to observe the activities of this golden monkey theorized
that the six-year-old male was abandoned by his family when he
became sexually mature.
</P>
<P>
They suspect he grew so lonely in the quiet primeval forest he
sought the attention of humans and machinery.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan golden monkeys mainly inhabit the mountainous area, 3,
800 to 4,700 meters above the sea level, between the Lancang and
Jinsha rivers in the province.
</P>
<P>
The number of such golden monkeys has increased to more than 1,
500 thanks to the efforts in building nature reserves, anti-
poaching campaigns, and logging prohibition since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
About 60 golden monkeys live in the Laojun Mountain region.

<HEADLINE> First Foreign Suspect Arrested by China's Anti-Smuggling Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's anti-smuggling police
arrested a foreigner suspected of smuggling in China recently.
</P>
<P>
Lee Jen Won, a 44-year-old businessman from the Republic of
Korea (ROK) whose passport number is YP0076690, has become the
first foreign suspect arrested by China's anti-smuggling police
force since it was formed on January 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Lee was suspected of smuggling leather into China and tax
evasion worth 166,300 U.S. dollars. He has already been sued by
the Shenyang Procuratorate at the Intermediate People's Court of
Shenyang in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
On March 18, 1999, anti-smuggling police in Shenyang discovered,
with the help of staff members from local customs that three trade
handbooks on processing business of Lee's leather company were not
canceled upon expiration. Such trade handbooks are used for
supervising bonded cargoes.
</P>
<P>
The police found the workshop at Lee's company was empty when
they started to do further investigations. Police noticed torn
pages from the handbooks among piles of garbage in the workshop.
They salvaged a dozen sacks of the scrap paper and use them to
piece together evidence.
</P>
<P>
The General Administration of Customs (GAC) and the Liaoning
Provincial People's Government held a meeting Tuesday praising the
efforts of the police involved for combating smuggling activities
among foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The Smuggling Cases Investigation Bureau under the GAC was
established to combat the increasingly number of smuggling cases.
The special task force is authorized to investigate smuggling
cases, arrest suspects and conduct preliminary hearings.

BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing hospital has reported
success with its first heart valve replacement-kidney transplant
operation performed recently.
</P>
<P>
According to the overseas edition of People's Daily today, the
Beijing Anzhen Hospital, known for its pioneering in
cardiovascular surgery, completed China's first double operation
of the kind on March 3.
</P>
<P>
The patient, 28-year-old Yan Xiangguo, a farmer from north
China's Hebei Province, suffered from serious kidney and heart
damage and was bed-ridden.
</P>
<P>
Doctors worried that Yan, who had an enlarged left ventricle
and failing kidneys, would not survive two separate operations,
and decided to perform the surgeries one after the other.
</P>
<P>
A team of cardiovascular surgeons and urologists performed the
5 hour, 50 minute operation.
</P>
<P>
Yan's body resisted infection and has not rejected the new
kidney. He was discharged from the hospital two weeks after the
operation.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Armed Men Stage Coup in Fiji, Seize PM  By Qi Zijian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Armed men Friday staged a dramatic
coup in Fiji, storming parliament, seizing Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry and his cabinet, and declaring a new government.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the armed men walked into the main chamber of
the parliament building, where the parliament session is held,
fired warning shots, and told the speaker of the house that they
were taking over the government.
</P>
<P>
Fiji's third coup in 13 years was led by Fijian businessman
George Speight, son of an opposition MP, who released a statement
claiming he had taken control of the island nation on behalf of
indigenous Fijians.
</P>
<P>
The Fijilive.com website later reported that Speight has named
Fijian Association Party MP Ratu Timoci Silatolu as Fiji's interim
prime minister and Ratu Rakuita Vakalalabure as home affairs
minister.
</P>
<P>
Sitiveni Rabuka, Fiji's former prime minister, was reported to
have negotiated with Speight on the hostage crisis at the
parliament building and was having meeting with the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka led a coup in 1987, and had in recent years spearheaded
political reforms that led to the election of the Chaudhry
government.
</P>
<P>
The coup came on the first anniversary of the election of
Chaudhry, who Fijian nationalists have accused of promoting pro-
Indian policies.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary was marked by a pro-nationalist march by
indigenous Fijians through the streets of the capital Suva,
calling for an end to the year-old government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mobs of youths began rampaging through Suva's
streets and looting businesses, many of which are owned by Fiji's
ethnic Indian community.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Fijians who took part in an anti-government march
through Suva gathered outside the gates of the parliament building,
chanting anti-government slogans as the gunmen held MPs hostage
inside.
</P>
<P>
A Fiji radio reporter said the gunmen had set free opposition
MPs but had refused to release at least one government MP who had
complained of being ill.
</P>
<P>
Fiji TV reported people were fleeing Suva and many of the
protesters were throwing stones and attacking people.
</P>
<P>
The Fijilive website also reported shops in Suva were on fire
and large clouds of smoke were rising over the city.
</P>
<P>
Coup leader Speight is the American-educated former chairman of
Fiji Pine Ltd and Fiji Hardwood Corporation Ltd and had worked in
Australia for several years as an insurance broker.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the people of Fiji, Speight said he had
revoked the constitution and the powers of the president.
</P>
<P>
"We have executed a civil coup on behalf of the indigenous
people of Fiji," he said. "That civil coup has resulted in the
overthrow of the Labor-led coalition government in Fiji."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to announce that Fiji is currently under civilian
rule, with the assistance of armed forces, who are passive but
will remain at the beck and call and the control of the civilian
government that is in place at this time and is headed by myself,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Tension has been building for months in Fiji between minority
ethnic Indians, who make up about 44 percent of the island nation'
s 813,000 people, and the majority Fijians, who account for 51
percent.
</P>
<P>
Since last year's election, there has been a groundswell of
Fijian nationalist opposition to Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
Criticism centered mainly on attempts by Chaudhry, who is of
Indian descent, to persuade Fijian landowners to renew expiring
leases on farm land held by thousands of ethnic Indian tenants who
are the core of his political support.
</P>
<P>
On April 28, several thousand people rallied against the
Chaudhry government in a march organized by opposition politicians
of the former ruling Fijian Political Party, which Chaudhry's
Labor Party defeated in a May 1999 general election under a new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Chaudhry's government allowed the protest to proceed.
</P>
<P>
But earlier this month, Chaudhry's government banned protest
marches, saying police had warned they might not be able to cope
with large-scale protest marches.
</P>
<P>
All phone lines into Fiji appeared to have been cut, as they
were following the 1987 coups.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of Australia had
warned Australians in Suva to remain indoors until the situation
became clearer.
</P>
<P>
While there was no evidence there was any danger to Australians
in the Pacific Island country, those in Suva should stay in their
homes and away from the parliament building where the prime
minister and government members were being held, a spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer's
office said the Australian consulate was moving to inform
Australians in Fiji of the situation.

<HEADLINE> hke051935--Backgrounder: Plan to Oust Fiji PM Simmers for Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The coup in Fiji on Friday seems
to have been in the wind for months.
</P>
<P>
Rumors about plans by dissident ethnic Fijians to oust the year-
old Labor-led government headed by Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's first
Indian prime minister, have been persistent.
</P>
<P>
Only on last Thursday, a joint statement by Fijian political
parties vowed to continue a program of civil protests until it
achieved its objective of removing both the government and the
constitution under which the government was elected.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the protests, including a scheduled march by
thousands of "discontented and angry" people through Suva Friday,
would be peaceful and orderly.
</P>
<P>
"No right-thinking Fijian will allow this government, which has
been manifestly anti-Fijian in both direction and intent, to
continue to violate the desires and the aspirations of the
indigenous Fijian people and to understand the little guarantees
left to them," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
A petition to President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara was drawn up by
the Fijian political parties - the Nationalist Vanua Tako Lavo,
SVT, Fijian Association, Taukei Movement and the VLVP.
</P>
<P>
The Fiji Review, a monthly news magazine, anticipated action
against Chaudhry in its current edition, in a cover story
headlined "Operation Chaos."
</P>
<P>
The story said in part: "Since Chaudhry became PM, many
underground groups have been working on ways to oust the
government."
</P>
<P>
"Some have even devised plans to bring it to its knees," the
story said.
</P>
<P>
An article by the Fiji Review Deputy Editor Tamarisi Digitaki
said Chaudhry's nemesis would be "a certain group of elite Fijians
" fronted by one-time union leader and cabinet minister Apisai
Tora.
</P>
<P>
Political observers quoted by Digitaki said Tora was backed by
"a powerful group of people who are hellbent on removing Mr.
Chaudhry as PM."
</P>
<P>
The Chaudhry government was also under fire over its regulation
of the prices of consumer goods and the banking sector, and has
come under fire from the civil service, some sections of the
business community and the media.
</P>
<P>
"Chaudhry has ruffled quite a few feathers in the business
community in the past 12 months," the Fiji Review said.
</P>
<P>
"And while his policies have been aimed at redistributing
wealth from the rich to the poor, there are nonetheless many
business people who would be more than happy to see his government
go under," the magazine said.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Kenya Army helicopter crashed on
Thursday in a joint military exercise at the Indian Ocean port of
Mombasa, injuring three Kenyan soldiers and one U.S. marine.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said the accident was caused by engine
failure, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter crashed into a swamp as the mechanical failure
was forcing the pilot to seek a "soft landing".
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were on their way to north Malindi, where Kenyan,
Ugandan and Tanzanian forces are taking part in a joint military
exercise dubbed Natural Fire 2000, which started on April 21 and
ends on May 27.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has dismissed as
groundless an allegation by the United States government saying
that the transportation of relief food was disrupted due to its
war against Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
A government statement, available here on Friday, said that the
country is currently using 65 percent of its transporting capacity
to ship relief food to areas affected by the prevailing drought.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,687 tons of relief food, with an average of over 526
tons every day, has been transported from Djibouti to the
country's drought-hit areas since May 12, when the Ethio-Eritrean
border conflict resumed.
</P>
<P>
At the current speed, some 15,000 tons of relief food could be
sent to the needy on a monthly basis, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The document also said that the Ministry of Transportation and
Communication has established a national committee to coordinate
the transportation of relief food on 24-hour basis.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Armed Forces Back Government: Military Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the armed forces of
Paraguay on Friday vowed support for the government after the
rebel staged a coup attempt overnight Thursday, according to a
report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"We are keeping the whole army together, we can't allow
rebellions at moments of difficulty. Long live the republic of
Paraguay," Admiral Jose Ramon Ocampos, head of Paraguay's joint
chiefs of staff, said on local television.
</P>
<P>
The government has declared a 30-day state of emergency, which
would allow arrests without warrants, the local television
reported.
</P>
<P>
President Luis Gonzalez Macci made an urgent appeal on radio
for all Paraguayans to defend the government after a coup attempt
on Thursday night by the army rebels, who have so far taken over a
barracks and kept firing on the country's Congress building from
armored vehicles, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Heavy artillery shelling was heard and armored personnel
carriers were seen in the streets of the capital.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Ready to Deliver for Semifinals Against Denmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesians are ready to
deliver for their customary place in Sunday's Thomas Cup finals
when the defending champions take on Denmark on Friday night at
the Putra Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, who are seeking for the fourth consecutive and 12th
overall Thomas Cup title, showed their forms in Tuesday's 4-1
victory over China and are ready for the semis. Now with China
storming into the finals with 3-1 win over South Korea Thursday
night, Indonesia are the favorites to set up an Indonesia-China
clash again in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
On local papers, that seems to be a certainty and the feeling
is that all Denmark can hope to achieve tonight is to make it as
difficult as possible for Indonesia. After all, except for the
first singles, Indonesia have the edge in all the other ties and
given their passion for the Thomas Cup, Denmark don't seem to
stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
"The Thomas Cup is what matters to us and the players are ready
to deliver," said Indonesian assistant team manager Hadi Nazri on
Thursday. "I'm confident that if they play as they have in the
previous matches, we will easily beat Denmark."
</P>
<P>
The players have not been promised any rewards but Hadi said
this doesn't matter to them. "The Thomas Cup is very important to
Indonesians and the players will fight till the end to retain the
Cup," Nazri said.
</P>
<P>
Denmark are hoping to turn the tide, resting their best hope of
upset on the second singles between Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, men's
singles gold winner of the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, and
Taufik Hidayat, only 19 but already two-time finalist of the All-
England Open.
</P>
<P>
World No.1 Peter Gade Christensen has been at his best and
should give the European champions a winning start against
Hendrawan, but Candra Wijaya and Tony Gunawan would make it 1-1
against Martin Lungaard and Lars Paaske in the doubles.
</P>
<P>
The cruncher of the third match will decide whether it will be
an easy win for Indonesia or one that goes to the wire. Hoyer-
Larsen hasn't looked very comfortable but Denmark will be hoping
his experience and Taufik's nervousness will pave the way for a
Danish win.
</P>
<P>
The second doubles, given the form of Jens Eriksen and Jesper
Larsen, will be a close affair and Indonesia may opt to rest Rexy
Mainaky and partner Ricky Subagja with Sigit Budiarto. If Denmark
don't seal the tie here, it will pave the way for either Kenneth
Jonassen or Marieve Mainaky, or maybe former world champion
Hariyanto Arbi, to emerge hero and villain.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia are the favorites and there is the possibility of
Denmark stealing the tie.
</P>
<P>
But are the Danes up to it?

SHIJIAZHUANG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists recently
unearthed 48 tons of iron coins dating back 900 years in the
northern province of Hebei
</P>
<P>
Experts hailed the find as a breakthrough because they had
never before discovered iron coins in north China. Before this,
historians believed that iron coins were only used south of the
Yangtze River, where commerce flourished.
</P>
<P>
The coins, made during the North Song Dynasty (10th-12th
century), were found in Cangzhou city by a local tourism
department. Also at the site were some molds and stoves that
suggest the existence of a mint.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the discovery will re-write China's history of coin
production.

<HEADLINE> Australian Donation Helps Eliminate Iodine Deficiency in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government has donated
two million Australian dollars to the Tibetan Autonomous Region to
help control the problem of iodine deficiency.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony Thursday in Lhasa, Garry Nehl, vice speaker of
the Australian House of Representatives, presented the gift,
saying that the Tibetan Autonomous Region has made remarkable
progress in public health care, citing the fact that the average
life expectancy of local people has raised to 65 years from 36
years in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
He said that a healthy body and a sound mind are the most basic
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-minister of Health Yin Dakui said that the general
intelligence level of children in areas where iodine is nearly
absent was 10 to 15 percentage points lower than in areas with
adequate supply of iodine. He added that improving the quality of
life of a population will help promote sustained economic and
social development, and the ongoing work to wipe out iodine
deficiency will help to make that happen.
</P>
<P>
A recent study shows that the majority of China's provinces and
autonomous regions have basically eliminated the problem of iodine
deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is one of six areas in the world where iodine is nearly
non-existent in people's daily diet. The Tibetan Autonomous
Regional government has made efforts to reverse the situation by
providing iodine supplements and iodine-added salt for its people.

BANGKOK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Concerned about further interest
rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Thai government
has ordered institutions to study the impact of the recent U.S.
rate hikes and U.S.economic development on the country.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Wheat Output to Exceed Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The latest official figure of
Pakistan has put the overall wheat production at about 21.14
million tons throughout the country against a target of 20 million
tons set by the government for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to available official figures, Punjab has produced 16.
3 million tons, Sindh 2.85 million tons, Balochistan 763,000 tons,
and Northwest Frontier Province 1.22 million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, officials said wheat output may exceed 21.7 million
tons, according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
After 17 years Pakistan is expected to save an average of at
least 400 million U.S. dollars in foreign exchange for importing
wheat.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan exported 50,000 tons of wheat to Iran in 1983 and
since then it has been depending on low-quality imported wheat to
meet its food requirements chiefly due to the smuggling of this
food item to Afghanistan and lack of incentives to growers.
Pakistan's wheat output last year was 17.8 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented wheat production is attributed to the timely
rain early this year and the government's incentives that have
encouraged farmers to grow wheat on 73 percent of the area under
cultivation.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sees High Economic Growth in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew
strongly by 9.1 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2000
and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has raised the
official forecast for the country's economy in 2000 from 4.5-6.5
percent to 5.5-7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
MTI Permanent Secretary Khaw Boon Wan told a press conference
Friday that the underlying growth momentum of his country's
economy remained robust compared with the 7.1-percent increase in
the last quarter of 1999 although this partly reflected the low
base in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to an MTI economic survey released at the conference,
the growth in the first quarter was propelled by the robust
expansions in all sectors, notably in the manufacturing and
wholesale and retail trade sectors which expanded by 13 percent
and 17 percent respectively during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
However the construction sector is an exception, continuing to
contract by 11 percent although at a more moderate pace compared
with the 12-percent fall in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector saw an expansion on a broad spectrum
of industries except for the transport equipment and petroleum
industries, with the semiconductors and telecommunication products
contributing to the strong 22-percent growth in the electronics
industry and pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals mainly
contributing to the 22-percent growth in the chemical industry.
</P>
<P>
The financial service sector reversed a 6.2-percent contraction
in the previous quarter to grow by 6.9 percent in the first
quarter and other sectors of the business services, hotels and
restaurants, and transport and communications also clinched a
growth rate from 4.8 percent to 9.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
External trade enjoyed the strongest growth among all economic
sectors in the first quarter, expanding by 24 percent with all of
the total export and import volumes increasing by 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the labor market saw continued employment gains
in the first quarter with overall employment rising by 13,000
persons.
</P>
<P>
However, the quarter also saw 6,000 workers retrenched, up
from the 4,475 in the previous quarter and the unemployment rate
went up to 3.4 percent in March 2000 from 2.9 percent in December
1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that Singapore attracted a total of 2
billion Singapore dollars (1.18 billion U.S. dollars) in
manufacturing investment commitments and 393 million Singapore
dollars (231.18 million U.S. dollars) in services investment
commitments.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed Singapore's robust economic expansion in
the first quarter to a healthy economic environment and a 16-
percent surge in external demand for Singapore's goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the growth in total domestic demand
moderated to 9.3 percent in the first quarter compared with 14
percent three months earlier.
</P>
<P>
The survey holds that the positive developments in the current
generally-bright global economy would sustain growth for Singapore
's various sectors in 2000 but the sustainability of growth in the
United States posts the main threat to the growth of the Singapore
economy.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Face Huge Damage in Severe Quake: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Experts in the country rated Dhaka as
one of the 20 major earthquake-prone cities in the world and
warned that there would be a complete catastrophe if a severe
quake should hit it,the newspaper The Observer reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Workshop on Earthquake-2000 here
Thursday,the experts said Dhaka would face severe calamity due
mainly to its vulnerability and poor emergency response and
recovery capability.
</P>
<P>
In view of the seismic risks in different parts of the country,
they suggested paying more attention and making preparations to
minimize the aftereffects of any earthquake, particularly in the
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Citing the possible outcome of any earthquake, the experts said
most of the structures including hospital will collapse,fire will
break out, incidents like power disruption, communication
disruption and gas leakage can take place and there could be huge
tidal surge.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the workshop jointly organized by the Ministry of
Disaster Management and Relief and Disaster Management Bureau,
Prof. Jamilur Reza Chowdhury said the low incidence of severe
earthquakes during the past century had led to a situation where
most of the population and some of the policymakers did not
perceive seismic risks to be important.
</P>
<P>
Azizul Haque, a prominent expert in the country, expressed
concern over the outcome of any earthquake, saying that as most of
the buildings in the big cities particularly in the capital were
not constructed according to the National Building Code, there
would be a huge loss and damage if any big earthquake hits the
cities.

<HEADLINE> China's Most Populous Province to Have 103 Million People in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's most heavily populated
province of Henan will work to control its population to less than
103 million in the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
The latest plan devised by the provincial family planning
department specified that to achieve that goal, the annual
birthrate should be controlled under 1.48 percent.
</P>
<P>
With 93.9 million people at present, Henan Province is the most
populated province in China. And China is the most populated
country in the world with a population of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
Despite the provincial population growth rate has been lower
than that of the national average for eight consecutive years.
Henan will continue to have 1.3 million newborns each year due to
its huge population base, according to the family planning
department.
</P>
<P>
According to the national goal of controlling the Chinese
population to within 1.4 billion in 10 years, the net increased
population in Henan Province should be less than 9.13 million in
the coming 11 years.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tough task," said Luo Shuyin, an official in charge of
family planning in the province.
</P>
<P>
"A rebound of population growth is possible since the
population base continues to grow and the low birthrate is not
stable," Luo noted.

<HEADLINE> Shop Windows Along Route to Fiji Parliament Smashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Shops along the route to Fiji's
parliamentary complex have had their windows smashed and stoned by
protesters marching toward the parliament, a Fijian radio reporter
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A protest march by about 5,000 nationalists had arrived at the
gates of the parliament building after marching through the
streets of the capital Suva Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We have also received information that the march has converged
outside the front gate of the parliament complex," the
unidentified reporter told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
Television.
</P>
<P>
"They are outside the locked gate chanting and calling out anti-
government slogans to the government who is being held hostage in
the main complex of parliament house," she said.
</P>
<P>
The reporter said that as the march moved down toward the
parliament building this morning, shops along the road were
smashed and stoned by the marchers as they made their way up to
the parliament complex."
</P>
<P>
She also said armed men walked into the main chamber of the
parliament building Friday morning and fired warning shots.
</P>
<P>
"Once they got into the compound they walked into the main
chamber which is where the parliament session is held and fired
warning shots and told the speaker of the house that they were
taking over the government," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Since then the members of the opposition have been released
out of the main chamber and they are walking around freely
apparently, around the parliament complex," she said.
</P>
<P>
The reporter said she had received information that, along with
Prime Minister Mehendra Chaudhry, his cabinet ministers, and
government backbenchers, the speaker of the house and the
president of the senate were also being held.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, a police department spokesman asked if the
speaker could be released because he was reportedly feeling unwell.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Foreign Trade Deficit Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- In the first four months of this
year, Mongolia's foreign trade balance turned a deficit of 42.2
million U.S. dollars, an increase of 15.4 million dollars,
compared with the same period last year, reported the Mongolian
National Statistical Office Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign trade turnover in the first four months
equaled 271.5 million U.S. dollars, of which exports amounted to
114.6 million dollars and imports 156.8 million dollars, up 34.4
percent, 30.9 percent and 37.1 percent, compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Mineral products, raw and processed hides and skins occupied a
high percentage of the export. But exports of wood and wooden
articles declined, because the Mongolian government had taken some
limited measures on wood export.
</P>
<P>
The imports on textile articles, machinery, electric appliances,
recorders and TV sets, increased by 16.1 million dollars, which
spurred an increase in total imports.

<HEADLINE> Gade and Co Aim to Woo More Fans Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite having Peter Gade
Christensen and Camilla Martin as the men's and women's singles
world number one, the profile of the sports is still low in
Denmark. But reaching the Thomas Cup semifinals, or even to the
finals, would be good for badminton in Denmark.
</P>
<P>
"It is good for the development of badminton in Denmark as
there is little awareness in my home," said Christensen after the
Danes reached semifinals. "That's why we need to do well here."
</P>
<P>
Denmark advanced to the semifinals after beating Malaysia 4-1
in the final Group B tie on Tuesday, setting up a face-off against
Indonesia tonight. The winners will go for a final clash with
China, who defeated South Korea 3-1 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Christensen has been in fine form and was hardly tested in the
group ties but the Dane said his matches were not as easy as the
scores suggested.
</P>
<P>
"The matches were not as easy as everyone thinks because I'm
the world number one and the one to beat in the tournament. So it'
s going to be tougher in semifinals."
</P>
<P>
Although his possible opponent Hendrawan may not cause upset on
the first singles, Christensen said Indonesia were favorites to
win the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia are the favorites but I want to give my team a good
start. Hendrawan is a tough nut to crack. It will be a close match.
I'm looking forward to the clash."
</P>
<P>
The second singles would be very crucial for Denmark but Poul-
Erik Hoyer-Larsen will be having a daunting task against world
number six Taufik Hidayat.
</P>
<P>
"We have fair chance to upset Indonesia even though they seem
to have a balanced team," said Hoyer-Larsen. "I have met Taufik
twice and the score is even. But more importantly, I beat him in
the Danish Open and I think I can do it again."
</P>
<P>
Taufik's win against the Olympic champion was in the semifinals
of the All-England last year but the youngster still has the edge
due to his youth and power.
</P>
<P>
"I might be 34 but I'm younger in heart. I still have what it
takes to play well and deliver," Hoyer-Larsen added. They are not
expected to make the finals but a Danish victory will definitely
make the sport more popular as Indonesia have been dominating the
Thomas Cup for too long.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Reaches to 148 in Floods in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from this week's
floods that caused extensive damage in Indonesia's East Nusa
Tenggara Province increased to 148 persons, according to reports
reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rains, which began on Tuesday, had swollen the Benenai
River which broke its banks the following day, swamping most of
the Central Malaka subdistrict.
</P>
<P>
The floods washed away refugee camps along the border between
East Nusa Tenggara and East Timor. The floods also swept away at
least 160 houses and destroyed or damaged streets.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted local officials as saying most of the dead
were women and children who were sheltering in several camps for
East Timorese refugees located to the west of the heavily guarded
border.
</P>
<P>
Some 250,000 people fled to East Nusa Tenggara during the post-
ballot violence in East Timor in September last year. Although
most of the refugees have long since returned, about 100,000
people remain in the squalid camps near the border.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency reported that the fate of hundreds of
farmers around villages in West Timor near the border with East
Timor remains unclear because the floods have cut off access to
the area. In some areas, the floodwaters were up to two meters
deep.
</P>
<P>
The head of the Belu district social affairs' office, Untung,
was quoted by Antara as saying rescue workers had been deployed to
evacuate residents from the flood-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
But evacuation efforts were hampered because several bridges
have been swept away by the floodwaters, he added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that military engineers belonging to the U.N.
force, now administering East Timor after it voted for
independence in August last year, were trying to repair roads near
Suai, where large areas of farmland had been flooded.
</P>
<P>
A ship carrying 300 tons of rice and other emergency relief
supplies was leaving Dili, capital of East Timor, for Suai, the
East Timorese town near the southern edge of the border region.
</P>
<P>
Two U.N. helicopters were evacuating people from the eastern
side of the border region and the United Nations has offered
Indonesian authorities in West Timor use of the choppers to help
reach remote areas cut off by the flooding, according to the
newspaper The Indonesian Observer.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Almost 100,000 additional jobs have
been created in Sri Lanka's garment industry since 1994 while
earnings from garments exports have risen by over 125 percent, the
official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The number of people employed in the industry last year was 328,
000, up from 232,000 in 1994 and its earnings increased by 2.18
billion U.S.dollars from 970 million dollars in same period,
sources from ministry of industrial development were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed this increase partly due to the proper
and transparent issue of textile quotas to garment factories and
measures taken to curb corruption and dishonest practices in the
use of garment export visas.
</P>
<P>
The government is helping the textile industry get ready to
face the phasing out of textile quotas by year 2005.
</P>
<P>
They have taken measures to improve the quality of the
manufactured products and also to enhance productivity, the
sources said, adding that this can be done by implementing
productivity improvement programs such as reducing costs,
improving employer-employee relationships and creating a better
relationship between government,the employer and the employee.

<HEADLINE> Tax Dodging, Evasion Rampant in Romania's Liquor Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Tax dodging and evasion in
Romania's liquor industry are running rampant, with 80 percent of
liquor products on the market being produced by underground
breweries or distilleries, industry experts estimated.
</P>
<P>
The country's Liquor Association noted Thursday that the amount
of taxes not paid by illegal producers last year exceeded 12
trillion leu (about 650 million U.S. dollars), causing economic
losses of 4 trillion leu (210 million dollars) for legal
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Only 39 liquor factories out of the current 140 nationwide have
followed regulations by applying for production certificates.
Illicit operations by others are severely damaging the economy.
</P>
<P>
A board chairman of a large liquor factory complained Thursday
that illegal producers have damaged the livelihood of liquor
workers in legal factories by grabbing the market with their low-
priced products and preventing the sale of legal beverages.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts blame the corruption of national monitoring
departments for the phenomenon. They are also urging a national
campaign to combat tax evasion and corruption.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean PM Resigns Over Tax Evasion Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Park Tae-joon Friday
who is under strong public criticism for a tax evasion scandal.
</P>
<P>
Before a new prime minister is appointed early next week,
Finance and Economy Minister Lee Hun-jai will serve as acting
prime minister, South Korean Presidential spokesman Park Joon-
young said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim expressed gratitude to Park for his past efforts
in economic reform and state management, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Park's resignation came amid increasing pressure from the
opposition Grand National Party and non-governmental organizations
over allegations of tax evasion and dubious real estate dealings.
</P>
<P>
Monday, Park's tax evasion scandal was brought to light as his
private administrator filed a lawsuit over the imposition of some
two billion won (some 1.8 million U.S. dollars) in gift tax.
</P>
<P>
A local tax office slapped the gift tax on the private
administrator on the ground that Park gave properties worth some
10 billion (roughly 180 million dollars) to the administrator as
disguised gift in a bid to dodge property tax.
</P>
<P>
A Seoul court Wednesday ruled that the steel magnate-turned-
statesman bought some real property valued 5.3 million dollars in
1988-1993 when he served as president of the state-run Pohang Iron
and Steel Co. (POSCO), and then tried to hide the assets by
nominally transferring the ownership of four items to his property
administrator.
</P>
<P>
Park, who is called "Steel King" as he established the POSCO
and turned it into the largest steel maker in the world within 30
years, apologized in a statement last night to the people for his
tax evasion case.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, he said he has no plan to defend his action
against the court's decision that he used others' names in
property transaction to evade tax.
</P>
<P>
Park added that he is to blame due to his loose control of the
people close to him.

Tehran Sewerage Project in the amount of 145 million dollars.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Fiji coup declared
Friday that he had revoked the country's constitution and he was
asserting executive power over the country.
</P>
<P>
In an address on radio in Fiji, businessman George Speight, a
son of opposition MP Sam Speight, also said that the cabinet
members he had taken hostage earlier are safe and that he will
shortly be declaring a new government.
</P>
<P>
"The members of the former government who we have just put down
are safe and well and are held in a secure place," Speight said in
a radio address broadcast in Fiji and replayed on Melbourne radio
station 3AW.
</P>
<P>
"Through these actions I am asserting ownership, I am taking
control and I am asserting executive power over Fiji as I speak,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"What these actions do is that I announce that we have revoked
the constitution of ... we have revoked the powers of the
president of the republic of Fiji and that all executive control ..
. of this country of ours currently resides in my hands," he said.
</P>

number of us but as I sit and as I speak and make these
announcements to you I speak on behalf of every individual member
of the indigenous Fijian community in this country of ours," said
Speight, a former chairman of Fiji Pine Ltd. and Fiji Hardwood

an interim government of ministers who will serve and run the
affairs of Fiji whilst we determine the ... long and short and
medium plans of this country."
</P>
<P>
Fiji Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and up to seven cabinet
ministers are being held hostage by armed men who stormed the
parliament in Suva earlier Friday, the New Zealand and Australian
governments said.
</P>
<P>
The men were reportedly armed with rifles and at least two
shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
Radio Fiji said Chaudhry and other cabinet ministers had been
locked in the upstairs chambers.
</P>
<P>
The gates to the parliament building, just outside the city's
main business district, had been closed.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's National Radio reported that Fiji's former Prime
Minister Sitiveni Rabuka had gone to the parliament to negotiate
with the hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the coup sparked riots in downtown Suva, with
Fijian youths smashing the windows of several shops.
</P>
<P>
An Australian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said that the events
were focused on the parliament building and that there appeared to
be no immediate danger to civilians in the capital of Suva.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Foreign Ministry spokesman James Funnell said they
were aware of the reports but communications with the New Zealand
High Commission in Fiji were down. Normal phone lines were also
not working.
</P>
<P>
Friday marks the first anniversary of Chaudhry becoming Fiji's
first ethnic Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It was marked by a pro-nationalist march by indigenous Fijians
through the streets of Suva, calling for an end to the year-old
government.

LISBON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio
welcomed visiting Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR) here Thursday, speaking highly
of the successful return of Macao to China.
</P>
<P>
During a welcome speech at a banquet, President Sampaio said
the successful return of Macao to the motherland on December 20,
1999 "has opened a new page in the multilateral relations between
European Union-Portugal and China-Macao, and established a sound
foundation for cordial relations between us."
</P>

Chief Executive Edmund Ho Haw Wah's visit to Portugal will "
further promote mutual understanding and bilateral relations
between Portugal and Macao SAR," Sampaio added.

Edmund Ho Haw Wah held similar views of the Portuguese
president, saying that his first visit to Portugal "was fruitful
and beneficial and has enhanced the good relations between
Portugal and Macao SAR."

bilateral relations and cooperation in new fields. Macao will make
more efforts to "develop multilateral relations with Portugal and
the EU, including cooperation between manufacturing sectors," said

<HEADLINE> Serbia's Control Destroys NATO's Attempt: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian government's decision
to take over Studio B Television has destroyed NATO's attempt to
continue invading Yugoslavia by "vicious lies," Yugoslav
Information Minister Goran Matic said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In letters to the International Association of Journalists and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE),
Matic said that Studio B, owned by the opposition, has publicly
instigated people to use violence to overthrow the Federal
government, aiming to set up a puppet Serbian state.
</P>
<P>
No country will allow any media to agitate violence and topple
the constitutional order, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Opposition and media from Western countries have accused the
Yugoslav government of obstructing press freedom. The minister
refuted the charge, claiming it was Western countries that prevent
the press from freedom.
</P>
<P>
During NATO airstrikes, to prevent Yugoslav media from
publicizing the truth about the airstrikes, Western countries
bombed the Serbian national television station and equipment,
killing 16 journalists, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Thursday, Serbian Vice Prime Minister
Vojislav Sesselj also said that Studio B was not an independent
press organization, but a state-owned enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Under the Serbian property law, the government has the right to
supervise it. He said television will resume its normal
programming after it was reorganized.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Vice Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic said at another
press conference that the decision to take over was legal, because
Studio B has provided direct service for NATO and become part of
NATO's anti-government organization.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government announced the takeover of Studio B, two
radio stations and a daily newspaper early Wednesday morning. On
the same day, demonstrators clashed with police in a rally
organized by the opposition to protest the takeover, causing
injuries to four policemen and the arrest of 37 people, Serbian
police said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Parliament Thursday

</P>
<P>
The new law provided a basis for the country's law enforcement

for illegal money laundering for both at home and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 18 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish parliament decided
Thursday that the country will start to implement the Schengen
accord on March 1 next year, which will enable its citizens to
travel freely to other countries implementing the same accord.
</P>
<P>
The parliament made the decision after adopting relevant
measures to pave the way for implementing the accord. The measures
included police cooperation across the borders, enhancement of
control and supervision of foreign nationals and the establishment
of an information system for tracking the floating population.
</P>
<P>
Sweden signed the Schengen accord in December 1996 and the
parliament approved the accord in 1998, but the accord could not
be put in force immediately because of lacking necessary measures
and coordination with other Nordic countries.
</P>
<P>
All the 15 member countries of the European Union (EU) have
signed the accord, which was initially signed in 1985 in the
Luxembourg town of Schengen and came into effect in March 1995.
The accord has come into effect in 10 of the 15 EU nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The triumph at the national swimming
championships delighted Chinese world record holder Wu Yanyan and
rebuilt her confidence for the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Wu claimed the victory in the women's 200 meters individual
medley in two minutes 14.02 seconds, her personal best since she
captured the title at the World Championships in Perth, Australia
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Though the result is far from my world record of 2:09.72, I
feel I am coming back. I have showed I am still one of the elite
swimmers in China," the 21-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by heart and incretion problems after the Asian Games
in Bangkok in late 1998, Wu slumped to nobody in the national
competitions and even lost faith in herself.
</P>
<P>
"The victory means a lot for me, confidence and aspiration for
the Olympic Games," she said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that her Olympic future was put in doubt before the
championships, and she was really trembled before the 200m medley
final.
</P>
<P>
"Because it is my last chance to prove myself. I am happy I
shrugged off the nightmare."
</P>
<P>
Wu predicted the top three finishers in Sydney Games should be
within 2:13 and vowed to perform her best in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I still have four months to go to prepare for the Games. I
hope this time I can grab a medal for China," said Wu, who did not
enter the final at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Crucial to SOE Reform: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The capital market, especially the
stock market, will play an important role in restructuring state-
owned enterprises, a senior economist said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jinglian, senior economist of the Development Research
Center under the State Council, said that the capital market will
help optimize the capital structure of state-owned enterprises (
SOEs) as the government tries to withdraw from many sectors and
concentrate resources on key industries.
</P>
<P>
He said that the stock market will serve as a yardstick for the
performance of state-owned enterprises and force them to develop
effective corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
Since November, 1993, most of the large- and medium-sized SOEs
in the country have been restructured into share-holding companies.
Some 600 large SOEs have been listed on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, about 70 percent of small-sized government-
run enterprises had been turned into independent companies.
</P>
<P>
Some of the large SOEs have sold their shares to the public and
some of them have even been taken over by non-government investors.
</P>
<P>
China now is re-organizing the SOE-dominated sectors of
petroleum, telecommunications and electricity by turning the SOEs
into share-holding companies that are listed on both Chinese and
overseas stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that using international capital to push forward the
restructuring of entire industries is a bold experiment in the
reform of SOEs. He said that the supervision of Chinese and
foreign shareholders will press the SOEs to deepen reform.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is creating equal opportunities for all
companies to enter the stock market, including the non-
governmental companies that are converted from SOEs. It has
already abolished government selection and approval for listing
companies on the market so as to eliminate chances for
discrimination against non-state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the government is reducing its shares in SOEs
and allowing a greater part of the shares of the SOEs to be traded
on the market.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the simultaneous promotion of SOE reform and the
development of the capital market will hasten the establishment of
a micro-economic market economy.

<HEADLINE> China Hikes Salaries for Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government has raised
the minimum salary for foreign experts engaged in educational and
cultural work by 80 percent to 2,200 yuan (265 U.S. dollars) per
month, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The new minimum salary, in place since March 1, is 83 percent
higher than the 1,200 yuan (144.6 U.S. dollars) that was paid in
1994, said Zhang Xinmin, deputy director of the Department of
Cultural and Educational Experts with the State Administration of
Foreign Experts Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Foreign cultural and educational experts also receive free
housing, medical care and transportation to and from work.
</P>
<P>
The administration has also classified salaries in to three
grades according to the experts' performance and academic degrees.
</P>
<P>
The first grade, from 2,200 to 3,300 yuan (265 to 398 U.S.
dollars), is suitable for college teachers with a bachelor's
degree and at least two years of teaching experience.
</P>
<P>
The second, from 3,300 to 4,600 yuan (398 to 554 U.S. dollars),
is suitable for assistant professors and lectures in colleges,
high school teachers with master's degree and at least five years
of teaching experience, and people with equivalent qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The third, from 4,600 to 6,000 yuan (554 to 723 U.S. dollars),
is suitable for professors or associate professors in colleges and
universities, senior lectures in countries of the British
Commonwealth, and people with equivalent qualifications.
</P>
<P>
Foreign experts earning more than 4,001 yuan (482 U.S. dollars)
must pay Chinese income taxes.
</P>
<P>
Compared with those engaging in the high-tech or business
sectors, the experts in the cultural and educational sectors are
paid less.
</P>
<P>
"We talked with a few foreign exports before the minimum salary
was decided. A salary of 2,000 yuan (241 U.S. dollars) will
provide a comfortable life for them while in the country," Zhang
said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Internet Investment to Get Returns (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China's Internet industry is
expected to get its economic returns in the current decade, thanks
to its effort to invest in the telecommunications and information
technology infrastructure in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Although China lags behind the United States in e-commerce
applications, it is a fast follower and is catching up quickly,
according to the on-going investors' forum hosted in Hong Kong by
the Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia) Ltd. (CLSA).
</P>
<P>
E-commerce, which appeared in China only two years ago, is
starting to accelerate with its revenue rising fivefold to 42
million U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce, including government and
educational expenditures, accounted for over 85 percent of that
amount, with business-to-consumer (B2C) home use contributing the
rest, according to the International Data Group.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet in China is bigger and getting bigger," Jing
Ulrich, managing director of the CLSA, said at the forum. "Net
users now over 10 million strong are doubling every six months."
</P>
<P>
"By 2005, China probably will have more net users than any
other country in the world with the exception of the United States,
" she predicted.
</P>
<P>
China's leadership has long recognized the role of
telecommunications and information in economic growth and had
pushed an aggressive deployment of fixed-line and wireless
infrastructure through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The wired infrastructure in China has a much higher percentage
of newer digital lines, which will favor the introduction of new
technologies associated with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The ability to use wireless to forego deploying much more
expensive and cumbersome landlines in undeveloped areas will also
make China's move into the wireless application protocol (WAP)
more aggressive than elsewhere. The year 2000 promises to be the
first time that more new cell phone subscribers are added than
landline users in China.
</P>
<P>
China's Internet market is expanding largely due to the demand
for online communications with friends and relatives, in addition
to the greater availability and quality of Chinese-language
content, the increasing scope of applications and expected
improvements in transactions and security.

<TEXT>
<P>
China's addressable market, defined as the number of persons
with sufficient income to afford Internet access, is on the rise
rapidly and has got its returns, according to economists attending
the forum.
</P>
<P>
"The basic fact is that there are that many people in China
with a lot of money in the pocket to spend on online goods and
purchases," said Eric Rosenblum, founder of the Chinanow.com, a
bilingual online living and traveling resource for China.
</P>
<P>
Rosenblum said his company sees transaction base revenue in
providing a sort of low-tech version of e-commerce, although the
cost of Internet technology and marketing is currently relatively
high in China.
</P>
<P>
"We provide a platform for local merchants to put on their
stores. They can partner stores and maintain themselves and do
business quite efficiently," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rosenblum said his company has targeted the profits from the
local merchants to do online transactions, in addition to selling
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
The Internet can be also used as a channel to complement media
and entertainment, Eric said, noting that the profitable business
is extremely weak in China.
</P>
<P>
Chinadotcom, the only NASDAQ-listed Internet firm in China,
reported total revenues for the first quarter of the year 2000 of
20 million U.S. dollars, an 84-percent increase over a year
earlier. Advertising revenue for the quarter was 9.3 million U.S.
dollars and e-business revenue 10.2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the financial results, Peter Yip, CEO of chinadotcom,
stated, "Each dimension of our core businesses -- e-business
solutions, online advertising and our integrated portal network --
is realizing continued rapid growth and increasing gross margins,
and decreasing operating cash losses."
</P>
<P>
"The effective execution of our focused business plan has once
again produced results ahead of internal and external projections,
demonstrating that we are growing strong and are well down the
path to profitability," he added.

<P>
CANBERRA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry has been seized by armed civilians inside the country's
parliament building, Australian Associated Press (AAP) quoted
diplomatic sources as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It has been impossible to confirm the events in the Fijian
capital of Suva as telephone lines have gone down.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted as saying shots have been fired and it
appears that seven cabinet ministers are being held in a room
upstairs in the Fijian parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio said
seven men wearing civilian clothes had entered the building Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Radio New Zealand reported that Chaudhry had been
taken hostage by seven men following an indigenous protest in Suva.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokeswoman of the Department of Foreign Affairs and
Trade of Australia said that nothing had been confirmed yet and
the department was investigating.
</P>
<P>
Friday marks the first anniversary of Chaudhry becoming Fiji's
first ethnic Indian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It was to be marked by a pro-nationalist march by indigenous
Fijians through the streets of Suva, calling for an end to the

JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's net foreign exchange
reserves fell by 215.3 million U.S. dollars to 18.05 billion
dollars in the week ending on May 15.
</P>
<P>
The drop was mainly due to the repayment of the country's
sovereign debts and financial charges paid to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), the central bank, Bank Indonesia, said in its
weekly report.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall, the country's net international reserves
exceeded the minimum target of 14 billion dollars agreed upon with
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross foreign exchange reserves, which are net
foreign exchange reserves plus outstanding foreign exchange

billion dollars, the weekly report was quoted by the Jakarta Post

<HEADLINE> Violence Continues in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Communal clashes continued in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku Province, on Thursday, bringing the
death toll to 27 since violence first re-erupted on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post Friday, six people were killed on
Thursday when mobs rampaged through Ahuru subdistrict, five
kilometers east of Ambon, burning the Waihoka community health
post, the Petra church and dozens of houses in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ahuru, a hilly area which separates Muslim and Christian
communities, hosts several important buildings such as the
provincial council office, the governor's residence, a sports hall
and five other important government offices.
</P>
<P>
Two people were killed in Muslim-Christian street clashes on
Tuesday and at least 17 others died on Wednesday when security
forces opened fire to disperse warring mobs.
</P>
<P>
A police officer and a member of the army's Strategic Reserves
Command died in Wednesday's clashes.
</P>
<P>
Maluku has witnessed a year-long ethnic bloodshed between
Christians and Muslims, which has claimed more than 1,300 civilian
lives. Clashes have subsided in recent months but tension remains
in some areas.
</P>
<P>
The three days of rioting this week is the first major eruption
of violence in Ambon, about 2,500 kilometers northeast of Jakarta,
this month. On April 30 six people were killed and more than 10
others injured near Ambon's port and at least 40 houses were razed.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post noted that the fresh fighting came just days
after hundreds of Laskar Jihad (Jihad Forces) members arrived in
Ambon. Their numbers were estimated to reach up to 2,200.
</P>
<P>
National Police spokesman Col. Saleh Saaf said in Jakarta that
7,000 police personnel would be dispatched to Ambon to replace the
existing force.
</P>
<P>
"The personnel now in Ambon need replacing. They are
psychologically tired," he said.

TIRANA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Defense Minister Nikola
Kljusev expressed dissatisfaction with the NATO-led international
peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR), said reports from Skopje,
capital of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Thursday with visiting KFOR commander General
Juan Ortuno, Kljusev listed factors affecting the security of the
country's border with Kosovo in Yugoslavia, and stressed the need
for greater control in the border zone from the Kosovo side.
</P>
<P>
Civil control should be implemented within the framework of U.N.
Resolution 1244 for Kosovo, he added.
</P>
<P>
A four-member border patrol in Macedonia was reportedly
kidnapped recently by unidentified armed personnel from Kosovo,
which caused uneasiness among Macedonians.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister urged KFOR to assert more discipline on
soldiers entering Macedonia from Kosovo. Reports said a Macedonian
minister and his family were killed recently in an accident caused
by NATO soldiers who were driving in violation of traffic
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Kljusev also complained that KFOR logistic forces in the
country were delaying payment for their expenses.

HELSINKI, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The majority of Finnish people
still oppose Finland's entry into NATO, an opinion poll released
on Thursday claims.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted in late April and early May by Finland's
Economic Research Institute, posed the question to 1,000 people: "
Do you think Finland should be a member country of NATO?"
</P>
<P>
Only 21 percent of those questioned supported NATO membership,
while 62 percent were opposed, and 17 percent expressed no opinion.
</P>
<P>
All the polls conducted by Finland's Economic Research
Institute since 1993 show that more than half of those surveyed
oppose NATO membership. The opposition even climbed to 70 percent
when NATO launched air strikes against Yugoslavia in 1999.
</P>
<P>
George Robertson, Secretary-General of NATO, was visiting
Finland when the poll was released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finland joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1994,
but it still maintains a policy of independent defense and
military non-alignment.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian Parliament Thursday
ratified a law against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The new law provided a basis for the country's law enforcement

</P>
<P>
Under the anti-money laundering law, currency trades exceeding
2 million lek (about 13,500 thousand U.S. dollars), or any other
foreign currency with the same value, should be registered, and
trades over 70 million (473,000 U.S. dollars) should be reported
to authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, any individual or organization failing to
register or report their financial activities as instructed are
subject to fine or be imprisoned for as long as five years.
</P>

BRASILIA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will cut 4.078 billion U.S.
dollars from this year's budget, which was approved last month by
the National Congress, a senior official announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry's executive secretary Amaury Bier said the
cut was intended to tighten the budget, which has an authorized
ceiling of 19.408 billion dollars. The cut would reportedly
guarantee the achievement of the target of a 2.65-percent surplus
of the gross domestic product (GDP) in government accounts, which
would agree with the International Monetary Fund's (IMF)
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
Ministries facing the biggest cuts include the Urban
Development, National Integration, Security and Social Assistance,
Environment, and Transports.

The government will retain 601 million dollars to permit the
necessary adjustments in the exercise of the budget, said Planning,

<HEADLINE> Canada's Inflation Down to 2.1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's inflation was down to 2.1
percent in April from the previous month's 3 percent, Statistics
Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation, which excludes food and energy, also declined
to 1.3 percent, from 1.4 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The lower inflation is largely attributed to a dip in energy
prices. The most sensitive gasoline prices dropped by 5.6 percent
to below the level of 0.45 U.S. dollar a liter in April.
</P>
<P>
The country's gasoline prices grew 8.8 percent to a record 0.49
U.S. dollar a liter in March to boost the month's inflation to the
top of the Bank of Canada's target range of 1 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
April also saw a decline of fuel oil prices by 7.8 percent, the
second month of declines after 11 consecutive monthly increases.
</P>
<P>
Other contributors to the plunge of inflation included cheaper
fresh fruit and vegetables, computer equipment and supplies, as
well as cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
The downing of inflation was reported a day after the Bank of
Canada followed the U.S. Federal Reserve in hiking interest rates
by half a percentage point to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite fears that inflation could go below the target range to
make the weak Canadian dollar even weaker, Finance Minister Paul
Martin reaffirmed his positive view about low inflation later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that Canada is right on the track of low
inflation, strong growth and strong job creation. It is necessary
for the central bank to keep low inflation to ensure a steady
economic growth, according to the minister.

BELGRADE, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will provide 85
percent of the total 24 million euros (21.6 million dollars)
needed to clear waterways on the Danube River, said Radisa
Djordjevich, head of the Yugoslav delegation on the Danube River
Commission Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the cleanup plan passed by the Danube River Commission in
Budapest Wednesday, all Yugoslav enterprises can equally
participate in the international bid for the clean-up project, and
the winners will not be restricted by sanctions imposed by NATO,
Djordjevich was quoted by Tanjug News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three countries alongside the Danube, Austria, Germany and the
Netherlands, will provide 15 percent of the clean-up expenditures.
</P>
<P>
During last year's 11-week air strike on Yugoslavia, NATO
destroyed three bridges over the Danube River in the Yugoslav
northern city of Novi Sad. The damage resulted in a serious
blockade of the waterways. The countries along the Danube River
suffered enormous economic losses due to the suspension of
navigation on the Danube River.
</P>
<P>
The Danube Commission was established after the bombing among
these countries in order to restore navigation on the river.

<HEADLINE> More Funds Needed to Alleviate Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 78 billion yuan (9.4 billion U.
S. dollars) is needed to alleviate pollution in Beijing, China
Daily quoted the state environmental protection authorities as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The spending will go to the ongoing air pollution treatment
project (1999-2002), which is to cost 47 billion yuan (5.6 billion
U.S. dollars), Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Environmental
Protection Administration, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a visiting delegation of US journalists, the
director said Beijing's air quality is expected to reach Category
2 by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
The indicators to determine category include exhaust levels
from vehicles and total suspended particles in the air.
</P>
<P>
For most of last year, Beijing's air quality fluctuated between
Category 2 and 3, which corresponds to slight pollution levels
according to the classification system.
</P>
<P>
But for about three months of the year, the city registers
levels as high as Category 4 and 5, indicating medium to heavy
pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Category 2 is what a city should have so that people can live
in comfortably," said the official. "We'll try to make it 80
percent Category 2 and 3 this year."
</P>
<P>
The Beijing government has decided to close down and relocate
the worst pollution-causing factories to suburban areas while
encouraging the development of the more environmentally friendly
high-tech industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another critical pollution control measure is to reduce the use
of coal and encourage natural gas use. The city will transport 1.7
billion cubic meters of natural gas this year from northwest China
's Shaanxi Province.

<HEADLINE> Air-to-Air Missiles Looted in Albania in 1997 Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 18 (Xinhua) -- Albanian police and military forces
recovered on Thursday 19 of the 20 air-to-air missile looted
during 1997 riots in the country, the Albanian news agency ATA
reported.
</P>
<P>
The PII-2 missiles were found in a village of the District of
Lezha, ATA reported, quoting a spokesman of the Albanian Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The realization of this operation was made possible by a
coordination of the actions of the Air Defense Base in Gjader,
Military Information Service, Military Police, the sector of the
fight against crime in the police of Lezha and the aid by the
people of Zadrima," the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the unidentified spokesman as saying that the
missiles were looted from a depot in the Air Defense Base in
Gjader, during the 1997 unrest in Albania, which was sparked by
the collapse of several pyramid investment schemes in which many
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
After the hiding place for the missiles was found, the missiles
were brought to their former base, ATA said.
</P>
<P>
"The 19 missiles restored in the Base were found in a generally
good condition after the technical control made to them," it
quoted the Commander of the Base, Major General Perlat Sula, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997 riots, large parts of northern and southern
Albania were in a total chaos and beyond government control for a
long time when looting became rampant.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Albanian government announced that gold
coins valued at an estimated 2.8 million U.S. dollars were stolen
from the country's treasury depots during 1997 riots. Property of
foreign companies was also stolen or looted during the riots.

Norbu Lingka, the largest palace garden in Tibet, was built in
1751 by the 7th Dalai Lama. Every Dalai Lama lived there learning
Buddhism until he was 18 years old. After he came into power, he
moved into the Potala Palace, but from March to October he would
still return to Norbu Lingka to perform his administrative and
religious duty.
</P>
<P>
In 1954, the Chinese government set up a new palace in Norbu
Lingka for the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China announced the palace a key historical site under
state protection.
</P>
<P>
After hundreds of years of renovation, the picturesque garden
has become a museum of authentic Tibetan culture and religion. The
palace now contains 30,000 relics and attracts thousands of
visitors every year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmer Wins Patents for Silk Production Techniques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer in east China's
Jiangsu Province has won three national patents for techniques to
produce no-wrinkle, washable silk.
</P>
<P>
Using the new techniques, pure silk thread can be made that,
unlike untreated silk, can be washed, won't wrinkle, and holds its
shape, according to Yu Xianggen, the inventor.
</P>
<P>
Yu, a 59-year-old farmer in Qingyun township in Wujiang city,
has spent six years analyzing the properties of pure silk thread,
and eventually developed the treatments for pure silk fabric.
</P>
<P>
Local spinning mills used his inventions to produce high-value
added natural fabric, and their products have been exported to
Japan in bulk.
</P>
<P>
The wash-and-wear problems accompanying pure silk fabric have
long plagued the world's textile sector.

<HEADLINE> Photo Album on Japanese Intrusion Discovered in NE China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 19(Xinhua) -- A photo album on the Japanese
occupation of some Chinese cities was revealed to the public by a
collector in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province recently.
</P>
<P>
The album has over 200 pages and includes nearly 800 pictures
showing Japanese military operations in Northeast China and
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that these pictures will be of great value in the
study of the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, Shenyang, Harbin,
and Qiqihar. Notes by Japanese commanders on crucial Sino-Japanese
battles during the occupation are contained in the preface.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese first broke into the northeastern part of China on
September 18, 1931, and then into east China's Shanghai on January
28 the following year.
</P>
<P>
The album was issued by a Japanese publishing house 50 days
after the establishment of the puppet Manchuria regime with Pu Yi
as the emperor on March 1, 1932.
</P>
<P>
The album, bought by Zhang Xuewei this year, a collector in a
antique market in Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang was
meant to show off the Japanese military prowess, said local
historians on the anti-Japanese war.

YINCHUAN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of tower-shaped tombs,
believed to have been built during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368),
have been discovered in Yinchuan, capital of northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
They are the first tombs of the kind ever found in this Muslim-
inhabited region.

Experts said that the stone tombs belong to Islamic followers.
They range in height from three to five tiers, and most are carved
with designs of lotus flowers and clouds, or engraved with Arabian
characters.
</P>
<P>
A two-meter-tall granite stele, carved with both Chinese and
Arabian characters, was found 80 meters northeast of the tomb
group.
</P>
<P>
Local people said that the tomb group originally covered 0.2
hectares, but many of them were later buried under mud and sand.

TIANJIN, May 19 (Xinhua) -- China and France recently signed an
agreement to jointly invest 70 million yuan (8.5 million U.S.
dollars) in setting up a large-scale incineration center in
Tianjin to handle poisonous industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
The center, the first of its kind in China, will be built by
the Vivendi Cjea Group of France and the Tianjin Environmental
Protection Bureau. It is scheduled for completion by the end of
next year.
</P>
<P>
When operational, the plant will recycle about 1,000 tons of
heavy metal, chemical and organic solvents annually, while
handling 6,200 tons of landfill waste material. Thus the center
will deal with more than 95 percent of the poisonous waste in the
municipality, and is expected to operate efficiently for about 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The center will adopt technologies from both China and France,
and experts believe the advanced technologies used in the center
will be gradually passed on to other provinces.

Torino's capping of the 1942-43 season, Napoli glorying to close
the 1986-87 season and Juventus wrapping up play in 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's celebrations mark Lazio's third win of the Coppa
Italia (Italian Cup), after those in 1958 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lewis Ready to Return in Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- World boxing champion Lennox Lewis
has vowed to out-blast "Iron Mike" when he ends his six-year
British boxing exile on July 15 at London Arena.
</P>
<P>
Lewis defends his world titles against South African Frans
Botha just over three weeks after Mike Tyson's scheduled
appearance in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Botha was blown away by Tyson in round five in January last
year -- and Lewis intends to underline his heavyweight dominance
with a bigger and better win against the former world title
challenger.
</P>
<P>
"I want to get him out of there a lot sooner," said Lewis. "We'
re in an ego sport and I've got a big ego. I'm out to break all
records."
</P>
<P>
Six years and 12 fights have passed since Lewis' last fight in
Britain, when he lost his WBC title to Oliver McCall at Wembley
Arena.
</P>
<P>
In that time Lewis has avenged the only loss of his 38-fight
career and firmly established himself as the world's premier
heavyweight, while Tyson's spells of enforced inactivity have left
the former champion a fading force.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Cleared for UK Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson is to be
allowed to return to the UK for a boxing match, despite an outcry
from politicians and pressure groups.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw has decided to grant the visa
application from Tyson, a convicted rapist.
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, Straw allowed Tyson into the UK to fight
Julius Francis in Manchester, but said there were "exceptional
circumstances".
</P>
<P>
The controversial ex-world champion is set to fight fellow
American Lou Savarese in Glasgow on 24 June.
</P>
<P>
The likely venue is Scotland's national stadium, Hampden Park.
</P>
<P>
Straw said he had taken into account the fact that Tyson's
behaviour in the UK was "satisfactory".
</P>
<P>
Any risk to the public posed by his rape conviction would be "
minimised by the circumstances of his proposed visit", part of
which would be the high-profile media presence.
</P>
<P>
Straw also said that a refusal to permit entry would result in
a loss of economic benefit to the UK.

<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- American boxer Mike Tyson has been
allowed to come to Britain to fight again - but it has become
clear that his fight will not be staged at Celtic Park.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw today granted permission to
allow Tyson to enter into the UK, for the second time in six
months, however, Celtic football club bosses said they are no
longer interested in staging the fight.
</P>
<P>
Celtic Chief Executive Allan MacDonald told BBC: "It's not the
type of event we would want to have at Celtic Park at the moment".
</P>
<P>
Hampden Park in Glasgow, the newly refurbished national stadium,
is now expected to be named as the venue for the bout on 24 June
with Lou Savarese.

<HEADLINE> UEFA Refuses to Change Venue for England-Germany Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 18 (Xinhua) -- European football governing body
UEFA have refused to switch England's Euro 2000 clash with Germany
from Charleroi to Brussels despite fears over safety.
</P>
<P>
European football chiefs, backed up by the European Parliament,
turned down an appeal headed by British MEP Chris Heaton-Harris to
change the venue for the Group A game on 17 June.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, UEFA said: "In response to the large
numbers of enquiries addressed to the UEFA press department, UEFA
would like to stress that there are no plans to change the fixture
list for the final phase of the European Championship."
</P>
<P>
"This means that, even though the venue for the match between
England and Germany may be cause for debate, the game remains
scheduled for 8.45pm on 17 June at the Stade du Pays de Charleroi.
"
</P>
<P>
The appeal by Heaton-Harris and his fellow Conservative members
Roy Perry and the Earl of Stockton was also formally rejected in
the European Parliament, their motion falling by 181 votes to 29
in the Strasbourg assembly.
</P>
<P>
Several security experts have questioned the wisdom of staging
the group game in the small Belgian town given the possibility of
violence between English and German fans.
</P>
<P>
Concerns have also been voiced over the large Turkish
population in the town, given recent trouble between English and
Turkish fans.
</P>
<P>
England are scheduled to play Romania there as well just three
days after the Germany game, and the stadium in Charleroi, with a
capacity of only 30,000, has been criticised as unsafe and
unsuitable for such high-profile encounters.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Urge Iran to Stop Hostile Activities: Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
will send a letter to his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi as
tensions mounted over alleged Iranian role in the murders of
Turkish intellectuals, Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cem will convey Turkey's concerns in a "straightforward" way,
urging the Iranian authorities to take necessary measures to stop
anti-Turkish activities stemming from Iranian territory, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The letter is in response of a message from Kharrazi, delivered
to Ankara by the Iranian ambassador Mohammad Lavasani on May 10, in
which he criticised the Turkish press for making the allegations
against Iran.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the paper said, Cem will underline that Turkey is
a democratic country with press freedom and that state officials
have no control over press reports.
</P>
<P>
Cem's letter, however, would not specifically touch on the
murders of Ugur Mumcu and Ahmet Kislali, two famous Turkish
intellectuals assassinated years ago, which were committed by
radical Islamist whom some reports said had links with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Despite public opinions that Turkey should take a tougher stance
towards Iran, Ankara does not favor a confrontational attitude, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has stuck to not commenting on the accusations
against Iran and its alleged support for the Islamic terrorist
group Hezbollah in Turkey before concrete evidence was found.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian press, meanwhile, has called for curbing diplomatic
relations with Turkey, saying that Tehran had already tolerated
Ankara's hostile acts for a long time and that it was time to limit
both commercial ties and diplomatic missions.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestant Leader Begins Devolution Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's main pro-British
Protestant party leader David Trimble has begun the battle to
persuade his party to return to Northern Ireland's power-sharing
executive alongside Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Party leader said Friday that he was
starting a process of dialogue with the community and the party to
"address worries and misinformation" about the package of
proposals to return to devolution.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Trimble threw his weight behind the restoration of
the suspended executive, saying he had received the assurances he
needed to recommend the Irish Republican Army offer to put its
arms beyond use, to his party's ruling council.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the 860-member Ulster Unionist Council,
scheduled for Saturday, has been postponed for a week until May 27
to give Trimble and his supporters time to win over anti-agreement
unionists in his party who remain opposed to the deal.
</P>
<P>
Trimble admitted he could not say whether the IRA's arms offer
was "genuine" and said that in the past, republicans had behaved
in a "niggardly" way refusing to honor their obligations under the
Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
But he said endorsing the proposals was the only way forward if
unionists were to ensure the future was shaped by them, to get a
democratic and peaceful society and because the consequences of
failure would be to see the political process "fall apart."
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland's political institutions were suspended by the
government in February during the dispute between the Ulster
Unionists and Sinn Fein about IRA arms and continues power-sharing.

<HEADLINE> One Wanted Executive Surrenders to Enschede Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- One of the two wanted executives
for the fireworks warehouse explosion surrendered himself to the
Enschede police on Friday and was detained for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Wilhelm Pater gave in after Dutch authorities issued on
Thursday arrest warrants for the two executives of the fireworks
warehouse which exploded last Saturday, killing 17 and injuring
946 others.
</P>
<P>
Interpol was alerted to be on the lookout for SE Fireworks
Company executive Ruud Bakker who is still at large. Bakker and
Pater vanished shortly after expressing regrets to the relatives
of the victims of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The two are being sought after in connection with allegations
that their company violated Dutch law regulating manufacture and
storage of fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok announced the set-up of an
investigation commission to probe into the cause of the
devastating explosion that took place late on Saturday afternoon
in eastern Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Residents of Enschede saw a small explosion that set off a fire
on the warehouse. The bursting of hundreds of fireworks then
triggered the second explosion that caused the most destruction of
the residential area around.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the casualties, hundreds of people are still
unaccounted for after the explosion. Town officials said that
they could have been staying with relatives and friends after the
explosion ruined their homes and appealed to them to come forward
and register with the authorities.

<HEADLINE> Annan Alarmed by Critical Humanitarian Situation in Horn of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said Friday that he was "deeply alarmed" over the impact of
the renewed fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea, and demanded "
an immediate and mutual halt" in fighting, and early resumption of
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by Annan's spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General is deeply alarmed over the impact of renewed
hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea on the already critical
humanitarian situation of hundred of thousands of innocent people.
"
</P>
<P>
The statement was promoted by reports over the recent days
that indicate that large number of people have fled away from
fighting.
</P>
<P>
"This new caseload of people requiring immediate humanitarian
assistance is in addition to the estimate 350,000 in Eritrea alone
impacted by the drought," the statement said. "In Ethiopia, some
eight million people require drought-related assistance."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General finds it tragic that, under such
circumstances, a large-scale military effort continues," the
statement said. "He endorses the appeal of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) for an immediate and mutual halt in fighting,
and a resumption of talks leading to a complete restoration of
peace," in accordance with relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"He also expresses gratitude to donors who have continued to
provide generously to the urgent needs of the innocent victims,
and hopes that such assistance will remain forthcoming while a
durable solution to the crisis is pursued," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea faces a major humanitarian crisis with up to one
million people fleeing their homes and thousands crossing the
border into Sudan to escape Ethiopia forces, the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Another 300,000 Eritreans have been suffering from hunger and
illness, due to a severe drought in the Horn of Africa region,
UNICEF said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea renewed their border fighting last Friday
after the breakdown of peace talks in Algeria under the OAU
auspices.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hails China Trade Deal with Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday hailed the trade deal between China and the European Union
and again urged the U.S. Congress to approve permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said the Chinese-EU agreement "
highlights the importance of congressional passage of permanent
normal trade relations with China."
</P>
<P>
"It is now clearer than ever that China will join the World
Trade Organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"For America to reap the broad benefits of China's historic
decision to open its markets and to strengthen the forces of
positive change in China, Congress must enact PNTR," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned that a vote against PNTR with China "will cost
America exports and jobs, cede this massive new market to our
competitors in Europe and Japan and embolden those resisting
reform in China."
</P>
<P>
China and the EU signed the bilateral agreement on China's
accession to the WTO on May 19 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China is required to reach agreement with the remaining five
WTO members, Guatemala, Mexico, Switzerland, Costa Rica and
Ecuador, before concluding the bilateral negotiation phase of its
WTO entry talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The 2000 Review Conference
of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is working hard on
the final document, which is expected to give stronger disarmament
pledge.
</P>
<P>
The conference began the ongoing efforts to finalize the final
document as the event is scheduled to wrap up Friday. The
discussion will probably last into late at night, sources close to
the conference said here.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the commitment toward a total nuclear
disarmament has survived in the draft agreement after France
withdrew a proposal to soften the draft language.
</P>
<P>
The 187 countries represented at the NPT review conference are
expected to agree on the document, which is also expected to
include "further reduction of nonstrategic nuclear weapons," with
Russia having withdrawn its objection, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The NPT review conference, in session at the U.N. Headquarters
in New York since April 24, was the first since the NPT was
extended indefinitely in 1995.

ATHENS, May 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of 15 Turkish military

late Friday landed at the Greek Air Force base of Nea Ankhialos in
central Greece.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Per Capita Income Drops 50 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Commission for
Latin America (CEPAL) said Friday that Mexico's per capita income
reduced by 50 percent, which went from 3,600 U.S. dollars to 1,800
dollars.
</P>
<P>
A CEPAL report ranks Mexico 43rd among those countries that
present the higher levels of poverty.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans available yearly income is under the one
registered in other nations like Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago,
Hungary, Malaysia, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicans per capita gross domestic product (GDP) was 3,600
dollars after Mexico was admitted as a member of the Organization
for Cooperation and Economic Development (OECD) in 1994, but the
reductions have been cyclical because of the acute recession of
1995.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the Mexicans' income reduction has been
their way of working because they now are eventual workers, or
work for hour, for low salaries, and without the fringe benefits
they should receive by law, and besides there is an open
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The CEPAL report said that the Mexicans per capita GDP is below
Greece and Portugal, which had been until 1994 the nations with
the least per capita income of all the OECD partners.
</P>
<P>
A Household Income-Spending poll made by the National Institute
of Statistics, Geography, and Informatics (INEGI) determines that
the number of poor increased by 17 million between 1994 and 1999,
and now 40 million Mexicans are in extreme poverty.

<HEADLINE> New Offshore Oil Well Discovered in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Oil company BP/Amoco announced here
on Friday that it has discovered a new oil well in Angola's
offshore oil field Block 18, located some 185 kilometers off the
coast.
</P>
<P>
The well denominated as "Galio-1", which was perforated some
1,238 meters below the sea level, is the third consecutive well
discovered in the Block 18, where the BP/Amoco is the operator.
</P>
<P>
According to the official source of the Angolan National
Society of Petroleum (SONANGOL), the test production of the
newly-sunk well is some 4, 770 barrels of oil per day, with a
density of 34 degree API, which indicates the possibility of a
significant accumulation of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
In the Block 18, other two oil wells had been discovered and
respectively named as "Platina-1" and "Plutonio-1".
</P>
<P>
With the daily oil production of 750,000 barrels, Angola is the
second largest oil-producing country in Africa. The Angolan
government divided the offshore waters into several exploring
blocks.
</P>
<P>
Foreign oil companies have to bid for the authority of
exploration in each block.

<HEADLINE> IMF Needs No Changes: Kohler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 19 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund (
IMF) Managing Director Horst Kohler dismissed Friday here the
need of making changes inside this credit institution.
</P>
<P>
Kohler said during a press conference in the 27th meeting of
governors of Central Banks of America and the 70th of Governors of
Central Banks of Latin America and Spain, that the IMF has played
"a good and positive" role in the recent Asia, Russia, and Brazil
crises.
</P>
<P>
The new IMF managing director said that the discussions being
held with the people in charge of the central banks contribute to
improve their functioning and the efficiency to "focalize" the
tasks of the organization.
</P>
<P>
Kohler said that the institution must concentrate itself on
working with the international financial systems and to advise the
monetary policies of the governments.
</P>
<P>
The new ideas will help to strengthen the work of the IMF as an
institution that must contribute to promote the economies, reduce
the volatility of the international markets and assist the
emerging countries to have access to the private markets of
capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that the volatility seen now in the international
markets because of the United States rises in the interest rates,
which "is not new," is a cause of concern.
</P>
<P>
Finally, he dismissed a financial crisis at the end of the
present Mexican government of Ernesto Zedillo, like the others
occurred in other years, and he estimates that the electoral
process will not affect the development of the economy, because
there have been democratic advances.

NEW YORK, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell broadly
Friday as the rising U.S. trade deficit sparked worries about more
hike in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 150.43 at 10,626.
85. The blue chip index rose 7.54 points Thursday.

</P>
<P>
The Dow index ended the week with a loss of 17.48 points while

The market tumbled today after the Commerce Department reported
that the U.S. trade deficit hit the high of 30.2 billion U.S.
dollars in march, a 5.1 percent increase from 28.7 billion dollars
in February. The new economic data showed more sign of inflation
and could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates again.

<P>
The Federal Reserve raised rates Tuesday for the six time since
last June in an effort to keep inflation at bay and warned
investors of possible increase later this year. The stock market
has suffered from the higher rates.
