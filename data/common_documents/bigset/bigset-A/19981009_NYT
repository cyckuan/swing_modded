STARS-GAZING: A 7-MONTH JOURNY TO STANLEY TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yu don't win a Stanley Cup without planning. Then again, it's
difficult to plan for the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   That's the quandary facing the Stars as they prepare for the
1998-99 season, scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. tomorrowwhen the
Buffalo Sabres and goalie Dominik Hasek, the reigning and two-time
MVP, visit Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed we had a pretty good chance at the start of the
playoffs last season, but then the injuries got to us,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``So it's hard to look that far in
advance.''
</P>
<P>
   But obvious key moments await as the Stars try to turn a room
full of talent into Stanley Cup champions. It won't be easy, with
Hitchcock emphasizing that the team must remain one of the top
defensive groups in the NHL, while acknowledging that the Stars'
biggest problem in last season's playoffs was that the team didn't
score enough goals.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he knows there are issues, but he also said the
team can't solve its problems without playing games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never plan more than 30 days in advance,'' he said. ``We
take it month by month and week by week.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how some of those months and weeks might unfold:
October Key stat: Seven home games, two on the road. Key dates:
Stars raise Presidents' Trophy banner tomorrow. The first
appearance of San Jose Sharks defenseman and Public Enemy No. 1
Bryan Marchment to Reunion Arena, on Oct. 24. The first rematch
with defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings, on Oct. 31
at Reunion Arena. Key issues: Hitchcock has emphasized that if the
line of Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen isn't defensively
responsible, he will break them up. Hitchcock's target date for the
experiment is one month.
</P>
<P>
   When does Joe Nieuwendyk return and will he be bothered by his
injured knees? He said he wants to err on the side of caution, and
he knows his body well. Nieuwendyk interacting with linemates Pat
Verbeek and Jamie Langenbrunner, as well as with Hull and Modano on
the power play, will be crucial to the team's success. November Key
stat: Of 10 games in November, nine are against playoff teams from
last season. Key dates: Stars make first visit to Joe Louis Arena
in Detroit on Friday the 13th _ why does that sound bad? Brett Hull
makes first return to St. Louis, on Nov. 21. Key issues: In the
Stars' trip to San Jose, tough guy Brent Severyn will likely be
pushed to the wall by the Sharks and the rivalry. How Severyn reads
his team's need for physical play and fighting will be a key.
Timing his fights is as important as winning them.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have to win convincingly in Detroit to show they can
compete with the Stanley Cup champions.
December Key stat: 10 of 15 games on the road, including five-game
trip sandwiched around Christmas. Key dates: Four-game West Coast
road trip to start the month tests the durability of Stars'
television-watching fan base. Second and final trip to Detroit, on
Dec. 18. Key issues: By now, the Stars have likely suffered
injuries, and the heavy road schedule will test that. By the end of
the month, the Stars will have played the Sharks four times and
will have played 10 games in their physical division.
</P>
<P>
   With games against Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Toronto and
Nashville, the Stars need to prove they can beat lesser teams on a
consistent basis.
January Key stat: Eight of 12 games against nonplayoff teams from
last season. Key dates: Longest road trip of the season takes Stars
to West Coast and Canada for five games Jan. 7-15. All-Star Game on
Jan. 24 in Tampa, Fla. Make reservations early, Stars players could
be filling hotels with friends and family. Key issues: If the
mental welfare of the team is an issue, this month could test it
most severely. The Stars are loaded with potential goal-scorers in
Hull, Modano, Nieuwendyk and Pat Verbeek _ yet it's likely at least
one or two will be left off the All-Star team. Does a potential
slight harm the chemistry of the team?
February Key stat: nine of 12 games at home. Key games: Avalanche
come to town for two Sunday afternoon games Feb. 7 and 21.
</P>
<P>
   Only visit of Pittsburgh Penguins and Jaromir Jagr, on Feb. 26.
Don't get too excited, last season was a 0-0 tie. Key issues: There
is the chance that Roman Turek could be playing better than Ed
Belfour at this stage, particularly in key games. Will the Stars
test Turek's ability as a possible replacement for Belfour or do
they quash a potential controversy by playing Belfour as much as he
likes?
</P>
<P>
   By this time, the Stars will have been taken a good look at
rookie Jamie Wright and potential looks at Jason Botterill or Jon
Sim with the Michigan K-Wings. If they hope to use any of the
rookies on a regular basis, now is the time to start working them
into the lineup.
March Key stat: 10 road games out of 15, 10 games against playoff
teams from last season. Key games: Stars in a New York state of
mind with road games against Rangers (second), Islanders (fourth)
and Sabres (fifth). Stars' only game with Flyers this season is
March 14 in Philadelphia. New schedule means Flyers don't visit
Texas. Key issues: It's hard to imagine that the Stars need
anything to add to the mix, but the trade deadline in late March
will provide interesting discussion. Do the Stars seek a guarantee
for the Stanley Cup and spend more?
April Key stat: Five-game homestand April 4-14. Key games: Hull
returns again to St. Louis. April 3. Stars play host to Red Wings
on April 4. Wow, what a weekend. Wayne Gretzky makes only trip to
Reunion Arena with New York Rangers, on April 9. Key issues: Stars
played near perfect in April last season and appeared ready to
crush any opponent. With five-game homestand including meeting with
Red Wings, they should again be trying to shape into form.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's philosophy is always to ask 100 percent from his
players, but there will be questions whether he should rest players
early in the month _ or in late March _ to get them ready for the
playoffs.

BROWN'S IN CHARGE, AND SO ARE PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before this National League Championship Series began,
John Smoltz had warned that, no matter what happened to the Atlanta
Braves this year, when fans looked back on the 1990s they would
finally realize how good they had it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves look back on the last two seasons, though, all
they are likely to see are bad memories of Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive time in the last two league
championship series, Brown took it to the Braves. Brown, a
33-year-old right-hander, tossed a three-hit shutout Thursday
night, struck out 11 and singled twice, during the game's only two
fruitful rallies, as the San Diego Padres beat the Braves, 3-0,
before 43,083 fans at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The victory sent the four-of-seven-game series to San Diego for
the weekend with the Padres in command, two games to none. They are
two victories short of reaching the World Series for the first time
since 1984. Worse for Atlanta, which will start Greg Maddux on
Saturday, is the fact that since the league championship series
went to a four-of-seven format, in 1985, no team in either league
has ever advanced to the Series after losing the first two games at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has now defeated Atlanta six straight times, dating from
September 1996, and Thursday night he did it with 122 pitches, 79
of which were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Braves scrap their way back into this series, they
will have to face Brown one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Brown guarded a 1-0 lead through the eighth inning Thursday
night, then triggered a two-run San Diego ninth with an
inning-opening single. He defeated Atlanta twice for the Florida
Marlins in a six-game upset of the Braves in the NLCS last fall.
The Padres might not need that many games this year.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Padres outlasted the Braves by 3-2 on Ken
Caminiti's 10th-inning home run in Game 1 on Thursday morning, Tony
Gwynn said his underdog Padres had originally come to Atlanta just
hoping for a split.
</P>
<P>
   ``You change your thinking,'' Gwynn said after Game 1. ``Now,
you go for two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres did so without their best power hitter, Greg Vaughn,
who strained his left quadriceps muscle on the wet outfield grass
of Turner Field chasing a line drive in the fourth inning of Game
1. There was a chance that Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs this
season, could be out for the remainder of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sore and it's hard to say how long,'' San Diego Manager
Bruce Bochy said Thursday afternoon. ``The doctors think possibly
three to four days, but it could be up to 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan said he felt as if he had let his teammates down. ``We
got to this point and I can't play,'' he said. ``I don't know how
long they said I'm going to be out, but it's not going to be that
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he hoped to be ready to play left field in Game 3 on
Saturday in San Diego. Bochy and general manager Kevin Towers did
not sound so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best-case scenario is that he will be ready in time for
the first couple of games back home,'' Towers said. ``But the
worst-case scenario is that Greg might not be ready until the end
of this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Rivera, the 24-year-old outfielder the New York Yankees
traded to San Diego on May 30, 1997, as part of the deal in which
they obtained Hideki Irabu's negotiating rights, did just fine as
Vaughn's replacement Wednesday night. It was Rivera's hitting and
daring base running in the eighth inning that gave the Padres a
short-lived lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera was less impressive Thursday night, going 0 or 5 with
three strikeouts. The Padres could have used Vaughn in the middle
of their order Thursday night. Tom Glavine was uncharacteristically
wild. He walked a season-high six Thursday night, including
Caminiti in his first three at-bats, and Wally Joyner in his first
two.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the walks hurt Glavine, who threw 31 pitches in the
second inning and 26 in the third, and left the bases loaded both
times.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was a little sharper. He struck out the side in the first,
but walked the first two batters he faced in the second, before
pitching out of the jam. Two innings later, Brown was able to
induce Javy Lopez into an inning-ending pop-up to left field with
runners on second and third.
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth, Glavine's pitch count had reached 100. An inning
later, the Padres finally broke through. With two out and nobody
on, Glavine allowed a single between short and third to Chris
Gomez, his second hit of the game. Up stepped Brown, who had taken
a called third strike to leave the bases loaded in the second.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-2 count, Brown grounded a single between short and third,
and the Padres, 0 for 8 with runners in scoring position, had
runners on first and second.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they came through. On Glavine's 121st pitch of the
game, Quilvio Veras singled up the middle to score Gomez. Andruw
Jones' throw from center skipped away from Lopez, but Glavine
backed up the play, and his throw to third was in time to get the
sliding Brown to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown had helped create one run. And he was enough for the
Padres to create all sorts of trouble for the Braves by heading
west with an improbable sweep of the first two games in Atlanta. &QL;

SENATE RIVALS JUGGLE DUTIES AND DENUNCIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the Republican National Committee on Second
Street, allies of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., held a news
conference Thursday to chide Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
D'Amato's challenger, for missing 90 percent of the House Judiciary
Committee's votes this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato, the tough campaigner, is staying here in
Washington doing his job and making his votes, while Schumer is
running around the state campaigning at taxpayer expense,'' said
Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Barely two hours later, at the Democratic National Committee on
South Capitol Street, Schumer and two Democratic senators attacked
D'Amato for opposing gun control and accepting $36,000 in campaign
contributions from the National Rifle Association during his 18
years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has done everything that the National Rifle
Association has asked for,'' Schumer said. ``If there were ever a
clearer case of a senator from New York siding with the special
interests rather than the people's interests, I haven't seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinched in one of the nation's closest Senate races this year,
Schumer and D'Amato have brought their bare-fisted campaigns 350
miles south to Capitol Hill, where Congress is rushing to finish an
overflowing schedule by this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' end-of-the-session sprint has produced an odd and
awkward geographic challenge to the candidates, who are trying to
conduct their legislative business while grabbing the attention of
voters and news media that are at least a 60-minute plane ride
away.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have sought to make the most of this juggling
act all week. But while this has been something of a new task for
Schumer, it is very much in keeping with the style of D'Amato, who
has focused his time, and public relations efforts, on Washington
all year.
</P>
<P>
   The differences say much about the two men's contrasting
political needs. Schumer, largely unknown in large swaths of the
state, has needed to campaign more than D'Amato back home. And
D'Amato, facing a candidate who is running on his lengthy
legislative resume, has sought to cast himself as the state's most
effective legislator, someone who gets bills passed against the
odds.
</P>
<P>
   So it is that in recent weeks, as Schumer has been traveling
about New York, D'Amato has ensconced himself in Washington,
testifying for acid rain legislation, helping negotiate a sweeping
banking bill, and speaking at a commemorative event for Nelson
Mandela, the South African president.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the nimble-footed politician, D'Amato has also tried to
seize on Schumer's spotty attendance record by citing it in
television commercials, news conferences by surrogates and campaign
remarks as evidence that the congressman ``puts politics ahead of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's aides say the strategy is intended to strike at the
heart of what Schumer considers his strongest political asset: his
legislative record and widely accepted reputation as an effective
lawmaker. The aides say they think they can also cast Schumer as a
publicity-grabbing opportunist.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer's aides contend that D'Amato's Washington campaign
is really intended to mask what they consider the senator's
greatest liabilities: a lack of interest in legislation, a
reputation for placing politics ahead of policy and high negative
ratings among many New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic strategists contend that D'Amato is so concerned
about his weak approval ratings that he has done his best to avoid
public events in New York, even to the point of not appearing in
his own television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man's been there 18 years,'' said Hank Morris, Schumer's
media consultant. ``He has a negative rating. And his handlers are
smart enough that they don't want to remind people of him. He knows
he can't win an up or down vote on him. He has to try to turn this
into two bad choices.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's campaign Thursday released a study of the Judiciary
Committee votes Schumer had missed, showing that he had
participated in only 21 of 267 votes this year. Among those he
missed were votes on bills dealing with sexual abuse of children,
anti-drug-abuse programs and parents who fail to pay child support.

EDITORIAL: COMPETITION FOR CREDIT CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Americans are bombarded constantly by telephone and mail
solicitations for credit cards, offering all sorts of incentives to
apply. So it may be hard for many to believe that Visa and
Mastercard, which dominate the field, are guilty of restricting the
choices for consumers, as the Justice Department charged in an
antitrust suit filed this week. But the department has marshaled
impressive evidence that these two credit card companies have
conspired to stifle competition between themselves and keep other
competitors out.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when the credit card phenomenon got under way,
each bank offered either Visa or Mastercard. But in the years
since, banks have generally offered both on the same terms. The
core of the antitrust argument is that because Visa and Mastercard
are both effectively owned by the same large alliances of banks,
they have little incentive to improve services and win customers
away from each other, since doing so would simply siphon profits
from one network into the other.
</P>
<P>
   Many banks are also barred by the terms of their Visa and
Mastercard agreements from offering any other cards, like American
Express or Discover, according to the department. The suit argues
further that if there had been more competition between them, Visa
and Mastercard would have offered many new services by now,
including ``smart cards'' with stored information like airline and
hotel preferences, identification codes, medical data and the like.
Plans for such technology were shelved by Mastercard after Visa
said it was opposed to introducing such a product, according to the
suit.
</P>
<P>
   These are serious charges that deserve scrutiny in court. The
credit card industry argues that there is already plenty of
competition among banks on credit terms for their cards, and says
that is the reason their credit cards generally require no annual
fees and provide tens of thousands of dollars worth of unsecured
credit.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card companies contend that government intervention
in an already competitive marketplace could prove disruptive. But
at a time of growing consolidation in the financial services
industry, the Justice Department is right to be concerned that
competition among cards not be constrained.

EDITORIAL: HUGE GAINS, AND HUGE WORRIES, ON AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   The medical accomplishment has been astonishing. Not many years
ago infection with the virus that causes AIDS was considered a
death sentence. Virtually everyone infected, except for rare
individuals with a peculiar natural resistance, would inexorably
develop symptoms, become progressively sicker, and die. It might
take 10 years or more for the virus to destroy the body's immune
system, leaving it vulnerable to attack by a host of opportunistic
infections, but the end was invariably the same _ premature death
for individuals who were mostly in the prime of life.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the advent of drugs to attack the virus itself and to
treat the pneumonias and other infections that typically administer
the coup de grace. Most important was the development in recent
years of powerful new cocktails of drugs that provided the most
effective treatment yet for neutralizing the virus. Suddenly people
who thought they were doomed had a new hold on life. The number of
deaths from AIDS in the United States fell by 29 percent in 1996
and by a spectacular 47 percent last year, the largest single-year
decline ever recorded for any major disease.
</P>
<P>
   That is cause for jubilation, but not for a declaration of
victory. As many as 900,000 Americans remain infected with the AIDS
virus, and the rate of new infections is holding steady in the
United States at some 40,000 a year. Now that infected individuals
are living longer and healthier lives, there is an increasing
danger that they will pass the virus on to others.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the virus is spreading at a frightening rate in Africa
and other parts of the developing world, where large parts of the
population are infected and there is neither money nor medical
capacity to provide lifesaving drugs. The world will not be rid of
this scourge until breakthroughs in vaccines or prevention
strategies can stop the spread of infection before any curative
treatment is needed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Oct. 9:
</P>
<P>
   By becoming the third president to face an impeachment inquiry,
Bill Clinton has secured an unfortunate historic distinction that
he provoked with reckless personal actions and self-defeating
political and legal tactics. But he was able to forestall the wave
of defections that the White House had feared. In the end, only 31
Democrats crossed over to vote for the Republican resolution that
passed 258 to 176. The debate was harsh, but at last the road ahead
is clear. While the Democrats favored a shorter, less expansive
inquiry, they in effect conceded that the nation deserves a formal
conclusion to the charges of lying under oath, witness-tampering
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   That is the proper direction. Absent a negotiated settlement,
the debate over whether Clinton's behavior is merely unwise or
violative of the law and the Constitution needs to move forward on
the path provided by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The vote highlighted a striking and probably permanent reality
of this president's image. As a political personality, Clinton has
been stripped of defenders in the Congress or outside it. One of
his most dogged House supporters, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, called
Clinton's behavior ``outrageous, reprehensible and disappointing.''
The prominent New Yorkers who ran an ad in this newspaper earlier
this week defending Clinton against impeachment nonetheless noted
that the president had ``destroyed his own dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   The real importance of the vote was that it allows a weighing of
the legal and constitutional implications of this much-condemned
behavior. It also provided a more orderly forum for other questions
of considerable weight, including the issues of prosecutorial
conduct and invasion of privacy that worry many citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's debate on the legal case, the essence of the
Democratic argument remained that Clinton's behavior was repugnant
but that his was an individual failing rather than an offense
against the state that warrants removal from office. As its most
elemental, the Republican response is that by lying under oath and
sending others out to make sworn statements he knew to be false the
president failed in his constitutional duty to see that the laws
are faithfully executed.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence so far, we regard Clinton's false testimony as
an offense against the rule of law that Congress cannot ignore. In
a nation whose legal system depends on sworn testimony and where
plain citizens are prosecuted for lying, there cannot be a special
standard for presidents who lie under oath. That has led this page
and many citizens of all stations to advocate a censure conditioned
on Clinton's admission of lying under oath and provided that we
have seen the worst evidence against him. But we accept the
political reality that a plea bargain is not likely before the Nov.
3 election.
</P>
<P>
   The public is clearly getting used to the idea of slogging on
with a flawed leader, and an impeachment inquiry could allow for a
valuable airing of other issues. We take seriously the debates over
Kenneth Starr's tactics, over whether the investigation of Clinton
raises privacy dangers for the general society and whether Clinton
has been denied the rights of a common citizen.
</P>
<P>
   On these issues it is important to remember how Congress arrived
at the point of having to vote on an impeachment inquiry. By
settling on a strategy of personal attacks, lying and possibly
enlisting others in those enterprises rather than settling the
Paula Jones lawsuit, Clinton embarked on a course that seriously
distended the legal system. His personal privacy was intact until
he invited a discovery process in which he knew he would have to
dissemble to hide his reckless stewardship of his office. As the
Democrats repeatedly noted Thursday, the president has said he is
sorry. But the House correctly said that is not enough.

KARIYA SHAKEN, STIRRED, READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Kariya's life was rended by a temblor so terrible that the
aftershocks continue to reverberate throughout the NHL. In fewer
seconds than it took a Northridge apartment complex to crumble, the
career of one of hockey's designated guardians was cleaved from its
foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter was the Arrowhead Pond, on Feb. 1. Defenseman Gary
Suter, then with the Chicago Blackhawks, cross-checked Kariya in
the jaw after the league's preeminent left winger had scored. It
would be a few minutes before Kariya woozily got up and a few
months before the fog that settled inside his head totally lifted.
</P>
<P>
   He sat out the remainder of the season, struggling to shake the
cumulative effects of his fourth concussion. The 23-year-old will
be back on the ice when the Mighty Ducks open their sixth season
Saturday at Washington, D.C., for the same reason most of us
returned to our homes after the 1994 Northridge earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   You live in Southern California, you resign yourself to the fact
the earth beneath your feet is going to shake now and then. You
play hockey for a living, you figure you're going to get hit.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya is aware of the risks he is taking by returning to the
ice. How can he sugarcoat his circumstances when a respected expert
in the field of brain injuries has come right out and said he would
advise him not to play?
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, Kariya is not ready to pull up the skates on a
career he has been building since he was a teen-ager in Vancouver,
B.C. So he is going to continue on as he did before Suter's blow
and leave the worrying to the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (another concussion) happens, it happens, and I'll have to
deal with it at that time,'' Kariya said recently at the Ducks'
practice facility in Anaheim. ``So far, I feel great. I don't even
think about what happened. It's totally out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Or would be, anyway, if reporters didn't continue to ask about
it. The fact is, head injuries are a legitimate concern in the NHL.
Pat LaFontaine, a diminutive (5-foot-10) dervish the same as
Kariya, recently announced his retirement after suffering his sixth
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   How many more skaters will be lost before the players stop
swinging their sticks like baseball bats? The league has notified
teams that it intends to mete out severe discipline for any
deliberate action by a player that is directed to the head of an
opponent or results in a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably that means no more puny four-game suspensions like
the one Suter served for his crosscheck on Kariya. And yet there's
reason to wonder if the seriousness of the situation is escaping
notice by everybody from the NHL front office types on down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Tampa Bay left wing Andrei Nazarov cross-checked
Florida center Rob Niedermayer in the back of the head. The NHL
should have acted swiftly to suspend Nazarov, especially
considering Niedermayer suffered two concussions that sidelined him
for most of last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the league did nothing, making you wonder how meaningful are
the NHL's own missives. The league's silence this week has been
like a cross-check to the gut of Niedermayer, who wonders what
it'll take for the NHL to start protecting its most valuable
investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kariya is) a draw, somebody fans want to watch,''
Niedermayer, who was selected directly after Kariya in the 1993
draft, told the Sun-Sentinel. ``And you have guys who can't even
play the game just skating around and hitting these people. It's
ridiculous. If they (gave stiffer penalties) it would make these
guys think twice about doing something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kariya has the right idea, calling for the abolishment of
the instigator penalty so players are free to police the ice
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody has got to play the bad cop. If it's not going to be
Colin Campbell, the league's new director of hockey operations,
then why not the likes of newly acquired Ducks enforcers Stu
Grimson and Jim McKenzie?
</P>
<P>
   Grimson, aka ``The Grim Reaper,'' was part of the inaugural
Ducks team in 1993-94. Before being traded to Detroit in April of
1995, Grimson dressed alongside Kariya for 31 games during Kariya's
rookie season. The Ducks made an offseason deal with the Carolina
Hurricanes to get Grimson back to watch Kariya's back.
</P>
<P>
   The Kariya who Grimson first got to know took hockey so
seriously he seldom permitted himself a smile. The player he
returned to find is much more approachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first thing I noticed about Paul when I came
back,'' Grimson said. ``He's still very intense but he has found a
way to enjoy himself at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you'd have to be a Buckingham Palace guard not to laugh
in the presence of fun-loving forward Teemu Selanne, who led the
Ducks in scoring last season. But there's more to the unbuttoning
of Kariya than that. He can't help but revel in where he is,
considering where he came from.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time in April when the headaches seemed to get worse
instead of better, making Kariya confront the possibility of a life
without hockey. ``I don't know what I would have done,'' he said.
``It's basically been my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope here is that it remains so for a long time. &QL;

MENASHE ZEMRO, 92; LED ETHIOPIAN JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Menashe Zemro, the last remaining ques, or traditional spiritual
leader of Ethiopian Jews, died Wednesday in Qiryat Gat, the town
where he settled after arriving in Israel in 1991. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   His funeral Thursday in Qiryat Gat, in southern Israel,
attracted thousands of mourners, but Israeli television reported
that no representatives of the Orthodox rabbinate, Israel's
governing religious body, were present. By the rabbinate's ruling,
Ques Menashe and other Ethiopian Jewish leaders were not authorized
to officiate at ceremonies like weddings and funerals, as they had
done in Ethiopia, and were indeed not to be called rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly ignoring this caution, Addisu Masala, a member of
Parliament of Ethiopian origin who spoke at the funeral, called
Ques Menashe ``the chief rabbi of the Ethiopian Jewish community in
both Ethiopia and Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rabbinate's ruling, until shortly before his death
Ques Menashe counseled the steady stream of Ethiopian Jews who
accepted his authority and sought his wisdom in his ground floor
apartment and adjoining chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Shoshana Ben-Dor, an anthropologist in Jerusalem and the
director in Israel for the North American Conference on Ethiopian
Jewry, said Ques Menashe was ``very unhappy that the traditional
forms of Judaism that he had practiced were not being accepted by
Israel authorities and were being allowed to disappear.``
</P>
<P>
   Ques Menashe never learned to speak Hebrew, but in his native
Amharic and in other languages of Ethiopia, he would caution his
followers to bear the trials of immigration with patience and
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Such cautions were not always heeded: A little more than a year
after his arrival, 16 Ethiopian Jews were arrested as they rushed
into the prime minister's office to demand that the rabbinate treat
Ques Menashe and his colleagues no differently than other rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ben-Dor said that the leader was vigorous for his age and
that his most striking physical quality were ``eyes that were
incredibly mischievous.'' She said it was likely he had come to
adulthood without awareness of the scale, scope and history of
Jewish life in Europe or America.
</P>
<P>
   Masala said Ques Menashe was survived by several children and
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia's Jews, known as Falasha or Beta Israel, traced their
origins to Solomonic times but had long been separated from other
Jews. Their communities had the Torah but never acquired the Talmud
or the medieval commentaries that shaped modern Judaism, and
conducted their rites in Geez, a Semitic language that is also used
in Christian liturgy.
</P>
<P>
   Graenum Berger, 90, of New Rochelle, N.Y., who began a campaign
more than 30 years ago to help rebuild the Falasha community, said
that in addition to conducting rites, a ques is responsible for
memorizing the genealogy of his congregation, going back as far as
10 generations, and maintaining prohibitions on marriage with
non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ben-Dor said that each region where Jews lived in Ethiopia
had a chief ques, and that Ques Menashe had held this position in
Semien and Wogera, north of Gondar, the historical heartland of
Ethiopian Jews. She said that as many as 20 percent of the 45,000
Jews who have settled in Israel since 1974 originated in this
region, but with the deaths of two other regional leaders, many
from beyond the area looked to Ques Menashe as a leader. The title
of ques is gained through learning.
</P>
<P>
   Ques Menashe came to Israel as part of the last wave of
Ethiopian Jewish emigration. Israel arranged for most of the
migrants to be airlifted out, and in the 15 years before his
arrival, much of the migration had been carried out in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ben-Dor said that while other figures of similar religious
rank had come from Ethiopia earlier, their arrival could not be
publicized.
</P>
<P>
   There are now about 70 Ethiopian Jewish spiritual leaders in
Israel, The Associated Press reported, but they are elderly and no
longer possess even the local authority they had in Ethiopia. There
are younger Ethiopian Jews who are pursuing Orthodox rabbinical
studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person like him doesn't exist anymore,'' said Masala, the
legislator. ``It looks like he was the last.``

AIR QUALITY IN PHOENIX STILL FALLING SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite recent reports that Phoenix has cleaned up its summer
air pollution, a new, stricter federal ozone standard is expected
to show that the air continues to harm people with respiratory
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix area would have violated the new standard 36 times
from May through July, according to a report released by the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group and its Arizona affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frequently asked question is, `Is Arizona's air getting
better?' '' said Carl Perry, the group's Arizona organizer. ``And
the answer is, `Not yet.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's success in meeting the existing federal standard
for ozone has suggested that the quality of the region's air is
improving. For the second summer in a row, levels of ozone stayed
below the maximum level allowed by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But clean-air advocates say the new rule, which will take effect
in 2000, more accurately reflects ozone's toll on health.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do today is declare a state of
emergency,'' said David Feuerherd, program director for the
American Lung Association of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The research group, which analyzed air-quality data from 41
states and the District of Columbia, reported at least 5,208
violations throughout the nation between April 5 and Sept. 14 of
this year. California led the states with 1,025 violations. North
Carolina was second, at 517.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had far fewer _ 41, including five in Yuma. The
measurements in Arizona were taken during three months this summer,
rather than five as in most other states.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerherd reeled off a list of things the Arizona Legislature
could do to cut down on ozone-forming emissions, ranging from
tighter vehicle-emissions standards, to getting old cars off the
road, to banning such gas-powered lawn equipment as mowers and leaf
blowers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Angie Weaver of Phoenix said she suffered from the
effects of ozone, even though this was supposed to be a clean
summer in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A smoker who lived in smoggy Los Angeles, Weaver said she didn't
come down with asthmatic conditions until she moved to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I experienced symptoms was this summer,'' she
said. She now uses an inhaler and stays indoors during extreme
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver, who since has quit smoking, said her doctor attributed
her asthmatic condition in part to the Valley's smog and dust.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors examined local air pollution data from this
summer and projected how it would measure up to the new standard.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new standard, air is considered dangerously polluted
when concentrations of smog reach .085 parts per million during an
eight-hour period. The idea is to mirror real life by setting the
health standard for prolonged exposure to the pollutant. The
current standard is 0.12 parts per million over one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Perry acknowledged that no matter when the new rule kicks in,
the pollution is there for people to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mountain of evidence showed the old standard didn't
adequately protect public health,'' he said. Based on that, the EPA
adopted the tougher standard last year.
</P>
<P>
   The report's findings are consistent with those of the Arizona
Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Local regulators say they don't know what could be done to bring
the area into compliance under the new standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix, clearly, is going to be non-attainment,'' said Gary
Neuroth, air-quality assesment manager at DEQ. ``Yuma, it's
questionable. And Tucson, too.'' &QL;

McCUTCHEON FACES ANOTHER CHALLENGE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There may be the impression he was burned by
Florida State's Peter Warrick, but USC cornerback Daylon McCutcheon
said he still feels like he's having an excellent season.
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon will receive another stiff test Saturday when he
faces California's Dameane Douglas, the third-leading wide receiver
in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon's not feeling any pressure, however, even if the
public perception had Warrick getting the best of the Trojans' top
defensive back two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think about it. I played a good game against
Florida State,'' McCutcheon said. ``He caught three passes (on me)
and they threw at me seven times.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, McCutcheon graded out at a score of 82 against
Arizona State. He gave up a deep ball, but also broke up a
fourth-and-goal pass attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They threw at me eight times and had three completions. And I
had three deflections,'' McCutcheon said. ``I don't want to give up
any catches, but I think I played a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   McCutcheon's role may be expanding in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   If tailback Chad Morton doesn't improve soon, USC coach Paul
Hackett said he might have to ponder some other options _ including
McCutcheon on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daylon is one (possibility),'' Hackett said. ``(Freshman
tailback) Sultan McCullough is another. If Chad's no better, we'll
have to be concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton update: Morton showed improvement Thursday after
receiving treatment on his back. He will run today and Hackett said
he will make a game-time decision on whether Morton will play
against California.
</P>
<P>
   USC clarified Morton's injury Thursday, terming it a ``lumbar
contusion.'' The injury occurred when Morton was hit in the back
while scoring a touchdown against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   It is not related to the back strain he suffered last month
while doing leg squats, although it was originally said to be a
re-aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   If Morton does not play, and his condition does not improve next
week, USC will consider an MRI test on his back. He has already
undergone X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he had not decided if Petros Papadakis or Frank
Strong would start.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen to start: With right tackle Matt Welch bothered by a sore
shoulder, senior Ken Bowen is expected to make his first start of
the season. Welch practiced Thursday and both are expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen becomes third tackle: Ryan Nielsen will be the third
defensive tackle in the rotation behind Ennis Davis and Aaron
Williams. Darren Collins could also play, but Hackett said he is
thinking about redshirting the JC transfer. Another possibility is
redshirt freshman Bobby DeMars.

BROWN DOMINATES BRAVES ON 3-HITTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Braves pitchers Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and
John Smoltz have six Cy Young Awards between them. Kevin Brown has
none, but it doesn't keep him from outpitching the Braves aces when
it counts the most.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's October supremacy over the Braves continued last night
with perhaps his best performance yet, a three-hit shutout that
carried the San Diego Padres to a 3-0 victory in Game 2 of the
National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Padres a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven
series with the next three games scheduled for San Diego's Qualcomm
Stadium. The possibility exists that the 43,083 fans at Turner
Field last night, many of whom turned a cold shoulder by booing the
Braves in the eighth inning, might have seen baseball live for the
last time in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more could you ask for than this,'' Brown said. ``This
was huge. It's a real moral victory to come in here and play this
well against a team the caliber of the Braves and the type of
pitching they have. It speaks to the heart and character of this
team to come in here and not be intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox acknowledged, ``You can't feel good
being down 0-2 but we have the type of ballclub and the type of
pitching that can reel off four in a row. Rather be 2-0 than 0-2,
but I think we can still rally back.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who beat the Braves twice in last year's NLCS while with
the Marlins, dominated this game like the big boy on the block
dominates Little League. Not only did he completely overwhelm the
Braves with his pitching, but he also had two singles that figured
prominently in all the Padres scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gomez, Brown and Quilvio Veras had three consecutive
two-out singles in the sixth to score a run and break up 0-0 duel
between Brown and Glavine. Brown then led off the ninth with a
single, and the Padres gave him a cushion by scoring two more runs
that inning.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely he needed them. Brown started the game by striking
out the side in the first inning and ended it by getting Chipper
Jones on a weak grounder and striking out Andres Galarraga and Ryan
Klesko in the ninth. The rest of the night was more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said he wasn't as good last night as he was in a
16-strikeout performance against Houston in Game 1 of the
Padres-Astros divisional series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to make adjustments and go with what was
working for me at the time,'' Brown said. ``Facing a team like the
Braves, with the type of club they have, I was trying a variety of
things, throwing everything up there but the kitchen sink. I was
making stuff up as I went along.''
</P>
<P>
   There were just two shaky moments. He walked Galarraga and
Klesko to start the second, but got Javier Lopez to hit into a
double play and Andruw Jones to ground out to shortstop. Brown also
threw a wild pitch that put runners on second and third in the
fourth before retiring Javier Lopez on a weak pop to left, ending
the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves managed just three singles, a couple of grounders by
Chipper Jones and Glavine that found a hole and a weak roller by
pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn that third baseman Ken Caminiti couldn't
come up with in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who retired 14 of the last 15 hitters he faced, walked
three and struck out 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him pitch the no-hitter against the Giants on
television, and I thought he had the same kind of stuff tonight
that he did in that game,'' Cox said. ``Against us, this was the
best he's ever thrown. I know my club, we were trying like crazy,
we just couldn't touch this guy. Houston has one of the best
hitting clubs in the league and they couldn't touch him \Rin the
division series\S either.''

DISNEY BRAND SET TO EXPAND WITH ESPN STORES' OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Walt Disney Co., continuing aggressive expansion
of its lucrative ESPN brand, plans to open two more ESPN stores
next month in Southern California, the Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The stores -- replete with video monitors, team apparel,
interactive kiosks and collectibles -- will open at the Del Amo
Fashion Center in Torrance and the Main Place at Santa Ana, a
Disney representative confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The original ESPN -- The Store opened a year ago at the Glendale
Galleria shopping center. Disney officials have reported strong
results from the 4,000-square-foot location and the new stores will

   Burbank-based Disney, widely regarded as the ablest marketer
among entertainment conglomerates, has been trying for the past
year to make the sports cable network and its logo ubiquitous by
launching retailing, restaurants and publishing operations. An
industry tracker said ESPN, which gears broadcasts toward the
coveted segment of males between 18 and 34, has plenty of room for
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, by extending the brand further into retail stores,
they're still not in any danger of overexposure,'' said retail
consultant Mark Kissel of Rockville, Md. ``More stores are a way to
further leverage what Disney's already got.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, with 75 million U.S. subscribers and three cable
affiliates, has been by far the most valuable part of Disney's $19
billion acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC in 1996. Analysts have
forecast ESPN, which peppers telecasts with humor and insider
jargon, will generate more than $600 million in operating profit on
revenues of nearly $2 billion this year -- profits well above any
of the three major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's decision to boost ESPN's exposure comes a month after
it announced a deal with Sears to open 450 ESPN shops within Sears
stores by next spring. It launched ESPN Magazine in March and the
ESPN Zone restaurant in June in Baltimore and plans to open
eateries next year in Chicago and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives have said they plan to open hundreds of ESPN
stores in the coming years but have not been more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they choose to saturate the market and go into every
regional mall, it could cut a new frontier for sporting goods
stores,'' Kissel said. ``The idea of combining an electronic
broadcast product with apparel is very clever, because those are
two types of products that are more and more dependent on each
other. Selling team apparel is entrenched; it's gone from wearing
something for a school you like to wearing something because you
like the colors.''

   Privately held Hearst Corp. owns 20 percent of ESPN.

MALONE CONFIDENT HE CAN LURE ALOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin Malone heard the Montreal Expos plea to Felipe Alou. He
has heard it before.
</P>
<P>
   Big dreams of a big stadium and the chance to build the Expos
into a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, that is one of the reasons I left Montreal,'' said
Malone, the Expos general manager in 1994-95 and now the Dodgers
GM. ``They were always excited about the future but the future
never came.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, however, also knows he was just passing through when he
was in Montreal. Alou, 63, has been with the organization for 24
years and is its most popular figure.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers new GM remains confident he can make Alou his
team's next manager by the end of the World Series, even though the
Expos say they will do whatever it takes to keep him in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sensitive to Felipe's concerns, that he wants to do
right by his family and his friends in Montreal,'' said Malone, who
has spent the past three days in the Dominican Republic speaking to
Alou. ``I believe he will make the right decision. He is encouraged
and excited about the opportunities of the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lifestyle decision as much as anything. But even
though he is known as a great manager and developer of talent, I
think at this stage of his career, he wants to win a World Series.
We offer him that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Montreal, the cost-conscious Expos unveiled a new
plan to extend the deadline for funding a new downtown stadium and
get Alou to be there when it opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not an issue,'' said Expos general manager Jim
Beattie, who insists the Expos plan to match any offer the Dodgers
make Alou. ``We are going to try our damnedest to keep him in
Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   With two teams aggressively pursuing Alou, the contract offers
could go pretty high. On Monday, the Colorado Rockies signed
manager Jim Leyland to a three-year contract worth $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Four days earlier, Leyland opted out of the final three years
and $4.5 million with the Florida Marlins, where he won the World
Series last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those numbers will have an impact on the market
because everything is like free agency now,'' Malone said. ``But I
don't see those kinds of numbers here, although I don't think this
will come down to a money issue with Felipe.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers can offer Alou the luxury of a $75 million
payroll and the nearly unlimited financial resources of Rupert
Murdoch's NewsCorp. Last season, the Expos had a payroll of $13
million, which was not expected to rise in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Montreal has traded many of Alou's top players,
including Pedro Martinez, Larry Walker, Marquis Grissom and John
Wetteland to keep the Expos' bottom line near the bottom of the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But with the blessing of new commissioner Bud Selig, who was in
Montreal last week when the new ballpark appeared dead, the Expos
now have five more months to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   They also appear ready to infuse capital into the club by adding
several new owners. Claude Brochu, who has served as the mouthpiece
for the organization despite owning just 7.6 percent of the club,
will be bought out, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Brochu originally attempted to get $150 million from the
government, $75 million from the province of Quebec and $75 million
from the federal government. That plan was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, the government would kick in a total of $75
million, with the new owner putting in the rest.

IRISH HOT TICKET; ABC IRKS UA 
</HEADLINE>
  TV-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notre Dame's football team arrived Thursday night in the Valley,
where tickets are hot, and so are Arizona fans and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers are receiving up to $350 for tickets to Saturday's
sold-out game between the Fighting Irish and Arizona State at Sun
Devil Stadium. The game will be televised by ABC, whose decision to
select it over Arizona-UCLA has irked Wildcats supporters, who
believe the meeting between the nation's No. 3 and No. 10 teams
deserves top billing.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's policy for this game was to offer the tickets to only
season-ticket holders, leaving Notre Dame's legion of fans
scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame alumni club of Phoenix has 1,600 members.
Thousands of other graduates live in the Valley, not to mention
Notre Dame's famous (or infamous) ``Subway Alumni.'' Some bought
season tickets just so they could attend the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still getting a lot of calls, people trying to buy and
sell,'' said Pat Dugan, spokesman for the Phoenix alumni club. ``We
have ASU season-ticket holders trying to sell their tickets, but we
won't take their name if they're selling for over face value.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket agencies are selling tickets from $45 to $350. None would
go on the record because of a recent decision among the owners to
not speak to the media, but several said privately that sales have
been strong and availability has been good. ASU's disappointing 2-3
start may have prompted some fair-weather season-ticket holders to
seek a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets also are being offered in classified ads for up to $400.
</P>
<P>
   Media interest in the game is high. Arizona State has issued
about 450 credentials for the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a national forum to showcase ASU football and the
university,'' ASU Athletic Director Kevin White said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what irritates Arizona Athletic Director Jim
Livengood. He was told last week by ABC that the network would wait
until after the Wildcats' game against Washington last Saturday
night to make a decision. But while watching the ASU-USC game
Saturday afternoon, Livengood noticed ABC already was promoting the
ASU-Notre Dame game for the following weekend. The Fighting Irish
had defeated Stanford earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I handle news pretty good when somebody's up-front with me,''
Livengood said. ``But don't tell me you're going to wait and then
promote it. Notre Dame won, and they made their decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big boy in terms of television, and I understand how
things work. But it really is odd how they handled it. This is a
big game in terms of history of the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   FoxSportsNet immediately jumped on the game, which also is a
sellout, and Livengood emphasized that's he's not disappointed by
that. ``Arizona and the Pac-10 have been wonderful partners with
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has been besieged by calls from fans wanting an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it was a decision made with great reluctance,''
said Tim Pernetti, ABC's director of programming. ``In a perfect
world, we'd show both games. This was a clear case of damned if we
do, damned if we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Pernetti said his decision was based on two factors: market
saturation and ratings. ASU-Notre Dame won on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   At least 43 percent of the country will get this contest.
Because of Notre Dame's appeal, it will land in the Chicago and New
York markets as well as the West. The UCLA-Arizona game would have
saturated only the Pac-10 markets, which is about 20 percent of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   More homes will actually have the game available since Fox's
broadcast will be national, but the prestige of being seen on ABC,
with its top broadcast team of Keith Jackson and Bob Griese, and an
earlier start (12:30 vs. 7:15 p.m), is what irked some.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never even occurred to me it wouldn't be on ABC,'' said
Terry Braden, 27, of Casa Grande. ``I have to work. And I'm one of
those rare breeds that don't have cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pernetti, ``We saw it as one of the first real big tests
for Notre Dame, and we saw that ASU was starting to bounce back. It
has the makings of an exciting game.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team will receive approximately $275,000 from ABC. Fox's
payout is about $175,000 per team. &QL;

<P>
   Keith Tkachuk is on his best behavior. Polite as an English
butler. Smiling as if he'd been given a midnight reprieve from the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard the boos, has accepted the wrath and is determined
to prove he deserves the big letter on his sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a human being. Of course, it hurts,'' Tkachuk said. ``But
I understand how they feel, and I know I have to produce to get
them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Smith has performed all the necessary surgeries. His
defense is completely revamped. His offense has improved. His
coaching staff has pulled in the reins on an undisciplined outfit,
one that won't spend most of the season killing penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the ingredients are in place,'' the general manager said.
``With enough firepower on the first two lines, with enough role
players and character guys, with the best defense we've had since
I've been here, we could be a very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Khabibulin, whose pride was pierced last season, is
determined to prove he's a top-flight goalie. Brad Isbister has
bulked up significantly, no longer awed by the company he keeps.
The pedigree of Rick Tocchet has started to rub off. And Jeremy
Roenick has rededicated himself to the pursuit of greatness,
spending most of the summer lifting weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked out until I cried,'' he said. ``And I worked out
until I puked.''
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds wonderful. Except for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   You get zero points for talking. You get nothing for potential,
get nowhere on paper.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the Coyotes to prove they can play a good game,
too. Starting Sunday. And lasting for the duration of the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   Entering their third season in the Valley, it appears the
Coyotes have grown from their mistakes. They have acknowledged that
chemistry and teamwork mean something in the chase for the Cup.
They understand the previous level of commitment was a few notches
short of championship material. They realize they can't slog
through the regular season and expect to pull the switch when it
matters.
</P>
<P>
   They have learned the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, we have to get home ice,'' Tkachuk said.
``Finishing in the top four is definitely our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   As well it should be. In the Western Conference, Detroit and
Dallas share the pedestal. Colorado lost defenseman Uwe Krupp but
still is loaded. Beyond that, it's wide open, and there's no reason
the Coyotes can't outpoint Los Angeles, St. Louis or Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less would be a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   You can count on a few things entering a pivotal season. The
Coyotes won't lose 473 man-games to injury. Roenick will not be
held under 60 points again. And with two of the most skilled
defensive lines in the NHL, the odd-man rush won't be a nightly
hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in every game with a good defense,'' Smith said.
``Teams without a skilled defense play a territory game. It's
almost like a punt, flipping the puck out and hoping for the best.
Now, you'll see us control the puck a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing: Tkachuk knows he's under the microscope, that the
value of his leadership is in question. He knows he has to correct
an image problem threatening to overshadow his game.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Tkachuk is trying hard. He has even given a bedroom to
Daniel Briere, the wunderkind who should make an impact this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it was like when I was that age, living by myself.
It's no fun, especially when you're in a hotel,'' Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no fun losing in the first round of the playoffs, either.
No fun carrying the label as one of the biggest underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make it past the first round, and I'm looking way
beyond that,'' Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   Talking like champions, too. But once the puck drops Sunday, the
words will mean nothing. The excuses will have expired. And it will
be time for the perennial playoff patsies to change their woeful
image. For good. &QL;

 &HT;    Braves' big guns face power outage
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ The heavy lumber in the Braves' batting order has been
hollow as a carved-out pumpkin. Andres Galarraga, Chipper Jones,
Ryan Klesko and Javy Lopez might as well had been swinging forks in
the opening two games of the NLCS against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Start right there when looking for reasons why Atlanta faces an
imposing 0-2 series deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's futility in losing 3-0 in Game 2 to
frighteningly awesome Kevin Brown was in keeping with the meat of
the lineup's continued ineptitude since bumping off the inferior
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Check it out: In the two games, the quartet of big boppers
produced three hits _ all singles _ in 28 at-bats. Worse, they
drove in exactly zero runs, several times failing with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because I know our offense is better than
that,'' said Klesko, who had no hits in two at-bats with three
walks. ``We just didn't get anything going.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much at all. Jones, the No. 3 batter, has a single in eight
tries, but nothing with men on base. He had a long out to center in
the sixth that threatened the seats. It was one of two balls hit
``good all night,'' manager Bobby Cox said. The other was a line
single by pitcher Tom Glavine in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see the best pitching in the postseason,'' Braves hitting
coach Clarence Jones said. ``That's why they're in the playoffs.
(The Padres) have been pitching good. What can you say?''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga has not said much with his bat. He has no hits in
eight at-bats. He has struck out four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' the Big Cat said of his kitten-like
performance. ``But I will stay positive. We're probably going to
turn it around on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the hope, anyway. Lopez, a perennial postseason producer,
hoped his bouncer in the second inning would find the outfield.
Instead, it turned into a double play that killed a potential
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not working out in our favor right now,'' Lopez
said.
</P>
<P>
   Good pitching overcomes good hitting, the axiom goes. And that
has held true to form for the beleaguered Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he pitches outstanding,'' centerfielder Andruw Jones
said, ``you struggle. And we struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had won 10 in a row coming in here and we had hit the ball
pretty good,'' Cox said. ``(Game 1 starter Andy) Ashby, I thought,
was tough. And this guy tonight (Brown) was even tougher. We had
him in trouble with a couple of walks a couple of times. But we
couldn't get the ball to fall in. We just need to hit the ball
better. Getting one run a night is not going to cut it.

 &HT;    Braves get 3 hits in 3-0 loss, trail 2-0
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forty-eight hours ago, they had the right opponent,
had the pitching rigged like a nicked deck and they owned the home
field.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, the Atlanta Braves have none of those things. Only
trouble. Deep, wide trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In what has become his autumnal rite, Kevin Brown again
paralyzed the Braves on a three-hitter Thursday night to allow the
San Diego Padres to beat Atlanta 3-0, leaving a dark funk over a
Braves team thought by many to be the best assembled. But by the
time this one was over, the same team looked liked it just fell off
the bus from Greenville. A four-hit, one-error, two-run top of the
ninth had fumigated Turner Field like a roach bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a position you want to be in,'' said losing pitcher
Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   This hole is a deep one. The Braves trail the NLCS 0-2, which no
Braves team has done during this run through the 1990s. Since the
playoffs began in 1969, 11 teams have won the first two games of
the NLCS. Only two of those failed to advance to the World Series
(1984 Cubs and 1985 Dodgers). Worse, no team that lost the first
two games at home has ever recovered to win an NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   After traveling west today, the series resumes in San Diego on
Saturday night, with Greg Maddux (18-9) facing Sterling Hitchcock
(9-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``They did it to us,'' catcher Javy Lopez said, ``so we can do
it to them. No doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably we'll turn it around on the road,'' Andres Galarraga
said. ``Probably we'll play better there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unless the middle of the Braves order regains consciousness.
Galarraga, Chipper Jones and Ryan Klesko are a combined 1-for-21 in
this series while the Braves have squeezed out merely two runs in
19 innings. Braves starters have allowed three earned runs thus far
and it hasn't mattered, the Padres earning their fourth postseason
win when scoring three runs or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's the best-of-seven,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy
said. ``The two games, you haven't done anything yet. We know
there's still a lot of baseball left. It's nice to win two games
here but we still have to go home and continue to play the way
we're playing right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres left the Braves in shambles, the San Diego ninth
making a farce of what had been a one-run game. Lopez's throwing
error (trying to pick off Brown at second on consecutive pitches)
opened the way, spicing a string of singles, said less about how
the Padres won and more of how the Braves lost. Another sparse
gallery of 43,083 paused to boo on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're not there now, I don't know what it takes to get
our backs against the wall,'' said Glavine, who joined Jerry Reuss
as the only pitchers to lose seven NLCS games. ``It's not an
enviable position to be in, down 0-2 going to the other ballpark.
But it wasn't too long ago that we were up 2-0 in a World Series
and wound up being swept. It can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not as long as Brown is around. He beat the Braves for the sixth
straight time, including three straight NLCS victories dating back
to his Florida tenure last October. Glavine gave up six walks and
six hits and still allowed just one sixth-inning run but was
overshadowed by the Padres starter. Brown allowed just three
singles while striking out 11.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves left three men in scoring position and Brown bore
down harder as he went, retiring 13 of the last 14 men he faced.
Not that he could explain what he was doing to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the fact that I had a variety of stuff,'' Brown said.
``I wasn't trying to stay with any one thing. I think I threw
everything but the kitchen sink at 'em out there tonight. Just
winging it, make stuff up as you go.''
</P>
<P>
   So will the Braves, who lost two of their three games at
Qualcomm Stadium this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 3-1 to the Cardinals (in 1996 and won),'' said
manager Bobby Cox. ``And with this club, we have the type of
pitching and I think we've got the hitting, once it gets going, we
could do that. It's that type of club.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the last two games.

PRAISE POURS IN FOR WULK  
 ASU COURT NAMING IS CALLED OVERDUE 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-WULK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ned Wulk always seemed more at home talking himself down, as
opposed to up, so it wasn't a big surprise that when asked about
his legacy, he sort of groped and fumbled for an answer without
really finding one.
</P>
<P>
   But he had no trouble recalling the time when he was the head
basketball coach at Arizona State and someone threw a wadded-up
paper cup at him during a game at Wyoming, and he returned the fire
and accidentally hit the team bus driver, who wanted to keep Wulk
off the bus. Or the time he drop-kicked a chair into the mezzanine.
Or the time. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Stories, not speeches, suited Wulk best, and plenty were going
around Thursday at ASU when it was officially announced that the
floor at Wells Fargo Arena will be named Ned Wulk Court during
dedication ceremonies on March 6.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, it will be almost 17 years to the day in 1982
that Wulk was fired by a university vice president, long since gone
from the scene, who never bothered to inform Wulk directly, thus
ending a 25-year, 406-victory tenure that spanned presidents from
Eisenhower to Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   You think Roger Maris' home run record stood a long time?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to retire here,'' new ASU Coach Rob Evans told Wulk and
a gathering that included old friends and coaching colleagues such
as Bill Kajikawa (football) and Baldy Castillo (track), and former
players. ``But I think you can feel safe that your 406 wins are
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans, facing the latest in a series of rebuilding jobs since
Wulk's departure, represents the present and the future of Sun
Devils basketball. Naming the court is a sturdy bridge to the past.
</P>
<P>
   Wulk is the biggest piece of that past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time in coming,'' Athletic Director Kevin White
said. ``It's terribly befitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Wulk said: ``After a while . . . you feel like you didn't do
enough to warrant it.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, this otherwise was a happy occasion for Wulk,
who is 78 and lives in Ahwatukee. So he broached the moment with a
still-impish sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first reaction I had was, `Boy, this is really gonna floor
me,' '' he said, clearly enjoying the pun.
</P>
<P>
   But seriously, folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm overwhelmed,'' said Wulk.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or not, the court is being named during the first
full season the former University Activity Center gets a different
label, thanks to a healthy donation. Wulk didn't have to give any
money for his honor, merely the better part of his working life.
Completed in 1974 at the now ridiculous-sounding cost of $8
million, the Activity Center was built because ASU basketball under
Wulk had outgrown the old gym. Wulk had a lot to do with the
arena's design, especially the floor area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The building means a lot to me,'' he said. ``I spent an awful
lot of time (working) on this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his players, Art Becker, said Wulk should be remembered
for being an innovator. You know the Chicago Bulls' triangle
offense, the alleged brainchild of Tex Winter?
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran an offense similar to that in the 1960s,'' said Becker,
the athletic director at Scottsdale Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Up-tempo offense and trapping defense were Wulk hallmarks before
they became en vogue. He sprung something radical called a zone
press on a UCLA team coached by John Wooden, and ASU beat the
Bruins by 30. Evans played for New Mexico State against the Sun
Devils in the late '60s and recalls the relentless pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our basketball team to exemplify the same effort and
toughness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevalent assessment of Wulk relates to his
post-coaching days. Despite being suddenly and unceremoniously let
go five victories shy of 500 for his career (he also coached at
Xavier of Ohio), and despite his dismissal resulting in a reduced
pension that would cost him serious dollars the rest of his life,
he remains an avid and visible supporter of ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't it difficult?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I like basketball. I like ASU basketball, no
matter what.'' &QL;

NORTHRIDGE'S BRADY TO FACE AH YAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ He's big, strong, poised and turns secondaries
pale with fear.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scrambling ability and toughness turn game-planning a
defense for him into a scary proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Through four games this season Cal State Northridge redshirt
quarterback Marcus Brady has been that player. Montana's Brian Ah
Yat has been that _ and much more _ since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Brady is good and exciting, Ah Yat has one thing on him.
He's established, and he is the cornerstone of one of the
dominating Division I-AA programs.
</P>
<P>
   Brady is the future. Ah Yat is the present.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN wants, and sees, Brady developing into the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them have good poise, and to me, Marcus offers the
same threat as Ah Yat,'' CSUN receiver Aaron Arnold said. ``He can
scramble. Ah Yat can scramble. Both make plays. I can definitely
see him being the same type of player as Ah Yat is. I can see him
taking Ah Yat's spot as the No.1 quarterback in the conference _ in
due time.''
</P>
<P>
   If it works out the way CSUN plans, Ah Yat and Brady will be
linked through comparisons for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   And they meet for the first time on Saturday at North Campus
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't like comparing myself to others,'' Brady said.
``I don't like to. I just know Ah Yat is a very good player. One of
the top in the Big Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   However, with Brady employing his exciting, athletic style _ not
to mention a 70 percent completion rate, 10 touchdowns, one
interception and the top efficiency rating (170.3) in the country _
comparisons are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Both are elusive and throw with remarkable accuracy. The most
discernible difference is size. Brady is 6-foot-1, 185 pounds. Ah
Yat, nursing a sore back, is 6-2, 190. But their abilities go
beyond the normal realm of quarterbacking and include the
leadership, the key ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus Brady is a lot like Brian Ah Yat,'' Southern Utah
defensive coordinator Chris Howard said. ``He makes things happen
and could end up being one of the best in the area by the time he's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard watched Brady hit 20 of 24 for 257 yards and three
touchdowns last week. Earlier this season he saw Ah Yat, who
declined an interview this week, throw for 423 yards and four
touchdowns against the Thunderbirds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what Brady did against Southern Utah mirrors what he's done
since a rough indoctrination into college football at Boise State.
In wins against Northern Arizona, Eastern Washington and Southern
Utah, Brady completed 59 of 74. Not coincidentally, CSUN (3-1) has
its first three-game winning streak since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've seen, I'm not sure but (Brady may be) the best
athlete I've seen at quarterback in our league,'' third-year
Montana coach Mick Dennehy said. ``He appears, at a very young age,
to be able to handle a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how impressive those games are, they're only a
trinket of the success Ah Yat's enjoyed. Since he became Montana's
starter, the Grizzlies (3-2) are 25-7, which includes an
unthinkable sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   Ah Yat, who's thrown for 74 touchdowns and 7,816 yards in the
regular season, threw for 42 touchdowns and 3,615 yards while
leading Montana to an 11-0 regular season in 1996. The Grizzlies
finished 14-1 and lost to Marshall in the Division I-AA title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Marcus can be like Ah Yat,'' Northridge offensive
coordinator Rob Phenicie said. ``We're going in the right
direction, like in terms of leadership. We want Marcus, in a couple
of years, to be as successful as Ah Yat.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Defensive lineman Patrick Cwik, who was hit by a car
while riding his bike on his way to practice earlier in the week,
and backup linebacker Carl Finely (shoulder) didn't practice
Thursday and won't play against Montana.... Punter Ethan Beck
(hamstring) returned to practice after missing one day....
Defensive lineman Erik Gardner and Eric Falconer, both sidelined
with knee injuries, returned to practice this week but won't play
against the Grizzlies.

SPORTS COLUMN: PADRES SHOW NO SIGN OF LETTNG UP ON BRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three hours before Game 1 of the National League
Championship Series on Wednesday, a group of San Diego Padres
players huddled around outfielder Steve Finley as he switched on
his laptop computer. This was no last-minute skull session for the
coming game against the Braves. Finley was using the Internet to
track a storm that was getting ready to belt Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The players could gauge the intensity of the rain, and thus its
duration, by the color of the cloud patterns on the computer
screen. From the darkening colors headed for Atlanta, the Padres
had an idea they would be in for a long delay. They were right. A
game that was supposed to begin at 8:15 p.m. began at 10:16 and
would not end until 1:43 a.m. on Thursday. Approximately 18 hours
later, San Diego was at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Padres groaned when they realized they were in for a
rain-soaked interlude. Since arriving Tuesday morning, they had
heard about nothing but Atlanta's pitching: Smoltz, Glavine,
Maddux. Enough, already. The Padres wanted to play.
</P>
<P>
   But while his teammates groaned, Ken Caminiti said ``Yes'' under
his breath. The Padres' 35-year-old third baseman and walking
infirmary, a mass of knots, welts and bruises, desperately needed
the delay to patch himself together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really big for me,'' Caminiti said after the game.
``I needed some extra time in the training room today. I woke up
really in a bad state; I had a massage therapist named Jody that
worked on me for three hours, so I had a lot of knots. That delay
gave me time. I went back in there, I said, `O.K., we got time.'''
</P>
<P>
   All the rest and extra rubdowns paid dividends in the 10th
inning. With the score tied, 2-2, Caminiti got hold of a Kerry
Ligtenberg fastball and sent it soaring over the center-field wall
for what turned out to be the game-winning run in a 3-2 Padres'
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's heroics gave San Diego a surprising 1-0 lead in the
four-of-seven-game series. Kevin Brown's dominating performance on
Thursday night _ 0 runs, 3 hits, 11 strikeouts, 3 walks _ stretched
the lead to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   But more than those clutch performances, San Diego's two
victories here have set a bruising tone for the rest of the series.
The Padres also put the Braves on notice: they better come out of
their business-as-usual mode and play with passion.
</P>
<P>
   In a span of less than 48 hours the Padres have set the terms
and conditions of what was supposed to have been a walk through the
park for Atlanta: They reduced the game to its simplest elements.
You throw it; we hit it. You hit it, we'll catch it. With an
inspired victory in Game 1, sore bodies healed, silent bats
awakened; confidence was sent soaring. The Padres survived a
monsoon and a marathon; after a two-hour rain delay, and after
Atlanta rallied to tie the game in the bottom of the ninth, the
Padres came away with a victory in a game the Braves' John Smoltz
started. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After the game, at 2:15 on Thursday morning, a group of Padres
sat in front of the big-screen television in the comfortable
visitor's clubhouse at Turner Field, the same place they had
huddled around Finley nine hours before. They were watching ESPN to
see how it all happened. First they watched the Yankees meet their
Waterloo against the Indians in New York; watched, politely silent,
while Chuck Knoblauch effectively fiddled as Rome burned. Then came
the good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth inning, Tony Gwynn knocked in a run to tie the
score, 1-1. In the eighth, Ruben Rivera, the former Yankee who was
playing in place of the injured Greg Vaughn, doubled, knocking
Smoltz out of the game. Rivera went to third on a heads-up play
when Caminiti lined out, and later scored on Andres Galarraga's
throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   They watched Atlanta's Ryan Klesko barrel into third in the
ninth, crashing headfirst into Caminiti's knee and shoulder. They
heard the announcer quote Caminiti: ``I wasn't trying to cheat, I
was just trying to block the base.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti's home run drew a ripple of reaction, but not much
else: that deed was done, after all. Now it was a new day,
figuratively, at least, and Tom Glavine was on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Two lockers down from Caminiti's, Vaughn, the Padres left
fielder who hit 50 home runs this season, moved gingerly with a
heavy bandage around his left leg. Vaughn pulled his quadriceps in
the fourth inning going after a fly ball. He took his turn at bat,
but Manager Bruce Bochy told him to sit out the rest of the game
and replaced him with Rivera in the fifth inning. Vaughn said he
instinctively resisted, thinking heroically but selfishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Why?''' Vaughn recalled. ``He said, `What if they hit
a ball out there and you can't get to it?' He was right; I needed
to come out because no one would feel worse than myself if I
couldn't get to a ball because of an injury.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a night, and early morning, of storms and great plays. A
night when two heavy favorites lost extra-inning games.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves and Yankees might consider borrowing Steve Finley's
laptop and tracking the weather. Feels like a crazy storm is
brewing.  &QL;

GOING ON A CRUZ FOR TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Camarillo drag racer Cruz Pedregon will be a busy
man over the final month of the NHRA season as he tries to put
himself back into contention for the Funny Car title.
</P>
<P>
   Pedregon, in fourth place with 249 points behind leader John
Force, will be at the Pennzoil Nationals in Memphis this weekend,
the Parts America Nationals in Topeka on Oct. 17, the Revell
Nationals in Dallas Oct. 22-25 and the Matco Tools Supernationals
in Houston Oct. 29-Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Between events, Pedregon will spend little time at home as he
tries to pull what began as a championship-caliber season back
together in time for the NHRA finale, the Winston Finals Nov. 12-15
at Pomona.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Fram Nationals back on April 20, Pedregon had two
of his three victories and was in first place in Funny Car points.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has won just once despite qualifying first five
times in the ensuing 12 events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a thousand ways to lose and only one way to win,''
said Pedregon, who has a penchant of late for qualifying high but
going out in early elimination rounds. ``It seems like we've
experienced all the ways to lose this year.''
</P>
<P>
   But through the losing, Pedregon said he and new crew chief Wes
Cerny are starting to come together as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first year with Wes,'' Pedregon said. ``And there
have been some instances where our being new to each other has
caused us to second-guess what we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those days are gone, Pedregon said. Cerny has Pedregon's
Interstate Batteries car roaring.
</P>
<P>
   And Pedregon qualified first again last weekend at Topeka before
rain forced postponement of the event to later this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any problems ahead,'' Pedregon said. ``We need to
win and (the drivers in front of him) need to stumble a few times.
This car flies. There is no reason for us to believe we're not
still in this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   IRL finale: The Indy Racing League will celebrate the conclusion
of its third season and perhaps crown a new champion Sunday with
the running of the Las Vegas 500K at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Brack takes a 31-point lead into the event and needs to
finish eighth or better to guarantee himself the title.
</P>
<P>
   Runner-up Davey Hamilton and third-place Tony Stewart, who needs
Brack to wind up no better than 15th to have a chance, remain
mathematically in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Vacation is over:After a month's respite, the two-man points
battle for the NASCAR Winston West title resumes with the
Iomega/Fry's 100 Sunday at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   With three races remaining in the 14-event series, Palmdale's
Kevin Harvick has a 34-point lead over Valencia's Sean Woodside. In
third place, 215 points back of Harvick, is Gary Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Best of the Southwest: Granada Hills driver M.K. Kanke is one of
the veterans of the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour. And as he
tries to pass Steve Portenga for the 1998 points title over the
season's final three races, he may also put his name in the tour
record book.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the pole at the Featherlite Trailer Manufacturers 125
in September, Kanke tied Ron Hornaday Jr. for the most poles
all-time with 19.
</P>
<P>
   And when he won the race, he moved into fifth place all-time in
wins (12), third on the all-time top-10 finishes list (76) and
second on the all-time top-five list (55).
</P>
<P>
   Kanke trails Portenga by 87 points. The next race is Oct. 16 at
Mesa Marin Speedway in Bakersfield.
</P>
<P>
   Like a jet: Four area jet ski racers will be at the
International Jet Sports Boating Association championships at Lake
Havasu next week.
</P>
<P>
   Racing in the Pro Runabout 1200 class will be Jason Howard of
Granada Hills, Paul Pistone of West Hills and Tom Powell of
Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Entered in the Pro-Am Women's Runabout class is Jennifer Jeppson
of Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The events run Sunday through Sunday, Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Retiring CART driver Bobby Rahal stopped by Los
Angeles' Petersen Automotive Museum Thursday to donate one of his
fireproof driver's suits.... Brazilian racing icon Emerson
Fittipaldi has signed a five-year contract to manage and promote
the CART Rio 400 in Rio de Janeiro.... Traditionally held in
November, the NHRA California Hot Rod Reunion will be held Oct.
16-18 this year to avoid conflicting with the NHRA's season-ending
event, the Winston Finals. The CHRR will be held at Famoso Raceway
in Bakersfield.... The Saugus Speedway Oldies and Goodies Classic
Car, Truck and Motorcycle Show has been rescheduled for Saturday,
Oct. 24. (4-10 p.m.) Information: (805) 259-3886.... Honda has
sewed up its second straight CART season manufacturer's title with
a total of 11 victories so far (six by Alex Zanardi, three by Dario
Franchitti and two by Jimmy Vasser).... Simi Valley's Alex Harris
won his eighth USAC three-quarters midget main event of the season
and has a 446-325 lead over Gene Godepski in season points....
Fontana's California Speedway has opened a racing theme restaurant
at Ontario International Airport called the California Speedway
Cafe.

CACTUS CURTAIN  
 FRONT 4 LIKENED TO BEST EVER 
</HEADLINE>
 LINE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a chance, as some Cardinals coaches suggest, that
Chicago Bears Coach Dave Wannstedt was just setting up the opponent
when he gushed about the Arizona defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best I've seen in a long time, since back in the
early '70s _ the Steel Curtain,'' Wannstedt said.
</P>
<P>
   So after five games, the Cardinals' defensive front of Andre
Wadsworth, Eric Swann, Mark Smith and Simeon Rice is being compared
to the Pittsburgh Steelers' Steel Curtain, which won four Super
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   What about the Fearsome Foursome, Purple People Eaters and
Doomsday lines?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Mean Joe Greene is coaching their defensive
(linemen), and that speaks for itself,'' Wannstedt said. ``Those
guys are just phenomenal athletes. They could probably play
linebacker in somebody else's defensive scheme, that's how good and
athletic they are. They can change a game in a matter of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene, the Cardinals assistant and Hall of Famer with the
Steelers, laughed when told of Wannstedt's praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sincere, but they have a long ways to go,'' Greene said
of the Cardinals' defensive line. ``They don't know one another.
They're starting to get to know each other. But they don't know
completely how the game should be played, how it is to be hunted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, the defensive line starters have had
nine sacks, six pass deflections, two fumble recoveries and one
forced fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, who has a team-high four sacks, has had two sacks in
two consecutive games, only the third Cardinals player to
accomplish that feat since the statistic was first recorded in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals have the potential to be the most dominating
front four in football,'' said Gary Horton, former Tampa Bay and
Cleveland scout who now is the editor of the ``War Room'' football
publication.
</P>
<P>
   There doesn't appear to be a defensive line that is clearly the
best in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay has the NFL's top rushing defense, but the Packers
were shredded through the air in Monday night's loss to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Packers' line has been a pleasant surprise,'' said
Horton of a line that is led by Reggie White. ``But I think people
will take advantage of them as the year goes on. At times, I think
they will look tired and overmatched.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, led by All-Pro defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy, also
has the AFC's co-sack leader in Mike Sinclair with seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``On paper, Seattle's line is very good,'' Horton said.
``Kennedy and (Sam) Adams are run stuffers. Sinclair is a great
edge pass rusher. But they also benefit from good linebacker play
and two good corners (Shawn Springs and Willie Williams).''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has the NFL's best defense even without injured
tackle Chester McGlockton.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has a star in John Randle, and Tampa Bay has the NFL's
best young tackle in Warren Sapp, but both teams' other linemen
aren't standouts.
</P>
<P>
   Other good lines include the New York Giants, paced by Mike
Strahan; New Orleans, led by Joe Johnson and Wayne Martin; and
Miami, which has huge defensive tackles in Tim Bowens and Daryl
Gardener and a speed pass rusher in Jason Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Raiders executive Bruce Allen thinks none is as
potentially good as the Cardinals' line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a (1997) Rookie of the Year in Simeon Rice, a
perennial All-Pro in Eric Swann and drafted a guy (Andre Wadsworth)
that some people are calling the next Bruce Smith,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said the Rams' Fearsome Foursome is the best ever,
but this has a chance to be just as dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals offensive tackle Lomas Brown, a seven-time Pro Bowl
performer, said Mark Smith ``is no slouch. He is just overshadowed
by everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a seventh-round pick a year ago, made the All-Rookie Team
last season with six sacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to be the guy who makes the plays,'' Swann said.
``I'm the demolition expert. I'm the guy blowing things up. There's
no doubt Mark is going to be one of the leading defensive tackles
in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice said the Cardinals' line is still a long way from a
finished product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building, growing, evolving as a team,'' he said. ``Each
week, we're getting better. None of us has had a blockbuster game
yet. We've showed a lot of brilliance, but there is a big game
coming for each of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton said the Cardinals' front causes big match-up problems
for opposing offensive lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be when you played the Cardinals, you figured that
if you stopped Swann you could get everything done that you needed
to,'' Horton said. ``Then last year, if you took Swann or Rice out
of the game _ either one of them _ you were all right. Now, any one
of those (starters) can give you fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, people were running at Rice. Now, if you do that,
Wadsworth is going to chase you down.'' &QL;

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ Bob sells bicycles for a living, but come this time of
year his mind tends to wander.
</P>
<P>
   To the Braves. His Braves. There's nothing fair-weather about
Bob the fan, no matter how many times they have tested his devotion
to their usual lost playoffs cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemme tell you,'' he said Thursday afternoon, shrugging off a
consoling comment regarding the unfortunate wee-hours outcome of
Game 1 of the National League Championship Series. ``We're gonna
put a whuppin' on that Georgia Tech boy tonight. You can go write
your story right now. `Braves beat Brown' _ that's your headline.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Bob knows bikes. He wouldn't make a
comfortable living as a seer. I suppose we need to question his
memory as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bob had the whuppin' part right, except he had it backward. He
confused the ``whuppee'' with the ``whupper,'' whose name was Kevin
Brown. A Macon, Ga., resident in the winter, Brown now devotes his
autumns to makin' whoopee at the expense of Atlanta's big-league
team.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago, he did attend Georgia Tech. Now, because of him, the
Braves are rambling wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   As a flu-bug-bitten Marlins mercenary a year ago, Brown beat
Atlanta twice in the NLCS, earning wins in the first and last
games. As a hale-and-hearty Padre, he did it once more this
evening, showing the Braves pretty much the same right stuff he
unleashed upon the Astros last week. If they gave a Cy Young Award
for the postseason, he would be well on his way to claiming it. His
ERA against the Astros was 0.61. His ERA against the Braves is
0.00.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to insult, Brown also managed one-third as many
hits as he gave Atlanta. His sixth-inning single was integral to
the Padres scoring the one run they needed in a 3-0 victory that
left the Braves in a possibly impossible place. Since the NLCS went
to its best-of-seven format in 1985, no team has recovered from
dropping the first two games at home.
</P>
<P>
   Brown struck out 21 Astros in 14 innings, including an almost
historic 16 in the opener at the Astrodome, a figure exceeded in
the playoffs only by a Mr. Bob Gibson. Then, to prove he really
meant it, Brown mowed down Braves Walt Weiss, Keith Lockhart and
Chipper Jones back-to-back-to-back in the first inning here.
</P>
<P>
   The game would conclude with consecutive whiffs of Andres
Galarraga and Ryan Klesko. While there was a minor wobble or two in
between, neither Brown's command nor his control was doubt. He has
four ``out'' pitches, ranging from a 96-mph running fastball to a
wicked, hooking slider, and Atlanta rarely had a decent look, or
cut, at any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would rip a fly ball to the right-center warning track in
the sixth, but Steve Finley chugged over to flag it down. Of the
last 18 Atlantans to dare venture to the plate, 16 returned
directly to the dugout, seven with bats on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw everything at them except the kitchen sink,'' Brown
said. ``Just winging it, you know, making up stuff as you go,
really. I don't like to back off and look at the big picture. I try
to stay focused on the little things and minimize my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't apply to his baserunning. He tried to take
third on Quilvio Veras' RBI single in the sixth and, even with a
foolhardy headfirst slide into the bag, was easily gunned down.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Brown isn't perfect. Not that Bruce Bochy felt like
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just how he plays the game _ all out,'' the Padres'
skipper said. ``He's a throwback. But, to be honest, he scares me
sometimes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how the other guys feel. The Braves, baseball's team of
the decade in every way except World Series championships
accumulated, brought a 10-0 run into their seventh NLCS in a row,
but they have run smack into the same immovable object that
abruptly terminated the Astros' best season ever.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the long-forgotten Friars, a non-factor in the
playoffs since being routed by the Tigers in the 1984 World Series,
are the fire and the frying pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying like crazy to win a ballgame tonight,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said, sounding more discouraged than he owned up
to being, ``but we couldn't touch Brown. The Houston club has as
good a hitting team as anybody, and they didn't touch him either.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a spot of good news for Atlanta, it's this: Because
San Diego goes home with a 2-0 lead, Bochy will feel no need to
pitch Brown in Game 4 on two days' rest. Call it a stay of
execution, not a pardon.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta must face Brown again, unless it gets swept. So there
can be no joy in Georgia tonight _ except in one Macon household.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Braves.

VALLEY READY TO SHOW OFF FOR OLYMPIC CONGRESS  
 COUNTY COMMISSION PURSUES EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than four years, the U.S. Olympic Congress has sat like
a forbidden-to-open present under the Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic Games in Atlanta and Nagano have come and gone since the
annual convention of the U.S. Olympic movement was awarded to
Phoenix in June 1994. The group that successfully bid for the
Congress has changed its name from Maricopa County Sports
``Authority'' to ``Commission'' and changed its Mike, from Lawrence
to Sculley, as executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Even the purpose of courting the U.S. Olympic Committee is
different.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the U.S. Olympic Festival existed, with Phoenix
among four finalists in the 1999 bidding. But the multisport event
that by its 14th and final staging in 1995 had grown to 36 sports
and 3,000 athletes was deemed as providing too little bang for a
$12 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Now the chase is on for individual-sport Olympic events. In that
endeavor, the Maricopa County Sports Commission, with a $400,000
annual budget mostly met via corporate fund-raising, is like David
Dellucci challenging Mark McGwire in a home run hitting contest.
</P>
<P>
   Sculley and his three-person staff can only be gracious and
somewhat envious hosts as Baltimore-Washington, Cincinnati, Dallas,
Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Orlando-Tampa, San Francisco and
Seattle come into their home to schmooze for the chance to bid on
the 2012 Summer Olympics that will cost more than $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800 participants are registered for the eighth
Congress, which for the first time will include a golf tournament
and an interactive sport expo. The Sports Commission is hosting an
opening reception Sunday night that will include tours of Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress is preceded today through Sunday by the bi-annual
meeting of the 107-member USOC Board of Directors, which includes a
report to the 20-member Executive Committee on the 2012 bid cities
and whether they meet minimum requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Executive Committee includes USOC Vice Presidents Sandra
Baldwin and Herman Frazier, both of Phoenix, who are de facto
hosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for Sandy and I to have this in our back yard,''
said Frazier, also chairman of the Maricopa County Sports
Commission. ``There are a lot of (National Governing Bodies) who
have annual meetings or some kind of competition who will figure
out that Phoenix is ideal for what they have to do later on. It's a
win-win situation for our state and for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing comes free in the Olympic sports world, especially
in attracting major events such as gymnastics, swimming or track
and field trials. And until the commission is bankrolled by a
significant funding source, it is unlikely to be able to compete
with the likes of the Indianapolis Sports Corporation (20-person
staff, $15 million budget), no matter how nice the weather is here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the venues and ideal location for what everybody
wants,'' Sculley said. ``But when someone else offers a $50,000
check, all we can say is congratulations, we'll try again next
time. Money is the only thing holding us back, and that's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Sculley floated the idea of a minimal surcharge,
perhaps a dime, being added to Valley pro sports tickets to fund
the sports commission. No legislative action would be required,
only an agreement with the pro teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get any negative feedback'' on the concept, Sculley
said. ``We haven't pushed it because of the Cardinals situation and
Coyotes (seeking new facilities). Everyone is trying to jump on the
sports bandwagon. I don't want to throw something else into the
pie. I needed to get more established by bringing in some events.''
</P>
<P>
   To the end, Phoenix will host the Reese's Gymnastics Cup on Jan.
30 at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The Senior Softball World
Championships and AAU 18-under baseball championships are coming to
the Peoria Sports Complex next year. Phoenix Swim Club will host
the U.S. Masters Nationals in 2000 and 2001, replacing the Grand
Prix meet it held for three years that is moving to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The softball, baseball and swim events will not quicken the
pulse of most sports fans, Sculley conceded. That's why this
Congress is important.
</P>
<P>
   His tour schedule includes a visit with USA Track &AMP; Field
officials to Sun Angel Track Stadium at Arizona State, where
Frazier is senior associate athletic director. As a quarter-miler,
Frazier trained there to win bronze and gold medals at the 1976
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Joe Sellah Track received a $700,000 remodeling in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track is our best bet'' for a major event, said Sculley. &QL;

   If the NFL ever wanted to retreat into a fantasy world, this
would be a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The No Fun League was especially so Sunday. In Phoenix, where
our TV games are chosen by sadistic network weasels, we were
treated to the Dolphins-Jets punt-a-thon and the ultimate atomic
stink bomb: Philadelphia at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying the Eagles gave up in the second half. They gave
up in the first half. At one point, the Philadelphia secondary was
actually playing hacky sack.
</P>
<P>
   But in all fairness, I noted that the Eagles were careful never
to actually touch the hem of Terrell Davis' garment.
</P>
<P>
   Other rotten match-ups: Giants-Bucs, Chargers-Colts and, of
course, Seahawks-Chiefs, which was halted for 54 minutes because of
heavy rain and lightning _ the only fireworks during a dismal NFL
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the average fan, this turn of events might lead to dire
consequences _ yardwork, baby-sitting or, horror of horrors, a
Sunday afternoon cooking show.
</P>
<P>
   While braising pork chops might seem more appealing than
watching Danny Kanell impersonate an NFL quarterback, this isn't a
problem for fantasy leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some might argue that fantasy leagues are saving the
NFL from itself.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the league. Five weeks into the season, there are three
winless teams (Washington, Carolina and Philadelphia) and seven
teams with one victory. Other teams with slightly better records
(Arizona, New Orleans and Atlanta) just don't have the legs to
last.
</P>
<P>
   Quick quiz. The Dallas Cowboys' next three opponents have how
many wins among them? Answer: one.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, two of them are actually tied with Bye Week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the bad football, fantasy owners always have a
reason to watch the games.
</P>
<P>
   Without fantasy football, the Eagles-Broncos might have seemed a
little, ah, dull. Don't tell that to the guy who started John Elway
at quarterback, only to watch Bubby Brister get the privilege of
whacking out the Eagles. (By the way, it's really hard to pry a
shoe out of a big-screen TV.)
</P>
<P>
   This game featured a slew of fantasy favorites besides Elway.
With Denver, you had Davis, wide receivers Rod Smith and Ed
McCaffrey and tight end Shannon Sharpe. As for the Eagles, some
poor souls were rooting for receiver Irving Fryar and running backs
Duce Staley and Charlie Garner.
</P>
<P>
   News that the Falcons were blowing out the Panthers was fine
with fantasy owners who started Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler,
running back Jamal Anderson or receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Purists argue that fantasy leaguers don't watch the games for
the right reasons, that we should be more interested in wins and
losses than statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this weekend, the winless Eagles play the winless
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The purists can have my ticket. &QL;  &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL;  &QL; 
Don't be fooled by the performance of Panthers quarterback Kerry
Collins against Atlanta. He ran up his numbers after Carolina was
behind, 38-3, and this week he benched himself in favor of backup
Steve Beuerlein. I think Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart
will have a bounce-back game against Cincinnati. &QL;  &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL;  &QL; 
Look for Miami rookie John Avery to find his way into the lineup.
Coach Jimmy Johnson never has been enamored with starter Karim
Abdul-Jabbar. In Kansas City, Rashaan Shehee looked good in relief
of Donnell Bennett on Sunday, but Bennett should be back this week
despite a bruised hand. Don't expect Cowboys running back Chris
Warren to score two touchdowns every week, but he will get
significant time spelling Emmitt Smith. Running back Gary Brown
appears to have the starting job for the Giants, such as it is. &QL;  &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL;  &QL; 
This week it's Detroit receiver Johnnie Morton, who had two catches
for 138 yards and two touchdowns. Morton is good, but he's not
going to catch too many more 98-yard bombs. &QL;  &QL;

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Familiarity has bred contempt, and reality is setting
in for the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The sheen is fading and the Braves' mighty mystique is giving
way, opening the way for a new king to take over in the National
League.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Atlanta is no longer the most feared and dominating
club in the league, a point that was especially punctuated after
San Diego grabbed its second straight victory in the NL
Championship Series on Thursday night, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The victory allowed the Padres to snag a 2-0 lead in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the next three games are scheduled at what promises
to be a thunderously raucous Qualcomm Stadium, the Braves' chances
of returning to their fifth World Series this decade are
staggeringly low right now.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego, which received a suffocating performance from starter
Kevin Brown, has taken it right to the Braves, dispatching John
Smoltz and Tom Glavine in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Greg Maddux will try to keep the Padres from assuming a
nearly insurmountable 3-0 lead in the series, but San Diego already
has beaten Atlanta's other two All-Star horses, so how could a
four-time Cy Young Award winner possibly intimidate this bunch?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't come out overconfident against Atlanta,'' Padres
third baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``But we fully expected to be
prepared. We have a good, veteran club and we aren't afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had Atlanta thrown off so much that Braves Manager
Bobby Cox had reliever Kevin Millwood warming up in the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   That startling fact alone is enough to underscore how the
balance of power in the NL no longer resides in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, normally one of the coolest customers in the game,
walked the bases loaded in the second and had walked a season-high
five batters through three innings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a most un-Glavine-like performance, which mirrored the
Braves' implosion during the ninth inning. This is a club that has
fashioned itself as steady as any in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mentioning the Atlanta Braves is like talking about Shaft in the
early '70s. This is a club that always maintained a coolness about
itself, even under the most difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But after watching the Braves' self-destruction in the ninth
inning, when the score was still within reach at 1-0, it may be
time to say Atlanta has fallen back to the pack.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, it's time to say the Braves no longer are
placed on some mythical pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our backs aren't up against the wall now, I don't know what
it's going to take to get them there,'' said Glavine, who is
winless in his past three postseason starts. ``We're still trying
to win a World Series. I don't think we need anymore motivation
then that.''
</P>
<P>
   Motivation is one thing, but the Braves are now staring history
in the face, and the record says Atlanta is in a difficult
quandary.
</P>
<P>
   Only the 1984 Padres and the '85 Cardinals have managed to
overcome 0-2 deficits in the NL Championship Series. But each time,
those clubs lost the first two games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves are to advance, they must accomplish something
that never has occurred in NLCS history. Of course, Atlanta can
take solace in remembering how the Yankees lost the first two games
of the 1996 World Series at Yankee Stadium before coming to Atlanta
and winning three in a row and eventually winning it all in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's defensive lapses in the ninth began shortly after
Brown led off the inning with a sharp single to right field.
Another single followed before Braves catcher Javier Lopez got cute
and his pickoff attempt of Brown at second base sailed into center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie pitcher Odalys Perez failed to cover first base on a
grounder between first and second and Andres Galarraga compounded
it all when he couldn't make a play on an easy chopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got really weird,'' San Diego right fielder Tony Gwynn
said. ``Sometimes in a playoff situation, those things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Those things might happen to the Chicago Cubs, Boston or even
the Yankees, but they haven't happened to these Braves very often.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' stranglehold over the rest of the NL seems to be
slipping away. Quickly. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ The National League Championship Series is far from
locked up, but the San Diego Padres are doing some serious fiddling
with the deadbolt.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All along, the Atlanta Braves have said the key to winning the
best-of-seven series was whether they could beat Padres ace Kevin
Brown. Maybe they should try another key.
</P>
<P>
   Brown slammed the door on the Braves with another masterful
performance, tossing a three-hit shutout to lead the Padres to a
3-0 victory Thursday at Turner Field. The Padres took a 2-0 lead in
the series and could clinch their first NL pennant since 1984 in
front of a home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more could we want?'' said Brown, who is 3-0 this
postseason. ``This (being up 2-0) is a lot better than being down
0-2, and it's better than a split.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a real moral victory for us to come here and beat
a team of this caliber in their ballpark. It really speaks to the
heart and soul of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   After an open date today, the series shifts to Qualcomm Stadium
for Games 3, 4 and, if necessary, 5. This constitutes new ground
for the Braves, who never have dropped the first two games of a
series during their dominant stretch of postseason play in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no team has ever won the NLCS after losing the first
two games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an enviable position to be in,'' Braves pitcher
Tom Glavine said. ``But this thing is not over until someone wins
four games. Coming back from two games down is not an easy thing to
do, but we don't need to look any further than what happened to us
in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves won the first two games of the 1996 World Series
before the Yankees took the next four.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to be up 2-0,'' Padres first baseman Wally Joyner
said. ``But we're not going to get overconfident. It was hard
enough to beat Atlanta these two times; now, we have to do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Killer B's and Co., the Braves had no luck
unlocking the mystery of Brown, who lowered his ERA to a
microscopic 0.38 this postseason. He has 32 strikeouts and has
allowed just eight hits in 23 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had 11 strikeouts Thursday and didn't allow a runner to
advance past second base after the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   He shut down the middle of the Braves' lineup _ Chipper Jones,
Andres Galarraga and Ryan Klesko _ holding them to one hit in nine
at-bats. The trio is hitting .048 (1-for-21) in the first two games
of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if any teams would have hit him (Brown),'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ``Houston has as good a lineup as any team
in the National League, and they didn't touch him. We have a good
lineup, and we didn't touch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine allowed just one run despite pitching in trouble all
night and was no match for Brown, who also was 2-for-4 at the plate
and scored in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the Padres' lineup started a two-out rally in the
sixth when Glavine finally ran out of ways to escape trouble. Chris
Gomez, Brown and Quilvio Veras hit consecutive singles, Gomez
scoring on Veras' base hit up the middle to give the Padres a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres had runners in scoring position in four of their six
innings against Glavine. It was a laborious night for the Braves
lefthander, who threw 83 pitches in the first four innings and 121
for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scored on two seeing-eye singles and a ball up the middle
that was just out of (second baseman) Keith Lockhart's reach,''
said Glavine. ``When you're in as much trouble as I was in, sooner
or later something is going to go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is 6-0 with a 1.85 ERA in his last eight starts
against Atlanta, wouldn't know that feeling. He retired nine of the
first 11 batters he faced and didn't allow a hit until Jones'
one-out single in the fourth inning. The 33-year-old righthander
allowed two more harmless singles the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had great stuff,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said. ``When
Kevin is on, he's as tough as any pitcher. He's just locked in
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres cushioned the lead against rookie Odalis Perez in the
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Brown got things started with a single and scored on a single by
Veras, who was 3-for-4. Veras scored the final run on Joyner's
infield single.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' Galarraga said. ``But I still feel
positive about this team. We still have a chance. Maybe things will
be better for us on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   They can't be any worse.

INQUIRY CERTAIN TO LEAD TO IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ &LR;   &LR; Even before Thursday's vote, an alarming
assumption had taken hold on Capitol Hill: William Jefferson
Clinton will be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of how an impeachment inquiry is just the
beginning of a deliberate search for the truth, the prevailing
wisdom inside the Beltway is that Congress is headed down an
irreversible path toward the first impeachment trial since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   As a mystified nation wonders how a tawdry sexual affair could
explode into an episode of historic significance, the political
class that dominates this town is preparing for months of scholarly
discussions on the Constitution, salacious arguments about sex and
then a partisan vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Though the conventional wisdom has been wrong many times before,
there is a firm belief that House Republicans _ ranging from
anti-Clinton crusaders and religious-right stalwarts to the
political moderates and constitutional purists _ have already seen
enough to support articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a fait accompli,'' said Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.
``There isn't any doubt in anybody's mind around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, an impeachment vote in the House does not mean
removal from office. That would take a two-thirds vote in the
Senate, and nobody believes that will happen. The prediction is
that Clinton will serve the remainder of his term, as Andrew
Johnson did, after having faced the House's ultimate rebuke more
than 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is a foregone conclusion,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren,
D-Calif., just moments before the House cast its ballots Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Republicans) don't care about the Constitution,'' she said,
previewing the coming hearings before the Judiciary Committee, of
which she is a member. ``I think we're going to be talking about
thong underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Democrats sometimes like to make such dire
predictions to portray their counterparts as extremists. But on
this issue, Republicans make the same prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the president does the honorable thing and resigns, we
are definitely headed toward the spectacle of an impeachment trial
in the U.S. Senate sometime in the first half of next year.'' said
Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   As farfetched as impeachment seems to those outside the
capital's self-absorbed web of intrigue, a look at what it would
take to derail Republicans from such a course shows why so many
political junkies believe it is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The surest way to make talk of impeachment go away is for
Democrats to make big advances in the coming election. The Nov. 3
vote, even if voters do not see it that way, will be interpreted as
a referendum on Clinton and impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic advances _ though possible _ seem unlikely. Some
polls have detected anger at Republicans for pursuing the inquest.
Other polls suggest that those most likely to vote are those who
are angry at Clinton. Most independent analysts expect Republicans
to pick up from five to 15 seats in the House and two to four seats
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to stave off impeachment is for the Republican
leaders, sensing the public's outrage at the inquiry, to back off.
As lawmakers explore the details to determine whether Clinton lied
under oath, they may find themselves on terrority that is difficult
to defend.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1860s, Congress debated whether Johnson fired a cabinet
secretary in defiance of the law. In the 1970s, it debated whether
President Richard Nixon used the FBI and CIA to cover up a
politically motivated burglary. In the coming months, Congress may
be in the position of having to debate whether President Clinton
touched Monica Lewinsky's breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are more solemn issues regarding lying under
oath, conspiracy and obstruction of justice, after nine months of
news reports it appears that the public is even more outraged over
the intrusion into the president's privacy, providing Democrats a
golden opportunity to attack his inquisitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president betrayed his wife. He did not betray the
country. God help this nation if we fail to recognize the
difference,'' railed Rep. Robert Wexler, D-Fla., during Thursday's
debate.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans to back off would require some key moderates to
step forward. Some insiders have suggested that Reps. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C., or Robert Goodlatte, R-Pa., both of whom serve on
the Judiciary Committee, might serve that role. Or perhaps House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, in an effort to shore up moderate votes in
his quest for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000, might
decide to broker a deal with the president and declare that ``our
long national nightmare is over.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no evidence of such inclinations Thursday, as
Republicans accused Clinton of far more serious sins than trying to
conceal an extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If perjury and obstruction of justice do not undermine the
integrity of the office, what offenses would?'' asked Rep. Charles
Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, impeachment could be avoided if Clinton resigns, as
Nixon did in 1974 when his removal from office became certain.
Clinton has made clear that he will not do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the future holds,'' Hyde said as the debate
opened Thursday. Most of Washington seems to think it does.  &LR;

RESEARCH DEAL BETWEEN UC BERKELEY, BIOTECH FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ An unprecedented $50 million research alliance
is nearing the final stage of negotiation between the University of
California at Berkeley and a unit of Swiss biotechnology giant
Novartis.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The five-year deal promises to bring $5 million a year in
research grants to the Berkeley campus, mostly to faculty in the
College of Natural Resources who specialize in unlocking the
genetic secrets of agricultural products. Talks also envision
expanded new laboratories on the Berkeley campus worth an
additional $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alliances with industry have become commonplace throughout
academia as cash-strapped institutions seek both financial
salvation and technological know-how. But the unusually broad scope
of the Berkeley-Novartis deal is expected to raise new questions
about the danger of corporate influences subverting academic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative outlines of the UC Berkeley deal were confirmed
publicly this week after several months of private talks between
the university and the Novartis Agribusiness Discovery Institute, a
new San Diego-based subsidiary of a company-sponsored research
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $25 million in research grants would be funneled to
plant and microbial gene researchers through a faculty-controlled
committee that would evaluate proposals. In return, Novartis would
get certain negotiating rights to develop the most promising
scientific discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis may also pay to refurbish and expand a building on
campus that would provide laboratory space for three
Novartis-affiliated researchers, who also would be adjunct members
of the Berkeley faculty.
</P>
<P>
   That part of the deal is tentative, and negotiators also are
looking into the possibility of locating the Novartis-run labs
somewhere off campus. The UC Board of Regents would have to approve
the capital-spending part of any deal. Also, any company
researchers would have to meet all the standard university
requirements to gain faculty status.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Rausser, dean of the College of Natural Resources, said
he already has been hearing from skeptics concerned about such cozy
relations between a public university and a single industrial
partner.
</P>
<P>
   But he predicted most of the concerns will vanish once the full
details of the plan become known.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique alliance,'' he said. ``It allows total
freedom on the part of the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main advantages for the university, according to
faculty members and administrators, is access to Novartis
technology _ stores of genetic-sequence information that is
becoming critical in virtually all the life sciences.
</P>
<P>
   It takes big teams _ and corporate-size budgets _ to decipher
and compile the key genomic information. Without it, faculty
members cannot keep pace at the ``frontiers of cutting-edge
research,'' Rausser said.
</P>
<P>
   For Novartis, company decisionmakers could take up to 120 days
to look over research results to determine whether to seek patent
rights. If the company decided to pass, the university could then
seek development rights with any other company.
</P>
<P>
   Such features are designed to mollify critics of other
university-corporate deals that, they say, could lock up important
research if it doesn't meet short-term profit potential or perhaps
might benefit competitors more than the sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether such concerns will become a major
impediment to the Novartis-Berkeley deal. The first full public
airing of the agreement is scheduled for next month, although
academic authorities already are being briefed on key aspects.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Berkeley Chancellor Robert Berdahl said that
while Berdahl supports the ``general concept,'' he has yet to sign
off on the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is premature as far as the chancellor is
concerned,'' said campus spokesman Jesus Mena. ``Discussions are
going on. Things may shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Briggs, president of the Novartis agricultural-research
institute, said talks ``from the beginning'' have focused on
finding ways to collaborate without violating campus traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're really doing is simply adding resources, more
funding and more technology, so the faculty can do more work,'' he
said. ``We're in no way trying to change the mission of the
university.''

<P>
   But three Irish fugitives whom the FBI apprehended in California
several years ago remain imprisoned at the federal penitentiary in
Pleasanton with little hope of early release. Kevin Barry Artt, Pol
((cq)) Brennan and Terry Kirby have slipped through the cracks of
Northern Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Four hundred and twenty prisoners in Northern Ireland are
eligible to apply for early release under the peace accord. So far,
68 have been released. Two hundred inmates are expected to be back
on the streets by Christmas. About 200 more will be let go by June
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, the three fugitives are caught in a limbo of
legal uncertainty. British officials are continuing to pursue
extradition warrants against Artt, Brennan and Kirby, and have also
blocked their requests for bail. Artt and Kirby were convicted of
murder, Brennan of possessing an IRA bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Irish activists complain that Britain's hard line is vindictive.
British officials say they are simply seeking criminal justice.
</P>
<P>
   The three took part in a 1983 mass escape from the Maze Prison
near Belfast and then settled in California. All have families in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prisoners need to be released to their own communities,
wherever that might be,'' said John Fogarty, regional vice
president of the Irish American Unity Conference. ``There is
potential here of uprooting families or destroying them. My feeling
is that common sense and a sense of compassion should rule here.''
</P>
<P>
   The inmates fear that if returned to Belfast and eventually
released there, they will not be allowed to return to their homes
in the United States because of their alleged or acknowledged ties
to the Irish Republican Army. Traditionally, the State Department
has refused to grant entry visas to suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be an appropriate part of the peace process to drop
the extradition of these men,'' said former U.S. Representative
Bruce Morrison, an adviser of President Clinton on Irish issues.
``There seems to be little benefit to anyone to extradite them and
separate them from their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Mastrogiorgio, editor of the New Irish Gael newspaper in
San Francisco, said British officials are singling out Artt,
Brennan and Kirby ``because they were embarrassed by them. Their
anti-extradition fights in America focused a lot of media attention
on Britain's human rights record in Northern Ireland and the
collusion between security forces and pro-British assassins.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department, which is representing Britain in
the extradition cases, says its hands are tied. ``If the U.K.
withdraws its request, the extradition proceedings will be
discontinued,'' said Sara Criscitelli, a lawyer for the department.
``But unless that occurs, we have an obligation under the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Britain is holding fast. ``They have all been convicted
of very serious offenses,'' said Paul Johnston, a British spokesman
in New York. ``When they return to custody in Northern Ireland,
Artt, Brennan and Kirby will be eligible to (apply) to the
Sentences Commission for early release.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams is expected to raise the cases
of Artt, Brennan and Kirby when he visits the White House on
Sunday. Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, has asked Britain to
withdraw its extradition requests.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Adams and his arch-rival, David Trimble, minister of
the new Northern Ireland Assembly, held private talks for the first
time. A few days later, Britain removed its troops from the streets
of Belfast and began releasing paramilitary prisoners, including
men convicted of bombings and political killings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the peace accord, approved in May by Irish voters, Britain
has agreed to release all prisoners linked to the IRA and certain
Protestant loyalist groups in the next two years _ except for those
considered a danger to society.
</P>
<P>
   Artt and San Francisco house painter Jimmy Smyth, who also was
among the 38 inmates who escaped from the Maze Prison, were
arrested by the FBI in June 1992. FBI agents arrested Brennan in
Berkeley in 1993, and picked up Kirby in Concord in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth, who was extradited to Northern Ireland in 1996, has
applied for early release. He is likely to be freed soon and plans
to settle in Belfast with his American wife, Julie Smyth, and their
son, Conner, who was born August 2.
</P>
<P>
   All four Catholic nationalist fugitives claim to be victims of
religious and political persecution in the British-controlled
province. Artt and Kirby said that Belfast detectives beat them
into making false confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. District Judge Charles A. Legge of San Francisco
ruled that Artt, Brennan and Kirby should be extradited. Legge said
that although he might find Artt and Kirby's confessions
involuntary under U.S. law, he had no authority to reconsider their
guilt. The inmates appealed his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Artt, 38, was convicted by a nonjury trial of the 1979 murder of
an off-duty prison warden and sentenced to life in prison. At his
extradition hearing, Artt's lawyers presented evidence that
detectives' notes of his 10-day interrogation were falsified. Artt
is engaged to Erin Riley, a U.S. citizen who works in San
Francisco. He has two children: Kara, 10, of San Diego; and Barry,
18, of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, 42, was sentenced to life in prison for the 1976 killing
of a gas station attendant during a suspected IRA bombing. He
admits being an IRA member, but denies any involvement in the
killing. After his escape, he settled in Concord and married
Colleen Dolan, a U.S. citizen. They have a 3-year-old daughter,
Keely.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, 45, was arrested in 1976 in possession of an IRA bomb
and sentenced to 16 years in Maze Prison. After his escape, Brennan
took an American wife, Joanna Volz, and worked as a carpenter in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Release of these three is totally consistent with the spirit
of the peace agreement _ its intent to put all the agony
experienced by people on all sides of the conflict behind them,''
said San Francisco attorney Jim Brosnahan, who represents Artt.
``As prisoners are released, there's no reason to make an exception
of these three men.''

SENATE OKS CLINTON'S PICK FOR 9TH CIRCUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Despite opposition from conservative lawmakers,
the U.S. Senate confirmed Berkeley law professor William Fletcher
to be a federal judge Thursday, more than three years after he was
nominated.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fletcher, who was approved by a 57-to-41 vote, had been waiting
longer than any other Clinton nominee to secure his post. His
nomination by President Clinton to the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco had become bogged down in complex
political maneuvers that were resolved only after Congress approved
a law this week barring family members from sitting on the same
bench.
</P>
<P>
   After being nominated in April 1995, the Boalt Hall School of
Law professor ran into problems because his mother, Betty Fletcher,
is also a judge on the Ninth Circuit court.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
blocked Fletcher's appointment, saying it would violate federal
anti-nepotism laws. To break the logjam, Fletcher's mother agreed
to step down if her son were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   But even after clearing that hurdle, Fletcher faced opposition
from conservatives who said he would continue to tilt the Ninth
Circuit court in a too activist or liberal direction, as they said
his mother had done. Fletcher vigorously denied the charges, saying
he holds centrist positions that differ from his mother's.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Fletcher, a Rhodes Scholar, was also a friend of
Clinton's and had helped run his Northern California campaign for
president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   His nomination languished for months, and then years. Along the
way, a controversial deal was struck in the Senate in which Clinton
would nominate a conservative Republican judge from Washington
state in exchange for his confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the House and the Senate cleared the final obstacle
in Fletcher's path by approving a bill sponsored by Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., barring close relatives from sitting on the same court.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in one of the last days of the congressional session,
Hatch made only oblique references to the battles that surrounded
the nomination, and instead warmly praised Fletcher. ``I am the
first to say that I may not agree with all of Mr. Fletcher's
views,'' he said. ``But the president is entitled to have his
nominees confirmed provided that the nominee is well qualified and
will abide by the limitations on federal judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative lawmakers were not willing to let Fletcher's
confirmation go through without a fight. ``Mr. Fletcher's writings
and statements simply do not convince me that he will move the
Ninth Circuit closer to the mainstream of judicial thought,'' said
Sen. Michael DeWine, R-Ohio, a member of the Judiciary Committee,
who voted against Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   After 21 years as a law professor, Fletcher will finish up
classes at Boalt this semester before taking up his post on the San
Francisco bench in January. Thursday, he declined to comment on the
controversy and delays that plagued his nomination, except to say:
``I am very grateful for the faith the president has shown in me,
and for the Senate's confirmation.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mining is generally seen as a dirty business, full of grimy men
and gritty landscapes. But now nature is being coaxed into cleaning
up the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phytomining'' -- using plants to extract valuable metals from
the earth -- was once dismissed as a modern form of alchemy. But it
is gradually gaining scientific ground as researchers begin to
understand, and enhance, the ability of some plants to soak up such
elements as nickel or gold.
</P>
<P>
   Among the phytominers are Chris Anderson and Robert Brooks at
Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand. In this week's
issue of Nature, they report their success in forcing a distant
relative of the cabbage, Brassica juncea, to extract gold from the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial amount of the world's supply of gold is found, not
as nuggets or rich veins, but as fine dust in the soil, or among
the tons of broken rock (called tailings) left over from mining
operations. Squeezing the gold out of these sources by conventional
techniques is hard, so a good deal of the precious metal lies
ungathered.
</P>
<P>
   Brassica, however, can make the most of these rich pickings.
Left to its own devices, Brassica has a tough time absorbing gold
from tailings, since it is often bound to other materials that the
plant cannot absorb through its roots. But the New Zealand group
has borrowed a trick from the mining industry, treating Brassica's
gold-laden soil with ammonium thiocyanate, a chemical that
separates the metal from other substances.
</P>
<P>
   In the laboratory at least, Brassica's roots now seem able to
soak up the metal and carry it to the stem and leaves where it is
stored. When tested for their gold content, the plants contained
2,000 times more metal than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks does not yet know how easy it will be to harvest usable
gold from plant tissues. And the cost of the process may make it
unattractive to mining companies if the price of gold falls back
from its current $300 an ounce. That said, Brooks is already
testing his techniques out in the field, growing the plants on
surface mines in Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the plants can dig only so deep, because the
ammonium thiocyanate that must be spread on the ground for them to
do their job will penetrate and release gold only up to a foot
below the surface. As a result, Brooks has his eye on a natural
gold releaser, a soil bacterium called Thiobacillus ferro-oxidans,
that may be able to help his plants go about their business without
some of the economic (and environmental) drawbacks of his present
method.
</P>
<P>
   Brassica is not alone in its appetite for metal. Alan Baker, at
the University of Sheffield, has identified over 400 species which
naturally take up zinc, cadmium and other metals in soils which
would kill common-or-garden varieties. Some of these are already
being tested on field sites in America, Italy, Britain and New
Zealand to pull nickel out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only gold-diggers who have an interest in these
plants. Because they also absorb and concentrate toxic metals, such
as lead, these natural collectors could help to decontaminate
industrial waste sites, a process known as phytoremediation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meagher and his colleagues at the University of Georgia
have been boosting the clean-up capacity of yellow poplars, tobacco
and other crops by adding bacterial genes that convert deadly
methyl mercury into a far less toxic form.
</P>
<P>
   Such genetically engineered plants soak up methyl mercury from
the ground, but avoid concentrating the nasty substance in their
own tissues by passing the final, detoxified version out into the
atmosphere through the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury spills are still a problem in the western world, and are
a growing concern in developing countries, particularly in
industries such as gold mining. Here Meagher sees a two-fold
prospect for his plants: cleaning up dirty surface mines, and, with
more molecular tweaking, one day concentrating precious metal from
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a long way from a gold rush, but such plants could
offer some farmers a rich harvest.

 &HT;    A wrastlin' good time with the Superstars
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's far too hot for an October night, especially inside the
Nacogdoches
</P>
<P>
   Expo Center, where there's not a hint of a breeze. Flies are
buzzing around
</P>
<P>
   languidly, as if even they don't have enough energy in this
infernal heat,
</P>
<P>
   which won't go away despite our pleas and prayers.
</P>
<P>
   I soon realize I've overdressed for the Superstars of Wrestling
</P>
<P>
   Extravaganza about to take place. My blue jeans and golf shirt
look out of
</P>
<P>
   place among the tank tops, gym shorts and wide array of T-shirts
sporting
</P>
<P>
   wrestling logos: Mean People Rule. New World Order. Austin 3:16.
WWF. I
</P>
<P>
   start wondering where one buys pro-wrestling sports attire.
Never seen it in
</P>
<P>
   the mall, though I haven't been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt floor of the Expo has been covered with the old SFA
stadium
</P>
<P>
   artificial turf, an excellent example of recycling. A small ring
has been
</P>
<P>
   set up in the middle, surrounded by folding chairs. I'm in the
cheap seats,
</P>
<P>
   the bleachers about 75 feet from the ring, along with a gaggle
of children
</P>
<P>
   and dads, most of whom are quick to tell me they're only here
because their
</P>
<P>
   kids made them come. That's why I'm here at that, and my wife is
a member of the civic club sponsoring the show.
</P>
<P>
   I don't follow wrestling. My 91-year-old grandmother watches it
with a
</P>
<P>
   passion, talking to the TV ninety-to-nothing, booing the bad
guys and
</P>
<P>
   cheering on the heroes. She steadfastly refuses to believe
wrestling might
</P>
<P>
   be, ahem, fake or to put it more kindly, staged.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of folks here tonight who do follow the likes
of King Kong
</P>
<P>
   Bundy ( no kin to Al, apparently), Nasty Boys, Red Dog or Greg
``The Hammer ``
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, a second-generation wrestler whose dad, Johnny ``The
Hammer ``
</P>
<P>
   Valentine roamed the ring in the 1970s. Wrestling is hot among
adolescent
</P>
<P>
   boys right now, and they are here in force tonight.
</P>
<P>
   This event is being taped for future broadcasting, we're
informed by the
</P>
<P>
   ring announcer, who implores the audience to cheer lustily and
make lots of
</P>
<P>
   noise. Not a problem. This crowd is ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   The first match is between Red Dog and Dapper Dan. Red Dog is
wearing
</P>
<P>
   black-and-red Spandex that barely holds in his sumo-class gut.
Wrestling is
</P>
<P>
   a morality play, good vs. evil. Most times the good guy wins,
but not
</P>
<P>
   always.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately the air punches and canvas-stomping to approximate
the sound
</P>
<P>
   of a vicious forearm to the chest look even less convincing in
real life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I can see air between the fist and its intended
target, though the
</P>
<P>
   victim still moans loudly and grimaces in artificial pain.
</P>
<P>
   But the wrestlers are good athletes, bouncing off the ropes and
flipping
</P>
<P>
   over each other with grace and skill. The crowd loves it, and I
find myself
</P>
<P>
   enjoying it more than I thought I would.
</P>
<P>
   The second match features King Kong Bundy vs. an utterly
outmatched and
</P>
<P>
   thoroughly outweighed fellow from Longview by the name of Jason
Nash. Bundy,
</P>
<P>
   I'm told, is well-known in wrestling circles. He is certainly
hard to miss
</P>
<P>
   at 460 pounds stuffed into a black single-piece outfit. Nash, at
a mere 242
</P>
<P>
   pounds, doesn't stand a chance. He's dispatched in 85 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bundy grabs the microphone and declares, ``Every man in Texas
fears me;
</P>
<P>
   every woman in Texas wants me. `` I don't know about the women,
but I'd
</P>
<P>
   certainly address him in a deferential manner. He weighs three
times as much
</P>
<P>
   as I do.
</P>
<P>
   My youngest daughter and her compadres ask me the crucial
question: ``Is
</P>
<P>
   wrestling fake? Are they really hitting each other? ``
</P>
<P>
   I feel like the grinch telling a child about Santa Claus as I
explain that
</P>
<P>
   the odds of someone surviving 27 straight forearms to the head
without even
</P>
<P>
   sustaining a mild concussion a let alone a headache a are slim.
They seem
</P>
<P>
   vaguely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The last match we watch turns into a typical wrasslin' melee
with four
</P>
<P>
   combatants taking the fight out of the ring and onto the floor.
The referee,
</P>
<P>
   of course, does nothing to stop the riot. It's up to Nasty Boy
to save the
</P>
<P>
   day.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know who Nasty Boy is, other than he has a blond shag
haircut and a
</P>
<P>
   foul mouth. After giving a short speech laced with words we
can't put in the
</P>
<P>
   newspaper (even after Kenneth Starr's report), he leaves and
then comes back
</P>
<P>
   with a folding chair that he bangs over the head of the bad-guy
wrestler
</P>
<P>
   with a convincing clang. End of the match. I'm not sure good
triumphed over
</P>
<P>
   evil. More like evil triumphing over the banal. The crowd loves
it. Small
</P>
<P>
   children surround Nasty Boy as he leaves the ring. Who says
there aren't
</P>
<P>
   heroes anymore?
</P>
<P>
   It's a school night, and we leave early, dragging unwilling
children away.
</P>
<P>
   The step-son takes note of the Superstars of Wrestling web site
for future
</P>
<P>
   reference (www.ssow.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned. The show might end up on late-night TV sometime. If
they show a crowd shot, I'm the guy in the back eating nachos and
taking notes, hoping
</P>
<P>
   King Kong Bundy isn't offended by my attire or attitude. He
could squash me
</P>
<P>
   like a fly.

 &HT;    By Scott Eyman

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ BUILDING A COMPANY: Roy O. Disney and
the Creation of an Entertainment Empire, by Bob Thomas. Hyperion;
359 pages; $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in this resolutely interesting biography of the
other Disney, someone speculates that, without his brother, Walt
Disney would have been a mediocre cartoonist for somebody else's
company. And without his brother, Roy would have been a provincial
bank manager in Glendale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the Disney brothers had each other. Actually, Walt
needed Roy more than Roy needed Walt, because nobody but family
would have continually acquiesced to Walt's wild dreams.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney brothers were Missouri farm boys whose father was a
fiery Socialist with a gift for failure. That both of Elias
Disney's sons grew up to be rock-ribbed Republicans, not to mention
self-made millionaires, is a delicious, possibly profound
generational joke.
</P>
<P>
   All their lives, Walt was the locomotive, and Roy was the
engineer who was frantically trying to keep the train on the
tracks. Their relationship was an extension of the familiar
childhood dynamic in which the older boy is instructed to take care
of his younger brother. Roy did, all his life.
</P>
<P>
   When Walt wanted to make cartoons, Roy, armed with a small
disability pension from his service in World War I, went out to
California to lend him a hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Walt, barely breaking even on black-and-white cartoons,
wanted to upgrade to color, Roy found the money.
</P>
<P>
   When Walt wanted to violate every ounce of conventional wisdom
and make a feature-length cartoon, Roy found the money.
</P>
<P>
   When the studio teetered on the edge of bankruptcy after the
consecutive failures of Bambi, Pinocchio and Fantasia, Roy somehow
managed to make payroll every week, even though nobody is sure how
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   And, when Walt developed a compulsion to build an amusement park
in Anaheim which could only overextend an already perilously
financed company, Roy went along, against his better judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The venerable Hollywood reporter Bob Thomas tells a story of
old-fashioned empire building, but he keeps the scale human. Thomas
simplifies the financial complexities but doesn't simplify the
fascinating emotional dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney was similar to the man his publicists created, but
not identical. He smoke, he drank, he had a good line in profanity,
he carried a strong residual grudge against his father, who was
prone to physically lashing out when angry, and who never believed
in his son.
</P>
<P>
   After they became successful, the brothers bought their parents
a house and took care of them, but it was Roy who did the grunt
work of keeping in touch, listening to them complain about their
declining health, etc. Walt was very careful to keep them at arm's
length.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were Roy and Walt a latter-day Damon and Pythias act. They
argued. At one point, late in their lives, they didn't speak for
two years, over a holding company engineered by Walt that, Roy
believed, verged on the unethical, and opened the company up to
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland brought the company to the edge of catastrophe. To
get the money, Roy used the film library as collateral, hocked
every lease they had, used up all of ABC's _ the brothers' partner
on the deal _ credit line. Roy even borrowed on the brothers' life
insurance. None of it fazed Walt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the worst thing that can happen to you?'' Walt mused
one day during construction. ``You could go broke. I look at it
this way: I've been broke five times in my life. One more time
won't hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The park ended up costing $15 million. Had it failed, it would
have taken the company with it. But Walt was right; Disneyland, and
Disneyland alone, was the vehicle that drove the company to
ultimate success; by 1961, Roy had paid off every company loan.
</P>
<P>
   Building A Company _ a drab, unworthy title _ holds interest
throughout, especially toward the end, as Roy, in his mid-70s, puts
aside his desire for retirement and girds his loins to build Disney
World after Walt's death. (According to Thomas, 12,000 acres in
North Palm Beach owned by John D. MacArthur was an early
possibility for the site, but the deal fell apart early on.)
</P>
<P>
   It was Roy who ramrodded the planning and construction of the
Florida park, and it undoubtedly took years off his life _ he died
of a sudden stroke just months after the park's 1971 opening.
</P>
<P>
   Although Roy had appointed a successor to run the business side,
his brother's inability to delegate meant that the creative side
was barren of anybody who could approach Walt's drive and vision.
The studio entered upon a long period of drift. Before the arrival
of Michael Eisner, who combined some of the best parts of both
brothers, all that kept Disney afloat was the parks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the continually surprising things about the Disneys is
how limited they were intellectually. Thomas quotes liberally from
Roy's letters, and they're like something out of an early Sinclair
Lewis novel, with the banal vocabulary and fusty mind of a
19th-century Plains banker.
</P>
<P>
   Roy talked about walking into a planning session for Fantasia.
``Can't you select some music that just the ordinary guy like me
can like?'' Roy asked. ``They all froze up and Walt ordered me out
of the room. `Go back down and keep the books,' he said.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the Disney brothers' horizons had been
wider, their minds wouldn't have been so focused. As it was, they
bonded with their generation, and their generation's children and
grandchildren and great-grandchildren to develop an unparalleled
sense of brand loyalty to the values contained in the name Disney.

 &HT;    When surfboards were long and the craze was young
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Surfing San Onofre to Point Dume:
1936-1942 (Chronicle, $24.95) is a superlative collection of
photographs by the late Don James, who was in at the inception of
the coming of surfing to Southern California in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   These images, individually unremarkable, cumulatively haunting,
document young men who built and finished their own surfboards,
strapped them to the top of battered Model A's and headed for the
beach with their girlfriends. The faces are
</P>
<P>
   specifically American, strong young bodies built without the aid
of steroids, recognizable even today as classic examples of the
California gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   Don James became a dentist and died at the end of 1996, just
after he saw an early, privately published edition of this book. I
hold no particular brief for surfing and know little about it
beyond a cursory exposure to Bruce Brown movies. But these
photographs are about innocence and time as much as they're about
surfing, and I recommend this deeply atmospheric collection.
</P>
<P>
   NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA AND SON . . . Abrams has signed up The
Escape of Alexei, a book about a St. Petersburg customs inspector
named Oleg Filatov, who believed he was the hemophiliac son of
Nicholas II, miraculously escaped from the slaughter of his family
in Ekaterinburg.
</P>
<P>
   The book, to be published in November, is written by Filatov's
son and will feature 100 photographs documenting the supposedly
amazing resemblance between Alexei Romanov and Oleg Filatov.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond a doubtful escape from the Red death squad, to believe
this particular story you have to posit that Alexei somehow
vanquished a case of hemophilia so severe that he wasn't expected
to live long enough to assume the throne, not to mention living for
another 60 years undetected by a government with a considerable
stake in making sure no Romanov was alive anywhere in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Selling this book to anybody but hard-core fantasists and
disappointed adherents of Anna Anderson will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   WRETCHED EXCESS . . . Molly Jong-Fast _ say her name quickly and
she sounds like one of Fu Manchu's minions _ is the daughter of
Erica Jong and Jonathan Fast, and the granddaughter of Howard Fast.
She has been signed to write Girl, a novel about youth coming of
age amid sex and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Jong-Fast is 19 years old. Joyce Maynard must be furious.

   Mining is generally seen as a dirty business, full of grimy men
and gritty landscapes. But now nature is being coaxed into cleaning
up the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phytomining'' -- using plants to extract valuable metals from
the earth -- was once dismissed as a modern form of alchemy. But it
is gradually gaining scientific ground as researchers begin to
understand, and enhance, the ability of some plants to soak up such
elements as nickel or gold.
</P>
<P>
   Among the phytominers are Chris Anderson and Robert Brooks at
Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand. In this week's
issue of Nature, they report their success in forcing a distant
relative of the cabbage, Brassica juncea, to extract gold from the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A substantial amount of the world's supply of gold is found, not
as nuggets or rich veins, but as fine dust in the soil, or among
the tons of broken rock (called tailings) left over from mining
operations. Squeezing the gold out of these sources by conventional
techniques is hard, so a good deal of the precious metal lies
ungathered.
</P>
<P>
   Brassica, however, can make the most of these rich pickings.
Left to its own devices, Brassica has a tough time absorbing gold
from tailings, since it is often bound to other materials that the
plant cannot absorb through its roots. But the New Zealand group
has borrowed a trick from the mining industry, treating Brassica's
gold-laden soil with ammonium thiocyanate, a chemical that
separates the metal from other substances.
</P>
<P>
   In the laboratory at least, Brassica's roots now seem able to
soak up the metal and carry it to the stem and leaves where it is
stored. When tested for their gold content, the plants contained
2,000 times more metal than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks does not yet know how easy it will be to harvest usable
gold from plant tissues. And the cost of the process may make it
unattractive to mining companies if the price of gold falls back
from its current $300 an ounce. That said, Brooks is already
testing his techniques out in the field, growing the plants on
surface mines in Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the plants can dig only so deep, because the
ammonium thiocyanate that must be spread on the ground for them to
do their job will penetrate and release gold only up to a foot
below the surface. As a result, Brooks has his eye on a natural
gold releaser, a soil bacterium called Thiobacillus ferro-oxidans,
that may be able to help his plants go about their business without
some of the economic (and environmental) drawbacks of his present
method.
</P>
<P>
   Brassica is not alone in its appetite for metal. Alan Baker, at
the University of Sheffield, has identified over 400 species which
naturally take up zinc, cadmium and other metals in soils which
would kill common-or-garden varieties. Some of these are already
being tested on field sites in America, Italy, Britain and New
Zealand to pull nickel out of the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not only gold-diggers who have an interest in these
plants. Because they also absorb and concentrate toxic metals, such
as lead, these natural collectors could help to decontaminate
industrial waste sites, a process known as phytoremediation.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Meagher and his colleagues at the University of Georgia
have been boosting the clean-up capacity of yellow poplars, tobacco
and other crops by adding bacterial genes that convert deadly
methyl mercury into a far less toxic form.
</P>
<P>
   Such genetically engineered plants soak up methyl mercury from
the ground, but avoid concentrating the nasty substance in their
own tissues by passing the final, detoxified version out into the
atmosphere through the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury spills are still a problem in the western world, and are
a growing concern in developing countries, particularly in
industries such as gold mining. Here Meagher sees a two-fold
prospect for his plants: cleaning up dirty surface mines, and, with
more molecular tweaking, one day concentrating precious metal from
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a long way from a gold rush, but such plants could
offer some farmers a rich harvest.

 &HT;    Glenn prepares fopr launch with all the same jitters
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, FLA. _ The advances in rocketry and space ship
systems may give Sen. John Glenn a smoother, roomier trip in orbit
than his last one 36 years ago, but he admitted Thursday that he
still has one recurring anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I was scared to death I was going to catch a cold
or something and might be replaced,'' Glenn said. ``I feel the same
way right now.''
</P>
<P>
   With the mammoth launch pad and shuttle looming behind them,
Glenn and the rest of the Discovery space shuttle crew scheduled to
fly Oct. 29, met briefly with reporters to talk about the final
weeks of preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go,'' Glenn said. ``Three weeks from
(Thursday). . . that thing will light off back there. And I'm
really looking forward to this, as you can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven-member shuttle crew arrived Tuesday night from
Houston, where they do most of their training, for three days of
countdown practice at the launch facility of the Kennedy Space
Center. The primary function of the countdown test is to bring
together the flight crew and the launch crew to iron out any
wrinkles in the strict launch day schedule NASA has planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that the flight crew get to talk and work with
the launch team,'' said Steve Altemus, the NASA test director.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the crew will strap into their seats in the orbiter and
run through the countdown to liftoff, stopping five seconds short.
Each of the shuttle's main systems will be activated in sequence,
and the astronauts will switch from outside air to the oxygen
supply in their suits before the countdown test ends. Then, they'll
fake an emergency and evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency retreat was a part of training Wednesday, too. The
crew was instructed on how to drive a small, armored personnel
carrier that will be stationed at the base of the launch pad. The
tank-like buggy is a safety precaution, like a concrete bunker near
by, that could be used if a fuel tank leaks or a fire ignites.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel carrier has never been used, but the training is
done for every launch and every crew member.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one in the tank scrambles up the driver seat and
becomes the operator (in an emergency),'' said George Hoggard, fire
captain in the space center's own fire department. ``That's why we
teach everybody to do this; first come first served.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoggard, who sits atop the personnel carrier while the crew
member steers from inside through the half-mile training course,
tried to be blase about his most famous pupil, saying, ``One ride's
as bumpy as the next ride.''
</P>
<P>
   But it took little prompting to get the 61-year-old to 'fess up
about his view of Glenn: ``I admire him a heck of a lot for his
efforts and I think that the information gathered on this mission
can be very valuable to us senior citizens

 &HT;    Let's hear from the small towns
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all the paid-for lies and distortions running on television
this political season, I was heartened to read something Roy Barnes
said on a campaign trip to Jesup, population 10,000 more or less,
deep in southeast Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a close election, and I think it's going to
be decided south of Macon,'' he predicted. In other words, it's
going to be even-steven in the Atlanta doughnut, with South Georgia
tipping the scale.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, I can sleep a little better.
</P>
<P>
   ``South of Macon'' translates into the small-town and rural
vote, still largely guided by old-fashioned values and horse sense.
</P>
<P>
   My first visit to Jesup was about 100 years ago. The Jesup
football team had pulled off the impossible, beating mighty
Valdosta for the state championship. Furman Bisher, my boss at The
Atlanta Journal, sent me down to report on the victory banquet.
</P>
<P>
   It was a memorable evening, starting at 7 p.m. and ending
slightly before midnight. The cooks who had prepared the food in
the school cafeteria were asked to come out and take a bow.
Everybody who contributed to the successful season was introduced.
It soon became apparent everyone in town had contributed. I
especially remember the mothers who baby-sat for other mothers who
drove cheerleaders to cheerleading practice.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Butts, the football coach at the University of Georgia,
was the guest speaker. It was past 11:30 when he finally was called
to the podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like ol' Clegg, our water boy, felt last year when we
were getting beat so bad by Auburn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they scored their fourth touchdown in the third quarter,
Clegg came up to me and said, `Coach, ain't there no way we can get
this thing over with and go home?'''
</P>
<P>
   It was a long night, but it was easy to see something special in
people who cared so much for their town and for each other.
</P>
<P>
   Later on, I got to know Dink NeSmith Jr., owner of the local
newspaper. Any time I passed that way, I stopped to visit and go
around the corner to Jones' Kitchen for fried chicken, turnip
greens, fried okra, mashed potatoes and banana pudding.
</P>
<P>
   I also got to know Dink NeSmith Sr., who owned the local funeral
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be awfully proud of your son,'' I said to him in one
of our conversations. Little Dink was coming off his term as
president of the Georgia Press Association, the youngest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am,'' NeSmith replied, ``but I sure was worried about him
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How was that?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent him up to Athens to the university to get an education,
and he joined everything except the Ladies Missionary Society. I
didn't see how he was going to have time for an education.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Dink must have learned something. About 10 years ago, he
hooked up with Tom Wood, the innovative former CEO of the
Journal-Constitution, to start a community newspaper company. At
last count, they were up to nearly 50 papers and growing.
</P>
<P>
   When I drove to Jesup a few days ago, I arrived at the First
Baptist Church 40 minutes before the funeral service was to begin.
The church was already full. I had to sit with a lot of other
people and a TV set in the cafeteria. Dink NeSmith Sr., who went to
work at the age of 11, scrimped and saved to send three children to
college, and wore a starched white shirt and tie even when he mowed
the lawn, in his 74 years filled just about every community and
church role in town _ except the Ladies Missionary Society.
</P>
<P>
   Little Dink told about finally getting rid of his clip-on
necktie and having a regular grown-up tie to wear to Sunday school.
He didn't know how to tie a real tie and had to ask his father for
help.
</P>
<P>
   After several unsuccessful tries, the frustrated
undertaker/father solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go over to the couch and lie down on your back,'' he
commanded. Until he learned to tie his own knot, Little Dink had to
lie on his back, like a corpse, every Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   After a round of Bach, tributes by numerous townfolk, and
favorite renditions by a gospel quartet, Little Dink announced that
interment at the cemetery would be delayed two hours so everybody
could enjoy dinner on the ground, because ``that's what Daddy would
want.'' Food tables ran from inside the cafeteria to under the oaks
outside.
</P>
<P>
   NeSmith loved to entertain friends and family in his back yard.
Fish fries and barbecues were always topped off with hand-cranked
ice cream and boiled peanuts, his signature favorites. Everybody
who came to his funeral got a dish of homemade ice cream and a bag
of boiled peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   High school banquets and funerals are a good way to take the
measure of a town. Although it's grown a lot, Jesup hasn't changed
much since that night in 1950-something when they spent an evening
celebrating a football championship.
</P>
<P>
   With the mess in Washington and paid political lies at home, I
was about to throw in with Neal Boortz and give up on the country.
Now I'm not quite ready. As long as we have small towns, and values
that endure in small towns, we can hope.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Tea time and politics in Paris
 &HT;    (Resending to fix line breaks.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It's Sunday, 4 p.m., and tea time for Americans in Paris
who gather at George Whitman's famed bookstore, Shakespeare &AMP; Co.,
just across the River Seine from Notre Dame Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, 86, has operated his store from this site since coming
to Paris in 1951. The location itself goes back somewhat further,
at least to the 16th century, when it served as a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   These days it is a place of congregation for those of us who
worship books and good writing.
</P>
<P>
   But on this particular day, in a cramped third-floor room
crowded wall-to-wall with some 20 students and writers, the topic
at tea time was politics, and the devilment thereof. Nobody to
blame but myself.
</P>
<P>
   I'd made the mistake of asking a middle-aged poet who recently
moved to Paris from Kentucky, a natural progression of sorts, what
the talk was of Bill and Monica.
</P>
<P>
   He all but exploded. ``It's asinine to speak of it,'' he said,
fuming, ``a ridiculous waste of time, conversation and ink, a
subject that people are tired of, fed up and disgusted with.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry I asked _ and even more so when for the next hour the
group talked of nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the younger women, U.S. exchange students living
with French families, had the most to say. They represented a wide
area of America, from Florida to Michigan, Washington, D.C., to
California.
</P>
<P>
   The quotes here are approximate. I find it all but impossible to
take tea and notes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I can't believe America is making such an issue of it. This
is a private affair. It should be kept private.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``My French family is more disgusted with Hillary than Bill.
They can't understand why she isn't showing more jealousy and
outrage. They say, `I would look for love elsewhere myself if I
were married to such an uncaring person.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I feel sorry for Chelsea. Imagine what she is going through.
A politician's family shouldn't be made part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Blame that on the politicians for the way they campaign,
exhibiting their families as if they were trophies and show horses.
The image of the family becomes part of the campaign promises.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``But when did we ever expect politicians to keep their
campaign promises?''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Too bad Clinton didn't get involved with a military woman.
The military is sworn to protect the president.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Better had he found someone a little older and a little less
tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Instead, he picked the ugliest women on the face of the
earth.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I feel sorry for Monica. Just think how it must be, that
every awful thing you ever did is laid out on a table for all to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Yes, but she was the one who put them there.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Excuse me, but I can't forgive her for keeping the dress.
And then, of all things, sending it to her mother. My mother would
have ... I can't imagine what my mother would have done to me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``It was a message she was sending to her mother. `Look, I've
slept with the most powerful man in the world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Well, they never actually slept together. They never took
that much time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Did you see the latest poll results? When asked, 66 percent
of the women in Washington said they'd never have sex with
President Clinton again.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went: Bill and Monica, tea and sympathy, or the lack
thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare, anyone?

 &HT;    Switzer's life after football remains in high gear
 &HT;    By Rick Cantu
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Barry Switzer is too busy riding his motorcycle
through the wilderness of Wyoming to worry about trivial matters
such as the annual Oklahoma-Texas football game.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer, easy rider and former football coach, is a busy man.
When he isn't riding his Harley-Davidson on scenic highways, he is
visiting Hollywood movie sets, opening restaurants and making cameo
appearances on an Oklahoma City TV station.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer, 61, does not plan to be at the Cotton Bowl for the
grudge match between Texas and Oklahoma, the school he coached at
for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same anymore,'' Switzer said of the border
rivalry. ``There was a time when one team would be No. 1 in the
country and the other would be No. 2. Both OU and Texas had
national prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither team is ranked, and the game will be televised only in
this part of the country (KTBC).
</P>
<P>
   Switzer, who resigned as head coach of the Dallas Cowboys eight
months ago, is filled with memories about his college career. In
1973, his first year as head coach of the Sooners, OU defeated
Texas 52-13.
</P>
<P>
   In 16 years as a head coach at OU, Switzer's team was 9-5-2
against the Longhorns. When he retired from the college game in
1988, he left OU with a 157-29-4 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had better talent than Texas in '73,'' Switzer said, ``and
Texas had damn good talent. But we had guys like the Selmon
brothers and Joe Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite memory is the 1984 OU-Texas game. Switzer had
just hired a new offensive coordinator, a man named Mack Brown, and
the Sooners and Longhorns struggled to a 15-15 tie.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only Red River rivalry matchup for Brown, a
33-year-old assistant who became the head coach of the Texas
Longhorns 14 years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mack Brown was the best and smartest offensive coordinator we
ever had at OU,'' Switzer said this week. ``Mack was a complete
coach. He helped turn the whole program around.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzer recently visited Brown at the UT coach's office. Switzer
offered this prediction on Longhorns football: ``I've said that it
will take Mack less than three years to turn the program around.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzer might have been the most hated sports figure in Texas
from 1973 to 1988. He was a terrific recruiter, and Oklahoma
developed a knack for signing the best high school players in the
Lone Star state.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer easily was the most successful and popular coach in
Sooners football history. His games against Texas icon Darrell
Royal are legendary. Yet the best part of coaching was not the
thrill of winning or losing a game in the Cotton Bowl or various
stadiums in Oklahoma and beyond, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer enjoyed his relationships with his players. It's the
reason he prefers the college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the college game much more than the pros,'' he said.
``A college coach has a better opportunity to shape and mold the
lives of the young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzer does not have similar feelings about his four-year
tenure with the Cowboys, which ended after the team finished 6-10
last season. Overall his record was a respectable 45-26, but he was
blamed for the team's gradual decline the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   He is not crying sour grapes, though, over his days with the
Cowboys. After Dallas defeated Washington recently, three players _
Leon Lett, Michael Irvin and Erik Williams _ visited Switzer at a
Dallas restaurant. And he still talks frequently with his former
boss, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer is much too busy to coach again. He currently is reading
a script for a movie that will be directed by Oliver Stone. In the
movie, which begins shooting in the spring, Al Pacino plays the
role of an NFL coach. Switzer will audition for the part of an
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark Switzer's second turn in acting. He had a bit part
in ``Varsity Blues,'' another football movie that will be released
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   He is also preparing to open two restaurants in Oklahoma City
and contributes commentaries on college football for an Oklahoma TV
station. He plans to sell his house near Dallas and return to
Oklahoma soon.
</P>
<P>
   Switzer recently spent two weeks riding his motorcycle with five
buddies through Wyoming, Utah and Colorado. It's a trip he has made
several times in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he will coach again, he gave an emphatic no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the fourth quarter of my life, getting close to the
two-minute warning,'' Switzer said, pausing for a hearty laugh.
``But I'm planning to go into overtime.''

 &HT;    Is Copeland the answer at wide receiver?
 &HT;    By Tom D'Angelo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ If the Miami Dolphins' wide receivers showed as
much emotion during a recent game as they did in the locker room,
perhaps the blame for Miami's ineffective offense would have been
placed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. McDuffie cursed out the print media and refused questions.
The normally talkative Lamar Thomas didn't even look up while
rummaging through his locker. Only newcomer Horace Copeland faced
the onslaught of cameras and note pads. Of course, Copeland didn't
have to worry about being fingered as part of the problem. At least
not until he plays a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm, guys giving high fives, I didn't see a lot of
that,'' Copeland said of Miami's listless loss to the Jets on
Sunday. ``The emotion part is a big part of the game . . . yelling,
getting hyped up. If we can get that going (Monday at
Jacksonville), it will be a better outcome. We missed that.''
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasm. Sense of urgency. Aggressiveness. The catch words of
the week at Dolphins camp. Coach Jimmy Johnson and his coaches
insist the receivers have the talent and ability to make big plays.
Nevermind that they are ranked 29th in passing offense and as a
group have combined for 76 fewer yards and three fewer TDs than
Minnesota rookie Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   With Charles Jordan (groin) out, Copeland will get his chance
Monday. Copeland is 6-feet-3, 210 pounds and has impressed coaches
with his speed. But before he is anointed as the savior, like
Jordan and Lamar Thomas and Oronde Gadsden, Copeland is an NFL
reject, having been released by Tampa Bay in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could help us,'' Johnson said. ``The way the system is now
he should be ready to contribute this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The system has a crack when it comes to the passing game.
Television replays recently continually showed Jets defenders
step-for-step with Dolphins receivers. And Jets later questioned
whether the Dolphins had a clue about where to attack their
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But like Johnson, position coach Robert Ford is shrugging off
the poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not overmatched,'' Ford said. ``We were very cautious
in the way we attacked. It was just like we were afraid to go
dadgum to the end of the dadgum limb.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing could not have been worse with Moss, a player Miami
could have selected in the first round if it had not traded down,
showing he may be the next Jerry Rice on national TV recently. Moss
is exactly what Miami needs: a game-breaker who can stretch the
defense and find the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Now Copeland, who signed a two-year contract last week, will be
given a chance to make any kind of plays.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland's best season was as a rookie in 1993 when he had 30
receptions for 633 yards, four TDs and a 21.1 average. He missed
the entire 1996 season after suffering a knee injury in the
pre-season and came back to catch 33 passes for 431 yards last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the knee surgery, a high salary and his
inability to help on special teams led to the Buccaneers releasing
Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my performance and the way I was practicing wasn't the
reason (he was released),'' Copeland said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good camp. But I understand the business.''

 &HT;    State makes plea to prison gangs
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Vowing to place Texas at the forefront of
curbing prison gangs, state prison officials are developing new
programs to entice convicts to renounce their gang membership and
to reduce gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some elements of the new program, officials said, could parallel
those in a successful anti-gang program adopted four years ago in
Connecticut prisons, as well as programs that have worked in other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very real and very ominous problem,'' said Allan
Polunsky, chairman of the prison system's governing board, ``and we
are looking at whatever measures are appropriate to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Scott, executive director of the Texas Department of
Criminal Justice that runs the 143,500-convict prison system, said
officials began studying new anti-gang initiatives several weeks
ago and hope to have the new program in operation within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the developmental stage right now, starting from
scratch to look at what has worked in other states and what has
not,'' Scott said. ``Whatever we do will be a pilot program. If
it's successful, we will expand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prison officials said the anti-gang initiative, parts of
which were announced in Austin recently, will include plans to make
Texas a national clearinghouse for information about prison gangs
via police computers and intelligence files. Officials estimate
there are 5,000 confirmed gang members inside Texas prisons _ plus
thousands of others suspected of gang membership. Gang networks
have become an increasing security problem inside prisons and a
crime problem outside prisons.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-month investigation, the Austin American-Statesman
detailed the problems in a series published last weekend. The
investigation found that racism has made prison gangs grow faster
than the overall convict population, and that gangs are being
segregated from one another in an attempt to control them. The
gangs also have begun recruiting members of teen-age street gangs
to help them run criminal enterprises, including drug trafficking,
outside of prison.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said prison officials are researching anti-gang programs
in other states to develop Texas' new efforts, which Polunsky said
probably will include first-of-a-kind educational programs to get
gang members to renounce their membership.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a growing gang problem, Connecticut prisons implemented
similar programs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Luis Arizarry, an intelligence chief for Connecticut
Department of Corrections, said that once convicts are confirmed to
be gang members they are isolated from other convicts _ as they are
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in maximum-security prisons with other members of the
same gang, they are placed on regimented schedules and mandated to
attend classes that focus on anger management, cultural and ethnic
diversity, even sessions on why they should renounce their gang
membership.
</P>
<P>
   If convicts refuse to participate, Arizarry said, they are
placed in solitary-confinement cells where they cannot earn time
credits for good behavior and have limited access to visitors,
among other restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members who renounce their affiliation and successfully
complete the first part of the program are then moved to another
prison with fewer restrictions. But they must continue to toe the
line and not restart their gang activity, Arizarry said.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure, he said, ``we monitor everything they do.''
</P>
<P>
   The last part of the Connecticut program entails moving the
convicts into a prison where they are housed with members of rival
gangs. If they successfully complete that phase of the program, and
officials are assured they are out of the gang, they can then be
moved into a regular prison to complete the rest of their sentence,
Connecticut officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizarry said that, at present, about 900 of Connecticut's
16,000 convicts are gang members. In four years, only 32 of the 500
convicts who have gone through the gang-renunciation program have
re-affiliated, he said. ``If a program like this implemented
correctly, it will work,'' Arizarry said
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Texas officials want to develop a similar pattern of
success, even though Connecticut's program by itself ``does not
appear a good fit with our offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons, other officials said, are that Texas' prison gangs
have deeper and more criminal roots than the nine gangs in
Connecticut, and prisons there operate under different rules and
laws than those in Texas. For example, Connecticut conducts
hearings when it labels a convict a gang offender. Texas does not.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said Texas officials are looking to use parts from
it and successful anti-gang programs in other states to develop new
programs for Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The element of renunciation that Connecticut employs is what
we're after,'' Polunsky said. ``We're open to any and all ideas. We
want something that will work in Texas.''

 &HT;    Disinterest could mean trouble for Democrats, democracy
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In 1992, Ohio voters helped elevate Bill Clinton
to the presidency by going to the polls in the greatest numbers of
the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Clinton is mired in scandal, the public seems
more disinterested than ever in politics and some experts fear
turnout in the Nov. 3 election will mark an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   That could spell trouble for the Democratic Party and, some
believe, for the country's form of government as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing is a progressive meltdown in civic
engagement, a major danger to American democracy,'' said Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, a nonprofit public policy center located in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Gans' study shows voter turnout nationally has decreased 25
percent in the last 36 years, plunging to the the lowest levels in
mid-term history in the 1998 statewide primaries. Ohio and the
Miami Valley mirror those national trends.
</P>
<P>
   Low voter turnout may merely be a symptom of far deeper problems
_ beyond apathy, general satisfaction with the economy or simply
being fed up with l'affair Clinton-Lewinsky-Starr. There is
evidence of widespread loss of faith by people in their government
and other public institutions. The possibility of affecting change
will still draw people to the polls, but those opportunities seem
fewer and farther between.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that people voted because it was the responsible
thing to do,'' said Dennis Lieberman, chairman of the Montgomery
County Democratic Party. ``That is a day gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said that close-to-home issues, such as workers'
compensation, will still draw people to the polls. However, two
issues on the Nov. 3 ballot _ a 2.5-mill refunding renewal levy for
Sinclair Community College and the new Dayton City Charter changes
_ have backers worried that a low turnout could lead to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jeff Jacobson of Phillipsburg, chairman of the
Montgomery County Republican Party, said that low voter
participation can hurt both parties, but that the Democratic Party
has seen a loss of active voters nationally in some traditional
strongholds like New York. In this year's primaries, Democrats saw
voter turnout hit record lows in 20 states, according to Gans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have people too complacent to vote it can hurt
those leading the races as well,'' Jacobson said. ``They don't vote
because they think it is in the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1982, Democrats held a 2-1 ratio over Republicans
in both primaries and registration, Gans' report says. Now
Democrats are in the minority in Congress, governorships and many
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Gans notes, the decline in voter participation comes
at a time when there are fewer barriers to voting than at any time
in the nation's history. Women, who won the right to vote in 1920,
started voting in equal numbers as men in the 1980s, and
liberalized voting and registration laws led to the demise of the
whites-only political system that dominated the South for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should have produced higher turnout,'' Gans said. ``What
has eroded over the last three decades is the motivation to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The high point of public involvement in the political process
were the years 1860 to 1900, according to Walter Dean Burnham,
political science professor at the University of Texas. Lincoln won
the presidency in 1860 with 82 percent of eligible voters showing
up to vote. In the election year of 1898, 92 percent of eligible
voters in Ohio cast a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the story is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate found:
</P>
<P>
   Overall turnout of eligible voters fell 10 percent, from 19.4 in
1994 to 17.4 in the 1998 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The average Democratic turnout fell 12 percent, to a record low
of 9.5 percent of those eligible to vote. Average Republican
turnout was even lower, dropping from 8.7 percent in 1994 to 8
percent in 1998. Based on this average, a majority winner in these
primaries could have emerged the victor with less than 5 percent of
the eligible vote.
</P>
<P>
   Overall turnout in the May primary was down sharply in Ohio,
with both Republicans and Democrats losing voters. Overall turnout
was 24 percent in Montgomery County, 25 percent in Warren County
and 28 percent in Greene County.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of census data indicates that Americans over the age
of 65 are the only group increasing turnout. Turnouts declined for
both the 25-34 and the 35-44 age groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That portrays a pretty bleak future for the nation's
leadership,'' Gans said. ``Voting tends to be the lowest common
denominator in politics. People who don't vote don't participate in
anything else, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Low voter turnout also opens the door for relatively small
groups of people committed to a limited agenda to control the
process, Gans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a situation where an average of less than 5
percent of the electorate can determine the nominees and direction
of either major political party, you are inviting intense factions
to take over one or both parties and skew the public agenda,'' Gans
said.
</P>
<P>
   Common wisdom says that rainy days and low voter turnout favors
Republicans, but Montgomery County Democratic chairman Lieberman
thinks the current downward trend hurts both parties and the entire
electoral political process itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is definitely a problem,'' he said. ``In some elections,
just 17 percent of the people eligible have selected our leaders.
That is not representative of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans' study shows that the nation's poorest people _ those
making less than $15,000 _ are among the least frequent voters.
Gans and others believe that debunks the theory that satisfaction
with the economy can lead to voter apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor are completely disenfranchised, they are in a
survival mode,'' Lieberman said. ``We are trying to work on that
because those are our people, but it is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for voter apathy are hard to pinpoint, but a report by
the Kettering Foundation, Governing in America, offers some clues.
It was released in June of this year after the foundation conducted
a series of focus groups with citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``What became clear is that despite good economic times people
feel disconnected with our government institutions,'' said John
Doble, who runs a New Jersey research firm and helped prepare the
foundation report.
</P>
<P>
   Among the frustrations voiced were the increasing incivility of
the public debate and the growing influence of money and special
interests, Doble said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel they don't have a voice in the debate,'' he added.
``Citizens are the lifeblood of a democratic society. When people
feel alienated from its institutions, something is seriously
wrong.''

 &HT;    Reynolds works out payment agreement
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A judge approved Burt Reynolds' plan for
reorganization, and the actor will emerge from bankruptcy
protection in the next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased that this matter is behind me, and I'm now looking
forward to focusing on my work and enjoying time with my family and
friends,'' Reynolds, 62, said in a statement from his Los Angeles
publicist.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds declared more than $10 million in debts when he filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1996. Under the plan
approved recently by Judge Paul G. Hyman Jr. in West Palm Beach,
Reynolds will pay creditors 10 percent of his film income up to
$500,000 over the next two to three years. He would keep his $1.17
million Hobe Sound home but most likely lose his BR ranch in
Jupiter Farms.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds' show-business resurgence and prospects for increased
income, which followed his Oscar nomination for Boogie Nights,
helped push through the agreement, lawyers for both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it was believed that his career was on the
upswing again was a factor,'' said Bob Gilbert, a West Palm Beach
attorney for unsecured creditors _ those who aren't holding any
assets they can seize. Unsecured creditors are in line behind two
mortgage holders and the tax collector, who are owed about $3
million, Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, creditors will see less than 20 cents on the dollar,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has the right to match any sales offer on his $4.6
million, 160-acre ranch and tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.3 million second mortgage on the ranch was in the name of
actress Loni Anderson. In the settlement, $300,000 of that debt is
moved to Reynolds' Hobe Sound home.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Reynolds divorced in 1994. Reynolds will continue
$10,000-a-month child support payments for son Quinton, now 10.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, Reynolds paid creditors $308,000 for personal
effects in the home and ranch. CBS received rights to syndication
of the ``Evening Shade'' television series. And properties Reynolds
owns in Hawaii and Utah will be sold to help pay creditors.

 &HT;    Ultima Online's success better than expected
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Which is more perilous _ navigating the swamp in
the computerized, fictional sword-and-sorcery world of Britannia or
answering questions from a roomful of business journalists about
your company, which creates that sword-and-sorcery world?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Garriott, co-founder of Austin's Origin Systems, seemed
equally at ease in both roles as he addressed a Society of American
Business Editors and Writers conference at the Renaissance Hotel in
Austin, recently.
</P>
<P>
   While Origin Systems' Ultima Online game, based on the fantasy
world of Britannia, may be treacherous, it's also more successful
than the company expected, Garriott said.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few online games, if not the only one, making
money from game sales as well as monthly subscriptions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The game has 90,000 users who hunt and fish, fight monsters,
talk to each other and train virtual pets to guard their virtual
homes when they leave Britannia to crawl into their real beds to
dream virtual dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists reacted with audible suprise when Garriott told them
the average time an Ultima online user spends with the game is 3
1/2 hours a day. An earlier speaker said that Web surfers stay at
even the most popular Web sites for less than 10 minutes a day on
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are playing way longer than we anticipated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garriott _ tall, sandy-haired, dressed in jeans and an Austin
essential blue workshirt bearing an Origin logo _ is considered a
legend and old-timer in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, Garriott has been the creator and guiding force of
Ultima, a series of games that go back to the early days of Apple's
first computers. After selling Origin to Electronic Arts Inc., a
public company based in San Mateo, Calif., Garriott became more
involved in business strategy than in developing games. With Ultima
Online and the Wing Commander series, Garriott thinks more about
distribution methods, brand management, cultivating and keeping a
strong team _ in short, the boring business stuff that's far from
the virtual world of Britannia.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't mind working for a big company _ with the
complexity of games (for one game: the average cost, $10 million;
time, two to five years; staff, up to 50 workers), he says it's
necessary to be sizable.
</P>
<P>
   That's changed from the days when he made $150,000 for a few
weeks' work after his first game was published in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He likens the current state of the game industry to Hollywood's
film eras _ experimentation, the rise of a studio system and the
breakout of the independents. Successful games, he said, make more
money than most movies.
</P>
<P>
   And it may go further: ``My goal is to create the first
completely virtual (reality) world,'' he said.

 &HT;    Hazardous waste site draws controversy
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A delegation of Mexican officials urged the Bush
administration and state lawmakers recently to block a proposed
disposal site for low-level radioactive waste.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the delegation said the state's plan to bury waste in
the desert near the West Texas town of Sierra Blanca threatens to
pollute water supplies, sour bilateral relations and reverse
economic progress in the region.
</P>
<P>
   They also criticized Gov. George W. Bush for not meeting with
them and other opponents of the site, and for repeated assertions
that his support for the project hinges on whether it is shown to
be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel first of all there was a political decision, that
politics decided where this site would be,'' said Jeffrey Jones, a
member of the Mexican Congress from the state of Chihuahua. ``Now
that the site is chosen, they want to shift everything to
scientific facts. This type of project seems to fly in the face of
the intent of what the free trade agreement is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement
between Mexico, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was among a dozen local, state and federal elected
officials from Mexico who met with Secretary of State Al Gonzales
and then held a news conference at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission is scheduled
to consider on Oct. 22 whether to grant a license for construction
and operation of the site, which would receive waste from nuclear
power plants, medical centers, universities and other sources. The
500-acre site in Hudspeth County is about 18 miles from the Rio
Grande, a major water source and a dividing line between the United
States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was unable to meet with the Mexican delegation because of a
scheduling conflict, said Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the
governor. Gonzales is his representative on the issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has met with site opponents, including elected
officials from Mexico, on several occasions, Edwards said. For
example, Bush met with the governor of Chihuahua and the mayor of
El Paso three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is confident the commissioners of the TNRCC will
judge the safety of the site based on sound science,'' Edwards
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two state administrative law judges have recommended that the
license be denied. The judges said the Texas Low-Level Radioactive
Waste Disposal Authority, which would own and operate the site, had
failed to provide sufficient evidence concerning its geologic
suitability and on socioeconomic matters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a thorny one for Bush, who has sought to cultivate
warm relations with Mexico as well as political support among
Texas' growing Hispanic population, which is mostly Democratic.
Guadalupe Rodriguez Martinez, a member of Nuevo Leon's state
legislature, said Texas' choice of a site in a low-income Hispanic
community with little political clout ``constitutes an act of
environmental racism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We call for the immediate consideration of the relocation of
this site,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Congress has unanimously adopted a resolution
opposing the site. But three executive-branch agencies _ foreign
relations, energy and environment _ recently issued a communique
declaring that the disposal site meets Mexican and international
standards and ``does not represent a risk for the Mexican
population and environment as long as its construction, operation
and sealing are carried out as outlined in the documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas state Rep. Norma Chavez, an El Paso Democrat who is
secretary of the 35-member Mexican American legislative caucus,
said she would introduce a measure next year to reject the site if
the conservation commission issues a license.

 &HT;    Whole Foods president resigns
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Peter Roy, who has been instrumental in building
Whole Foods Market Inc. into the nation's largest chain of natural
foods supermarkets, has resigned as president of the Austin-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   Roy said his decision to step down was motivated by a desire to
take a break from the day-to-day stress of running a billion-dollar
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally a personal choice,'' the 42-year-old executive
said from his corner office atop the Whole Foods store at West
Sixth Street and North Lamar Boulevard. ``I'm very interested in
restoring balance in my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity to repot my plant,'' said Roy, who will
join the company's nine-member board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hitt, president of Whole Foods' Mid-Atlantic region, will
succeed Roy. Hitt came to Whole Foods in 1985 from the American
Farm Foundation and has led five of the company's regions. He has
been a key player in the company's mergers with Wellspring Grocery,
Bread &AMP; Circus and Fresh Fields Markets.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Fred ``Chico'' Lager called Hitt the company's
``Sir Lancelot'' _ the person they have turned to whenever they
made an acquisition or faced a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't anybody in the company who doesn't admire and
respect him,'' Lager said. On Wall Street, news of Roy's
resignation helped push the company's stock down $3.50 to close at
$36.50 _ an 8.8 percent drop. ``He's the $80-million man,'' said
Matt Patsky, managing director of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill, a Boston
investment bank, adding that the company's market capitalization
declined by more than $80 million with the stock drop.
</P>
<P>
   When Roy became president of the company five years ago, Whole
Foods had 30 stores. Today it has 87 stores in 19 states and the
District of Columbia. Over the past decade, the company's stores
have more than doubled in size, offering a wider range of products.
</P>
<P>
   Roy said he is proud that he has been able to help the natural
foods industry improve its image on Wall Street, which once
regarded it as a fad run by unsophisticated hippies. ``Whole Foods
would not be the company it is today without Peter Roy's leadership
and contributions,'' said John Mackey, Whole Foods chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is dramatically different than it was when the
17-year-old Roy got a job bagging groceries at a small New Orleans
health food store called the Whole Food Co. in 1975. In 1988, Whole
Food Co. merged with Whole Foods Market and Roy headed the new
California region of Whole Foods. In 1993, he became president of
the company and moved to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a wild ride,'' said Roy, who said he has flown more
than 150,000 miles a year on American Airlines alone, visiting
stores, meeting with analysts and performing the other duties of
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Roy said he and his wife, Gillian, who celebrated their 20th
anniversary this year, have bought land in Pawley's Island, S.C.
and are building a house.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has no immediate plans to find another job when he
quits Jan. 1. He said he may serve on a few company boards and do
some teaching and consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Carolina has yet to get a Whole Foods, Roy said
he plans to buy his natural foods on Wholefoods.com, an online
shopping service that will be launched in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be lobbying for a store in Charleston,'' he said.

REDMOND SAYS HE'LL BE BACK IN '99  
 INSISTS HE WON'T LEAVE ASU FOR NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Versatile tailback J.R. Redmond said Thursday
that he's ready to take on another role: college senior.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State standout dismissed speculation that he will
leave school after his junior season to make himself eligible for
the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' Redmond said. `I'll be here. I'm
just now starting to get a handle on football as far as learning
the game. And I'm just starting to get a handle on my schoolwork,
too. I need another year to get better at both.''
</P>
<P>
   If Redmond returns, it also might give ASU an opportunity to
restart his Heisman Trophy campaign. He was considered a legitimate
candidate before the season, but a slow start by him and the Sun
Devils have diminished his chances.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond has rushed for 556 yards and six touchdowns. After
totaling 136 yards and one touchdown in the Sun Devils' first two
games, he has had 419 yards and five in the past three.
</P>
<P>
   He had the best game of his career Saturday against Southern
California at the Los Angeles Coliseum, when he accumulated an ASU
record 350 all-purpose yards and a career-high 214 rushing yards.
He became the 12th man in ASU history to rush for 200 yards in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's rushing average of 111 yards per game ranks second in
the Pac-10. His 207 all-purpose yards per game rank first in the
conference and fifth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He also plays safety, although he has played little on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still consider myself a defensive back first who's learning
how to play running back,'' he said recently. ``I think I have room
to become a better tailback. I'm really trying to be a student of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most speculated that the lure of NFL money would prompt Redmond
to leave early. But the senior said completing his education is a
priority. He is majoring in English. &QL;

CHANGES HAP PEN AS COYOTES SHAKE UP ROSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - The opening day of Coyotes' training camp
this fall looked more like a White House reception line than a
hockey practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Greg Adams.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, nice to see you. I'm Keith Carney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, I'm Jyrki Lumme. I'm looking forward to playing with
you this season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, thanks. By the way, I'm Louie DeBrusk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's up, man? My name's Jim Cummins. They call me Kong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey there, Kong. I'm Mike Sullivan. The pleasure's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   After that initial workout, right wing Dallas Drake remembers
walking over to his locker and looking around the room. Players
were still greeting each other, shaking hands and getting to know
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I know half these guys,'' Drake said at the
time. ``I knew there were going to be a lot of changes this year,
but I had no idea we were going to see so many news faces. There's
a ton of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 38 players who appeared in at least one game last season
for Phoenix, 14 are gone. In their place are 13 new players who
weren't with the club when it opened the season a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   No other team in the NHL made as many roster changes as the
Coyotes did in the offseason. It was by design, according to
General Manager Bobby Smith, who had his hands full with just
trying to re-sign a herd of his own free agents, let alone scanning
all of pro hockey to find a bunch of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we significantly improved our team in the past year,''
Smith said. ``It wasn't easy, but I'm convinced the team we put on
the ice for opening night, 1998, will be far better than the one we
had on opening night, 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell, but do all the changes guarantee the Coyotes of
advancing beyond the first round of the playoffs for only the third
time in the fracnhise's 20-year history?
</P>
<P>
   Captain Keith Tkachuk, who ended what could have become a
season-long holdout by agreeing to a restructured contract two
weeks into camp, seems convinced this is the group that can finally
get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really addressed some key areas and I think this will be
the strongest team we've put on the ice in years,'' said Tkachuk,
whose 205 goals are the third-most among any NHLer in the past five
seasons. ``The important thing is to go out, get a good start, get
some wins, and hopefully, when it comes down to the stretch drive,
we'll have the players to get us to that next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows for sure? But I'm really happy with this team. I
love this team. We've got some balanced scoring now, a solid D, and
a great goaltender. Now we've just got to put it together.''
</P>
<P>
   It starts Sunday, when the new-look Coyotes open their third
season in the Valley against the Ottawa Senators at America West
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Just getting Tkachuk back into the fold was a change many
players weren't exactly counting on. Had Smith not decided to make
one last contract pitch to the power forward midway through camp,
the chances were very real the Coyotes wouldn't have their leading
scorer from each of the past three seasons around anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   But he's back, and the left wing brings with him 40 to 50 goals
the team can count on. It more than balances out the 45 goals
Phoenix lost by purging the 14 players from last season.
</P>
<P>
   The main substractions were Tkachuk's personal play-making
center, Craig Janney, 700-goal scorer Mike Gartner, defenseman
Murray Baron, enforcer Jim McKenzie, left wing Darrin Shannon, and
center prospect Chad Kilger, who was dealt to Chicago in March for
defenseman Keith Carney and right wing Jim Cummins.
</P>
<P>
   The additions of Carney and Cummins were only the beginning.
Smith landed perhaps the best defenseman on the free-agent market
in July by signing Vancouver's Jyrki Lumme to a four-year deal. He
will start the season on the No. 1 defensive unit with fellow Finn
Teppo Numminen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a solid, two-way defenseman,'' Numminen said of Lumme, a
10-year pro who plays power play, kills penalties and four times
has reached the 40-point mark. ``He does everything well.''
</P>
<P>
   With Numminen and Lumme, Oleg Tverdovsky and Carney, and Gerald
Diduck and players such as Deron Quint, Michel Petit and Sean
Gagnon, the Coyotes' defense is as strong as it ever has been,
according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like our defense, too,'' said Diduck, a 14-year
veteran. ``It's definitely an improvement over last year. Oley and
Q are younger and better. Carney really came on last year. We've
got lots of guys who can move the pu ck and know the game and where
to be in your own end. We work well with the sys tem, work well
with the forwards, and we're getting a raport going with Niki
(Khabibulin) in net, where we're using each other as three guys in
that zone and we can shut a lot of things down.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a knock on the blueline, it's that the defense may
lack some size and toughness. Diduck, though disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teppo's not a punishing checker, but he throws hits,'' Diduck
said. ``Carns hits guys. So does Jyrki. ... Look, the game has
changed now. You can be a punishing checker, but the way they've
changed the rules around, if you're missing your hits, you can't
get that extra grab on a guy. So it's a higher risk play now to be
an aggressive, body-checking defenseman. You've got more
opportunities for things to go wrong now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was starting out, you could chase guys around all day
and battle guys without the puck all over the place. They're
getting away from that. What you want now are guys who can move,
know where to be on the ice, and be their ahead of time. If you
look at our defense, I think that's exactly what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also finally have some goal-scoring depth at left
wing behind Tkachuk. Smith solved that problem by signing Greg
Adams of Dallas as a free agent. The former standout at Northern
Arizona University, Adams, 35, is capable of a 25-goal season by
skating with the likes of Jeremy Roenick or Cliff Ronning. He's had
injury problems the past few seasons, but Adams has looked great in
the preseason and he has been healthy so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what they've been able to add this year, there should be
no more excuses,'' Tkachuk said. ``There should never be any
excuses for any team,'' Drake said. ``You do your best, you play
hard, and you should win a lot of hockey games. That doesn't just
go for us, but for every team in he NHL. We're no exception. But
yeah, definitely, there are no more excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are, there could be even more changes next year. &QL;

CHANGES: COYOTES WELCOME NEW RIVALS IN NEW DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - For a guy who isn't particularly excited
about flying in airplanes to begin with, Coyotes defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky took about one nanosecond to explain what he likes most
about playing in a new division this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Less travel, a lot less travel,'' the fifth-year pro from
Moscow said. ``Those long, three- to five-hour flights are going to
be almost cut in half, and that's the best part of it, no question
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the NHL's realignment for this season, the Coyotes
moved out of the Central Division, where they were paired with
Toronto, Detroit, Chicago and St. Louis, and joined Dallas by
transferring to the Pacific Division with its three
California-based teams, Los Angeles, Anaheim and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 45-minute flight to a place like Anaheim or LA,'' Tverdovsky
said, ``beats a 3{-hour flight to Detroit or Chicago in a
heartbeat. . . . I couldn't stand those long, long trips all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes still will make the occasional jaunt to the Midwest
and East Coast, but instead of playing teams such as the Red Wings
and the Maple Leafs at least three times away from home, that will
usually happen only once. In some circumstances, they won't even
travel to certain Eastern Conference cities.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Phoenix plays the Carolina Hurricanes only once
this season _ and it's at America West Arena. Next year, Pittsburgh
could be left off the road list. Or maybe Washington or Boston or
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific, the Coyotes will play divisional foes six times
apiece. That accounts for 24 games out of the 82-game schedule _
and probably tens of thousands of reduced miles aboard a cramped
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really going to be the most beneficial thing for us,''
Coach Jim Schoenfeld said. ``We had very tough travel last year.
And it really wears on you after a while. It affects you in a lot
of ways, and it alters your routine. Among other things, you don't
always get good practices on the road because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the change was announced before last season, it was widely
thought the Coyotes would be putting themselves in a much greater
position to challenge for a division championship by moving into
the Pacific. Sure, Dallas was seen as a visible threat, but Los
Angeles, San Jose and Anaheim weren't exactly viewed as Stanley
Cup-contending material.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be better than slugging it out against Central rivals
such as Chicago, St. Louis and Detroit _ the pure essence of what
used to be the old black-and-blue Norris Division.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld, though, doesn't buy into that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any given night, you can get beat (in the Pacific), so you
have to be at your best,'' he said. ``I don't think we're any
better or worse off that way. With players changing teams as
rapidly as they do and coaches changing teams as rapidly as they
do, it's hard to identify a division as the skating division or the
black-and-blue division anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at one year, when the high-flying Pittsburgh Penguins
became a great defensive team with great goaltending and a
different coaching staff. It happens all the time now. I think you
have to be careful when you start labeling one division as this and
another division as that because it's always changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes aren't the only team moving to a new division. The
NHL abandoned its two-division format in each conference and went
to a three-division lineup, creating a Southeast Division in the
East and a Northwest Division in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, Florida in Tampa Bay are leaving the Atlantic
Division for the Southeast, where they will be joined by Carolina,
which leaves the Northeast. Pittsburgh also leaves the Northeast to
join Philadelphia, New Jersey and the Rangers and Islanders in the
Atlantic. Toronto, meanwhile, has switched conferences altogether,
leaving the Central for the Northeast to join Boston, Buffalo,
Montreal and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver and
Colorado leave the Pacific to form the Northwest Division. And
joining Chicago, Detroit and St. Louis in the Central is the
expansion Nashville Predators, the first of four expansion clubs
that will be unveiled by 2000-2001.

play.'' &QL;

DEATH IS IN NEW ENGLAND FOR ITS ANNUAL SPECTACULAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNDON, Vt. _ On the other side of the meadow that slants away
from the house in which I'm staying, the hillside is well into its
annual biodance with death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When sunlight drills through the big, low-flying clouds, which
are sliding to the northeast on a chilly, haphazard wind, it flames
the trees to shining oranges and polished coppers, and there's no
question now that death is ascending these fetching hills. There's
no escape from death's insistent presence, though evergreens
scattered among the maples, oaks, aspens and birches will put on a
brave show and stand as sacraments of hope that all is not lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vermont _ and much of New England _ celebrates death in October,
though, of course, no one calls it that. The summer-green hills
give way, subtly at first, to the cycles of change that require
trees to survive by cutting off the energy of life to their leaves.
When the process reaches critical mass, a kind of spontaneous
combustion flashes over the countryside and stuns both natives and
travelers with colors no one has ever quite reproduced
artificially. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This astonishing display draws tourists who, as author Kurt
Vonnegut once wrote in another context, come rushing in with the
brainless ecstasy of volunteer firemen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, today as I drove along Route 2 from the lovely
gold-domed capitol building in Montpelier toward St. Johnsbury and
neighboring Lyndon here in the Northeast Kingdom, I saw several
people along the roadside taking pictures of scenes that have been
photographed millions of times in the last 50 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but that's not quite true. No autumn perfectly reproduces
any other autumn, so whatever people capture on their 35 mm cameras
or video cameras has, in fact, never been seen before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whole busloads of foliage tourists even now are moving along
Vermont's colorful highways just to see the spectacular show death
is putting on here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As I was stopped across the street from the State Capitol this
morning, I watched two tour buses pull up and disgorge dozens of
folks with cameras at the ready. They spread out on the capitol
lawn and snapped away, hoping to show the apple-crisp gold of the
dome against the turning hillside behind it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, before foliage season ends, Vermont expects six million
``leaf peepers,'' as some of the locals call them, to come and
spend $500 million in the state. The season has become such a draw
that it has even attracted academics to study the phenomenon. Kit
Anderson, a cultural geographer at the University of Vermont,
earlier this year presented a paper on the subject at the American
Association of Geographers' annual meeting in Boston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She says people come looking not just for beauty but for
stability, security and harmony. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press recently produced a long feature article
about fall foliage and quoted Brian Barry, an associate professor
of psychology and sociology at Rochester (N.Y.) Institute of
Technology, who seemed to understand that tours to see colorful
leaves have something to do with death. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My own sense,'' he said, ``is that as people age they get more
aware or more sensitized to life having cycles.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they enter the autumn and winter of their own lives, he said,
they come to Vermont to let nature remind them how to cope with
final things. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe. But my guess is that most people come here in the
fall simply because they are drawn by beauty. They rarely imagine
how impossible this beauty would be were it not for an annual cycle
of death _ nor do they think much about what this means about their
own deaths, probably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But death is what's really going on here. And it's a reminder to
all of us that when we are brave enough to look even death in the
eye, we can see a beauty we are likely to miss if we avoid the
subject. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Death minuets its way across Vermont's chameleonic hills, and if
we understand what we are seeing we can lose ourselves in the grim
spectacle because we know about the greening gift of spring. And,
at least so far, spring has always come. &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ How do governments negotiate when they don't recognize
each other?
</P>
<P>
   Two honored octogenarians, both heads of ``unofficial''
organizations and both long-time confidants of their respective
leaders, are tasked with resuming the talks that may determine
whether China and Taiwan live peacefully or go to war.
</P>
<P>
   Here are their backgrounds:
</P>
<P>
   KOO CHEN-FU
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's lead negotiator is a savvy businessman from a native
family of the island's landed gentry. The Koos struck it very rich
after Chiang Kai-shek's government traded shares of Taiwan Cement
for much of their land in a so-called ``land-to-the-tiller''
program in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   The family enterprise grew into a 60-company conglomerate
including China Trust Commercial Bank, Taiwan's largest
privately-owned financial institution, and China Life Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Koo, 82, not only was a founder of the Taiwan Stock Exchange,
but also brought plastic to Taiwan: the credit card. He will not
likely endorse any agreement that might endanger Taiwan's deeply
embedded capitalist _ and more recently democratic _ system.
</P>
<P>
   Educated in law at National Taiwan University, Koo became a
political mover and shaker as president of an influential
industrial association. He has been an adviser to Taiwan's
president for a decade and a member of the Kuomintang's central
standing committee. He presides over Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The industrialist lately returned to an early love: the Chinese
opera he studied in the 1950s. Koo resumed practice and performed
in full face make-up in one of the Beijing Opera productions his
family sponsors in Taiwan twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   WANG DAOHAN
</P>
<P>
   Wang is not so wealthy as his counterpart but is rich in the
experience of cutting through thickets of communist politics and
bureaucracy. A fixture since the communists took over China in
1949, he served first as minister of the East China Industry
Department and then for 13 years as deputy head of the First
Ministry of Machine Building. Later positions mostly related to
foreign finance, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ministry of Machine Building in 1956 he encountered a
younger man whose path he would cross repeatedly. He was Jiang
Zemin, today the president of China, then just returned from
studies in Moscow. One affinity between Wang and Jiang: both sprang
from the engineering school of Shanghai's Jiao Tong University.
</P>
<P>
   Appointed mayor of Shanghai in 1980, Wang brought the city out
of isolation back to its old position as China's center of world
trade and finance. He spearheaded the Pudong project that created
an international industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
   He was followed in the job in 1985 by Jiang. Although Wang
assumed a lower profile after leaving the mayor's office, he is
said to have been a mentor to Jiang and to have remained a close
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Wang, 83, has represented Shanghai at the Chinese People's
Congress and taught at the country's most prestigious universities:
Beijing, Fudan and Jiao Tong. He is president of China's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Like Koo, he is a fan of Chinese opera but also a book-lover who
was known to wander alone through book stores of Shanghai when he
was mayor.

 &HT;    MAINLAND CHINA AND TAIWAN GINGERLY RESTART TALKS ON SETTLING
CONFLICT
 &HT;    With CHINA-BIOBOX-$ADV11.

<P>
   BEIJING _ Mighty China and fortress Taiwan once again have
tucked away their guns and this week will make another tenuous
sortie into the realm of peacefully settling half a century of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions still are huge between the communist mainland and the
island that broke away after civil war 49 years ago, ultimately to
evolve into a raucous little democracy 100 miles off China's
southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   The delicately choreographed talks that begin Wednesday are not
even formal negotiations. They will not be conducted by government
officials and so far don't seem to have much of an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But when Koo Chen-fu, head of the Straits Exchange Foundation,
comes over to meet his Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan, president
of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, the two
octogenarians will have the futures of their people on the table.
These are the highest level talks since the same two men held
break-through discussions in Singapore in 1993, then saw
missile-rattling disrupt the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important in the sense that the Wang-Koo meeting implies
that the two sides `normalize' their relations,'' said Zheng
Yongnian, a fellow at the East Asian Institute in Singapore who
follows cross-strait relations.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have stepped gingerly in recent weeks in order to do
exactly that: pave the way for more normal and continuing contacts
after Koo's six-day visit that is scheduled to include an Oct. 18
meeting with China's President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's military, for example, canceled exercises set for this
week in order ``to cultivate harmony and positive progress in
cross-strait relations,'' according to news reports from Taiwan.
Taiwan's troops would have employed their most sophisticated
weapons, including American F-16 fighter planes and Knox-class
frigates, the sales of which so raised the ire of Beijing's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   On the Chinese side, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan recently
promised Taiwan ``will enjoy greater autonomy than Hong Kong and
Macao'' if it reunites with the mainland. The former British colony
of Hong Kong became part of China in 1997, and Macao is due to end
four centuries as a Portuguese territory when it rejoins China next
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese government spokesman later explained that Taiwan would
maintain its own armed forces and get guaranteed positions in the
mainland government. Hong Kong and Macao were offered neither but
do hold guarantees to keep personal rights and freedoms, as well as
their capitalist economies under the ``one China, two systems''
formula.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports of other possible concessions by the
mainland, such as replacing the red communist flag and changing the
country's name to ``China'' from the current People's Republic of
China, which was created when the communists took command 49 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 China-Taiwan talks were likewise promising, but the
dialogue didn't last. Beijing canceled a major follow-up
negotiation in mid-1995 in response to Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui's ``unofficial'' trip to the United States. It was viewed
as promoting Taiwan's independence.
</P>
<P>
   Relations deteriorated. When China for a second time fired
unarmed missiles near Taiwan in March 1996, the United States sent
an aircraft carrier battle group to the South China Sea to warn
China to sheath its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two years of fence-mending finally produced this new set of
talks, but the path to resolution is hardly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Today many Taiwanese are edging toward a declaration of full
independence. Potentially, that could provoke an armed response
from the mainland state that the United States recognizes as the
sole legitimate Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   To remind his mainland counterparts that radical sentiment is
gaining strength among the island's 22 million people, negotiator
Koo reportedly has included in his delegation several Taiwanese of
the political faction backing independence.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang party, which founded the Taiwan
government when it fled losing battles against the communists in
1949, has been more amenable to some form of reunion that would
preserve Taiwan's autonomy without status as an independent state.
But even in the Kuomintang, voices rarely can be heard accepting
the mainland's formula applied to Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Taiwan has not even publicly accepted Beijing's demands
that the talks immediately home in on the tough political questions
of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese leaders keep promoting discussion of less momentous
economic and cultural issues first, to facilitate the already heavy
exchanges of people and capital across the strait. For instance,
Taiwan wants an understanding on how to treat Chinese or Taiwanese
refugees who reach the others' territory.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't much interest the mainland side. President Jiang
has consolidated his hold on power on the mainland and is under
pressure by some communist party elements to flex his strength and
finally bring the island back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to do something regarding the Taiwan issue,'' said
Zheng of the East Asia Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's position was enhanced this summer, when President Bill
Clinton for the first time enunciated what Chinese call the ``three
no's,'' committing America not to recognize ``two Chinas'' or ``one
China, one Taiwan;'' not to support Taiwan seeking independence,
and not to endorse Taiwan's membership in international
organizations whose members must be sovereign states.

   ``AMBASSADOR ANN-MARGRET.'' From W magazine. One color slide. In
``Life of the Party,'' a dishy movie premiering Oct. 12 on
Lifetime, legendary actress Ann-Margret plays the late Pamela
Harriman, the U.S. ambassador to France who became notorious for
her affairs with wealthy married men. Although Ann-Margret was the
first choice of producer Francine LeFrak for the role and looks
uncannily like Harriman in the movie, it's difficult to think of
two women less alike than the courtesan-cum-diplomat and the
actress. An interview from W magazine.

   ``AMBASSADOR ANN-MARGRET.'' From W magazine. One color slide. In
``Life of the Party,'' a dishy movie premiering Oct. 12 on
Lifetime, legendary actress Ann-Margret plays the late Pamela
Harriman, the U.S. ambassador to France who became notorious for
her affairs with wealthy married men. Although Ann-Margret was the
first choice of producer Francine LeFrak for the role and looks
uncannily like Harriman in the movie, it's difficult to think of
two women less alike than the courtesan-cum-diplomat and the
actress. An interview from W magazine.

   &UR; By JOHN TAGLIABUE &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian cities, like Naples or Palermo, have a hard time
being sedate. Ask them to spin a pirouette or dance a tarantella,
and they're in their element.
</P>
<P>
   But Milan is not a tarantella _ it's a slow tango, a cool,
understated place with a measured step, where excitement can mean
strolling to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, the glassed-in
Beaux-Arts shopping concourse adjacent to the Duomo, to down a
cappuccino or just to see and be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But Milan tangos a little faster in the fall, when the big trade
fairs come to town, most notably the fall fashion showings.
</P>
<P>
   The spring and fall fashion weeks were certainly the busiest
time of the year in Milan, with tens of thousands of anxious
designers, willowy models, buyers, photographers and just plain
hangers-on descending on the city.
</P>
<P>
   But in this heady season, there are plenty of other diversions
besides fashion. Milan is a spread-out city, and the best way to
get an overview is on one of the many bus tours or guided walks
offered throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rome or Naples, where sunshine reigns much of the time,
Milan can be damp and gray. So it is also an indoor city, whether
that means lounging in one of the Galleria's cafes or visiting
Leonardo's ``Last Supper'' in the former refectory of the convent
of Santa Maria delle Grazie, or Michelangelo's tender Rondanini
Pieta at the Museum of the Castello Sforzesco.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather is nice, you might start by climbing to the roof
of the vast Gothic Duomo, a sierra of finials and statues that you
can hike across like an Alpine meadow, and which affords a close
look at the Madonnina, the golden statue of the Virgin atop the
central tower, and spectacular views of the city; on clear days the
vistas stretch northward to the Alps.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, the place not to miss is the Ambrosiana Art Gallery
and Library, 2 Piazza Pio XI, (39-02) 806921, which reopened last
year after a seven-year restoration. The library, commissioned by
Federico Cardinal Borromeo in 1607, contains 35,000 manuscripts and
700,000 printed books.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal's personal art collection forms the core of the
gallery, Milan's oldest museum. His good taste allows us to enjoy
Raphael's cartoon for the School of Athens in the Vatican;
Caravaggio's ``Basket of Fruit''; paintings by Leonardo, Botticelli
and Titian; and one of the world's finest collections of Lombard
art. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission $7,
calculated at 1,724 lire to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To explore the heart of Milan, start at the Duomo and walk
through the Galleria to La Scala, then up Via Dante to the Castello
Sforzesco, and the spacious gardens behind. To visit the fashion
district, start at the Piazza San Babila, then stroll narrow Via
Monte Napoleone and nearby Via Spiga, lined with the flagship
stores of many of Italy's leading designers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1920s tourist tram leaves the Piazza Castello at 11 a.m. and 1
p.m. daily (also 3 p.m. in September and October). From there, it
passes the Duomo, goes out to the gradually gentrifying Navigli
neighborhood of canals and narrow lanes _ where some of Milan's
liveliest night life can be found. It then goes on to Santa Maria
delle Grazie, and back by the fashion district and La Scala.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigli neighborhood borders two canals in the southwest
corner of Milan. Once the port of Milan (the canals connected the
city to the Po River) and a tough working-class district, it has
become a trendy neighborhood, filled with antiques shops, bars and
restaurants (some on barges). Tickets, for sale on the tram,
(39-02) 72002584, are $17.50.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the Milan Tourist Office, 1 Via Marconi,
(39-02) 72524300, organizes two-hour walking tours of the Duomo,
the Victor Emmanuel gallery, the Marino Palace courtyard (now city
hall) and La Scala for $11.50. You can call ahead to reserve an
English-speaking guide.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's most important art collection, the Brera, 28 Via Brera,
(39-02) 722631, includes such masterpieces as Raphael's ``Marriage
of the Virgin,'' Piero della Francesca's ``Sacra Conversazione''
and Caravaggio's ``Supper at Emmaus.'' Open Tuesday to Saturday 9
a.m. to 9:45 p.m.; Sunday and holidays 9 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and
2:30 to 7:45 p.m. Tickets $4.65.
</P>
<P>
   One of Milan's best-kept secrets is the 15th-century Church of
Santa Maria presso San Satiro. The downtown church was built by
Bramante next to a ninth-century basilica. Of particular note is
the baptistry _ marvelous in its Renaissance harmony _ and the
trompe l'oeil apse, designed that way by Bramante because he had no
more room.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No musical event in Italy commands as much attention _ and
reverence _ as the opening of the opera season at La Scala, which
traditionally takes place Dec. 7, the feast of St. Ambrose, Milan's
patron saint. Yet the preseason offerings at La Scala are also
impressive, with ballets, operas, symphonies and chamber music most
nights during the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet corps closes its summer season with Kenneth
MacMillan's ``L'Histoire de Manon,'' which will be performed on
Oct. 1 to 3, 6 and 7, with Alessandra Ferri, La Scala's prima
ballerina. Tickets are $14.50 to $52.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 opera season closes with Donizetti's ``Elisir
d'Amore,'' with Mariella Devia, Vincenzo La Scola and Paul Groves.
Performances on Oct. 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 31 and Nov. 6
and 8. La Scala's box office is at 2 Via Filodrammatici; (39-02)
860775. Tickets $17.50 to $156.50.
</P>
<P>
   The La Scala museum, with historical costumes and other
memorabilia, (39-02) 8053418, is open 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to
5:30 p.m. Monday to Sunday (closed Sundays after Oct. 31). Tickets
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   La Scala overshadows other musical pleasures in Milan _ a shame,
for there are gems to be found. The Orchestra Verdi dazzles with a
varied repertory at the Lirico Theater, 14 Via Larga, (39-02)
809665. Concerts are on Thursday and Friday at 8:30 p.m. and Sunday
at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance and a rock opera start the season at the Teatro
Smeraldo, Piazza 25 Aprile, (39-02) 29006767. ``Elastesse,'' a
ballet choreographed by David Parsons, Moses Pendleton and Daniel
Ezralow, Oct. 6 to 11 (tickets $17.50 to $23), is followed by the
Who's ``Tommy'' Oct. 13 to 25 (tickets $17.50 to $29).
</P>
<P>
   An extensive Man Ray retrospective at the Fondazione Mazzotta
runs through Jan. 24, at 50 Foro Bonaparte, (39-02) 878197. Open
Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (10:30 p.m. Tuesday and
Thursday). $7.

(39-02) 8052157, is an upscale 49-room hotel just behind the lovely
medieval basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. Rooms have modern furnishings,
usually with an antique or two. Doubles with breakfast start at
$225.
</P>
<P>
   For the business traveler, the 128-room Brunelleschi, 12 Via
Baracchini, (39-02) 8843, fax (39-02) 804924, is centrally situated
and comfortable, with simple, contemporary furnishings. Doubles
with breakfast are $260.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotel Liberty, 56 Viale Bligny, (39-02) 58318562, fax
(39-02) 58319061, blends comfort and charm with reasonable prices.
All 58 rooms are done up in Art Deco style. Doubles with breakfast
are $136, $157 and $203, depending on the season, excluding
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: The no-frill Hotel Sempione, 11 Via Finocchiaro Aprile,
(39-02) 6570323, fax (39-02) 6575379, is near the Piazza della
Repubblica. Double rates in the 43 rooms range from $81 in low

<P>
   Behind La Scala, the Hotel Star, 5 Via dei Bossi, (39-02)

   Since it opened in 1863, the Grand Hotel et de Milan, at 29 Via
Manzoni, (39-02) 723141, fax (39-02) 86460861, has been a favorite
with celebrities. Giuseppe Verdi chose it as his residence in
Milan. The Grand Hotel retains its plush 19th-century elegance and
charm, along with all modern amenities; stepping through its doors
is to step back in history. Doubles are $377 and $447, without
breakfast.
 &UR; WHERE TO EAT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn-of-the-century decor and exceptional wines are two reasons
to eat at the Caffe della Pusterla, 24 Via De Amicis, near the
basilica of Sant' Ambrogio. The food is simple _ salads,
sandwiches, light entrees. The wines tend to be Tuscan, since the
owners have a farm near Montalcino. Meal for two with wine: $46.50.
(39-02) 89402146. Closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Next door is the Premiata Pizzeria, with garden, serving a vast
selection of excellent pizzas and full meals. Pizzas range from
$5.25 to $9.25. A simple dinner for two can stay under $23 with the
house wine. (39-02) 89406075. Closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Milan's freshest fish is found at the Ristorante Mercato
del Pesce, 54 Via Cesare Lombroso, near the wholesale fish market.
Despite a kitschy faux-Tahiti decor, it is worth the cab ride to
the edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   The fixed menu offers substantial appetizers, spaghetti alla
pescatora or risotto alla marinara, and a grilled-fish platter for
$32 a person, without drinks. A la carte meals will bring the bill
to about $100 for two. Reservations are preferred. (39-02)
55195540. Closed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Osteria dei Binari, 1 Via Tortona, is in the Navigli
district, the hub of Milanese night life. The Osteria, in the style
of an old Milanese inn, with heavy wooden chairs and tables and
iron lamps, and a large garden, exudes atmosphere and offers
traditional fare of Lombardy, Milan's region. The fixed price menu
is $34.75, without drinks. Reservations suggested. (39-02)
89409428. Closed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ristorante Peck, across from the specialty foods shop of the
same name, is modern, stylish and intimate. A wide-ranging menu
includes all the Milanese classics, from risotto alla Milanese,
with saffron, to osso buco and cottoletta alla Milanese. Dinner for
two from $135 with a nice bottle of wine. 4 Via Victor Hugo,
(39-02) 876774. Closed Sunday.

<P>
   &UR; By JOHN TAGLIABUE &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Some Italian cities, like Naples or Palermo, have a hard time
being sedate. Ask them to spin a pirouette or dance a tarantella,
and they're in their element.
</P>
<P>
   But Milan is not a tarantella _ it's a slow tango, a cool,
understated place with a measured step, where excitement can mean
strolling to the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele, the glassed-in
Beaux-Arts shopping concourse adjacent to the Duomo, to down a
cappuccino or just to see and be seen.
</P>
<P>
   But Milan tangos a little faster in the fall, when the big trade
fairs come to town, most notably the fall fashion showings.
</P>
<P>
   The spring and fall fashion weeks were certainly the busiest
time of the year in Milan, with tens of thousands of anxious
designers, willowy models, buyers, photographers and just plain
hangers-on descending on the city.
</P>
<P>
   But in this heady season, there are plenty of other diversions
besides fashion. Milan is a spread-out city, and the best way to
get an overview is on one of the many bus tours or guided walks
offered throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Rome or Naples, where sunshine reigns much of the time,
Milan can be damp and gray. So it is also an indoor city, whether
that means lounging in one of the Galleria's cafes or visiting
Leonardo's ``Last Supper'' in the former refectory of the convent
of Santa Maria delle Grazie, or Michelangelo's tender Rondanini
Pieta at the Museum of the Castello Sforzesco.
</P>
<P>
   If the weather is nice, you might start by climbing to the roof
of the vast Gothic Duomo, a sierra of finials and statues that you
can hike across like an Alpine meadow, and which affords a close
look at the Madonnina, the golden statue of the Virgin atop the
central tower, and spectacular views of the city; on clear days the
vistas stretch northward to the Alps.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, the place not to miss is the Ambrosiana Art Gallery
and Library, 2 Piazza Pio XI, (39-02) 806921, which reopened last
year after a seven-year restoration. The library, commissioned by
Federico Cardinal Borromeo in 1607, contains 35,000 manuscripts and
700,000 printed books.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal's personal art collection forms the core of the
gallery, Milan's oldest museum. His good taste allows us to enjoy
Raphael's cartoon for the School of Athens in the Vatican;
Caravaggio's ``Basket of Fruit''; paintings by Leonardo, Botticelli
and Titian; and one of the world's finest collections of Lombard
art. Open Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission $7,
calculated at 1,724 lire to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To explore the heart of Milan, start at the Duomo and walk
through the Galleria to La Scala, then up Via Dante to the Castello
Sforzesco, and the spacious gardens behind. To visit the fashion
district, start at the Piazza San Babila, then stroll narrow Via
Monte Napoleone and nearby Via Spiga, lined with the flagship
stores of many of Italy's leading designers.
</P>
<P>
   A 1920s tourist tram leaves the Piazza Castello at 11 a.m. and 1
p.m. daily (also 3 p.m. in September and October). From there, it
passes the Duomo, goes out to the gradually gentrifying Navigli
neighborhood of canals and narrow lanes _ where some of Milan's
liveliest night life can be found. It then goes on to Santa Maria
delle Grazie, and back by the fashion district and La Scala.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigli neighborhood borders two canals in the southwest
corner of Milan. Once the port of Milan (the canals connected the
city to the Po River) and a tough working-class district, it has
become a trendy neighborhood, filled with antiques shops, bars and
restaurants (some on barges). Tickets, for sale on the tram,
(39-02) 72002584, are $17.50.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the Milan Tourist Office, 1 Via Marconi,
(39-02) 72524300, organizes two-hour walking tours of the Duomo,
the Victor Emmanuel gallery, the Marino Palace courtyard (now city
hall) and La Scala for $11.50. You can call ahead to reserve an
English-speaking guide.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's most important art collection, the Brera, 28 Via Brera,
(39-02) 722631, includes such masterpieces as Raphael's ``Marriage
of the Virgin,'' Piero della Francesca's ``Sacra Conversazione''
and Caravaggio's ``Supper at Emmaus.'' Open Tuesday to Saturday 9
a.m. to 9:45 p.m.; Sunday and holidays 9 a.m. to 12:45 p.m. and
2:30 to 7:45 p.m. Tickets $4.65.
</P>
<P>
   One of Milan's best-kept secrets is the 15th-century Church of
Santa Maria presso San Satiro. The downtown church was built by
Bramante next to a ninth-century basilica. Of particular note is
the baptistry _ marvelous in its Renaissance harmony _ and the
trompe l'oeil apse, designed that way by Bramante because he had no
more room.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No musical event in Italy commands as much attention _ and
reverence _ as the opening of the opera season at La Scala, which
traditionally takes place Dec. 7, the feast of St. Ambrose, Milan's
patron saint. Yet the preseason offerings at La Scala are also
impressive, with ballets, operas, symphonies and chamber music most
nights during the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet corps closes its summer season with Kenneth
MacMillan's ``L'Histoire de Manon,'' which will be performed on
Oct. 1 to 3, 6 and 7, with Alessandra Ferri, La Scala's prima
ballerina. Tickets are $14.50 to $52.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997-98 opera season closes with Donizetti's ``Elisir
d'Amore,'' with Mariella Devia, Vincenzo La Scola and Paul Groves.
Performances on Oct. 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26, 27, 29, 31 and Nov. 6
and 8. La Scala's box office is at 2 Via Filodrammatici; (39-02)
860775. Tickets $17.50 to $156.50.
</P>
<P>
   The La Scala museum, with historical costumes and other
memorabilia, (39-02) 8053418, is open 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. and 2 to
5:30 p.m. Monday to Sunday (closed Sundays after Oct. 31). Tickets
$3.50.
</P>
<P>
   La Scala overshadows other musical pleasures in Milan _ a shame,
for there are gems to be found. The Orchestra Verdi dazzles with a
varied repertory at the Lirico Theater, 14 Via Larga, (39-02)
809665. Concerts are on Thursday and Friday at 8:30 p.m. and Sunday
at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Modern dance and a rock opera start the season at the Teatro
Smeraldo, Piazza 25 Aprile, (39-02) 29006767. ``Elastesse,'' a
ballet choreographed by David Parsons, Moses Pendleton and Daniel
Ezralow, Oct. 6 to 11 (tickets $17.50 to $23), is followed by the
Who's ``Tommy'' Oct. 13 to 25 (tickets $17.50 to $29).
</P>
<P>
   An extensive Man Ray retrospective at the Fondazione Mazzotta
runs through Jan. 24, at 50 Foro Bonaparte, (39-02) 878197. Open
Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (10:30 p.m. Tuesday and
Thursday). $7.

 &HT;    
 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not tied to a schedule, mature travelers can tour many
destinations in a short period of time _ without having to unpack.
That made the ``one-city-plus-side-trips'' travel schedule the
perfect choice for Kent and Wynne Crombie of Palatine, Ill., who
were celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary.
 &HT;    The Crombies had met in Berlin when Wynne was a teacher for the
Department of Defense and Kent was in the Air Force, so the logical
location to celebrate their anniversary had to be Berlin.
 &HT;    The love birds were prepared to see a Berlin that was quite
different from the one they had loved in their youth. They spent
parts of the first two days checking out old haunts.
 &HT;    The Americans are gone and the PX (post exchange) has been
bulldozed. Their old BOQs (bachelor officers quarters) are now
offices. Only a few years ago Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's pre-war
Times Square, was a mine zone. A viewing platform _ or the Info Box
_ provides a terrific 360-degree view of this massive
reconstruction zone.
 &HT;    The Crombies planned their weeklong trip to allow them to
explore the city one day and then take a daylong side-trip by train
the next. No dodging 100 mph Mercedes on the autobahn for them!
 &HT;    They began by buying a seven-day transportation pass for $27
each for travel among Berlin's three different travel zones in the
city and surrounding countryside.
 &HT;    The Crombies alternated between the S-Bahn, U-Bahn, trams and
buses as often as they wanted. A senior discount does kick in at
age 62, but unfortunately it applies only to a monthly pass.
 &HT;    Berlin's transit system comes with stairs _ and plenty of them _
so the Crombies recommend that visitors set their own pace. By the
end of the day the couple's calf muscles had had a great workout.
Escalators are available at most stops.
 SIDE TRIP TO POTSDAM  
 &HT;    The first of three side trips took the Crombies to Potsdam,
specifically Cecilienhof, where the Potsdam Conference was held in
1945. It was set in a massive Tudor structure built by Kaiser
Wilhelm II during World War I.
 &HT;    The Crombies say that the Big Three _ Churchill, Stalin and
Truman _ might have just taken a coffee break, so impressive is the
room in which their meetings were held. They urge visitors to take
the time to stroll along the cobblestone streets around Cecilienhof
to see the surrounding country mansions even though they have lost
much of their opulence through neglect.
 &HT;    On the way back to Berlin from Potsdam, the Crombies crossed the
Glienicker Bridge _ often called the ``James Bond Bridge.'' It has
become a fixture in many spy novels and movies. Here Francis Gary
Powers gained his freedom in 1962. The walk across this symbol of
the Cold War can be quite a heady experience.
 BORDER CITY VISIT  
 &HT;    The Crombies' next side trip was to Slubice, Poland, a border
city of 18,000. With the border only 90 minutes away, it was an
excellent way to see the former East German countryside while the
train made its way through farmlands and forests.
 &HT;    The Crombies offer one word of caution: Well-dressed seniors are
especially easy targets for thieves in this area where East Germans
and Poles have a high rate of unemployment. A fellow traveler on
the train warned Wynne Crombie against leaving her purse in plain
view.
 &HT;    It's a 25-minute hike from the Frankfurt-on-der-Oder train
station to the bridge crossing over to Slubice, but a cab ride
costs about $3.
 &HT;    The Crombies joined the melange of pedestrians on the bridge:
women with strollers and shopping bags, people walking their bikes
and smokers looking for cheap cigarettes.
 &HT;    For lunch they chose the appropriately named Restauracja Odra,
which is on a main street near the Odra River. They ate a delicious
lunch of goulash soup and roasted chicken with vegetables.
Deciphering the menu required a dictionary: It is in Polish with
German translations.
 TRANQUIL SPREEWALD  
 &HT;    For the Crombies' final side trip, relaxation reigned as they
made their way to the village of Lubbenau, which is about 60
minutes south of Berlin by rail. As the train began its journey,
Berlin's industrial suburbs gave way to pastoral land and the
canals of the Spreewald River.
 &HT;    The Crombies took note of the memorial on the left side of the
street about halfway down the block from Lubbenau's rail station:
``1930-1945. Never Forget: It is better to die standing than to
live kneeling. In memory of the 11 million victims of freedom.''
 &HT;    Boat trips begin at the small boat landing in the center of
town. The flat-bottom gondolas hold 24 people and are poled by a
German version of a gondolier. The gondolas can be tricky to board
if you have a balance problem or are not steady on your feet.
 &HT;    The ride takes travelers through a series of small rivers _
sometimes only 10 feet across _ under a canopy of willows, ash and
birch. Houses lining the banks resemble storybook cottages, like
those from the children's tale ``Hansel and Gretel.''
 &HT;    The narrative is in German, but the Crombies say the visual
effects make up for any missing audio.
 EXPLORING THE CITY  
 &HT;    The trio of day trips did not prevent the Crombies from poking
into some side corners of Berlin. The Topography of Terror, a
series of photographs chronicling the Nazi era, is temporarily
housed in the remnants of cellar rooms once used by the Nazis to
torture their victims.
 &HT;    The Museum at Checkpoint Charlie offers an absorbing display of
the various ingenious escape methods used by the East Germans.
 &HT;    The Crombies also visited Berlin's flea markets for some
extraordinary shopping. The biggest such market is held every
Sunday on the Juni 17th Strasse, just off the Tiergarten. There are
many articles left over from the German Democratic Republic. The
Crombies found lots of old chandeliers, telephones, carved-brass
door handles and Prussian generals' hats.
 &HT;    The Crombies had explored Berlin and made three fascinating side
trips. In between they had the leisure to browse the corner
bierstuben, or pub, and chat with the locals. This gave the couple
a chance to be a part of the new Berlin as they had been part of
the old.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not tied to a schedule, mature travelers can tour many
destinations in a short period of time _ without having to unpack.
That made the ``one-city-plus-side-trips'' travel schedule the
perfect choice for Kent and Wynne Crombie of Palatine, Ill., who
were celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary.
 &HT;    The Crombies had met in Berlin when Wynne was a teacher for the
Department of Defense and Kent was in the Air Force, so the logical
location to celebrate their anniversary had to be Berlin.
 &HT;    The love birds were prepared to see a Berlin that was quite
different from the one they had loved in their youth. They spent
parts of the first two days checking out old haunts.
 &HT;    The Americans are gone and the PX (post exchange) has been
bulldozed. Their old BOQs (bachelor officers quarters) are now
offices. Only a few years ago Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's pre-war
Times Square, was a mine zone. A viewing platform _ or the Info Box
_ provides a terrific 360-degree view of this massive
reconstruction zone.
 &HT;    The Crombies planned their weeklong trip to allow them to
explore the city one day and then take a daylong side-trip by train
the next. No dodging 100 mph Mercedes on the autobahn for them!
 &HT;    They began by buying a seven-day transportation pass for $27
each for travel among Berlin's three different travel zones in the
city and surrounding countryside.
 &HT;    The Crombies alternated between the S-Bahn, U-Bahn, trams and
buses as often as they wanted. A senior discount does kick in at
age 62, but unfortunately it applies only to a monthly pass.
 &HT;    Berlin's transit system comes with stairs _ and plenty of them _
so the Crombies recommend that visitors set their own pace. By the
end of the day the couple's calf muscles had had a great workout.
Escalators are available at most stops.
 SIDE TRIP TO POTSDAM  
 &HT;    The first of three side trips took the Crombies to Potsdam,
specifically Cecilienhof, where the Potsdam Conference was held in
1945. It was set in a massive Tudor structure built by Kaiser
Wilhelm II during World War I.
 &HT;    The Crombies say that the Big Three _ Churchill, Stalin and
Truman _ might have just taken a coffee break, so impressive is the
room in which their meetings were held. They urge visitors to take
the time to stroll along the cobblestone streets around Cecilienhof
to see the surrounding country mansions even though they have lost
much of their opulence through neglect.
 &HT;    On the way back to Berlin from Potsdam, the Crombies crossed the
Glienicker Bridge _ often called the ``James Bond Bridge.'' It has
become a fixture in many spy novels and movies. Here Francis Gary
Powers gained his freedom in 1962. The walk across this symbol of
the Cold War can be quite a heady experience.
 BORDER CITY VISIT  
 &HT;    The Crombies' next side trip was to Slubice, Poland, a border
city of 18,000. With the border only 90 minutes away, it was an
excellent way to see the former East German countryside while the
train made its way through farmlands and forests.
 &HT;    The Crombies offer one word of caution: Well-dressed seniors are
especially easy targets for thieves in this area where East Germans
and Poles have a high rate of unemployment. A fellow traveler on
the train warned Wynne Crombie against leaving her purse in plain
view.
 &HT;    It's a 25-minute hike from the Frankfurt-on-der-Oder train
station to the bridge crossing over to Slubice, but a cab ride
costs about $3.
 &HT;    The Crombies joined the melange of pedestrians on the bridge:
women with strollers and shopping bags, people walking their bikes
and smokers looking for cheap cigarettes.
 &HT;    For lunch they chose the appropriately named Restauracja Odra,
which is on a main street near the Odra River. They ate a delicious
lunch of goulash soup and roasted chicken with vegetables.
Deciphering the menu required a dictionary: It is in Polish with
German translations.
 TRANQUIL SPREEWALD  
 &HT;    For the Crombies' final side trip, relaxation reigned as they
made their way to the village of Lubbenau, which is about 60
minutes south of Berlin by rail. As the train began its journey,
Berlin's industrial suburbs gave way to pastoral land and the
canals of the Spreewald River.
 &HT;    The Crombies took note of the memorial on the left side of the
street about halfway down the block from Lubbenau's rail station:
``1930-1945. Never Forget: It is better to die standing than to
live kneeling. In memory of the 11 million victims of freedom.''
 &HT;    Boat trips begin at the small boat landing in the center of
town. The flat-bottom gondolas hold 24 people and are poled by a
German version of a gondolier. The gondolas can be tricky to board
if you have a balance problem or are not steady on your feet.
 &HT;    The ride takes travelers through a series of small rivers _
sometimes only 10 feet across _ under a canopy of willows, ash and
birch. Houses lining the banks resemble storybook cottages, like
those from the children's tale ``Hansel and Gretel.''
 &HT;    The narrative is in German, but the Crombies say the visual
effects make up for any missing audio.
 EXPLORING THE CITY  
 &HT;    The trio of day trips did not prevent the Crombies from poking
into some side corners of Berlin. The Topography of Terror, a
series of photographs chronicling the Nazi era, is temporarily
housed in the remnants of cellar rooms once used by the Nazis to
torture their victims.
 &HT;    The Museum at Checkpoint Charlie offers an absorbing display of
the various ingenious escape methods used by the East Germans.
 &HT;    The Crombies also visited Berlin's flea markets for some
extraordinary shopping. The biggest such market is held every

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Now is the time to start planning this season's ski vacation.
For skiers in need of some pampering, here are eight of the most
atmospheric places on the slopes. Rates are based on double
occupancy in January.
 &HT;    Taos might seem like a high desert mirage of purple skies and
snow-white powder. But that miraculous Southwest powder that
inspired Georgia O'Keefe is no mirage. Here in laid back Taos, the
Inn at Snakedance (Box 89, Taos Ski Valley, N.M. 87525;
800-322-9815) counts as high fashion. The rooms are comfortable but
simple, the fireplaces welcome, a television the only hint of
luxury.
 &HT;    Skiers don't come here to watch CNN, however, but to earn their
stripes among moguls the size of adobe pueblos. Rates from $175,
including breakfast.
 &HT;    Aspen has four extraordinary mountains, the best restaurants in
ski country and a wallop of glitterati. It also has more than its
share of places that would qualify as a romantic retreats.
 &HT;    But the sybarites' choice has to be The Little Nell (675 E.
Durant, Aspen, Colo. 81611; 800-525-6200). As smooth as hazelnut
gelato, the last word in subtle, this slope-side hotel compares
favorably with the best in the world.
 &HT;    From impeccable service to marble baths and Frette robes, the
Little Nell attempts to give its guests the feeling of being the
most important person in the world. Rates from $475.
 &HT;    The Spring Creek Resort (P.O. Box 3154, Jackson Wyo. 83001
800-443-6139) has views of the snowcapped Tetons and grazing elk
herds. The hotel is a cozy place where wood-paneled bedrooms come
with a wood-burning fireplace.
 &HT;    The Granary restaurant offers a bountiful skiers breakfast, just
the thing for negotiating Corbet's Couloir on a pair of K-2s or
heading down one of the less intimidating runs at Jackson Hole.
Rates from $190 including breakfast.
 &HT;    Adjacent to Spring Creek is the newly opened Amangani (P.O. Box
15030, Jackson Wyo. 83002; 800-443-6139), which offers sybarites a
totally different kind of pleasure.
 &HT;    The first resort in this luxury chain to open in the continental
United States, the rooms have a sleek, quasi-oriental design,
drop-dead views and a quiet demeanor that suits a chain whose best
known properties are in Bali. Rates here start at $400.
 &HT;    At Sundance (RR4, Box A1, Sundance, Utah 84604; 800-892-1600),
there are few lights, no cameras and all of the action is on the
slopes.
 &HT;    An hour from Salt Lake City, Sundance is actor Robert Redford's
retreat at the base of Mount Timpanogos, the highest peak in the
Wasatch Range. The accommodations at Sundance are an idealized
version of what a cabin should be, with pine interiors, stone
fireplaces and rustic furniture with just the right amount of
cowboy chic. Cap the night at the screening room, which has
Hollywood-quality sound and vision. Rates from $195 and includes
breakfast.
 &HT;    Take the most dramatic mountain scenery in North America, add a
Relais &AMP; Chateaux property, and position it five minutes away from
Lake Louise, Canada's largest ski area. That's why the cognoscenti
cozy up at the Post Hotel (P.O. Box 69, Lake Louise, Alberta,
Canada, T0L 1E0; 800-661-1586) in Lake Louise.
 &HT;    Swiss brothers George and Andre Schwarz run this alpine
chalet-style property, which features rooms paneled with Canadian
pine, whirlpool tubs and fieldstone fireplaces. That same decor is
featured in what is arguably the best dining room in the Canadian
Rockies.
 &HT;    The cooking is by Chef Wolfgang Vogt, the award-winning 15,000
bottle wine cellar is a treat and the dinnertime pianist isn't bad
either. Call it north woods rustic meets European civilization at
discounted Canadian prices. Starting in January, rates will begin
at about $110 U.S.
 &HT;    Visitors are know to hum ``Edelweiss'' on their horse-drawn
sleigh ride around the 2,200-acre Trapp Family Lodge (42 Trapp Hill
Road, Stowe Vt. 05672; 800-826-7000). The ``Sound of Music'' family
bought this farm outside of Stowe Village in 1940 because it
reminded them so much of Austria.
 &HT;    Rebuilt and updated, the Tyrolean-style rooms come with a duvet
and a balcony with an Alpine-style view of the mountains.
 &HT;    Johannes von Trapp, the youngest of the 10 children of Maria and
the Baron, not only runs the lodge but laid out the resort's 100
kilometers of cross-country trails back in 1968, the first
dedicated Nordic center in North America.
 &HT;    The lodge is a few minutes from the prototypical mountain
village of Stowe, the downhill pleasures of Mt. Mansfield and the
headquarters of Ben &AMP; Jerry's. Rates from $140.
 &HT;    The Peaks Resort &AMP; Spa (P.O. Box 2702, Telluride, Colo. 81435;
800-789-2220) Facials, massage and a yoga class are the perfect way
to unwind after a day in San Juan Mountain powder.
 &HT;    The 42,000-square-foot spa at the Peaks lays claim to being the
best spa at any ski resort. Think of this as a contemporary
mountain chateau, with good-size rooms, terry-cloth robes and
generous bathrooms. Not to mention terraces with views of 14,000
foot peaks.
 &HT;    The hotel is a gondola ride away from the heart of the
Victorian-era mining town of Telluride, perhaps the most beautiful
ski town in America. Rates from $405.

<P>
   How the mighty are fallen. Earlier this year, most financial
folk thought the dollar could go only one way -- up. But this week
it plunged.
</P>
<P>
   At one point it touched 111 yen, down by a quarter from the
year's peak in early August, before bouncing back to almost 117.
</P>
<P>
   The greenback also slumped against the Deutschemark, hitting a
20-month low. What on earth is going on?
</P>
<P>
   Many think the dollar's troubles have been caused by the
unwinding of positions by hedge funds that had borrowed in cheap
yen to finance purchases of higher-yielding dollar assets. There
are fears of more to come because of huge positions still to be
unwound by the likes of the stricken Long-Term Capital Management
(and banks that have made similar bets but pretend they are not
hedge funds). Uncertainty has bred illiquidity; already badly
burned, many potential buyers of dollars have been deterred.
</P>
<P>
   If the recent sharp fall in the dollar reflects only such
temporary factors, the greenback might soon recover. However, part
of the dollar's decline also reflects a shift in perceptions about
economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, these moves reflect new optimism that Japan will
cure its sick banking system and spur its economy out of recession.
The yen's spurt coincided with the submission of bills to Japan's
Diet (parliament) that would allow the government to intervene in
the operations of ``extremely undercapitalized'' banks.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such optimism is justified is arguable: the government
and the opposition are still at loggerheads about the form the
package should take. Besides fears that the yen's strength will
hurt Japanese exporters the realization that bank reform is still
some way off may explain why, after rising sharply on Wednesday,
the Japanese stockmarket fell as sharply the following day.
</P>
<P>
   There is also growing concern that America's economy will slow
markedly next year. Economists are slashing their growth forecasts.
Lehman Brothers has cut its forecast for growth next year to a mere
0.7 percent, and expects the Fed funds rate to drop to 3 percent by
the end of next year, from 5.25 percent currently. J.P. Morgan is
now forecasting that the American economy will move into recession
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Bludgeoned from all sides, bankers attending the annual meetings
in Washington of the IMF and the World Bank were in a grim mood.
``This is the greatest drying up of liquidity to emerging markets
since Moses parted the Red Sea,'' said Robert Hormats of Goldman
Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The inference was clear: to calm markets -- America's among them
-- politicians should have come up with a grand scheme to save the
world economy. When this failed to materialize, one banker
complained of the bureaucrats: ``these guys are at 100,000 feet,
and the crisis is at 3,000 feet.''
</P>
<P>
   His feet, as usual, firmly on the ground, Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, does share some of these concerns.
This week he said that the American economy was slowing, and that
the Fed needed to be especially alert to risks from forces shaking
global markets. At the moment, he said, the main risk comes via the
financial system: credit has been tightened since the Russian
crisis in the middle of August.
</P>
<P>
   Such is their mood at the moment, it is not surprising that the
markets seized on these comments as implying that the Fed will cut
interest rates again soon.
</P>
<P>
   Where now for the battered dollar? America's widening
current-account deficit should count against it. More importantly,
as the premium of American interest rates over Japanese and German
rates narrows, the dollar should also weaken. But neither of these,
nor a remote sign of courage in Japan, explains the magnitude of
this week's drop. For that, blame increased illiquidity in the
markets, forced selling by hedge funds -- and panic.
</P>
<P>
   But fear contributes to investment banks' current forecasts of
economic armageddon. With luck, these will prove as accurate as
their previous predictions of never-ending growth and ever-rising
share prices.
</P>
<P>
   Transfixed by Greenspan's darker remarks, markets are
downplaying his reminders that the American economy still has legs
aplenty and, moreover, that although companies are finding it
harder to raise fresh capital, a full-blown credit crunch is a long
way off.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, as Greenspan points out, is that the bad news is
always on the front page of newspapers, and the good news buried on
page 35.
</P>
<P>
   A plummeting dollar comes at an awkward time for policymakers.
The dollar's strength has dampened inflation in America; a falling
dollar will tend to revive it, which could make it harder for the
Fed to cut interest rates. A strong yen is also the exact opposite
of what Japan's recession-bound economy needs right now for it
chokes exports, which are just about the only thing that Japan has
going for it.

EUROPEANS ARE CHILLED BY GREENSPAN'S WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ When Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan said this week
that in 50 years as a financial analyst he had never seen anything
like the recent turbulence that has struck financial markets, he
sent a wave of cold apprehension through Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is not, to put it mildly, known as someone who
over-dramatizes events. His speeches have in the past drawn stifled
yawns of boredom from his audiences. The Fed chairman has built his
reputation as a cautious and balanced analyzer of economic trends.
He is widely regarded as the most asute central banker of the
world's top industrial nations, partly because of his usual care
not to say something he might later regret.
</P>
<P>
   So when even he publicly ackowledged he was caught by surprise
by the speed of the markets' sharp dip and the downward movement of
the dollar, his foreign peers became seriously concerned. Le
Figaro, France's biggest newspaper, said it was surprised at his
pessimistic tone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he has declared several times in recent months that the
continuing Wall Street bull market might not be justified by the
hard economic facts. But he always cushioned his statements by
adding that the economy was still in fine shape. This week, the
cushion was nowhere to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   His latest remarks were interpreted here as signaling that
Asia's year-old credit crunch _ a polite way of saying banks won't
lend you any money _ has now struck the United States and that
business executives have become shy about further expansion.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be little evidence of any of this as recently
as late summer. U.S. banks, unlike many in Japan and elsewhere in
Asia, are stable and, as far as we know, mainly profitable. And
hardly a day went by without the announcement of some multi-billion
dollar industrial or financial institutional merger.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, investors are quitting the American market in a
strategy of ``risk aversion,'' London's Financial Times reports. It
quotes one financial adviser as explaining that ``everybody is
rushing for the exits ... not just those involved in so-called
hedge funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The near crash last month of Long-Term Capital Management, L.P.,
a leading hedge fund, is blamed by many for the change in the
economic outlook. Hedge funds make money _ or lose it _ essentially
by betting on changing values between different currencies.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the storm, the dollar, previously the world's
strongest currency, took the heaviest hammering. The dollar's most
spectacular losses were against the yen. But most experts said this
had virtually nothing to do with the respective economies of the
United States and Japan. ``There has been no upward reassessment of
the Japanese economy,'' said French banker Emil Miller.
</P>
<P>
   He and other specialists said the dollar fell largely as a
result of hedge funds being forced to cash in to cover their losses
in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   As Greenspan might have said, but didn't: It's a crazy world.
And there is likely to be more to come.

<P>
   &UR; By CHERYL HECKLER-FELTZ &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   In the last several weeks, while Bill Clinton has faced the
greatest moral crisis of his presidency, Jimmy Carter has built a
recreational complex for the children of Plains, Ga., promoted his
ambitious plan to bring democracy to China one village at a time,
received a visit from the former president of Nigeria and taught a
Sunday school class on the subject of personal accountability.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some carefully worded comments last month
at Emory University -- in which the former president demonstrated
disgust for President Clinton's affair and lack of honesty with the
American people and in which he predicted Clinton would survive
impeachment hearings -- Carter has remained mostly silent about
Clinton's circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   However, as is often the case, regular students in his Sunday
school class at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains were the first
to get a hint of just what Carter is thinking about national
events.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has been the regular adult Sunday school teacher at
Maranatha for the last 16 years. He teaches an average of three
times a month, beginning each hour-long class with a 10-minute
update on personal events or observations relating to the
activities in his own life in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, he has made several observations regarding the
Lewinsky affair and the campaign-finance investigation now
surrounding Vice President Al Gore:
</P>
<P>
   --The Sunday after Congress released President Clinton's taped
grand jury testimony, Carter told his class he had spoken that week
with former president Gerald Ford, ``who has evolved into a very
deep and personal friend of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we discussed this week was the crisis now in
Washington, Carter said. We agreed to not speak out in public about
what should happen, but we both deplore the crisis and the moral
problem of our nation. We constrasted it with when we happened to
be in office, and we agreed to just consult with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   --In addressing his class just a few days after Clinton's Aug.
17 admission, Carter spoke about his visit to the ``Tonight Show''
with Jay Leno after he wrote ``Living Faith'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In preparation for my visit to the show, he (Leno) interviewed
people on the street to see what they knew about the Bible. It was
surprising how many people knew the first commandment was freedom
of speech, and a lot of them knew the whale swallowed Pinnochio,''
Carter told his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one that modern-day leaders should remember involves the
seventh commandment. I'm not going to name any names, but they
thought it said, ``thou shalt not ADMIT adultery.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience burst into applause.
</P>
<P>
   --In early September, Carter told his class, ``One thing I did
this week was to call Al Gore, who is a friend of ours, and give
him some advice on how to deal with the charges against him that he
might have used improper means to raise funds for the last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I hoped that no matter what he did, that if he
made a mistake that he should just admit it and say, 'I made a
mistake. My lawyers advised me to do this.' and not get caught
later on in having told the American people something that wasn't
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listened carefully and began to tell me his lawyers advised
that this was technically correct. And I said, 'Look Al, I don't
even want to hear that. You just tell the worst that you possible
could have done, and let the American people be on your side.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure would hate to see Al Gore get caught up in a situation
where people would doubt his honesty and his integrity. I think Al
Gore is a very honest and decent person.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's obvious omission of comment on Clinton was not lost on
anyone in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the contrasts between Clinton's moral quotient and
Carter's is not lost on anyone who remembers the 1976 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's ``I'll-never-lie-to-you'' promise seemed almost naive
at the time but stands in total contrast with Clinton's public lie
in January, ``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's lead in the 1976 pre-election polls vanished when
``Playboy'' reported that he had admitted having lusted for women
other than his wife Rosalynn.
</P>
<P>
   This is mild stuff when compared to the thousands of
near-pornographic pages released in the last four weeks related to
the Clinton-Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was voted out of office by Americans who considered him
ineffective in his efforts to reduce double-digit inflation and to
reclaim our hostages from Iran.
</P>
<P>
   After he lost his bid for re-election, Carter was consoled by
people who told him he was too good a man, too honest a human
being, to be in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton now is tagged untrustworthy, morally repugnant, ``but an
effective president.''
</P>
<P>
   While Carter has remained restrained in his public comments on
the moral crisis in Washington, he does offer a profound example of
redemption after leaving the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Clinton should start taking notes.
</P>

NEW QUEST LANDS IN MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESEND: CORRECTS TOYOTA SIERRA TO TOYOTA SIENNA IN PENULTIMATE
GRAPH)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Four doors, no waiting. That's the new slogan in the
minivan world, where buyers have rebelled against the
right-side-only, sliding-rear-door setup. Now, it's rear doors on
both sides or else.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Quest (also known as Mercury Villager) is coming into the
four-door realm a bit late in the game, more or less the last major
minivan to jump on the wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Because, let's face it, all of these minivans have pretty much
settled into the Chrysler model of front-drive, V-6,
seven-or-eight-passenger, cupholder-enhanced vehicles that drive
like cars. Even Honda and Toyota, which attempted their own takes
on the minivan, have come around.
</P>
<P>
   The Quest/Villager has been one of my favorite minivans for
years, mainly for its driveability, especially the carlike
handling. Although in the past it hasn't compared in interior space
with the long-wheelbase Chryslers or Fords, it has provided
seven-passenger seating and a flexible interior that takes
advantage of the space it has.
</P>
<P>
   For '99, the Quest has been restyled and updated, with more
interior space, a more-powerful engine, freshened styling and, of
course, a second sliding door.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Japanese surname, the Quest is largely a U.S.
product, with redesign work performed at Nissan's design studio in
La Jolla, Calif., engineering in Farmington Hills, Mich., and
assembly along with Villagers at a Ford plant in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Though just 4.6 inches longer and 1.2 inches wider, the new
Quest feels more commodious, with improved stowage behind the third
seat. I'm told the interior has been revised, but the test minivan
was a prototype model, and the inside was a mishmash.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the Quest felt accommodating, with easy-to-read
gauges and easy-to-use switches and controls, lots of stowage,
including a handy cargo net strung between the front seats, and, of
course, plenty of cupholders strewn about.
</P>
<P>
   A removable shelf, the better to load grocery bags and provide
two-shelf efficiency, has been added behind the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite feature of this van, and its predecessor, is the way
the rear seat slides forward on rails. With four people aboard, we
stopped off at a furniture store and bought one of those Laz-Z-Boy
reclining chairs. When it came time to load, I was able to fold the
rear seat and slide it forward, providing space for the chair
without disturbing the passengers in the middle row.
</P>
<P>
   The two captain's chairs in the middle row can be removed and
the third seat can slide up to substitute as a three-across middle
seat, providing a large cargo area in the rear. Or one can fold the
middle seat and slide it all the way up to the front seats for the
maximum amount of cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Quest has the same fault of all minivans in providing
inadequate stowage when all seats are occupied. A trip with seven
people onboard requires other accommodations for luggage. Maybe a
roof rack.
</P>
<P>
   The engine has been upgraded for '99, growing to 3.3 liters and
providing noticeably more power. The Quest is still not a
powerhouse among minivans, with the Ford Windstar, Chevy Venture
and some Chrysler models offering more pull. But the Quest will
accelerate, climb hills and cruise at highway speeds without
apology.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is quiet and refined, with scant wind or road noise,
even in this prototype. Like the former model, the Quest will
corner and handle better than most.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new Quest rests on the same platform as the old
Quest (the extra length is behind the rear wheels), the suspension
has been revised for a smoother ride. The tester was a
performance-tuned SE version with a rear anti-roll bar and bigger
wheels and tires.
</P>
<P>
   Though pricing wasn't firmed up at press time, base Quests are
expected to start at about $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   The new styling is more of a makeover than a face lift, with a
new face up front and the extra length nicely added to the original
design. I found the styling of the original to be a little more
edgy, the new one blander and more generic.
</P>
<P>
   Because Honda just unveiled its new Odyssey minivan, and
Toyota's Sierra is new for '99, the new Quest has serious
competition from the East as well as the West.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole run of today's minivans shares the same big-guppy
stying, wedgy in the front and rounded in the rear. They're all
variations on a theme, and choosing one over the other depends
mostly on personal preference or brand loyalty. &QL;

'TIS THE SEASON FOR POLL-VAULTING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Linda Pershing is annoyed. I can't blame her.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches at the State University of New York at Albany. She's
on sabbatical. She's working at her home in the Albany suburb of
Guilderland. Her husband works nights for an airline. And, while
she's trying to work and he's trying to sleep, her phone is ringing
with disturbing regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Who's calling? This is an election year. So the callers are
pollsters, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing said: ``They just kept calling the house over and over
again ... What they do is start out with this spiel, `We just want
to ask you a few questions. It'll just take a few minutes time.'
And they talk so fast that you can't get a word in. And before you
can say boo, pretty soon the person starts rattling off questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed real clear to me that they were trying to figure out
how voters were feeling about some political issues ... When I
asked for information about who was sponsoring this _ I asked for
an address, a phone and a name _ I got hung up on. The second time,
I said, `Do not hang up on me. I want to talk to your supervisor.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This person put me on hold, and I eventually talked to his
supervisor. And this man who was the supervisor refused to give me
that information ... he explained to me that that's not public
information, and that he could not give it to me ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Well, that's interesting. You're going to bother
me in my home and ask my opinion, and you're not going to tell me
who you are.' ... And then that's when I thought, `Gee, there's
something wrong going on here.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I explained to Pershing. ``They never give you that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. They don't want you to know who's calling because
they're afraid that if you're an activist and you have a point of
view hostile to their candidate that you'll lie. You see, it's my
own personal belief that anybody, when contacted by a pollster, has
a duty to lie through his or her teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I say that is that too much of government is run by
polls and too much of the political process is dictated by polls.
You've got all these sniveling cowards in public office who're
afraid to act on the dictates of their consciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think that everybody should lie on every single political
polling question.''
</P>
<P>
   And, you know, that really is the way to fix things. Politicians
are so attentive to polls for a perfectly rational reason. They're
tremendously effective mechanisms for measuring public sentiment at
a precise moment in time. Professionally conducted polls produce
remarkably accurate snapshots of public opinion at that moment.
Politicians well understand that you can obtain a snapshot like
that on a statewide or even a national basis with calls to maybe
800 people. It's relatively cheap, and the science is definitely
for real. This stuff works.
</P>
<P>
   Now you might not believe that. You might be one of those people
who sneer at poll results because you have never been called and/or
because you can't conceive that so few people could share your view
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   You are wrong, though. For evidence, just take a look at how
many political dollars are spent on this stuff _ and how many
commercial dollars, too, by companies doing market research.
</P>
<P>
   Lying to commercial pollsters would be a mistake _ unless, of
course, you want to see a lot of cars on the road with three
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   But lying to political pollsters? Hey, that's no mistake. That's
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   And ethical, too. It's perfectly OK to lie in what you believe
to be a just cause, even under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Thats what the polls say, anyway.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Betrayal is the first sensation 15-year-old Vili Fualaau recalls
feeling when he learned that Mary K. Letourneau, his former grade
school teacher, was pregnant with his second child.
</P>
<P>
   In a tell-all book released in Europe this week, the teen
Letourneau was convicted of raping last year reveals his shock at
learning that he had fathered another child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the impression that she had wronged me, or lied,
something like that,'' Fualaau recalls in the 300-page paperback,
``Un Seul Crime, L'Amour'' _ French for ``Only One Crime, Love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really overwhelmed because I didn't really feel ready
for another baby. I already had problems with the first,'' Fualaau
says.
</P>
<P>
   The book, written by Letourneau, 36, and Fualaau with the help
of a ghostwriter, is not yet available in the United States or in
English.
</P>
<P>
   It was released in French this week at a book fair in Frankfurt,
Germany. A French publisher offered the most money for the book _
and French readers may more easily accept the tale as a love story.
</P>
<P>
   While Fualaau receives most of the $250,000 advance, sources
close to the deal say, Letourneau will not get a cent. Her share
will be awarded to Fualaau, their 18-month-old daughter and their
unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing house, Laffont, would not confirm particulars.
</P>
<P>
   The book details the illicit affair that cost the former
Shoreline Elementary School teacher her career, her marriage, her
freedom and custody of her five children, and thrust her favorite
sixth-grade pupil into teen fatherhood and notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   The book _ and the baby, when it arrives _ could end up being
used as evidence against Letourneau, who is in prison in Gig
Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   One or more new criminal charges could be filed after the birth
of the latest child if it turns out Fualaau is the father, said Dan
Donahoe, a spokesman for King County Prosecutor Norm Maleng.
</P>
<P>
   Each chapter of the book is written from the perspective of
Letourneau, Fualaau, or his mother, Soona. Irish writer Bob Graham
wrote the book from tape-recorded interviews with Letourneau at the
Washington State Corrections Center for Women, and the Fualaaus at
their home in Burien.
</P>
<P>
   With its cover photograph of baby Audrey cradled in Letourneau's
arms, much of the book dwells on protestations by Letourneau and
Fualaau that love cannot be outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are revelations, as well:
</P>
<P>
   _ Though ordered to have no contact with Fualaau after she was
arrested and charged with raping him in 1997, Letourneau asked the
boy to drive her to the hospital for the birth of Audrey, now 18
months old. The teen, then 13, did not have a driver's license and
hadn't learned to drive a manual transmission. Though he managed to
drive part of the way, Letourneau, in the midst of contractions,
was later forced to take the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   _ Released from jail on Jan. 2 after serving six months in the
King County Regional Justice Center on two counts of second-degree
rape of a child, Letourneau immediately resumed contact with the
teen, speaking by phone, communicating by pager and meeting late at
night.
</P>
<P>
   _ During her month of freedom in January, while she was under
close monitoring and treatment as a convicted sex offender,
Letourneau hid Fualaau in the Seward Park home where she was
staying. For two nights _ without the knowledge of her hostess _
they slept together in a bed and on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shortly before a police cruiser knocked on the steamy window
of Letourneau's gray compact car early on Feb. 3, Letourneau
threatened to kill herself, according to Fualaau. In response, he
promised to do the same, to fulfill a ``Romeo and Juliet scenario''
they had previously discussed. She was rearrested that night for
violating the terms of a suspended sentence by having contact with
Fualaau.
</P>
<P>
   Soona Fualaau, who has given her blessing to a future union
between Letourneau and her son, describes in the book how she came
to accept the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a simple woman. I understand simple things,'' she says in
the book's prologue. ``The court says she committed a crime. The
rape of my son ... I know, myself, that it wasn't a rape, and God
knows it, too. Yes, it was adultery, that I don't dispute, but not
a rape. They don't know my son.''
</P>
<P>
   A worldly-sounding Vili Fualaau, who entered the ninth grade
this fall, said his his attraction to Letourneau was
``inexplicable, love. You feel it, that's all and you know what it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Letourneau asks for understanding:``We took, I know, a road
different from others, the road less traveled, but we're no longer
in the Middle Ages, when they burned women, the unfaithful, the
witches, who dared to love outside their marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Letourneau nor Fualaau would comment on the book.
</P>
<P>
   Fualaau left Seattle for Paris on Wednesday for a book tour with
his lawyer, Bob Huff.
</P>
<P>
   Letourneau's estranged husband, Steve, also would not comment
about the book. He once told a reporter he was considering his own
book deal, as were a British physicist who befriended Letourneau, a
Puget Sound crime writer and the two attorneys who have represented
both Letourneau and Fualaau. But in a brief telephone interview
Thursday, there was both relief and exhaustion in Steve
Letourneau's voice when he said, ``No,'' afterall, he doesn't plan
to write a book.

making an unprecedented effort to win Hispanic support, not only

   HISPANIC-HISTORY (Washington) _ 1stLd-Writethru _ For Hispanics,
the long march to political power began shortly after World War II.
We trace the effort, looking at such leaders as Cesar Chavez, who

across the country at the refusal of a Texas town to bury an Army
private killed in World War II in the local cemetery because he was

The development comes at a time when more Hispanics are running for
national and statewide posts generally. By MARK HELM and STEWART M.
POWELL.

   With HISP-LOGO graphic.

   HISPANIC-DIFFERENCES (Washington) _ Republican and Democratic
politicians are learning that they cannot regard Hispanics as a

'TIS THE SEASON FOR POLL-VAULTING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Linda Pershing is annoyed. I can't blame her.
</P>
<P>
   She teaches at the State University of New York at Albany. She's
on sabbatical. She's working at her home in the Albany suburb of
Guilderland. Her husband works nights for an airline. And, while
she's trying to work and he's trying to sleep, her phone is ringing
with disturbing regularity.
</P>
<P>
   Who's calling? This is an election year. So the callers are
pollsters, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing said: ``They just kept calling the house over and over
again ... What they do is start out with this spiel, `We just want
to ask you a few questions. It'll just take a few minutes time.'
And they talk so fast that you can't get a word in. And before you
can say boo, pretty soon the person starts rattling off questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed real clear to me that they were trying to figure out
how voters were feeling about some political issues ... When I
asked for information about who was sponsoring this _ I asked for
an address, a phone and a name _ I got hung up on. The second time,
I said, `Do not hang up on me. I want to talk to your supervisor.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This person put me on hold, and I eventually talked to his
supervisor. And this man who was the supervisor refused to give me
that information ... he explained to me that that's not public
information, and that he could not give it to me ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Well, that's interesting. You're going to bother
me in my home and ask my opinion, and you're not going to tell me
who you are.' ... And then that's when I thought, `Gee, there's
something wrong going on here.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I explained to Pershing. ``They never give you that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. They don't want you to know who's calling because
they're afraid that if you're an activist and you have a point of
view hostile to their candidate that you'll lie. You see, it's my
own personal belief that anybody, when contacted by a pollster, has
a duty to lie through his or her teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I say that is that too much of government is run by
polls and too much of the political process is dictated by polls.
You've got all these sniveling cowards in public office who're
afraid to act on the dictates of their consciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I think that everybody should lie on every single political
polling question.''
</P>
<P>
   And, you know, that really is the way to fix things. Politicians
are so attentive to polls for a perfectly rational reason. They're
tremendously effective mechanisms for measuring public sentiment at
a precise moment in time. Professionally conducted polls produce
remarkably accurate snapshots of public opinion at that moment.
Politicians well understand that you can obtain a snapshot like
that on a statewide or even a national basis with calls to maybe
800 people. It's relatively cheap, and the science is definitely
for real. This stuff works.
</P>
<P>
   Now you might not believe that. You might be one of those people
who sneer at poll results because you have never been called and/or
because you can't conceive that so few people could share your view
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   You are wrong, though. For evidence, just take a look at how
many political dollars are spent on this stuff _ and how many
commercial dollars, too, by companies doing market research.
</P>
<P>
   Lying to commercial pollsters would be a mistake _ unless, of
course, you want to see a lot of cars on the road with three
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   But lying to political pollsters? Hey, that's no mistake. That's
patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   And ethical, too. It's perfectly OK to lie in what you believe
to be a just cause, even under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Thats what the polls say, anyway.
</P>
<P>

HOUSE VOTES TO LAUNCH CLINTON IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ A divided House embarked Thursday on an American
odyssey, launching a full-scale investigation into whether
President Clinton should forfeit his office over charges he tried
to cover up his sexual affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic moment in presidential history, the House voted
258-176 to conduct an open-ended probe into Clinton's possible
impeachment, only the third such inquiry since the nation was
founded.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread concerns about the potential consequences for
the presidency, Congress and the country, 31 Democrats joined the
united Republican majority in approving the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an onerous, miserable, rotten duty, but we have to do it
or we break faith with the people who sent us here,'' said
Representative Henry J. Hyde, chairman of the House Judicicary
Committee, which will conduct the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get this behind us and behind the country and move
on,'' Hyde said near the end of a three-hour debate marked by
flourishes of impassioned eloquence, accusatory rhetoric and what
one lawmaker described as ``a cacophony of catcalls.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage of House Resolution 581, the first impeachment
inquiry approved by Congress since the Watergate crisis in 1974,
authorizes the Judiciary Committee to ``investigate fully and
completely whether sufficient grounds exist for the House of
Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach
William Jefferson Clinton, president of the United States of
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution places no limits on the scope of the inquiry,
although Hyde said he plans to focus on allegations involving
Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky unless other possibly
impeachable charges arise.
</P>
<P>
   By partisan turns, Republicans portrayed the resolution as the
framework for a solemn, constitutional review of Clinton's conduct,
while many Democrats assailed the plan as a prologue to a long,
lurid soap opera with a plot designed to drive the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the vote clears the way for high-profile
impeachment hearings, with Clinton and Lewinsky high on the list of
possible witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's aides immediately began planning the inquiry, saying they
expected to spend the next month conducting a separate review of
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigaton of Clinton.
They said they hoped to hasten the inquiry by reaching an agreement
with Democrats and Clinton's lawyers on accepting as many of
Starr's findings as possible as true.
</P>
<P>
   Committee investigators also are expected to interview many of
Starr's witnesses ``to see if they have changed their testimony,''
said Paul McNulty, the panel's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he will hold hearings after the Nov. 3 elections in
the hope of concluding the inquiry by Jan. 3, 1999, when the
impeachment resolution expires.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Democrats argued in vain to limit the inquiry's scope
to the Lewinsky matter and permit a full investigation only if the
Judiciary Committee first determined that the allegations meet the
standards for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all profoundly hurt by what the president has done,''
said House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri. ``He
has deeply disappointed the American people, and he has let us all
down. But this investigation must be ended fairly and quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected the Democratic proposal, 236-198, with every
Republican opposing the plan except for Representative Jay Dickey,
from Clinton's home state of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Democrats voted against their party's alternative, several
because they favored the GOP plan and others because they believe
Clinton's conduct does not warrant an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president betrayed his wife. He did not betray the
country. God help this nation if we fail to recognize the
difference.'' said Representative Robert Wexler, a Florida Democrat
who serves on the Judiciary Committee and supported the Democratic
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Democratic leaders had subtly lobbied House
Democrats to oppose the Republican-sponsored plan in an effort to
portray the inquiry as a partisan vendetta aimed at negating
Clinton's victory in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, the strategy is vital to his survival plan. But to
many rank-and-file Democrats, the effort is geared less to
protecting Clinton than to regaining control of the House in
November. Democrats need to pick up 11 seats to seize what they
lost four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With House Speaker Newt Gingrich presiding over the debate, his
fellow Georgian and Democratic foe, Representative John Lewis said,
``Republicans want to do what they could not do in the election,
defeat Bill Clinton. Well, the American people are watching. Beware
the wrath of the American people, Mr. Speaker. Beware.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the 31 Democrats who defected were fewer than the
White House had feared and Republicans had desired. ``I would have
liked 40,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Democratic defectors are Southern conservatives who
quickly abandoned Clinton over the Lewinsky spectacle. Others, such
as Representative James H. Maloney of Connecticut, are locked in
tight election races and feared they would be attacked as
apologists for Clinton if they did not support a full inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Still others were moderates from Midwestern states where
Clinton's popularity is flagging. ``There are states like
Massachusetts and New York that strongly support the president,''
said Representative Tim Roemer, an Indiana Democrat who voted for
the Republican-sponsored inquiry. ``But there are states like
Indiana and Nebraska that are deeply divided. The country needs a
full and fair inquiry so we can can start to move toward some kind
of healing.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most partisan moments of the debate, Democrats
accused Republicans of holding Clinton to a different standard from
Gingrich, who was reprimanded by the House and fined $300,000 last
year after he admitted providing the ethics committee inaccurate
information during its investigation of his political finances.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, reminded
Gingrich he received the reprimand shortly after the GOP majority
reelected him speaker last year. ``How inconsistent, Mr. Speaker,
for the same Republican majority to move to an impeachment inquiry
of the president for lying about his personal life,'' Pelosi said.
``We all agree that lying is wrong. But why the double standard?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At issue throughout the proceedings Thursday was a two-hour
limit on the debate. Democrats had asked for eight hours. But
Republicans, citing House rules that permitted only one hour for
debate on the special resolution, would agree only to the two-hour
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At one point, so many Democrats wanted to speak that 13 women
lined up at a microphone to ask, in the few seconds allowed, for
permission to insert their written comments into the Congresional
Record.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When several of the women tried to voice their views at the
microphone, they were shouted down by Republican members.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, lawmakers in both parties invoked the words
of dozens of American heroes, from Benjamin Franklin to Frankin D.
Roosevelt. And one member alluded to a setting from a work of
American fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Gary Ackerman, a New York Democrat, decried the
impeachment inquiry as a witch hunt by saying: ``Mr. Speaker, I
move that when the House adjourns, we do so to Salem, a quaint
village in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, whose history beckons
us thence.''

`FIREFLIGHT': A SOUP THAT BOILS BUT NEVER COOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever wonder what ``Jane Eyre'' might have been like if Charlotte
Bronte had watched too many soaps? Wonder no longer, because here
we have ``Firelight,'' a well-meaning, sufficiently well-acted but
ultimately lachrymose cross between chest-heaving Victorian
melodrama and ``As The World Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie aims for subtle eroticism but misses, mostly because
it's stuffed to the cheeks with woozy sentimentality. The whole
thing would be more affecting _ more romantic _ if it had, in the
end, less romance. How's that for irony?
</P>
<P>
   ``Firelight'' marks the directing debut of William Nicholson,
who penned the radiant script for ``Shadowlands'' (from his own
stage play) and has a proven affinity for eros. And there are
moments in this film that stand on their own as snapshots of
frustration or desire _ lovers who share a furtive caress, a child
who sits in a lonely lake house, a woman who gazes at her daughter
with distant maternal longing. But Nicholson gets tripped up by his
own itch for closure, shoving his lovers toward the finish line
while they're still tying their shoes at the start. The pair in
question are Elisabeth (Sophie Marceau, best known as the fiery
princess in ``Braveheart'') and Charles (Stephen Dillane, of
``Welcome to Sarajevo''), a promisingly ill-matched 19th-century
duo.
</P>
<P>
   Charles is the son of a decadent English lord (Joss Ackland) and
the husband of a comatose woman who's been out cold since a riding
accident early in their marriage. But Charles wants an heir, so he
arranges, anonymously, for a three-day tryst with the impoverished
Elisabeth and pays her for their baby.
</P>
<P>
   An infant girl arrives and departs, swept away by nurses. The
years pass. Elisabeth is haunted by the absent child. And although
Elisabeth hasn't a clue to Charles' identity or the whereabouts of
her daughter, she tracks them both down to an austere stone manse
in England, where the lost baby is now a bratty 7-year-old named
Louisa (Dominique Belcourt) with an indulgent father, a kind maiden
aunt (Lia Williams) and a silent lady staring at the ceiling in an
upstairs bedroom. Elisabeth becomes Louisa's governess, despite the
fact that Louisa is a spoiled snotnose who knows nothing about her
teacher's maternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're poor, I suppose,'' the kid fumes. ``I don't have to do
what you say.''
</P>
<P>
   Here the movie splits off into two directions: into ``Jane
Eyre'' territory (the wife in the attic), and into the land of the
von Trapp Family Singers, where obnoxious urchins need to be tamed
and clueless fathers need to be chided. Let's hear it for
wisenheimer governesses, particularly wisenheimer governesses who
inspire quivering lust in their employers.
</P>
<P>
   The main drawback to these and other plot turns is their
abruptness everything unfolds too quickly, too exaggeratedly, with
a score (by Christopher Gunning) that's far too heavy on bathetic
violins. Forbidden love is a fair subject, but forbidden love
pinned on bawling string solos and awkward dialogue (``I am not a
servant! I am a prisoner, just like you!,'' yelps Elisabeth to
Louisa, ripping into a speech on the oppression of women) is too
much of a not-so-good thing. And Nicholson chews too hard on the
title image, a reference to the ``magic time'' created in a room
lit solely by firelight. Explains Elisabeth: ``You can do what you
want, say what you want, be what you want.'' And the viewer thinks:
don't.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Anderson, who played the worldly priest in ABC's doomed
series ``Nothing Sacred,'' shows up as a pony-tailed American sheep
farmer who makes a flaccid stab at wooing Elisabeth. Like almost
everything else in the film, Anderson's character feels contrived,
a stock ingredient in a soup that boils but never cooks.

CELLUCCI HOLDS SMALL LEAD IN GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH   AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Acting Governor Paul Cellucci and Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger are locked in a tight race for governor, with
Cellucci holding a small lead but drawing strong support from swing
voters, a new Boston Globe/WBZ-TV poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, taken Tuesday and Wednesday, gives Cellucci a 46
percent to 40 percent lead with 10 percent undecided. It also shows
that his themes are working better with voters than those
Harshbarger has pushed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poll's finding that Harshbarger trails the Republican
incumbent by only a few percentage points should come as a boost to
the Democratic nominee, who has been off balance and on the
defensive in the first few weeks of the general election campaign.
Election Day is Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Harshbarger has struggled to overcome a
perception among even his supporters that he is slipping behind
Cellucci, a feeling accentuated by his poor showing in a debate on
Monday. The poll, done by KRC Communications Research of Newton,
has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news for Harshbarger is that despite a few bad weeks,
he is still in the hunt,'' said Gerry Chervinsky, president of KRC
Communications Research Inc., the Newton firm that conducted the
survey. The pollster said Harshbarger's continuing strength stems
from the fact that the state's voter registration is heavily
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   But Chervinsky said the numbers suggest Cellucci seems better
positioned to attract more support as the campaign progresses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cellucci holds a strong lead, 59 percent to 27
percent, among a key voting bloc, independents.
</P>
<P>
   Undecided voters, who make up 10 percent of the sample, also
tend to select Cellucci when asked to choose between the two on a
number of economic and fiscal issues.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 400 likely voters also suggests that Cellucci has
struck a chord with voters by making a no-new-tax pledge, which he
has taken and Harshbarger has declined, a central issue in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When respondents were told that Cellucci had taken the pledge
while Harshbarger had not, 44 percent said it made them more likely
to back Cellucci, compared to 20 percent who said the news made
them more inclined to support Harshbarger. Twenty-seven percent
said it had no impact.
</P>
<P>
   And among a smaller sample of independents, the issue played
even more strongly, with half of the respondents saying the
anti-tax issue made them more likely to vote for Cellucci, and only
12 percent saying Harshbarger's anti-pledge position would help win
their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to have gotten used to all the years of holding
the line on taxes,'' Chervinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Harshbarger's attempt to use his rival's switch of
position on several major issues over the years to paint him as
untrustworthy does not appear to move voters. Forty-nine percent
rejected that argument, while 24 percent agreed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harshbarger has scoffed at the notion that Cellucci
deserves any credit for the state's healthy economy _ something the
acting governor cites as a reason he should be elected _ likely
voters were more charitable.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four percent said Cellucci deserved all the credit he has
taken, with 15 percent saying he deserved more kudos than he has
claimed. Only 26 percent thought Cellucci had overstated his role
in the state's economic success.
</P>
<P>
   When voters were asked who they thought cared more about people
like them _ typically a question on which Democrats score well _ 39
percent chose Cellucci, and 34 percent said Harshbarger.
Significantly for Cellucci, among independents, he beats his
Democratic rival 48 percent to 21 percent on this question.
</P>
<P>
   One ominous sign for Harshbarger came among the 31 percent of
the sample who watched the first televised debate between the two
men on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Of that subsample, 47 percent said what they had seen in the
debate made them more likely to back Cellucci, while only 21
percent said the debate had pushed them toward Harshbarger. Two
more live televised debates are scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger can find comfort in two other findings. One is
that voters tend to &UR;  &LR; discount Cellucci's assertion that the
attorney general is a big-spending Democrat. Some 40 percent
rejected that charge, while 36 percent agreed with it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cellucci should not get much traction from his claims that
Massachusetts needs a Republican chief executive to keep the Beacon
Hill Democrats in check. Although 32 percent agree with that view,
35 percent said they would prefer an all-Democratic government and
24 percent said it would make no difference. Independents, however,
wanted divided government by a margin of 37 percent to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci is benefiting from Democrats who have broken with
Harshbarger to support him, as well as from the perception that
Harshbarger is getting only lukewarm support from some factions of
the Democratic Party. Among independents, 46 percent said that made
them more likely to vote for Cellucci, with 14 percent saying it
made them more inclined to vote for Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   During their Monday debate, Harshbarger, tired of Cellucci's
references to the Dukakis-era fiscal crisis, accused Cellucci of
trying to run against former governor Michael S. Dukakis. The new
poll suggests Cellucci's strategy might work.
</P>
<P>
   Although respondents split about evenly when asked whether they
recalled the Dukakis years negatively or positively, 35 percent
said their memory of that era made them more likely to vote for
Cellucci, compared with 18 percent who said it made them more
likely to back Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   On teacher testing, voters were slightly more inclined to
support Cellucci's position that a teacher who failed a competency
test should be fired, than Harshbarger's somewhat more lenient
stand, which would give them two chances to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six percent said that teachers who fail the test should be
fired, while 36 percent said they opposed firing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to identify the greatest problem facing them and their
families, 19 percent of those polled said education, 17 percent
taxes, 13 percent health care, and 10 percent crime.

IN THE BATTLE OF THE BUGS, `ANTZ' LEADS THE WAY IN COMPUTER
ANIMATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Antz,'' a new computer-animated movie, battle lines are
drawn between armies of ants and monstrous termites.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world of making such films, the battle lines are
between Pacific Data Images and Pixar.
</P>
<P>
   Both are computer-animation firms in Northern California, and
both are aligned with major studios: PDI with DreamWorks and Pixar
with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Both also have new insect films: PDI's ``Antz,'' out now, and
Pixar's ``A Bug's Life,'' due Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Their rank-and-file animators are probably too busy to worry
about competition. But their parent studios are big rivals _
perhaps even bitter ones.
</P>
<P>
   It all began at Disney, when Jeffrey Katzenberg was ousted as
production chief by company president Michael Eisner. Katzenberg
hit back by forming DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg and David
Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   That studio now has a traditional, hand-drawn animated film,
``The Prince of Egypt,'' ready to steal Disney's thunder during the
holiday season. It's due in theaters Dec. 18.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, bug wars _ and computer animation _ can mean big
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz'' opened at No. 1 last weekend, earning $17.2 million.
That's an all-time record for an October weekend, and industry
analysts expect Antz to become the highest-grossing non-Disney
animated film ever.
</P>
<P>
   As for critics, some believe that this second computer-animated
film has surpassed the first: 1995's ``Toy Story,'' from the
Richmond, Calif.-based Pixar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that sense that if you go back and look at `Toy
Story', it won't look the same, because we've raised the bar,''
said former Houstonian Eric Salituro, who works at PDI.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Antz,'' his job was lead technical director for production
and engineering, building software to bind elements together.
</P>
<P>
   Salituro doesn't think the two bug movies symbolize a war
between studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney vs. DreamWorks doesn't mean anything to us,'' he said.
``It may mean something to certain people at those companies, but
it's not what drives us.''
</P>
<P>
   PDI's Tim Johnson, who directed ``Antz'' with Eric Darnell,
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their rivalry doesn't carry over from our point of view down
in the trenches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just concentrate on making our movie. Folks on the upper
end may have a different story. But frankly, we've got lots of
friends and even people dating between the two companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said PDI's animators ``were not very conscious of `Toy
Story' while making `Antz,' which is not to say we weren't huge
fans. `Toy Story' opened a lot of doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But computer animation is a broad spectrum of looks and feels
and aesthetics, and we knew our story was different. The world of
insects is a very natural, organic world compared to that in `Toy
Story.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``A Bug's Life,'' ``We knew nothing about it, the story
or the look,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   No one seems sure who resolved to make a computer-animated bug
film first.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he conceived of such a film in 1991, when PDI was
focusing on graphics and commercials. In 1995 he pitched the idea
to the new DreamWorks.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Toy Story'' hit big that year, PDI got the green light.
</P>
<P>
   Although PDI was responsible for ``Antz's'' story and character
development, Katzenberg often provided input.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good at looking with fresh eyes,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It took 2 { years to make the movie. DreamWorks financed it,
thereby gaining 40 percent ownership of Palo Alto, Calif.-based
PDI.
</P>
<P>
   At the production's start, PDI had 80 employees. Now it has 240,
and 190 of them worked on ``Antz,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was part of that hiring surge,'' said Salituro, who lived in
Houston from 1982 until joining PDI in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Salituro graduated from Houston's Rice University in 1986 with a
degree in computer science, then worked at Rice for a decade,
mostly in the computer department.
</P>
<P>
   Salituro had been aware of PDI and other computer-animation
firms. When he heard about ``Antz,'' he applied and was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been at PDI for 10 years. Before ``Antz,'' he was
animation director on a Halloween program for ``The Simpsons,''
placing Homer Simpson in a three-dimensional, computer-animated
world.
</P>
<P>
   Creating computer animation starts with traditional methods:
drawings with pencil and paper.
</P>
<P>
   But these concepts are soon fed into computers, with characters,
backgrounds, movements and lighting programmed in intricate detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spend a long time just preparing,'' Johnson said. ``You
gradually work toward building this fantastic world on a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fun of animation: creating an entire world. It's
fun to take moviegoers someplace they've never been.''
</P>
<P>
   As in traditional animation, voices are recorded early in the
process. For ``Antz,'' the first actor cast was Woody Allen as
voice of Z, an ant who has adventures with a princess, voiced by
Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice actors were inspiring,'' Johnson said. ``We didn't
actually make the character look like Woody, but because of the
animators' ability to capture the essence of the voice, you end up
thinking these characters look a lot like the actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Since all of ``Antz's'' visual information is now programmed
into PDI computers, a sequel would be ``much simpler, cheaper and
faster to make,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You easily spend 50 percent of your time and money just
getting ready _ getting characters built into the system. There are
over 300 controls just to move Z's face, and somebody had to
program all that.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Antz'' has brought computer animation to new heights,
Johnson doesn't think it will take the place of traditional
animation, even though the latter sometimes uses computer-generated
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an animation purist,'' he said. ``Nothing will ever beat
the beauty and expressiveness of drawn animation.''
</P>
<P>
   PDI's next film will be ``Shrek,'' which is about a troll trying
to find his place in the world. Like ``Antz,'' Johnson believes it
will be a departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I knew what computer animation was,'' he said. ``But
`Antz' is entirely different.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge was humanizing the bugs' faces ``while
keeping them bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted the characters to have a lot of heart, which meant
they needed to be expressive in ways we're used to seeing faces be
expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether using computers or drawings, Salituro thinks the key to
success is in a strong story and talented artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got nothing to do with the technology,'' he said. ``None
of this is automatic. The heart of any animated movie still comes
down to animators creating. All the technology in the world can't
supply the heart.'' &QL;

STAR OF `BELOVED' IS BELOVED HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You know Oprah Winfrey. We all know her: She's
everyone's best buddy, the lady down the street with the warm-bread
voice and the infectious belly laugh. What's more, she knows we
know her _ she seems to understand that wherever she goes, she'll
be treated as a longtime friend. She is our crowned queen of
amiability.
</P>
<P>
   So when Winfrey breezed into Boston on a press tour for her new
film ``Beloved,'' she greeted reporters with an easy, unaffected
familiarity. She made eye contact. She memorized names. Articulate,
quick-witted, self-deprecating and smart, she answered questions
with candor and heat, discussing the film and the Toni Morrison
book on which it's based in impassioned bursts of talk. Here,
clearly, was a woman with zeal for her subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book spoke to me. The book deepened me in a way that I do
not have words to express,'' said Winfrey, wearing a simple brown
sweater with slacks. For ``Beloved,'' she earned two credits, one
as star (her first role in a feature film since ``The Color
Purple''), the other as a producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened me up to the experience, the humanity, of people who
every day reconstructed their lives and had the faith to love in
spite of their pasts. ... I wanted to create a movie where people
would feel the same thing. So when people come away feeling numbed,
they feel dumbfounded, staggered, they feel devastated,
overwhelmed, all of that _ I felt all of that when I read that
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jonathan Demme, ``Beloved'' examines the tortured
past and conflicted present of Sethe (Winfrey), an ex-slave haunted
by the ghost of her dead baby. When an old friend (Danny Glover)
becomes Sethe's lover, the apparition leaves. But the ghost
rematerializes in the form of an enigmatic young woman named
Beloved (Thandie Newton), and Sethe is forced to confront the past:
her life in slavery, her bloody escape and her role in the baby's
death. The story of Sethe and Beloved ``connects to all
experiences, all human experiences. The denial of your past, the
denial of your true existence, is the real death. To deny who you
really are is the real living death, and that's part of what Sethe
understood,'' Winfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past does have a life of its own ... and it will walk into
your house and sit at your table and call (itself) something else,
unless you're willing to look at it in truth. It just bleeds into
the future all the time. You can't deny it,'' she said. ``You can't
deny it. So free yourself. So free yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has championed a movie version of Morrison's book for
years, jumping through endless hoops in the search for the right
director. Demme, best known for ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and
``Philadelphia,'' was not her first or most obvious choice. She
considered foreign directors (``I thought: foreign ... sensitivity
...''), African-American directors, female directors. She even
asked Jodie Foster, who had written a thesis on the novel at Yale
and replied with ``a lovely `no' letter saying she didn't think it
could be on the screen _ that she thought this was a piece that
worked best as a piece of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   With razor timing, Winfrey stopped for a moment and smiled.
``She has changed her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those she interviewed was director Peter Weir, who
questioned Winfrey's ability to play the main character. Winfrey
was adamant: She told him she just needed to lose weight, that
Sethe ``is here, inside me somewhere.'' Weir suggested she give him
the rights to the book, ``and then we can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter in the group wryly noted the ``parade'' of directors
that had failed to make the cut. ``I never heard it described as a
parade,'' Winfrey replied, then started humming a spry little
circus tune. ``Peter Weeeirrrrr ... Jane Campionn

ROCK 'N' ROLL ROSE, RONNIE SPECTOR, BLOOMS AGAIN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the Spice Girls and Madonna, before Courtney Love and
Chrissie Hynde, before Diana Ross and the Supremes and Martha and
the Vandellas, there was Ronnie Spector.
</P>
<P>
   As the lead singer of the Ronettes, the ultimate girl group of
the early '60s, Spector defined a sound and a look that had a
profound influence on subsequent generations of female rockers. The
Ronettes' classic recordings with producer Phil Spector, who became
Ronnie's husband, include ``Be My Baby,'' ``Baby I Love You'' and
``Walking in the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Spector will be singing these songs and other favorites
Saturday at Compaq Center in Houston, when she appears with Three
Dog Night, Ben E. King, Jan &AMP; Dean and America in the 17th annual
Whataburger Lovin' Feelings concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing the oldies-but-goodies shows,'' she said. ``I do
six or seven a year. It keeps me rooted.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect her to run through abbreviated versions of her
hits, as is the case with so many oldies acts. She brings her own
band and puts on a real show, just like she does in the hippest
nightclubs in New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come to my shows, I give them their money's worth.
I don't do medleys. I do `Be My Baby' all the way through, maybe
even longer than the record, because that's what the people came to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Spector was a 12-year-old kid named Veronica Bennett when
she fell under the musical spell of Frankie Lymon &AMP; the Teenagers.
Lymon was only 13 himself, but he was already a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like a god to me,'' she said. ``He came to my 13th
birthday party. He lived just 10 blocks away from me in Spanish
Harlem. My mother was a waitress, and he used to come into the
restaurant where she worked. She told him she'd give him free
hamburgers if he came to my party.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Lymon's example, Ronnie put together a group with
her sister, Estelle Bennett, and their cousin Nedra Talley. The
group cut a couple of singles for the Colpix label, then Ronnie
became intrigued with a hot young producer from Philadelphia named
Phil Spector.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that song `Spanish Harlem' came out, I thought they wrote
it for me, because I was a rose in Spanish Harlem'' she said. ``I
said to my sister, `I'd like to meet that Phil Spector guy, who
wrote a song about me, and he doesn't even know me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Spector heard the Ronettes sing at the Peppermint Lounge
and signed them to his Philles label. His first single with the
group, ``Be My Baby,'' hit No. 2 in 1963. With its majestic ``wall
of sound'' production and Ronnie's sexy, yearning vocal (``for
every kiss you give me/I'll give you three ... ''), ``Be My Baby''
remains one of rock 'n' roll's most glorious moments.
</P>
<P>
   As successful as they were in the United States, the Ronettes
were even more popular in Great Britain. When they toured England,
the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds opened shows for them. The
Beatles, in preparation for their first American tour in 1964,
wanted the Ronettes to fly back across the ocean with them so they
all could get off the plane together in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil insisted that we come home a couple of days earlier,''
said Ronnie. ``Then, when the plane landed in New York, who gets
off the plane with them? Phil Spector. That's when I realized that
he wanted to be the star; he wanted all the credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ronnie and Phil fell madly in love.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was make love and make music,'' she said. ``We were
so much in love with each other. As a matter of fact, I think he
loved me a little bit too much. He didn't want me to be a star. He
wanted me to be his star alone.''
</P>
<P>
   After they married in 1968, Phil made Ronnie quit performing.
Except for a session with the Beatles, none of the recordings they
worked on together ever came out. As Phil's hit-making career
declined, he became ever more reclusive. Ronnie felt like a
prisoner in her own house. She left him in 1972, although it was
another two years before their divorce was final.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie attempted to resume her career, but the momentum was
gone. Still, her peers recognized her lasting contribution to rock
'n' roll. In 1976, Billy Joel wrote a tribute to her called ``Say
Goodbye to Hollywood,'' which she recorded with Bruce Springsteen's
E Street Band.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Ronnie recorded a hit duet with Eddie Money _ ``Take Me
Home Tonight'' _ that proved her voice had lost none of its
evocative power. She also made an unforgettable appearance in the
video for the song, which contained a strong echo of ``Be My
Baby.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 16 years, Ronnie has been happily married to her
manager, Jonathan Greenfield. They live in Connecticut with their
two teen-age children. A lengthy court case against Phil Spector
and Allen Klein, who manages the Spector song catalog, is nearing
its conclusion. Greenfield expects to receive some sort of
settlement for unpaid royalties and lost opportunities, although he
adds that ``it will never undo what's been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Spector documented her life before, during and after Phil
Spector in the book ``Be My Baby: How I Survived Mascara,
Miniskirts and Madness'' (Crown Publishers, 1991). Now, she's
looking forward to the release of her first new recordings in more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a long time, but I wanted to make sure I had the
right material and the right producers,'' she said. ``I wouldn't do
anything if it wasn't to my liking. I'd rather stay home and play
with my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   She has finished an EP-length recording for the British Creation
label, which boasts such contemporary artists as Oasis and the
Jesus and Mary Chain. The sessions were co-produced by Daniel Ray
and Joey Ramone and include covers of the Ramones' ``She Talks to
Rainbows'' and Johnny Thunders' ``You Can't Put Your Arms Around a
Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect to hear either song at Compaq Center. But there's
another cover Ronnie definitely plans on singing: the Beach Boys'
``Don't Worry, Baby''. Brian Wilson wrote the song for her
immediately after hearing ``Be My Baby,'' but Phil Spector refused
to let her sing it because he didn't control the publishing rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That song kept me alive during the time when I was divorcing
Phil,'' she said. ``I always loved Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys'
version of it. I'd come home from court and listen to those lyrics.
When it came time for me to make another record, I thought, I must
do `Don't Worry, Baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still a rose at 55, Ronnie Spector is finally free to pursue her
dreams of 30 or 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a real life now,'' she said. ``I'm a mother, and a
wife, and a performer in rock 'n' roll. And that's everything for
me.'' &QL;

NO COMPARISON BETWEEN NIXON AND THIS FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sword of impeachment, a deft instrument skillfully employed
in the surgical removal of the Nixon cancer 24 years ago, returned
as a clumsy mallet, a blunt, partisan tool wielded by smaller
people than the members of Congress who showed Nixon the door.
</P>
<P>
   History's wheel, grinding first as tragedy, then as farce, takes
another turn in the House of Representatives. The ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' of the Founding Fathers' high-minded framing of our
nation's laws are ratcheted down to the low conduct of Clinton and
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be a better word than ``squalid'' for Clinton's
entanglement and his trying to wriggle off the hook? And does not
``squalid'' also encompass the actions of the House in bringing
down upon our collective heads the totally unnecessary and
potentially disastrous consequences of this foolish partisan
overreaction?
</P>
<P>
   There is a different feel to this political dumb show compared
with the gravity, awe, and genuine sense of duty evident 24 years
ago, when the House last weighed impeaching a president. I covered
the House Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry in 1974 for the
Globe. Both the process and the politicians of both parties
participating were several cuts above this present pathetic
performance in preelection propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Peter Rodino, Speaker Carl Albert, and majority leader
Tip O'Neill were fair and sincere in their respect for
bipartisanship. That's what convinced the Republicans, then in the
minority, that the process was fair. The fact that six of the 17
GOP members voted to recommend impeachment was what sealed Nixon's
deserved doom. But it was the courting of the Republicans and
Southern Democrats whose constitutents sympathized with Nixon that
carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Henry Hyde does not demonstrate sufficient independence
from Speaker Gingrich to merit similar respect across the aisle.
This is a far more partisan House under rule-or-ruin Gingrich. Bill
Cohen, the present secretary of defense, was a young lawyer from
Bangor, Maine, in those days, a junior House member, but eloquent
in sizing up the stakes and then voting to take down his party's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's crimes, concluded Cohen then, ``raise the specter of an
American `Gulag Archipelago,''' a reference to the just-published
revelation of Soviet labor camps by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. ``The
rattle of the chains that can bind up our own Constitution can be
heard,'' said Cohen 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with Henry ``Homewrecker'' Hyde's dismissing
revelations of his extramarital dalliance with a married mother of
three as ``a youthful indiscretion'' committed when he was in his
40s and you get an idea of how the debate has deteriorated. The
process then was too important for politics of a low order. But not
so now. Twenty-five days in advance of elections for Congress and
state offices, the Republicans slash at Clinton's neck. The
process? It reeks of partisanship and cheap electioneering. The
fact that the nation's newspapers do not denounce such
grandstanding is due principally to their role in profiting from
the president's embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Editorialists pose as high-minded moral arbiters safeguarding
the tender ears of the nation's young while sales depend on
stuffing each edition with more prurience slicked up as news. In
the Department of Hypocrisy, the media pack takes the cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's committee, stacked to vote impeachment, dumped the
now-infamous Starr report on the public without even reading it.
The committee's ``deliberations'' are a joke. The House vote is a
mere formality.
</P>
<P>
   It all gets real the morning after the congressional elections
are tallied. If the Democrats lose, say, only half the 44 seats the
party of the White House typically loses in the sixth year of an
administration, the GOP brass will conclude that the public wants
this charade to end. But if the GOP picks up enough Senate seats to
make the upper chamber filibuster-proof (60), or if Gingrich wins a
heady addition of 30 to 50 congressmen, a two-thirds vote to
impeach Clinton in the Senate becomes a real possibility, though
perhaps still not a probability.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to dynamite Clinton's fingers off the Oval Office
door jambs. I cannot conceive of this political survivor yielding
to his enemies over an unconsummated romantic dalliance that
stopped short of intercourse. It is ludicrous that it got even this
far. But the mendacity of the Republicans, the timidity of the
Democrats, the stupidity of Clinton, the incompetence of his
lawyers and handlers, and the rapacity of the news media combined
to land us where we are.
</P>
<P>
   I remain convinced that Clinton will be neither impeached nor
forced to resign. His job approval ratings are around 60 percent.
In July 1974 Nixon's job approval rating in the Gallup poll: 24
percent. That is a huge differential. Every poll shows that a
majority of Americans do not want Clinton removed via impeachment.
But in '74, Gallup's number had 47 percent saying Nixon should be
ousted as opposed to 34 who said no. Absent that kind of sentiment,
this week's House action is purely an exercise in preelection
posturing for political gain.

MAIL SERVER PROVIDES A SAFE HOME FOR E-MAIL WHEN COMPUTER'S DOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Where does e-mail go that I get when my computer is off? Do
those little guys hang out in a room somewhere until I turn it back
on and somebody yells ``Showtime!''? And how long can you leave
your computer off before your e-mails get tired and go home? If
someone trashed an old computer, seems like spam would pile up
until it covered the world.
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, your speculation about what happens with your first
question is not bad. Except the ``little guys'' aren't waiting on
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   When someone sends you an e-mail, it travels across the Internet
and lands on a computer at your Internet service provider. That
computer, called the mail server, is designed to receive, sort and
then dispatch incoming mail. You can think of it as a kind of
digital mail room.
</P>
<P>
   When you log on to the Net through your provider and launch your
e-mail software, it sends a message to the mail server requesting
that it deliver all your unread mail. The server checks your
in-box, finds your mail and sends it to your system.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a direct connection to the Net, it's possible for
you to run your own mail server on your computer, so that e-mail is
sent directly to your machine. But this setup is rare for most home
users.
</P>
<P>
   As to your second question, the answer depends on how your
Internet provider has configured the mail server.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, unretrieved e-mail is removed after a specific
period of time. In other cases, it may be removed when your in-box
on the mail server gets too full. Or, there may be a combination of
the two. In that case, older messages go first.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just started getting into computers, so forgive me if this
question is too basic. But what's Windows NT? Do I want it instead
of Windows 98, which is what came on my first computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. To paraphrase an old joke: If you have to ask what Windows NT
is, you don't need it.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances are you're going to get it, eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Windows NT is Microsoft's industrial-strength operating system.
It's aimed at businesses and those users who require a
crash-resistant, high-security system that runs over a network.
</P>
<P>
   Windows NT is not a good choice for the home user, particularly
someone who is new to computers. It doesn't run older programs _
particularly MS-DOS software _ very well. It lacks many of the
features that make Windows 95 and 98 relatively friendly, most
notably Plug and Play _ the ability to install new hardware and
have the system recognize it. Trying to get Windows NT _ even 4.0,
the latest version _ to recognize a sound card can be a Herculean
feat.
</P>
<P>
   That will change soon. Shortly after the release of Windows NT
5.0, which is scheduled for early next year, Microsoft will merge
the underlying architecture of NT and the Windows 9x series of
operating systems. You'll then have Windows NT for Business and
Windows NT for Consumers. They'll share the same internal
structure, but with different features for home and work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have installed Windows 95 and created the start-up disk.
Can you tell me what command to type in at the A: prompt when you
want to reboot using the start-up disk?
</P>
<P>
   A. No command is necessary. Just insert the disk into your
floppy drive and leave it in there when you reboot your computer,
or power it down and fire it back up.
</P>
<P>
   When a PC begins the boot-up process, it first checks the floppy
drive for the operating system. If it doesn't find it on the
floppy, then it moves to the hard drive. If you've got a floppy
disk in place with the OS on it, it will boot from there. You need
to do nothing else.
</P>
<P>

help. Send e-mail to dwight.silverman at chron.com &QL;

ASSAULT ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Far from laying claim to fairness in the Boston Fire
Department, a handful of angry white people would rather torch the
city with wasted emotion, pour ignorance over the flame, and howl
in celebration as the ashes of progress waft into the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the City Council held a hearing on affirmative action.
The hearing was called by the council's president, James Kelly, who
is already immortalized as a foe of school busing in South Boston
in the 1970s. Kelly has contended that thousands of white police
and fire candidates have been passed over for jobs by people of
color who have lower test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of unfair treatment to people who take the
test, pass it, but because of their race they are being denied the
opportunity,'' Kelly has said. Kelly's view is shared by Councilor
Peggy Davis-Mullen. She has said, ``There are poor white males that
are not being hired anymore in the traditional jobs they are
looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those bearing kerosene is Larry Mackin. Mackin, a white
man, claimed he was rejected several times by the Fire Department
throughout the late 1970s and '80s despite having high civil
service test scores, including a 100 in one case.
</P>
<P>
   Mackin sued all the way up to the Supreme Court. But whatever
meritocracy Mackin thought should be in place in Boston, the court
did not see the merits of his own case.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative court, which has already badly singed
affirmative action, declined to hear Mackin. Mackin's bitterness
has driven him to claim, fatuously: ``I have really been able to
see how the marchers in the civil rights movement must have felt,
being American citizens and being denied.''
</P>
<P>
   For all their flame and fuel, for all their access to city
statistics, these angry white souls have no hard evidence of a
wholesale denial of opportunity to white people.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action has lifted the percentage of Boston
firefighters of color from less than 1 percent in 1968 to 29
percent today. But white firefighters still make up 71 percent of
the force in a city that is now 56 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   Mackin cannot point to wholesale denial even in his own family.
Two of his brothers have made the force. More important, several
studies have torn apart the implication by Mackin, Kelly, and
Davis-Mullen that test scores should be the highest proof of a
candidate's qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   Last year a study published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association found that 94 percent of medical school
students of color admitted under affirmative action graduate from
the University of California at Davis. That is nearly equal to the
97 percent graduation rate of rest of the student body.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action students received fewer A's than regular
admissions students, but once graduated, 82 percent of both
affirmative action graduates and regular admissions graduates
completed their postgraduate residency training. Affirmative action
graduates received nearly the same percentage of honors evaluations
in residency as graduates from regular admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time they had completed residency,'' the study said,
``the practice characteristics of the two populations were nearly
identical.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study of corporate affirmative action in Atlanta, Boston,
Detroit, and Los Angeles by two Michigan State University
economists found that African-Americans entered the work force with
an average of one year less schooling than white colleagues at
identical jobs. But African-American men hired under affirmative
action received performance ratings equal to white men and
African-American women actually earned job performance ratings that
were slightly higher than for white women.
</P>
<P>
   Authors Harry Holzer and David Neumark said that while critics
of affirmative action may choose to focus narrowly in the fact that
African-Americans often enter jobs with less educational
qualifications, the study revealed a more profound truth. They
found that ``ultimately, the most important measure'' of job
qualification is ``job performance.'' Once hired, they said, ``Our
results suggest that most women and minorities hired under
affirmative action make up in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle of people of color to make up ground lost to racism
is lost on Kelly, Davis-Mullen, and Mackin. Given the history of
Police and Fire Department hiring, affirmative action is the only
known way to assure fairness. Kelly and company have been curiously
slow to suggest that white performance on fire and police tests may
have less to do with native intelligence and potential for bravery
than the benefits of growing up in insular white neighborhoods
where it was assumed that police and fire jobs could be handed down
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Boston could not stop Kelly from holding his hearings. It can
stop him from doing what he wants. Kelly, Davis-Mullen, and Mackin
hold a torch lit only with grumbles of white superiority and
accusations of black inferiority. A Boston that does not care to
rekindle its inflamed past should douse this arson squad with a
fire brigade of facts.

DIRECT BUYING PUTS PC MAKERS ON ALERT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buying a PC for the home used to be so simple. You walked into
an overcrowded electronics or computer store, dealt with a
salesperson who may or may not know more than you about computers,
settled for what's in stock and then hoped you could get it home in
the back seat of your compact car.
</P>
<P>
   Today, you can still have that _ ahem! _ thrilling shopping
experience, or you can buy your PC direct from the manufacturer: by
phone or over the Internet. Increasingly, those who've owned their
first or second PCs are buying direct, a trend that has alarmed
computer makers who push their goods through retailers.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the traditional PC manufacturers _ Compaq, IBM,
Hewlett-Packard, NEC/Packard Bell _ are adopting the tricks of the
direct trade. You can buy some of their systems online, and in some
cases they've set up kiosks in stores for direct ordering. Buyers
pick the features they want and the custom-built PCs are shipped
directly to their homes. No more cramming 17-inch monitors into the
back seat of a Chevy Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two high-end PCs, each sold using some form of
direct marketing. One's from a traditional PC company, and the
other's from the most non-traditional computer maker around.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Enthusiast 2 _ $2,863, iDot.com. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You knew this was destined to happen. With the success of
businesses like CDNow and Amazon.com _ which sell music and books
on the Web, respectively _ someone was bound to start a Web-only
PC-sales operation. And iDot.com is it, at www.idot.com.
</P>
<P>
   Austin-based iDot sells PCs built out of brand-name components
and aims them at knowledgeable computer users. The company targets
gamers, computing enthusiasts, home/- &QL; 
small office buyers and students. It offers base configurations for
each of these niches, which a buyer can tweak online at will.
</P>
<P>
   I tried the Enthusiast 2 model, which comes with a 450-megahertz
Pentium II chip, 128 megabytes of memory, a 10-gigabyte hard drive,
a 40X CD-ROM drive, a 56K fax modem, 3-D audio, Advent speakers
with a subwoofer, a 19-inch monitor and an Intel i740 AGP graphics
card. I upgraded the video by replacing that with an 8-MB Matrox
Millenium G200 card, and added a 12-MB Voodoo2 graphics card for
3-D games.
</P>
<P>
   The iDot system arrived with some problems, some of which were
easily solved. Others I'm still living with.
</P>
<P>
   The video card, for example, was not seated properly so the
system wouldn't even boot up when I first turned it on. At first I
thought the system was dead on arrival, but reinserting the card
was the easy fix.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I discovered that if connected to America Online via
dial-up, the computer rebooted when I signed off. I downloaded new
modem drivers, but now I'm having difficulty dialing in to my
Internet provider. I can get through, but it takes several tries
before the Lucent fax modem connects.
</P>
<P>
   (In general, I've had problems with Lucent modems, which are
used in other brands of computers. iDot offers a 3Com 56K fax modem
as an option, and it's one worth taking.)
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this is a slick, fast machine. Its zippiness has a
lot to do with its massive amount of high-speed memory and its
snappy hard drive, which spins at 7,200 revolutions per minute.
Like most systems sold direct, there is very little in the way of
glitzy add-ons to slow it down. It comes with Windows 98, some
games on CD _ you install 'em yourself _ and that's about it. It's
an excellent game system, particularly with the Voodoo2 card
installed.
</P>
<P>
   If you want top speed, want to be able to design your own system
and already have the software you need to be productive _ or have
fun _ then iDot's PCs are worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Presario 5600 _ $2,499, Compaq Computer Corp. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can buy this high-powered Presario, which just bristles with
bells and whistles, either at Compaq's Web site or in a store. At
those retailers who are participating in Compaq's Built-for-You
program, you can configure one and have it shipped to your door.
</P>
<P>
   The 5600 series is Compaq's attempt to compete with direct PC
sellers. Many of its components, such as the modem and the video
card, can be easily replaced, and the internal design is greatly
simplified. When you open it up, there's lots of room to work
inside and plenty of free expansion slots.
</P>
<P>
   The 5600 I tried had a 450-Mhz Pentium II chip, 128 MB of
memory, a 16.8-GB hard drive, 3-D sound, a 56K Rockwell fax modem,
a DVD-ROM drive, a built-in Ethernet connection, an ATI Rage Pro LT
video card and an internal Iomega Zip drive. The price quoted here
doesn't include a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Presarios, it comes with a keyboard with four buttons
that take you to various Web sites. While the software that
configures the buttons is easier to use than its initial version,
it's still not quite simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a speedy computer, but it lags behind the iDot
because its hard drive is not as fast. I added a 12-MB Voodoo2 card
to this system, and it ran demanding 3D games without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Presario is a good choice if you're interested in working
with digital video. It includes a Firewire connector _ also known
as IEEE 1394 _ which lets it link up with newer video and audio
components. It also has video-out jacks so you can plug it into a
TV set _ particularly handy given that this computer has a DVD
drive.
</P>
<P>
   While the hardware in this system may be streamlined, Compaq
continues to make the software environment a messy place. There are
too many programs that run in the background, including one that
checks an Internet server for software upgrades and the
Internet-button controller. Fortunately, if you want a cleaner
system, you can disable these. In computing, simpler is almost
always better.

PRESIDENT CAN ONLY HOPE FOR SPEED, FAIRNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He has lived for years in a universe of independent
counsels, grand jury investigations, sexual harassment suits and
criminal task forces, but at no point in the presidency of Bill
Clinton has he faced a threat to his survival as dire and
unpredictable as this, aides and allies conceded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, mostly grimfaced, Thursday issued a personal plea for
an impeachment inquiry that will be fair and fast, telling
reporters after the vote, ``It is not in my hands. It is in the
hands of Congress and the people of this country, ultimately in the
hands of God.''
</P>
<P>
   As his fate is now left to others, Clinton is characterized by a
complex emotional mix of frustration and relief, friends said. He
is at once infuriated that congressional Republicans insist on
making -- quite literally -- a federal case out of his affair with
Monica Lewinsky and his subsequent efforts to deny and conceal it.
But he has appeared unburdened by his dramatic series of public
confessions these last two months, his mood, his psyche, lightened
by his admissions of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were in his shoes and walk by a TV set and see `House
Impeachment Vote,' that's unsettling,'' said Doug Sosnik, a White
House counselor who spends considerable time with Clinton. ``How
could it not be? A person has to be weird not to be unsettled by
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on another level, anyone in his situation would feel much
more liberated,'' Sosnik added. ``No one is carrying around the
secret anymore and wondering if today's the day it comes out. For
months, everyone's been chasing rumors, and now we know what we're
dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself seemed to echo that sentiment Thursday, offering
reporters a small smile at a Cabinet Room photo opportunity and
saying, ``Personally, I am fine. I have surrendered this. This is
beyond my control. I trust the American people. They almost always
get it right, and have for 220 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, White House officials have taken to repeating the
mantra that Clinton will not be impeached, almost as if they are
trying to will their words into reality. The public is behind them,
the officials say, and in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority
is needed for removal and the Democrats now hold 45 seats, simple
arithmetic points to his survival.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the emotion and the fear and the unprecedented nature of
their predicament, Clinton and his aides have tried to cobble
together a strategy that takes him back to his most successful
roots as a moderate policymaker scratching at issues crucial to
everyday Americans, like health care reform and the minimum wage.
The idea, some aides said, is to position the president as a voice
of reason amid what they will portray as an inquiry propelled by
partisanship that could stretch well into next year.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Thursday's House roll call which launched the
full full impeachment inquiry, White House officials began looking
towards the next crucial vote -- the November 3 congressional
elections -- as the key to the president's future.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strategists have already mapped three potential
scenarios: A Republican landslide, which would embolden the GOP
leadership and could prove ruinous to Clinton; a Democratic
comeback, which would serve as some vindication and may inspire a
GOP retreat from impeachment to a compromise outcome, like a
censure vote. The third possibility, and perhaps the most likely,
is an election day result somewhere between the two extremes,
providing a muddled message for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will assume his role as the policymaker immediately;
indeed, it is the posture he has adopted from the day last month
that he reluctantly conceded to an improper relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky. Thursday, he began with a declaration that the
most important item on his agenda is the passage of a federal
budget that will preserve the surplus to protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working in a way that I hope will restore their trust in
me by working for the things that our country needs,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Clinton will immerse himself into the business of
state, pondering possible NATO-sanctioned bombing runs in Kosovo
and brokering a potentially breakthrough summit on Thursday between
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestine leader
Yasser Arafat on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were president, I would get the focus on the issues, get
out and campaign for candidates,'' said Representative Martin
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat and a member of the Judiciary
Committee. ``I would take his arguments directly to the American
people. The republican members of the Judiciary Committee will all
vote for impeachment. The only thing that can change that is
Democratic victories in November.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House plans to heed the advice. For the next month,
Clinton will make at least one campaign trip a week, including a
visit next week to Miami where he will highlight his plan to reform
the Social Security system, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote was a political event 26 days before the election,''
said Ann Lewis, Clinton's communications director. ``This was their
only campaign strategy to crowd issues off the front page. They
don't care about you. They want to play their own games, and all
the while the president will talk about issues that people care
about.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides predict a volatile election period, followed
by the hearings -- whose tenor and outcome it seems too early to
predict. If Democrats hold their own in the elections and lose
fewer than a dozen House seats and just a Senate seat or two, the
nature of the inquiry remains unclear. Should the GOP gain
significant numbers of seats in both chambers, they will likely
seek to broaden their investigation to encompass Whitewater and the
wholesale firing of the White House travel office. Conversely,
almost any Democratic gains at all will signal to Republicans to
retreat from the probe.
</P>
<P>
   In November, as the Judiciary Committee convenes a hearing,
Clinton is due to fly off to Asia for a protracted trip, including
stops at an economic summit in Malaysia during which the worldwide
financial crisis will be the dominant issue, followed by likely
stops in South Korea and Japan, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday season, White House officials said they plan
to follow their script from years past and make little news while
huddling to put together an agenda for the State of the Union
address in January. Some aides are already conceding that the House
will vote for an impeachment, leaving the president's fate in the
hands of the Senate and a possible policy agenda early next year
obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House will come back and we go through a 60-day, America
held hostage hearing on impeachment,'' said one senior White House
adviser. ``It rolls down the track toward the Senate, and depending
on the appetite, the Senate will take it up and he will not be
impeached and America will scream to get on with life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, for now, is left to plead for brevity and impartiality.
``I hope that we can now move forward with this process in a way
that is fair, that is constitutional and that is timely,'' he said.
``The American people have been through a lot on this, and I think
that everyone deserves that.''

LIBRARY SNARES A VAST COLLECTION ON THE `ROUGH RIDER'

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The chair, wide of girth and squat of stature,
seems a good fit for its famous occupant, Theodore Roosevelt, who
described his strength as that of a bull moose.
</P>
<P>
   The dark stain on the chair's curved ladder back has been rubbed
off down to the golden oak's natural grain, presumably by the
kinetic energy of the man known as ``The Rough Rider.'' Similarly,
the rush seat apparently took plenty of abuse and is tattered and
sagging.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the chair from all sides within inches of its carved
legs and low-slung muscularity, the sensation is magical.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine the 26th president of the United States summoned
back to life. With a slap of his brawny knee, a flourish of his
spectacles and a ``Bully!'' muttered from beneath his walrus
mustache, you can picture Roosevelt launching his fireplug frame
out of the chair and lighting out for another adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bit of a spar,'' perhaps, as TR liked to call military
battles.
</P>
<P>
   As politician, writer, naturalist, hunter, war hero and rugged
adventurer, everything about Teddy Roosevelt was outsize, and so is
the chair and the collection where it now resides, in its new home,
the New York State Library in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The State Library paid a private collector $200,000 _ a record
amount for a single collection acquisition in the state's history _
for this Roosevelt collection, which contained an estimated 300,000
items ranging, including books, letters, photographs, campaign
buttons, official papers and teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Library has wanted to have this collection for a
long time because of the tremendous importance of Teddy Roosevelt
to New York state,'' State Librarian Janet Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   The only other public collections to rival it are TR's personal
archives at Harvard University and his presidential papers at the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill, near Oyster Bay, N.Y., is a
historic site, but does not contain much in the way of manuscript
material.
</P>
<P>
   Born Oct. 27, 1858, in New York City, Roosevelt was elected at
age 23 to the state Legislature in Albany, where he built a
reputation as a blunt-spoken, reform-minded Republican. Roosevelt's
swagger is captured in an 1892 oil painting by William Bengough
titled ``New York State Senate'' that hangs today outside the
Senate floor in the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of immense popularity for leading the Rough Riders
in the battle for Cuba's San Juan Hill in 1898, Roosevelt was
elected governor of New York later that year.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief stay at the governor's mansion, TR wrote the
book ``Rough Riders'' and was a dynamo of legislative and literary
output.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt won election to the vice presidency under William
McKinley in 1900. McKinley was assassinated on Sept. 14, 1901 in
Buffalo. Roosevelt, who was hiking in the Adirondack High Peaks at
the time, rushed to Buffalo, where he was sworn in as president at
age 42 _ the youngest to hold that office.
</P>
<P>
   The collection came to the State Library only after years of
gentle coaxing of Lyall Squair, a Syracuse collector known far and
wide as a TR omnivore.
</P>
<P>
   Squair, 68, a retired librarian, decided it was time to part
with the tonnage of a four-decade obsession that threatened to
overtake his large home near the Syracuse University campus.
Besides, his wife needed more room for her doll collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squair's entire living room, the bedrooms, a study, the
basement, every inch of his house was crammed with TR material,''
said James Corsaro, associate librarian and special collections
expert for the State Library.
</P>
<P>
   Corsaro hauled away four vanloads packed tight with TR stuff and
Squair's Syracuse house still wasn't completely emptied of
Teddydom.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bargain, Squair threw in dozens of boxes of
material for free, Corsaro said, appraised at tens of thousands of
dollars. Squair turned down lucrative offers from dealers and
collectors and refused to sell his TR collection piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   Squair typed his own catalog to the collection. Its 21 sections
run to more than 200 pages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every item has a story. Take the chair, for instance. TR brought
it to use when he visited his sister, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson,
at her home _ Henderson House, also known as Cruger Mansion _ in
Jordanville. ``I got the chair at auction near Jordanville many
years ago,'' Squair said. ``I paid $850 for it and outbid members
of the Roosevelt family.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a large bronze bust of TR by the sculptor James Fraser
that once dominated Squair's living room. ``I got that out of
Fraser's studio in Connecticut,'' Squair said.
</P>
<P>
   Squair was a relentless TR tracker. It took him a decade, for
instance, to run down a 1902 limited edition, specially bound
volume by TR titled ``The Deer Family.'' There were just 100 copies
of TR's biological study of deer, and Squair snared No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Books were where Squair's TR obsession began. As a library
science student at Syracuse University, Squair picked up a copy of
``The Life of Theodore Roosevelt,'' by William Draper Lewish, that
his wife, Linda, had picked up for a dime at a church rummage sale.
``I read it, got interested in TR, followed the bibliography to
other books and kept going,'' said Squair, who made his first
purchases in 1960. ``The next thing I knew, I had a whole house
full of TR books.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt was a prolific writer whose published books number in
the dozens, along with hundreds of essays and articles. ``Squair
collected not only every book by TR, but every edition, along with
every book with an introduction or foreword by TR, as well as every
biography and history book about TR,'' Corsaro said. The books
alone in the collection total thousands of volumes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many notable books, including a poetry collection
titled ``Sea and Shore.'' TR gave it to his sister as a Christmas
present in 1874. An inscription penned in a light, controlled
cursive reads: ``To Corinne from her brother. Thee Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Squair's catholic collecting habits can be seen in odd items of
tangential interest: a half-dozen different bottles of TR barbecue
sauce, thousands of TR postcards, TR china and TR beer trays, even
a bag of jasmine incense sticks (``Carry A Big Stick'') that
purport to burn for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The list of teddy bears _ named for Roosevelt _ and teddy bear
accoutrements goes on for pages. There are never-before-published
letters, glass negatives and photographs of TR, as well.

SUPPORTERS PUSH EFFORT FOR CONTRACEPTIVE REFUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Armed with a threat of a Senate filibuster and the
pledge of White House support, backers of a measure to provide
federal workers with insurance coverage for prescription
contraceptives braced Thursday for another round in what has been
an unexpectedly tough fight for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, threatened Thursday to
hold up the Treasury Department spending bill and tie up the Senate
with a filibuster unless the contraceptive-coverage amendment,
which was dropped from the bill on Tuesday, gets reattached.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the administration
favored the measure and pledged to ``continue to make the fight for
this provision'' in negotiations with Congress over a host of
appropriations bills that will probably be rolled into one large
spending package to fund the federal government through the next
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The contraceptive-coverage amendment passed with bipartisan
support in the House and Senate this summer. But on Tuesday, GOP
leaders abruptly dropped it from the fiscal 1999 Treasury-Postal
spending bill, saying it was one of several measures blocking the
bill's passage. The House passed the stripped-down spending bill on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the measure, which would extend insurance coverage
to an estimated 2 million federal workers, were furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is just outrageous the way the Republican
leadership bowed to its extreme right wing and thwarted the will of
the people,'' said Kate Michelman, president of the National
Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, a private group.
``It makes me wonder what kind of democratic process we really have
when something like this can happen in the dead of night.''
</P>
<P>
   The contraceptive-coverage amendment has become a lightning rod
for antiabortion groups, lawmakers, and the US Catholic Conference.
The opponents argued heatedly Thursday that most prescription
contraceptives are abortifacients, or abortion-inducing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ecstatic. We didn't expect Congress to show the courage
to take this language out,'' said Judie Brown, president of the
American Life League, an antiabortion group. ``We have been working
for over a year to prove that prescription contraceptives have
nothing to do with a woman's health and well-being but are
recreational drugs that prevent fertilization and abort children.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's-rights activists say they took advantage of the
agreement by some insurers to pay for the impotence drug Viagra to
press the issue of contraceptive coverage. Groups such as Planned
Parenthood for years have complained that women are shortchanged
because half of all private insurers do not pay for the Pill and
other prescription contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to mandate the benefit for federal workers who are
covered for other prescriptions was aimed at getting private health
plans to provide substantially more coverage for contraceptives,
backers said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Nita Lowey, a New York Democrat who authored the
House version of the amendment, said Thursday that she was
optimistic about its prospects because White House officials
assured her `they would stand very firm for it'' in ongoing
spending-bill negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Campanella, a spokewoman for Reid, said Senate leaders had
delayed debate on the Treasury spending bill Thursday ``to see if
they could work something out'' and avoid a filibuster. The most
likely outcome, she said, is that the Treasury bill will be rolled
into the omnibus spending package, with the contraceptive-coverage
amendment attached.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who handled the Treasury spending bill insisted they
had not killed the amendment to punish Democrats who favored it,
but were fighting an unrelated GOP-backed provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good example of what happens when a spending bill
gets bogged down with too many pet items,'' said a spokeswoman for
the House Appropriations Committee. ``The leadership did what it
had to do to get this train out of the station.''

the cockpit and run for his life _ knowing all the while that it
was just a drill. Glenn, who made history Feb. 20, 1962 as the
first American to orbit Earth, was aboard the shuttle with six
crewmates at least 31 years his junior for a full dress rehearsal
of the scheduled Oct. 29 liftoff that will mark his return to
space. There was no fuel in the shuttle's rocket engines. (700

BROWN HAS MADE HIS PITCH; CAN ATLANTA? 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Had a great history teacher once. He had many
wonderful expressions, but one of his favorites to describe the
inexplicably woebegone state of once haughty powers was this: ``Oh,
how the mighty have fallen!''
</P>
<P>
   A. Graham Down was a Brit whose knowledge of American sport was
pretty much confined to an awareness that Joe Louis had once packed
a tremendous punch. But those of us whose business it is to monitor
the game of baseball might be inclined to adopt A. Graham's maxim
in reference to the Atlanta Braves, who have just lost the first
two games of a rather important playoff series at home.
</P>
<P>
   They dropped the opener of the National League Championship
Series, 3-2, in the wee small hours Thursday morning, and they
dropped the second game, 3-0, Thursday night. Let's just say that
the 42d anniversary of Don Larsen's perfect game will not be a
featured day on any Atlanta Braves calendar.
</P>
<P>
   It now falls to the $10 million man to rescue the proud
perennial rulers of whatever division the ever-changing National
League sees fit to insert them in. Greg Maddux gets the start in
San Diego Saturday, and if he can't beat Sterling Hitchcock, the
Braves can start thinking about tee times and vacation itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Hitchcock lived up to his first name with 11 strikeouts in
six-plus innings last time out against Randy Johnson and the
Houston Astros. But if he is aptly named, then what can we say
about Kevin Brown? Should his name be Cy? Christy? Grover
Cleveland? Sandy? Zeus?
</P>
<P>
   Right now he is the best pitcher in baseball, at least among
those whose teams are still playing. He's not going to win the Cy
Young Award, which will go to either Thursday night's rival, Tom
Glavine, or teammate Trevor Hoffman. He doesn't have the historic
reputation of Mr. Maddux, or even the Big Unit. But at the moment,
Kevin Brown is the towering figure in the 1998 postseason. He is
compiling the most intimidating postseason resume since Orel
Hershiser pitched the Dodgers to the 1988 title.
</P>
<P>
   In three 1998 postseason starts, he is 2-0. He has given up
seven hits and one run in 23 2/3 innings. They always said he had
``nasty'' stuff. Now he is more than just nasty. He has become
ruthless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great start in Houston (when he struck out 16 in
eight innings) and he had great stuff tonight,'' said San Diego
manager Bruce Bochy. ``He is as tough as any pitcher in baseball.
He is as great a competitor as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   You really can't pitch a whole lot better in the circumstance
than he did Thursday night, when he threw a three-hit shutout
during which the Braves hit exactly one (1) ball hard, that being a
390-foot fly to the center-field fence off the bat of Chipper Jones
in the sixth, when it was still a 1-0 game. The three hits were
singles, none distinguished. He walked three, fanned 11, and was in
trouble only once.
</P>
<P>
   The closest Atlanta came to scoring was in the fourth, when a
single, walk, and wild pitch put men on second and third. But Brown
got Javy lopez on a routine fly, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped himself with two hits (love that National League
ball), figuring in both scoring innings. No radio or TV station had
to look too far in order to find what a more sports-minded A.
Graham Down might refer to as the Man of the Match.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves always count on their superb starting pitching to be
their trump card in all matters, but once you get to the
postseason, you discover that the Other Guy often has pretty good
starting pitching, too. John Smoltz didn't pitch a bad game
Wednesday night/Thursday morning, and Glavine didn't pitch a bad
game Thursday night, either. The two combined to surrender three
runs in 13 innings. Not bad. But not good enough, either. As good
as Messrs. Smoltz and Glavine were, Andy Ashby and Kevin Brown were
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought both our guys pitched brilliant games,'' sighed a
glum-looking Braves manager Bobby Cox. ``But their two guys did,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   When pitching is this good, it is often difficult to dissect
individual hitters. But it is increasingly obvious that Atlanta has
some major offensive problems, which, if not solved immediately
(i.e., by Saturday afternoon), will result in an embarrassingly
abrupt ending to another routinely fine Braves season (106 wins).
The Braves need something from cleanup man Andres Galarraga, for
example. The Big Cat hasn't hit a home run since Sept. 7, and his
lack of production is killing the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In vivid contrast to the Red Sox' woes during the Cleveland
series, just about all the damage done by the Braves this
postseason has been done by the bottom four spots in the order. The
only RBI among the top four is a solo homer by Chipper Jones.
Leadoff man Walt Weiss is in a complete fog, and you've got to
wonder how long Cox can stay with him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, be careful. Don't assume the Braves are dead.
Any reasonable person likes their chances in the next two pitching
matchups (Maddux vs. Hitchcock and Denny Neagle vs. Joey Hamilton).
This is a team that came from 3-1 down two years ago to defeat St.
Louis. Baseball is not really a momentum sport. It is, and always
will be, an execution sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have enough veteran players to be aware of this, and
in case anyone is unclear on the matter, Bochy will be only too
happy to remind him. ``We know it's the best of seven,'' Bochy
said. ``We know there is a lot of baseball left. It was nice to
take two here, but we have to go home and keep playing the same
kind of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Saturday's game is everything to the Braves, and they
have the acclaimed Mr. Maddux going. If they lose that one, then
OK, feel free to quote my esteemed history mentor. Until then, the
mighty haven't fallen. They've just stumbled.

DRESS UP A TABLE SETTING WITH ANTIQUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. _ Setting a beautiful table can be half
the fun of creating a great dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest book, ``Modern Antiques for the Table'' (Viking,
240 pages, $39.95), author Sheila Chefetz takes the novice and
seasoned collector through the paces of gracious table settings
with tableware antiques from about 1890 to 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``An empty table is like a blank canvas awaiting the touch of
the painter's brush,'' Chefetz said in a recent interview at her
store that specializes in table settings, The Country Dining Room,
in Great Barrington, Mass. ``Don't forget that many of the great
hostesses often spent days supervising the setting of their tables
with hundreds of pieces from their fabled tableware collections.
You can too, by using your imagination and an artistic eye. You
don't need to be an heiress or a great decorator to dine with
antique tableware.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how Chefetz coordinates different settings, she
mixes several periods in her book. For one setting, she combines
glass Art Nouveau celery vases as flower vases and a mix of silver
and ivorine flatware, solid yellow basket-weave scallop-edge plates
and a Chintz coffee set in yellow, green, orange and white.
</P>
<P>
   You better shop around. Chefetz advised the best way to add to
your existing table settings is to shop around at garage sales,
auctions, antiques shops and specialty stores, where you can find a
myriad of buys, from a separate set of salad plates to cups and
saucers and serving pieces. Mixing and matching is what makes a
table interesting and come to life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the popularity of Chefetz's first book, published in
1993, ``Antiques for the Table,'' that inspired her latest book. It
depicted memorable table settings for every occasion using 18th-,
19th- and 20th-century china, glass and silver, along with the
history of each piece and customs for using them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Modern Antiques for the Table,'' Chefetz covers the four
principals of modern design _ Art Nouveau, Arts &AMP; Crafts, Beaux
Arts and Art Deco. She does so through two cities she considered to
be the ``pulse points'' of America: Detroit for its industry, and
Los Angeles for its fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good design can harmonize with and enhance well-designed
tablewares of any era,'' Chefetz said. ``Never try to re-create
history, but rather bring your own personality to the mix to create
a melange of your favorite accessories and table service.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefetz suggests thinking about setting a dinner table in the
same way one would accessorize a model. This is a comparison
Chefetz has had firsthand experience with, having been a fashion
director for Gimbles in New York City years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make the dress stand out, you need the right jewelry, shoes
and purse,'' she said. ``Setting the table utilizes the same
principal. A friend once told me that silver is a table's or a
room's jewelry. An outfit is never complete without jewelry. Silver
and jewelry provides the glow or shine to make other things stand
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do, don't be afraid to mix and match,'' Chefetz
said. ``A table setting should always be a mix of the unexpected to
create a conversation piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefetz said that the best route to table setting is to start
with what you have or like to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always best to bring a few pieces of your table service
with you when shopping,'' she said. ``You should also bring a
sample of your wall color, paper or fabric and measure the space on
the table that you plan to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In English porcelain dinner sets, dating up to the 1920s, there
were always separate dessert services, according to Chefetz, as
well as separate sets for breakfast, fish courses, tea and coffee.
The latter two, were more or less an American invention, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really early set of fine china, for middle- to upper-class
homes, would never have had bread-and-butter plates,'' Chefetz
said. ``An early set would have had a set of crescent-shaped dishes
in which to discard fish or meat bones from your dinner plate.
People are buying these crescent-shaped dishes today and using them
as salad plates. Demitasse cups are perfect for serving sorbet.''
</P>
<P>
   Early sets of china also came without matching cups and saucers.
There would be a separate dessert set that was placed after all of
the dinner dishes were removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to mix teacups, as many of the decorative ones tell a
little story,'' Chefetz said. ``These can start as low as $20 to
$30 and up to the $200 range for one cup and saucer. It's easy to
start a set of your own by carefully mixing color and designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tea also required its own service. The small plates that
accompanied a tea service were for sweets or finger sandwiches.
``Today, these make very nice plates for salad, which Americans
serve as a first course,'' Chefetz said. ``Tea and dessert services
were always more decorative than the dinner plates, to show off the
dessert. It's always nice to pre-set and start with the prettier
plate, because that's what people see first.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Modern Antiques for the Table,'' Chefetz notes that the
beauty of china made during the Arts &AMP; Crafts period, is in its
subdued patterning. That allows it to mix with contemporary pieces
without fear of clashing. Its predominantly subtle colors work well
with today's tableware, affording an opportunity to combine the
best of the old with the new.
</P>
<P>
   Antique silver and glass are also able to meld well with
contemporary settings, Chefetz said.
</P>
<P>
   The richly decorated silver from the Arts &AMP; Crafts period can be
used for a special dinner party or be interspersed with new pieces
for a Sunday brunch or luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   The rich colors that were used in stained glass windows and
showed up in the table glass of the period are particularly
appealing, Chefetz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, what could be lovelier than a luncheon table set with
Depression-era glasses of pink and green, maybe set off with a
centerpiece of complementary roses?'' she said. ``The mix and match
possibilities are endless, and Depression glass still remains
well-priced, making it particularly attractive to young people with
a lifelong love of collecting vintage glass. You see many of
America's greatest financial titans choosing reproductions for
their American manor homes, because of the new pride in
machine-made goods.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1920s, Arts &AMP; Crafts and Art Nouveau gave way to the
modern look of Art Deco. Exotic designs associated with Art Deco
were lavishly used on both tables and decorative glass by almost
all of the major china, silver and glass manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   As styles changed and more and more women entered the work
world, fine china, crystal and silver flatware were commonly left
in their cases and cabinets. These ornate and delicate settings
were replaced by the more functional and gaily colored plates made
of Bakelite (the first synthetic plastic, developed in 1907) and
Depression glassware.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variety of plates changes as each decade progresses,''
Chefetz said. ``For instance, the geometry of some of the china
made during the 1920s and '30s was so it was possible to wedge
pieces together to conserve needed space in the trunk or rumble
seat of the Model T car. Many china companies responded to the rage
for traveling by car by designing attractive breakfast, bachelor,
tete-a-tete, or tea-for-two sets that were easily packed.''
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of services were made for travel by public and private
train cars and water on yachts and passenger steam ships. Chefetz
said these pieces make wonderful accents.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the holidays at hand, it's great fun to search for
holiday motifs on tableware,'' Chefetz writes in her new book.
``There is an abundance of turkeys, evergreens, rabbits, cherubs
and reindeer to be found on tableware made between 1880 and 1940.
... Pine cones were particularly popular during the Arts and Crafts
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be argued that for a table to be truly spectacular, it
must be placed in a truly spectacular setting _ and yet, a
thoughtfully planned table, lovingly set with treasured heirlooms,
is very much a world unto itself, much like a stage set, conjuring
up an exotic ambiance that transcends even the plainest environs,''
she added.

VA. TECH LEAVES BC HIGH AND DRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tom O'Brien knew the deluge was coming. The Boston
College football coach had the television in his office tuned all
week to the Weather Channel. With each update, the forecast for
Thursday night's game against Virginia Tech grew more ominous: 100
percent chance of rain. Sheets of rain. Torrents of rain.
</P>
<P>
   What O'Brien never figured was that his team would be inundated
by a deluge of turnovers (three interceptions, including one for an
85-yard touchdown, a questionable fumble, and two blocked punts), a
blown goal-line scoring opportunity in the third quarter, and, oh
yes, Virginia Tech's defense, a force of nature that lived up to
its billing as the best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when BC would have been better off suiting up Doug
Flutie and Mike Ruth instead of retiring their numbers at halftime,
the Eagles put a damper on the festivities by suffering a 17-0 Big
East loss to the 17th-ranked Hokies in an ESPN matchup before an
Alumni Stadium crowd of 37,628.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's defense, which has not yielded a rushing
touchdown this season, dealt BC _ owner of the conference's most
potent offense _ its first blanking since a 21-0 loss at Navy in
1980. It was BC's first shutout loss at home since 1972, a 10-0
setback against Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   One bit of BC consolation: The Hokies (5-0, overall, 3-0 Big
East) were roughed up by senior running back Mike Cloud, who
carried 32 times for 186 yards, including a long of 65 yards. They
were gaudy numbers when you consider Virginia Tech's rushing
defense was allowing just 58 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think we need to build an ark,'' said O'Brien,
managing a weak smile and a weaker quip in his postgame remarks.
``It was a tough night out there. I think that Virginia Tech did a
great job. They're a great defense. They cause so many problems
with their quickness. Obviously, throwing a couple of
interceptions, they returned one for a touchdown, that's a killer.
I think that our defense played well. They, for the most part, gave
us an opportunity to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was BC's offense, senior quarterback Scott Mutryn in
particular, that wound up costing the Eagles. Mutryn (10 for 20,
116 yards) was sacked three times and committed four costly errors
when he threw three interceptions _ one that Pierson Prioleau
returned for an 85-yard touchdown that gave the Hokies a 7-0 lead
in the first quarter _ and fumbled a wet ball on a critical
fourth-and-goal play from the Virginia Tech 1.
</P>
<P>
   On the latter play, Mutryn regained possession but was dropped
for an 11-yard loss by defensive end Corey Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key moment of the game came when it's 14-0 and
we're on the 1-inch line and can't get in,'' O'Brien said. ``You
put the ball in the end zone there and it's 14-7, and who knows
what's going to happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn, who fumbled on second and goal as well, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to get into the end zone there and we didn't, and
that's totally on me,'' he said. ``That's two quarterback sneaks
we've got to get in there, and that fourth-down play, that's my
fault, too. We've got to punch that ball in there. It's
disappointing for me to come out and play as poorly as I did. It
really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   It nullified a valiant effort by BC's defense, which held
Virginia Tech's sputtering offense to 236 yards total (72 passing)
and forced six turnovers (four fumbles, two interceptions).
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries, Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer started
his third quarterback in as many conference games _ redshirt
sophomore Nick Sorensen, who served as Al Clark's backup last
season before switching to free safety. Sorensen was pressed into
service in a 27-7 victory at Pittsburgh two weeks ago when
sophomore backup Dave Meyer suffered a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've ever been around a game where there were
more big plays,'' Beamer said. ``They've got a great offensive
line, but we have some guys who are fighting their heart out.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to muster much offense, the Hokies relied on their
special teams to come up with their second touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Davis blocked a Jason Malecki punt at the Virginia Tech 48
and recovered for the Hokies at the BC 16 in the third quarter.
Four plays later, Lamont Pegues crashed in from the 2, giving
Virginia Tech a 14-0 lead with 6:23 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles threatened on their next drive when Cloud ripped off
a 65-yard run before he was dragged down from behind by Loren
Johnson at the Virginia Tech 23. Two plays later, Cloud had BC
knocking on the door when he carried for a 10-yard gain to the 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was right there; I should've got in,'' Cloud said. ``But a
guy from the back side came and clamped down on my legs and I
couldn't get enough drive to punch it in.''
</P>
<P>
   There the Hokies stymied the Eagles, including the last-gasp
play that was supposed to be a play-action pass to Cloud in the
right flat until Mutryn mishandled the ball.
</P>
<P>
   After the teams exchanged possessions, the Hokies converted
another BC turnover into an easy score. Ricky Hall recovered a
muffed punt by Jermaine Walker, who appeared to regain possession
when he stripped the ball from Hall's hands. However, officials
ruled the play dead when Hall recovered at the BC 18.
</P>
<P>
   Shayne Graham, who missed a 26-yard chip shot wide left in the
first quarter, put the game out of reach when he tacked on a
29-yard field goal with 8:38 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we played extremely hard and I think it's a great
measuring stick for where we are,'' said O'Brien, whose team now
must prepare for a visit from Syracuse a week from Saturday. ``We
can compete. As long as we stay healthy and we don't turn the
football over and do some of the things that I think we can, we can
be a heck of a football team.''

CLOUD IS SILVER LINING FOR BC 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You almost had no reason to watch it. No one watches a
game with 10 fumbles and five interceptions if they can help it.
And don't forget the rain. There were times you looked out at the
Alumni Stadium field and wondered if someone were dishing out
buckets of water, just like they do during those fake torrential
rain scenes in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   No, you had almost no reason to watch Boston College's 17-0 loss
to Virginia Tech Thursday night. Almost no reason.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Grier was watching. A few seats away from him, Bill Polian
was watching, too. These men make their living by evaluating
football players for the Patriots and Colts. So they were here to
see what players on either team possibly could help them in the
NFL. Sometimes professional football observers can make you dizzy
with their breakdown of the game. It is as if they are saying,
``This is why I get paid for this and you don't.'' But then there
are days when all football fans are equal, days when you all look
at a player and simply say, ``He's very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier said that Thursday night about Mike Cloud. Polian said it.
More than 37,000 people probably said it a few times as they peered
through raincoats and watched Cloud run for 186 yards on 32
carries. That performance would have been impressive enough on a
normal day. But when a ball is constantly sloshed through water and
you have to carry against one of the fastest defenses in the
country, falling 14 yards short of 200 is other-worldly.
</P>
<P>
   This is all fitting, isn't it? On a night when BC coach Tom
O'Brien said he was watching the Weather Channel to see what was
coming next; and on a night when you swore you could hear countless
echoes of Johnny Gill's baritone on ``Can You Stand The Rain,'' a
young man named Cloud ran through the rain. That doesn't
necessarily blunt the pain of BC's first home shutout loss since
1972. And it won't stop the skeptics from saying that the Eagles
can count on only two more wins this season (Pittsburgh and Navy).
It also didn't make O'Brien sleep any easier knowing that his team
was inches from a touchdown, had four shots to get in the end zone,
and didn't do it. But even O'Brien, an ex-Marine who doesn't throw
around praise easily, had to give Cloud his props.
</P>
<P>
   Long after the stadium had cleared, O'Brien approached Cloud as
he was doing an interview. ``I thought he was going to yell at me
or something,'' Cloud said. ``I thought I had done something
wrong.'' Not at all. O'Brien touched Cloud on the shoulder and held
out his hand. ``Good job,'' the coach said. ``That was a hell of a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was right. BC has a huge offensive line, a line whose
members told Cloud before the season that they wanted to see him
get 2,000 yards. They are a talented line, but you have to be a
very good back to break 2,000. Cloud is very good. You could argue
that every great runner is motivated by something powerful,
something that flashes across his mental screen each time he
touches the ball. Cloud is no exception. The BC athletic department
lists him as 5 feet 11 inches and 201 pounds. The weight is not in
question. But Cloud goes somewhere between 5-9 and 5-10 (maybe) in
bare feet. But he runs hard for many reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One is his brother, Kevin. A few years ago, Kevin Cloud broke
three vertebrae in his neck and had bone chips in his spinal cord.
That ended Kevin's football career. Now he has an academic
scholarship at the University of Hartford ``and has a 3.9
grade-point average,'' a smiling Mike Cloud said. Mike used to
idolize Walter Payton and wear No. 34 because of him. But when
Kevin was injured, he switched to his current No. 21 and began to
have even more respect for his brother.
</P>
<P>
   You could also point to Cloud's studies. He is the ultimate
student-athlete. He already has a degree in sociology and is
currently working on one in marketing. ``I'd like to take the money
I make in the NFL and use it to open my own business,'' he said.
``A nightclub-restaurant. Something laid-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud's mention of the NFL is not unrealistic. ``He's a good
back; there are no two ways about it,'' Polian said Thursday night.
``These aren't the best conditions to be running in, but he's doing
a great job.'' Grier, the man who drafted Curtis Martin and Robert
Edwards, also was intrigued by Cloud. ``I've seen him a few times
now,'' Grier said. ``He's a good back.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were a few downers. Cloud did have one of those
10 fumbles (he recovered it). And personnel men get kind of antsy
when they see an offense drive inches from an opponent's goal
without coming away with a touchdown. But that's just nitpicking
when you compare Cloud's 186 yards to the frequent bobbles and
fumbles going around the rest of the field. It wasn't fun to watch.
A man named John Valente at least helped make it a listenable game.
Announcing play-by-play in the press box, Valente unleashed a
Seinfeldian ``Hello, Newman'' after a fumble recovery by BC
linebacker Adam Newman. A few people laughed. They had to. It was
almost better than the alternative, which was watching.
</P>
<P>
   Almost better. That's because Mike Cloud was in the building,
carrying the ball over and over. BC may not be good enough to go to
a bowl this year. But the Eagles are worth watching as long as
Cloud is running.

STAR OF `BELOVED' IS BELOVED HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You know Oprah Winfrey. We all know her: She's
everyone's best buddy, the lady down the street with the warm-bread
voice and the infectious belly laugh. What's more, she knows we
know her _ she seems to understand that wherever she goes, she'll
be treated as a longtime friend. She is our crowned queen of
amiability.
</P>
<P>
   So when Winfrey breezed into Boston on a press tour for her new
film ``Beloved,'' she greeted reporters with an easy, unaffected
familiarity. She made eye contact. She memorized names. Articulate,
quick-witted, self-deprecating and smart, she answered questions
with candor and heat, discussing the film and the Toni Morrison
book on which it's based in impassioned bursts of talk. Here,
clearly, was a woman with zeal for her subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book spoke to me. The book deepened me in a way that I do
not have words to express,'' said Winfrey, wearing a simple brown
sweater with slacks. For ``Beloved,'' she earned two credits, one
as star (her first role in a feature film since ``The Color
Purple''), the other as a producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened me up to the experience, the humanity, of people who
every day reconstructed their lives and had the faith to love in
spite of their pasts. ... I wanted to create a movie where people
would feel the same thing. So when people come away feeling numbed,
they feel dumbfounded, staggered, they feel devastated,
overwhelmed, all of that _ I felt all of that when I read that
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jonathan Demme, ``Beloved'' examines the tortured
past and conflicted present of Sethe (Winfrey), an ex-slave haunted
by the ghost of her dead baby. When an old friend (Danny Glover)
becomes Sethe's lover, the apparition leaves. But the ghost
rematerializes in the form of an enigmatic young woman named
Beloved (Thandie Newton), and Sethe is forced to confront the past:
her life in slavery, her bloody escape and her role in the baby's
death. The story of Sethe and Beloved ``connects to all
experiences, all human experiences. The denial of your past, the
denial of your true existence, is the real death. To deny who you
really are is the real living death, and that's part of what Sethe
understood,'' Winfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past does have a life of its own ... and it will walk into
your house and sit at your table and call (itself) something else,
unless you're willing to look at it in truth. It just bleeds into
the future all the time. You can't deny it,'' she said. ``You can't
deny it. So free yourself. So free yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has championed a movie version of Morrison's book for
years, jumping through endless hoops in the search for the right
director. Demme, best known for ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and
``Philadelphia,'' was not her first or most obvious choice. She
considered foreign directors (``I thought: foreign ... sensitivity
...''), African-American directors, female directors. She even
asked Jodie Foster, who had written a thesis on the novel at Yale
and replied with ``a lovely `no' letter saying she didn't think it
could be on the screen _ that she thought this was a piece that
worked best as a piece of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   With razor timing, Winfrey stopped for a moment and smiled.
``She has changed her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those she interviewed was director Peter Weir, who
questioned Winfrey's ability to play the main character. Winfrey
was adamant: She told him she just needed to lose weight, that
Sethe ``is here, inside me somewhere.'' Weir suggested she give him
the rights to the book, ``and then we can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter in the group wryly noted the ``parade'' of directors
that had failed to make the cut. ``I never heard it described as a
parade,'' Winfrey replied, then started humming a spry little
circus tune. ``Peter Weeeirrrrr ... Jane Campionn

FLUTIE'S NUMBER IS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They have a special place for their awards.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie, he of the fabled Hail Mary pass that beat Miami,
47-45, the day after Thanksgiving 14 years ago, has a spot in the
front room of his home with lighting focusing on the 1984 Heisman
Trophy he won as the nation's finest college football player.
</P>
<P>
   And Mike Ruth has created a space of honor in the middle of his
recreation room for the 1985 Outland Trophy he earned as the
nation's best lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Now the two Boston College legends have something else. At
halftime of Thursday night's game against Virginia Tech, their
uniform numbers _ Flutie's 22 and Ruth's 68 _ were retired. They
took their place on the Wall of Fame at Alumni Stadium, next to
those of Mike Holovak, Charlie O'Rourke, Luke Urban, and Tony
Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was recruited by Boston College, I was told that BC
hadn't gone to a bowl game in 40 years but that we had a 5-10
player who would bring us to another one, and he brought us to
three bowl games in a row,'' said former nose guard Ruth, noting
that Flutie was that player.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman and The Pass have stood the test of time,'' Flutie
said. ``And this will stand the test of time. It's something that I
can be proud of the rest of my life. This is a great achievement,
what BC is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flutie gang's last bowl was the best _ the 1985 Cotton, in
which BC belted Houston, 45-28. The other postseason trips ended in
losses _ to Auburn in the 1982 Tangerine Bowl, 33-26, and to Notre
Dame in the 1983 Liberty Bowl, 19-18.
</P>
<P>
   Before that run, BC hadn't been to a bowl game since the 1943
Orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now people can look at the wall and you get a great feel as to
who 22 and 68 were,'' said Flutie, the Buffalo Bills reserve
quarterback who had two teammates with him for the trip. ``Fame is
fleeting, and this is something that will last forever, including
with the guys who played with me, like Gerard Phelan (who caught
the TD pass against Miami).''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie is still playing football, 14 years after leaving
college. Many of the young fans in the stadium Thursday night were
just 4 or 5 years old when Flutie was performing his exploits at
the Heights, but they saluted him vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the only Division 1-A offer, and I thought I'd take
advantage of the university,'' Flutie said. ``I didn't have any
expectations of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   All Flutie and Ruth have to do now is point to their numbers.
They will be up there forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my wife, Judy, here with my two kids,'' said Ruth, ``and
they can see the wall, and I can lose all my hair and I now have a
pot belly, but the numbers on the wall will last for a long, long
time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Prime time at the Heights. Prime-time national
television exposure. Reporters from USA Today and the New York
Times. Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino on hand. All the attention
focused on Boston College athletics.
</P>
<P>
   And not a scandal or controversy in sight. No talk of
point-shaving or gambling. No disgruntled coaches or players. No
harried BC officials attemping to put a positive spin on a negative
story.
</P>
<P>
   How refreshing. If progress is best measured in tiny steps, then
what happened at Alumni Stadium Thursday night must be considered
significant at the very least.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, consider the crowd of 37,628 who came to watch a
game _ available on television _ on a miserable evening in a
driving rain.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time certainly in the memory of the current senior
class, the focus on the Eagle football program was directed at was
happening on the field, not off it.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday night's ESPN special against Virginia Tech, the
Eagles were in the spotlight for all the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it was not classic football. Not with all those
turnovers hampering the offenses. And nothing more than bragging
rights in the Big East was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   You have to understand where the BC program was two years ago to
appreciate Thursday night. Saddled with losses, embarrassed by a
gambling scandal that put the football program on the nightly news
and ultimately brought down coach Dan Henning and his staff, the
Eagles were in the most negative situation imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's negative _ a sloppy 17-0 loss to No. 17
Virginia Tech _ was frustrating for coach Tom O'Brien and his staff
since all of the Hokies' points were almost direct gifts from
turnovers deep in Eagle territory. But it pales in comparison to
events of a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's team might have taken something positive out of that
kind of loss.
</P>
<P>
   These Eagles have gotten past the point of moral victories.
Forget about how BC basically outplayed Tech all evening, shutting
down the Hokie offense and moving the ball fairly well itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles were genuinely angry that they lost because they knew
that were it not for the turnovers, they had a chance _ a good
chance _ to win. Such was not the case two weeks ago when
Louisville simply blew the Eagle defense off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Two blocked punts, three interceptions, one fumble, and a
failure to score with a first and goal on the opponent's 1-yard
line will make all but the very best teams losers on any given
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our chances,'' said O'Brien, who now must put his
team's pysche back together in the 10 days remaining before
Syracuse comes to town. ``But I think this shows we can compete.
It's a measuring stick where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   For Virginia Tech, which has been a Big East and quasi-national
power for several years, it was just another step along the highway
to what coach Frank Beamer hopes will be a spot in the Bowl
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   But for the Eagles, it was something different. The memory of
the stain caused by the gambling scandal two years ago is fading
fast. O'Brien, who surely has the Eagles headed in the right
direction despite their second loss in succession, has brought
stability and pride to a program that needed them as much as any in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake about it _ lots of people are rooting for
O'Brien and BC.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Fiesta Bowl (and insight.com Bowl) head man John Junker
about the Eagles and you hear a plea for them to get bowl-eligible
sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to have BC,'' said Junker the other day from his
Phoenix office. ``They would be a very attractive team.''
</P>
<P>
   Junker was speaking about the insight.com Bowl, which will
select the third-place (or choice) team from the Big East for the
game in Tucson Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Junker also knows that the Eagles still have a rough road to
reach the six-win minimum requirement for bowl eligibility and the
seven wins likely necesssary to play in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   But it's obvious that BC _ which Thursday night unveiled some of
its past greatness, honoring former stars Mike Ruth and Doug Flutie
_ is in demand again.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Eagles' program is still fragile. They have
barely reached the stage where they can beat the teams they are
supposed to beat, much less pull off an upset of a nationally
ranked team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our growing process as a football team,'' O'Brien
said. ``We'll get better. And we'll play our hearts out against
Syracuse.''
</P>
<P>
   And after that come Navy, Miami, Notre Dame, Pitt, and West
Virginia, none of them _ with the possible exception of Navy _
anything close to a sure W.
</P>
<P>
   To become bowl-eligible and get to Tucson over the Christmas
holidays will take some luck as well as skill.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's loss will make finishing above .500 a struggle
_ the Eagles will need to pull off some major upsets to do it.
</P>
<P>
   But even if this turns into another sub-.500 season, it seems
clear that the Eagles under O'Brien are flying north, not south.

PADRES DOUBLE UP BRAVES

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can the nightmare be recurring for the Atlanta Braves?
They are the acknowledged class of the National League, playing for
the pennant a record seventh straight time. But they are on the
verge of being denied a chance to advance to the World Series for a
second straight year by a nemesis named Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Brown beat the Braves twice in the NL Championship
Series for the Florida Marlins, who eventually won the World Series
with a team that was almost immediately disbanded for financial
reasons. Now Brown has chance to inflict damage on the Braves while
representing the opposite coast. And that's just what he did
Thursday night, hurling a three-hitter, striking out 11, and
getting hits that figured in both scoring rallies as the San Diego
Padres silenced the Braves, 3-0, and seized a 2-0 advantage in the
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on to San Diego for three games, with Brown looming
like a thunderclap in Game 5, if necessary. Maybe by then, the
Braves will have figured out a way to get to him, because they sure
haven't so far. In his career against Atlanta, Brown is 6-0 with a
1.85 ERA; in the playoffs, he's 3-0, 2.63.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after Ken Caminiti's 10th-inning homer won
the rain-delayed opener, 3-2, Braves hitters again struggled.
</P>
<P>
   They mustered only three singles, an output Brown nearly matched
by himself. Tom Glavine, the NL's only 20-game winner, allowed just
one run in six innings but wound up throwing 121 pitches and
issuing six walks to go with six strikeouts. That is not a
blueprint for beating Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying like crazy to win a ballgame,'' said Braves
manager Bobby Cox, ``and we just couldn't hit the guy. I don't know
if any team would have hit him tonight. The Houston team has as
good a hitting lineup as there is in the National League, and they
couldn't touch him'' _ when Brown struck out 16 Astros in the
opener of last week's Division Series. ``We have a good-hitting
lineup and we couldn't, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown wasn't as sharp as he had been in throttling the Astros,
but then again, that's comparing degrees of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I had quite the stuff I had that night,'' said
Brown. ``But from the standpoint of just making adjustments as the
game went along and trying to use what was working at that moment,
I was pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Braves are a team that can hurt you from top to bottom.
You've got to minimize your mistakes against them. I think I threw
everything at them but the kitchen sink.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had, that probably would have been a strike, too. It was
one of those nights for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he made just one mistake _ and that was while running
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an idiot,'' he said about being nailed at third in the
sixth inning after an overthrow following a single by Quilvio Veras
that brought in San Diego's first run _ the only one Brown needed.
``I misread the play. I thought the throw home got further past
him. Glavine picked it up and threw me out. Obviously, it was
misjudgement on my part. It could have cost us the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. The Padres come to life each time Brown pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Brown is as tough a competitor as I've ever seen,'' said
manager Bruce Bochy. ``He's just locked in. When you have somebody
like Kevin Brown, it gives you a tremendous sense of confidence.
When he's out there, you feel you're going to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Kevin would make a difference in our club. But I didn't
think he'd make this big an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   He got the support he needed on Veras's hit _ one of three he
had for the night _ which followed base hits by Chris Gomez and
Brown, ground balls all.
</P>
<P>
   For insurance, the Padres scored two in the ninth off lefthander
Odalis Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was in the middle of this rally, too. After a leadoff
single, he moved to second on Veras's single. Atlanta tried to pick
him off second, but the throw by catcher Javy Lopez went into
center field and Brown wound up on third. From there, he scored on
an infield single by Steve Finley. Wally Joyner's bases-loaded
single brought in the last run, window dressing for Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more could we want at this point?'' said Brown. ``It's a
huge victory, a moral victory coming in here and facing this
caliber of team.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are sick of facing Brown's caliber of pitcher.

POLICE CHIEF CALLS FOR MORE TRAINING AFTER FATAL SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA and RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The fatal shooting of an advertising executive
who had gunned his car at two patrolmen has prompted San Francisco
Police Chief Fred Lau to order specialized training to help
officers handle such confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Of 12 shootings involving the police this year, seven have
involved officers firing at cars during traffic stops or attempted
arrests. Two, including the latest, resulted in death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to learn from all of these incidents,'' Lau said
Thursday. ``We need a comprehensive training program to reduce the
number of these kinds of incidents. ... You can never predict the
behavior of suspects, but we can improve the safety for officers.
This is the kind of thing we need to address in training.''
</P>
<P>
   John M. Smart Jr., 46, an executive for New York-based
Interbrand, was shot dead late Tuesday when the two officers fired
as many as 13 rounds at his 1996 Mercedes convertible. The police
say the officers fired as Smart drove at them, minutes after they
interceded in a struggle between Smart and a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide investigators said the officers believed their lives
were in danger and had no choice but to shoot as the car bore down
on them. Smart was not armed, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Under departmental rules, officers are not to fire at suspects
fleeing in cars, but are allowed to shoot in cases of self-defense
or to protect the lives of others.
</P>
<P>
   But Lau said the department needs to offer its patrol officers
better training. He said, ideally, officers should avoid firing
their weapons. But, he added, ``We need to protect the public and
allow officers to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very concerned about these incidents. I don't want to
second-guess (the officers') right to defend themselves and other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's weapons policy has been heavily scrutinized
since May 13, when 17-year-old Sheila Detoy was shot dead by
officers as she rode in the car of a man the police said was
fleeing a drug bust.
</P>
<P>
   The police homicide unit, the district attorney and the Police
Department's Management Control Division have launched separate
investigations into the Smart shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began when the officers saw Smart involved in an
apparent quarrel with a woman in his car. The officers stopped the
argument and separated the two for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   When Smart was allowed to re-enter his car, he gunned it into
reverse, pinning one officer, who was standing on the curb, between
the open passenger door and a parking meter, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer pulled away from the meter and ran into the street
where the other officer joined him. With their guns drawn, both
officers ordered Smart out of the car, but he shifted into drive
and headed at them, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   They started shooting as the car approached them, the police
said. The car swerved across the oncoming lanes of traffic and
crashed into a building on the eastern sidewalk. Smart was
pronounced dead at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The woman fled and the police are seeking her for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want her to come in voluntarily and talk to us,'' homicide
Lt. David Robinson said Thursday. ``This woman is a witness. ... We
do not see her as someone who committed a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson confirmed that at least 13 shell casings were found at
the scene.

ANAHEIM MIGHTY DUCKS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Craig Hartsburg &QL; 
(FR)Record: 26-43-13 (sixth) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired LW Stu Grimson and D Kevin
Haller from Carolina for D David Karpa and a 2000 fourth-round
draft pick; signed D Fredrik Olausson and D Scott Ferguson; lost RW
Scott Young as a free agent. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The disappointing Ducks have only one change that
matters: superstar Paul Kariya is back with his head clear, his
'97-98 season ended when he was crosschecked by then Blackhawk Gary
Suter just prior to the Olympics. Kariya and Teemu Selanne are two
of the most talented and exciting players in the game. Once past
that super duo, however, these are lame ducks. GM Pierre Gauthier's
mandate will be to fill out the picture, make it a competitive
squad without giving up either of his super shooters. The place to
start will be defense, where the Ducks have youth on their side but
little else. There is no power-play quarterback, which severely
impacts what either Kariya or Selanne can do on the man-advantage.
The option of putting Scott Young (now in St. Louis) back there is
gone. Add the right player or two, and it could get interesting in
a hurry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
DALLAS STARS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Ken Hitchcock &QL; 
(FR)Record: 49-22-11 (first in Central) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed D Brett Hull and RW Brent
Severyn; lost LW Greg Adams, LW Benoit Hogue, and C Bob Bassen as
free agents; acquired C Tony Hrkac from Nashvile for future
considerations. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: This is the one club out west that could give Detroit
a real tickle in the ribs. They handed Brett Hull $17 million for
the next three years and he'll team with Mike Modano for one
frightening line, with Jere Lehtinen the lead checker. Hull will
start the season at left wing, a switch he made voluntarily,
knowing that Lehtinen's preferred side was the right (company guy
to the end, Hull). Hitchcock's crew is deep up front and big on
defense. Holdout Jamie Langenbrunner finally signed a new deal at
the start of the week, and he'll help fill out a second line with
Pat Verbeek and, eventually, Joe Nieuwendyk (back from knee
surgery). They realized last year that they needed to toughen up
some and went out in the offseason and signed Brent Severyn away
from the Ducks, a move that should take care of yet another missing
piece. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOS ANGELES KINGS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Larry Robinson &QL; 
(FR)Record: 38-33-11 (second) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired D Doug Bodger from New Jersey;
signed D Steve Duchesne; lost D Jan Vopat as a free agent. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Still waiting for that big, franchise-saving Eric
Lindros trade. The Kings are getting better, slowly, but they're
still recovering from the lingering Wayne Gretzky hangover. The
Kings could find it difficult to improve much on last year, when
their two top scorers were former Bruins Jozef Stumpel and Glen
Murray. The picture on offense is about the same, unless one or two
kids (Olli Jokinen? Don MacLean?) can come in and deliver a
legitimate second line. The key off-season hurdle was getting
heavy-hitting defenseman Rob Blake, the Norris Trophy winner, under
contract, which GM Dave Taylor did for more than $5 million a year.
Until further notice, it's a .500 team in need of a marquee forward
to take charge, ergo the rumors about a megaswap for Lindros. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PHOENIX COYOTES &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Jim Schoenfeld &QL; 
(FR)Record: 35-35-12 (fourth in Central) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: RW Mike Gartner and D Jim Johnson
retired; signed D Jyrki Lumme, LW Greg Adams, and C Mike Sullivan;
sent C Craig Janney to Tampa Bay; lost D Murray Baron and C Mark
Janssens as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: For around $11 million, the Coyotes got Keith Tkachuk
to agree to bump his contract out one more year, through 2001. He
should come in and play with a revived passion, which could
translate to another 50-goal season (he dipped to 40 last year
after a pair of 50s). What the Desert Dogs now need is for Jeremy
Roenick to come back and play with his signature fire. First,
they'll have to put him in a position to perform. If the Coyotes
ever really are going to light it up it will be with Roenick
dishing to Tkachuk, allowing them to open up the ice. On defense,
Oleg Tverdovksy should be a more valuable contributor. Teppo
Numminen, if allowed some freedom to create, could be a force. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAN JOSE SHARKS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Darryl Sutter &QL; 
(FR)Record: 34-38-10 (fourth) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: G Kelly Hrudey retired; signed D Bob
Rouse and D Gary Suter; lost RW John MacLean and D Marty McSorley
as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: There is plenty of upside here, with some real voids
filled through free agency the last couple of years. Mike Vernon
arrived last year to secure the net. Now Gary Suter is in from
Chicago, adding instant respectability to the defense, which
already included hitman/terrorist Bryan Marchment. But what about
up front? The day will come, everyone says, when Patrick Marleau
(the No. 2 draft pick to Joe Thornton's No. 1) develops as the
club's franchise center. But that won't happen this year. Sutter
will have to coax some badly needed points out of what amounts to a
below-average bunch of shooters and passers _ the Stephane
Matteaus, Shawn Burrs, and Murray Cravens of the world. The one guy
he could lean on is Owen Nolan, but it just seems that Nolan never
blossoms (41 points last season). &QL; 
 &QL; 
NORTHWEST DIVISION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Calgary Flames &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Brian Sutter &QL; 
(FR)Record: 26-41-15 (fifth in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired C Bob Bassen from Dallas;
acquired D Phil Housley off waivers from Washington; dealt LW
German Titov to Pittsburgh; D Steve Smith came out of retirement;
signed G Ken Wregget. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: For now, Theo Fleury remains the centerpiece of the
franchise. But the Flames are so small-market, it may be impossible
to keep paying him, and he could be worth far more in overall
roster enhancement than, say, another 90- or 100-point season.
Meanwhile, former Bruins coach Sutter has to keep force-feeding
kids. Not a pretty prospect after last season's collapse. To help,
aging blueliners Housley and Steve Smith have been added to the
mix. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Colorado Avalanche &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Bob Hartley &QL; 
(FR)Record: 39-26-17 (first in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed C Chris Drury from Boston
University; lost D Uwe Krupp and C Tom Fitzgerald as free agents;
RW Jari Kurri retired. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Exceptional forwards and highly respectable at defense
and in goal. So what's wrong? That's left for rookie coach Hartley
to answer. GM Pierre Lacroix has gone from acquiring Patrick Roy in
a brilliant swap to letting the likes of Krupp and Young, Mike
Ricci and Mike Keane leave without getting much, if anything, in
return. He also watched Marc Crawford walk (or was he fired?) in
the offseason. But there is still a lot here for Hartley to
kickstart, beginning with forwards Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic,
Valeri Kamensky, and let's not forget lovable Claude Lemieux. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Edmonton Oilers &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Ron Low &QL; 
(FR)Record: 35-37-10 (third in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired G Mikhail Shtalenkov and C Jim
Dowd from Nashville; signed D Marty McSorley and RW Pat Falloon;
lost G Curtis Joseph as a free agent; D Kevin Lowe retired. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Doug Weight spent training camp on the sidelines,
asking for about $4 million a year, and unless he pulls on a
sweater, the Oil might not have anyone to put the puck in the net.
Edmonton does have a talented and exciting defense, ex-Boston
University blueliner Tom Poti only adding to the mix that already
included Roman Hamrlik and Janne Niinimaa. GM Glen Sather let
Curtis Joseph walk and now will entrust the net to journeyman Bob
Essensa and ex-Duck backup Mikhail Shtalenkov. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vancouver Canucks &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Mike Keenan &QL; 
(FR)Record: 25-43-14 (seventh in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed D Murray Baron; lost D Jyrki
Lumme, G Arturs Irbe, and F Brian Noonan as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Brian Burke gave up his cushy seat at NHL headquarters
for the hot seat as GM here, where superstar Pavel Bure says he'll
never again wear the Canucks uniform. About the only thing the
Canucks might have going for them is that Mark Messier is back with
something to prove. Wrentham's Garth Snow is the No. 1 netminder,
but that could change if Bure gets swapped for a franchise
netminder (hello, Felix Potvin?). &QL;

CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Dirk Graham &QL; 
(FR)Record: 30-39-13 (fifth) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired G Mark Fitzpatrick and a 1999
fourth-round draft pick from Tampa Bay for D Michal Sykora; sent G
Chris Terreri to New Jersey for a 1999 second- or third-round draft
pick; signed C Doug Gilmour, C Mark Janssens, D Paul Coffey, and RW
Ed Olczyk; lost D Gary Suter and C Greg Johnson as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: They passed on Brett Hull and instead lavished their
money ($6 million per year) on Gilmour, who'll have to wring a lot
out of those 35-year-old legs to help the goal-challenged Hawks.
They didn't have anyone with a point per game last year (Tony
Amonte was tops with 73 in 82 games). Coffey fell off the map in
Philadelphia. He's 37 and not the kickstart this team needs.
Remember when Alexei Zhamnov was going to step in and be the
statistical equivalent of Jeremy Roenick? It's been two years and
Zhamnov looks forever to be in that almost-but-never-quite
category. Jeff Hackett will handle most of the load in net after 58

(FR)Outlook: Bowman, recovering from an offseason heart procedure,
will make it back sometime in the first half. There is no real
hurry. The Wings will be back in the hunt, their lineup spiced a
little with the heavy-shooting Krupp, acquired from Colorado. The
Wings pull on that postseason face that make guys like Doug Brown,
Darren McCarthy, and Kirk Maltby invaluable Cup performers. Who
heard of Tomas Holmstrom until it really became time to play? In
other words, they're rich in talent (Steve Yzerman, Brendan
Shanahan, Sergei Fedorov) and deep, too. Could they have won it all

Greg Johnson, and RW Blair Atcheynum in expansion draft; acquired
RW Vitali Yachmenev from Los Angeles for future considerations;
acquired RW Sergei Krivokrasov from Chicago; signed C Tom
Fitzgerald and D Rob Zettler as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The ever-growing,
team-in-every-town-bigger-than-Biloxi NHL now brings Game On to the
Big Guitar. The good people of Nashville will have to be patient
(witness the suffering souls of San Jose, who've had little more to
cling to than a wicked cool logo for seven years). Ex-Caps GM David
Poile has remained true to his initial plan. He wants speed and
grit. He even brought in ex-Panther Tom Fitzgerald and instantly
made him captain. They hope they've got a franchise player in
waiting with pivot David Legwand. With the likes of Fitzgerald,
Atcheynum (St. Louis), Zettler (Toronto), Boughner (Buffalo), there
is at least the fabric of an enthusiastic squad. Dunham has waited
since the '94 Olympics to get a real big league shot in net. It's
all his now, with all the rubber he can handle. &QL;

   &QL; 
ST. LOUIS BLUES &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Joel Quenneville &QL; 
(FR)Record: 45-29-8 (third) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed RW Scott Young; lost RW Brett
Hull and D Steve Duchesne as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: OK, everything here is the same, except with former
Boston University winger Young plugged in as one of the ways to
fill the Hull void. Oh boy and uh-oh. Not to mention the Blues also
saw Duchesne pack bags for LA and the developing Blair Atcheynum
get gobbled up by the Predators. If this club can hope to play
around .600 again (.598 last year), a lot more of the load is going
to fall to Pierre Turgeon, Geoff Courtnall, and even Jim Campbell.
They'll tighten up on defense without Hull, and that's an emerging
Blue strongsuit with the talented Chris Pronger back there. And,
oh, they gave Al MacInnis $15 million over three years to stick
around. He's the type to earn every penny, and he'll be asked to do
just that. &QL;

   &QL; 
CALGARY FLAMES &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Brian Sutter &QL; 
(FR)Record: 26-41-15 (fifth in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired C Bob Bassen from Dallas for C
Aaron Gavey; acquired D Phil Housley off waivers from Washington;
sent G Rick Tabaracci to Washington for a conditional 2000 seventh-
or ninth-round draft pick; sent LW German Titov to Pittsburgh; D
Steve Smith came out of retirement; signed G Ken Wregget; lost LW
Todd Hlushko, G Dwayne Roloson, and C Jim Dowd as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: For now, Theo Fleury remains the centerpiece of the
franchise. But they're so small-market, it may be impossible to
keep paying him, and he could be worth far more in overall roster
enhancement than, say, another 90- or 100-point season. Meanwhile,
former Bruins coach Sutter has to keep force-feeding kids. Not a
pretty prospect after last season's collapse. To help, aging
blueliners Housley (out of Washington) and Steve Smith (out of
retirement) have been added. If they're at their best, Housley will
help move the puck _ especially on the ravaged power play _ and
Smith should help ex-Penguin Ken Wregget on the defensive end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COLORADO AVALANCHE &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Bob Hartley &QL; 
(FR)Record: 39-26-17 (first in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed C Chris Drury from Boston
University; lost D Uwe Krupp and C Tom Fitzgerald as free agents;
RW Jari Kurri retired. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Exceptional forwards and highly respectable at defense
and in goal. So what's wrong? That's left for rookie coach Hartley
to answer. General manager Pierre Lacroix has gone from acquiring
Patrick Roy in a brilliant swap to letting the likes of Krupp and
Young, Mike Ricci and Mike Keane leave without getting much, if
anything, in return. He also watched Marc Crawford walk (or was he
fired?) in the offseason. But there is still a lot here for Hartley
to kickstart, beginning with forwards Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic,
Valeri Kamensky, and let's not forget lovable Claude Lemieux. The
loss of Krupp's big shot from the point will hurt, but the talented
Sandis Ozolinsh makes up for a lot of that on the power play. Don't
be surprised in BU's Chris Drury gets regular second-line duty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
EDMONTON OILERS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Ron Low &QL; 
(FR)Record: 35-37-10 (third in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired G Mikhail Shtalenkov and C Jim
Dowd from Nashville; Signed D Marty McSorley and RW Pat Falloon;
lost G Curtis Joseph as a free agent; D Kevin Lowe retired. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Doug Weight spent training camp on the sidelines,
asking for about $4 million a year and unwilling to come in for $3
million. Unless he pulls on a sweater, the Oil might not have
anyone to put the puck in the net. Edmonton does have a talented
and exciting defense, ex-Terrier Tom Poti only adding to the mix
that already included Roman Hamrlik and Janne Niinimaa. GM Glen
Sather let Curtis Joseph walk and now will entrust the net to
journeyman Bob Essensa and ex-Duck backup Mikhail Shtalenkov. If
there are some goals to be found, they'll likely come from Bill
Guerin, Todd Marchant, Dean McAmmond, or perhaps the disappearing
Andrei Kovalenko. &QL;
</P>

   &QL; 
VANCOUVER CANUCKS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Mike Keenan &QL; 
(FR)Record: 25-43-14 (seventh in Pacific) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed D Murray Baron; lost D Jyrki
Lumme, G Arturs Irbe, and F Brian Noonan as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Brian Burke gave up his cushy seat at NHL headquarters
for the hot seat as GM here, where superstar Pavel Bure says he'll
never again wear the Canucks uniform. About the only thing the
Canucks might have going for them is that Mark Messier is back with
something to prove. . Wrentham's Garth Snow is the No. 1 netminder,
backed by Corey Hirsch, but all that could change if Bure gets
swapped for a franchise netminder (hello, Felix Potvin?). The
Canucks tried to convince former Bruin Andy Moog to come out of
retirement, an indication that Snow comes in needing to do some
convincing. The ultimate franchise saver here would be a
Bure-Alexander Mogilny swap to bring in a pair of young, character
forwards or a franchise netminder and one forward. &QL;

NHL 1998-1999: EASTERN CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT AND NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
 
ATLANTIC DIVISION 
 
NEW JERSEY DEVILS 
(FR)Coach: Robbie Ftorek 
(FR)Record: 48-23-11 (first) 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired G Chris Terreri from Chicago
for a 1999 second- or third-round draft pick; acquired D Ken Sutton
from San Jose fort a 1999 fifth-round draft pick; lost C Doug
Gilmour, LW Steve Thomas, and D Doug Bodger as free agents; lost G
Mike Dunham in expansion draft. 
(FR)Outlook: Ftorek is behind the bench, replacing Jacques Lemaire.
Gone is veteran center Gilmour, who left for the Blackhawks in free
agency. The defensive system will remain in place, though Ftorek
has said he'll allow more offensive freedom. Could be a case of
taking the reins off the horse only to have him stay in the barn.
Martin Brodeur will always give them a chance. In this league, as
evidenced with Buffalo, a string goaltender is often enough. They
do, however, need to resolve their contract squabble with
defenseman Scott Niedermayer. 
 
 
 
NEW YORK ISLANDERS 
(FR)Coach: Mike Milbury 
(FR)Record: 30-41-11 (fourth) 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed G Marcel Cousineau, D Dean
Malkoc, D Barry Richter; lost D J.J. Daigneault and D Dennis Vaske
as free agents. 
(FR)Outlook: More turmoil on the island. There was an ownership
change, a lawsuit over whether the Nassau County Coliseum was safe
(a judge ruled it was), and more contract problems (an annual
occurrence it seems with Zigmund Palffy). Since the club has a
terrific coach in Milbury, a major trade with Toronto and Vancouver
(as rumored for the past two weeks) could be enough to shake the
Islanders out of their doldrums. 
 
 
 
NEW YORK RANGERS 
(FR)Coach: John Muckler 
(FR)Record: 25-39-18 (fifth) 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired RW Mike Knuble from Detroit for
2000 third-round draft pick; signed LW Brent Fedyk, RW Scott
Fraser, RW John MacLean, D Zarley Zalapski, and G Kay Whitmore as
free agents; C Pat LaFontaine and D Bruce Driver retired. 
(FR)Outlook: When you have Wayne Gretzky and Mike Richter, it's
impossible to get too depressed. Niklas Sundstrom appears to be the
second line center, which is a good thing. Kevin Stevens has been
relegated to a checker by Muckler (still in the experimental
stages) and there's always Brian Leetch. With the new rules, the
Rangers should make a charge but may run out of gas by the end of
the season.  
 
 
 
PHILADELPHIA FLYERS 
(FR)Coach: Roger Neilson 
(FR)Record: 42-29-11 (second) 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed C Marc Bureau, G John
Vanbiesbrouck, and LW Valeri Zelepukin; lost G Sean Burke, D Paul
Coffey, and C Daniel Lacroix as free agents. 
(FR)Outlook: Is this the year? Some say it is, while others say it
will never be. The league and franchise have been waiting for Eric
Lindros to lead the Flyers to the promised land. He's armed with a
new contract, a burr in his saddle from comments made by general
manager Bob Clarke that Lindros needs to pick it up, and the best
roster in the East. Vanbiesbrouck could be the missing link. If
not, maybe goaltending wasn't the problem after all.

   &QL; 
PITTSBURGH PENGUINS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Kevin Constantine &QL; 
(FR)Record: 40-24-18 (first in Northeast) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired LW German Titov from Calgary;
acquired D Bobby Dollas from Edmonton; signed LW Todd Hlushko; lost
C Ron Francis, LW Joe Dziedzic, D Fredrik Olausson, C Ed Olczyk, G
Ken Wregget, and LW Alex Hicks as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: This could be a very frustrating year for Jaromir
Jagr, who will have to perform without Mario Lemieux and Francis.
Truth is, the Penguins aren't a very good team. They've been hurt
badly by the ownership battle between Roger Marino and Howard
Baldwin. Could be a long season in the Steel City.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NORTHEAST DIVISION &QL; 
 &QL; 
BOSTON BRUINS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Pat Burns &QL; 
(FR)Record: 39-30-13 (second) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed RW Peter Ferraro, C Chris Taylor,
and D Dennis Vaske as free agents; lost LW Mike Sullivan in
expansion draft. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The Bruins were a question mark at the start of last
season. This year, there are still a few puzzles on the horizon.
Byron Dafoe is a legitimate No. 1 goalie, Ray Bourque is still Ray
Bourque, but will the club be able to score consistently enough to
take it to the next level? Be assured Burns will get the most out
of his players. He'll either make or break Joe Thornton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BUFFALO SABRES &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Lindy Ruff &QL; 
(FR)Record: 36-29-17 (third) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed LW Randy Cunneyworth, D James
Patrick, and G Dwayne Roloson; lost G Steve Shields as a free
agent; lost D Bob Boughner in expansion draft. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Dominik Hasek anchors a young team filled with players
whose names no one knows despite their slaying of Goliath
(Philadelphia) in the playoffs last year. When your leading scorer
has just 46 points ... well, you get the picture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MONTREAL CANADIENS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Alain Vigneault &QL; 
(FR)Record: 37-32-13 (fourth) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: G Andy Moog retired; signed C Sergei
Zholtok; lost C Marc Bureau as a free agent. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Saku Koivu is signed (and therefore happy, we
presume), Vincent Damphousse has to have a better year than last
season. So where does that leave the Habs? It depends on
goaltending. The club has never really replaced Patrick Roy. In the
Eastern Conference, Montreal has enough to be competitive.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
OTTAWA SENATORS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Jacques Martin &QL; 
(FR)Record: 34-33-15 (fifth) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed RW Steve Leach and RW David
Oliver; lost LW Randy Cunneyworth, LW Denny Lambert, and RW Pat
Falloon as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: A good coach and terrific young forwards but the
roster lacks depth. Once you get past oft-injured star Daniel
Alfredsson, Alexei Yashin, and Shawn McEachern, there isn't much
but scrappiness. That helps, but it's not enough. Is Damian Rhodes
that good? We'll see. This club, as it proved in the playoffs, has
the potential to make some noise.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Pat Quinn &QL; 
(FR)Record: 30-43-9 (sixth in Central) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed G Curtis Joseph, LW Steve Thomas,
LW Scott Pearson, and LW Niklas Andersson; lost LW Wendel Clark as
a free agent; LW Nick Kypreos retired. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: You have to love the decision to move the Maple Leafs
to the East. Well, OK, they were already in the East, but it was
good of the league to take them out of the Western Conference and
let them play where they belong. No-nonsense coach Quinn has
arrived, Joseph is in net, and the games between the Leafs and
Canadiens should be entertaining. Toronto is rebuilding but the
construction should be fun to watch.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUTHEAST DIVISION &QL; 
 &QL; 
CAROLINA HURRICANES &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Paul Maurice &QL; 
(FR)Record: 33-41-8 (sixth in Northeast) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired D David Karpa and a 2000
fourth-round draft pick from Anaheim for D Kevin Haller and LW Stu
Grimson; signed C Ron Francis, G Arturs Irbe, and C Steve Martins;
lost LW Jeff Daniels as a free agent. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The return of Ron Francis to the franchise certainly
can't hurt. The 'Canes need Ray Sheppard to return to form. Keith
Primeau and Sami Kapanen are fine players but the fact is this is
only a so-so club.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
FLORIDA PANTHERS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Terry Murray &QL; 
(FR)Record: 24-43-15 (sixth in Atlantic) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed G Sean Burke; lost D Dallas
Eakins and G John Vanbiesbrouck as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The Panthers have a new building and new coach, but
will that be enough to inject life into a club that finished 12th
out of 13 teams in the conference last year? Will Kirk McLean, who
played for three teams last year, and Burke, who also played for
three teams, be enough to offset the loss of Vanbiesbrouck to the
Flyers? Look for a drought in southern Florida. &QL;

LIBRARY SNARES A VAST COLLECTION ON THE `ROUGH RIDER' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The chair, wide of girth and squat of stature,
seems a good fit for its famous occupant, Theodore Roosevelt, who
described his strength as that of a bull moose.
</P>
<P>
   The dark stain on the chair's curved ladder back has been rubbed
off down to the golden oak's natural grain, presumably by the
kinetic energy of the man known as ``The Rough Rider.'' Similarly,
the rush seat apparently took plenty of abuse and is tattered and
sagging.
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the chair from all sides within inches of its carved
legs and low-slung muscularity, the sensation is magical.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine the 26th president of the United States summoned
back to life. With a slap of his brawny knee, a flourish of his
spectacles and a ``Bully!'' muttered from beneath his walrus
mustache, you can picture Roosevelt launching his fireplug frame
out of the chair and lighting out for another adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bit of a spar,'' perhaps, as TR liked to call military
battles.
</P>
<P>
   As politician, writer, naturalist, hunter, war hero and rugged
adventurer, everything about Teddy Roosevelt was outsize, and so is
the chair and the collection where it now resides, in its new home,
the New York State Library in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The State Library paid a private collector $200,000 _ a record
amount for a single collection acquisition in the state's history _
for this Roosevelt collection, which contained an estimated 300,000
items ranging, including books, letters, photographs, campaign
buttons, official papers and teddy bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Library has wanted to have this collection for a
long time because of the tremendous importance of Teddy Roosevelt
to New York state,'' State Librarian Janet Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   The only other public collections to rival it are TR's personal
archives at Harvard University and his presidential papers at the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's home at Sagamore Hill, near Oyster Bay, N.Y., is a
historic site, but does not contain much in the way of manuscript
material.
</P>
<P>
   Born Oct. 27, 1858, in New York City, Roosevelt was elected at
age 23 to the state Legislature in Albany, where he built a
reputation as a blunt-spoken, reform-minded Republican. Roosevelt's
swagger is captured in an 1892 oil painting by William Bengough
titled ``New York State Senate'' that hangs today outside the
Senate floor in the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a wave of immense popularity for leading the Rough Riders
in the battle for Cuba's San Juan Hill in 1898, Roosevelt was
elected governor of New York later that year.
</P>
<P>
   During his brief stay at the governor's mansion, TR wrote the
book ``Rough Riders'' and was a dynamo of legislative and literary
output.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt won election to the vice presidency under William
McKinley in 1900. McKinley was assassinated on Sept. 14, 1901 in
Buffalo. Roosevelt, who was hiking in the Adirondack High Peaks at
the time, rushed to Buffalo, where he was sworn in as president at
age 42 _ the youngest to hold that office.
</P>
<P>
   The collection came to the State Library only after years of
gentle coaxing of Lyall Squair, a Syracuse collector known far and
wide as a TR omnivore.
</P>
<P>
   Squair, 68, a retired librarian, decided it was time to part
with the tonnage of a four-decade obsession that threatened to
overtake his large home near the Syracuse University campus.
Besides, his wife needed more room for her doll collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squair's entire living room, the bedrooms, a study, the
basement, every inch of his house was crammed with TR material,''
said James Corsaro, associate librarian and special collections
expert for the State Library.
</P>
<P>
   Corsaro hauled away four vanloads packed tight with TR stuff and
Squair's Syracuse house still wasn't completely emptied of
Teddydom.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bargain, Squair threw in dozens of boxes of
material for free, Corsaro said, appraised at tens of thousands of
dollars. Squair turned down lucrative offers from dealers and
collectors and refused to sell his TR collection piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   Squair typed his own catalog to the collection. Its 21 sections
run to more than 200 pages.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every item has a story. Take the chair, for instance. TR brought
it to use when he visited his sister, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson,
at her home _ Henderson House, also known as Cruger Mansion _ in
Jordanville. ``I got the chair at auction near Jordanville many
years ago,'' Squair said. ``I paid $850 for it and outbid members
of the Roosevelt family.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a large bronze bust of TR by the sculptor James Fraser
that once dominated Squair's living room. ``I got that out of
Fraser's studio in Connecticut,'' Squair said.
</P>
<P>
   Squair was a relentless TR tracker. It took him a decade, for
instance, to run down a 1902 limited edition, specially bound
volume by TR titled ``The Deer Family.'' There were just 100 copies
of TR's biological study of deer, and Squair snared No. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Books were where Squair's TR obsession began. As a library
science student at Syracuse University, Squair picked up a copy of
``The Life of Theodore Roosevelt,'' by William Draper Lewish, that
his wife, Linda, had picked up for a dime at a church rummage sale.
``I read it, got interested in TR, followed the bibliography to
other books and kept going,'' said Squair, who made his first
purchases in 1960. ``The next thing I knew, I had a whole house
full of TR books.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt was a prolific writer whose published books number in
the dozens, along with hundreds of essays and articles. ``Squair
collected not only every book by TR, but every edition, along with
every book with an introduction or foreword by TR, as well as every
biography and history book about TR,'' Corsaro said. The books
alone in the collection total thousands of volumes.
</P>
<P>
   There are many notable books, including a poetry collection
titled ``Sea and Shore.'' TR gave it to his sister as a Christmas
present in 1874. An inscription penned in a light, controlled
cursive reads: ``To Corinne from her brother. Thee Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Squair's catholic collecting habits can be seen in odd items of
tangential interest: a half-dozen different bottles of TR barbecue
sauce, thousands of TR postcards, TR china and TR beer trays, even
a bag of jasmine incense sticks (``Carry A Big Stick'') that
purport to burn for three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The list of teddy bears _ named for Roosevelt _ and teddy bear
accoutrements goes on for pages. There are never-before-published
letters, glass negatives and photographs of TR, as well.

THE IMPEACHMENT TRAIN IS LEAVING AS SCHEDULED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You couldn't really call it a debate. The word ``debate''
implies competition, and Thursday's House vote to initiate
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton was a no-contest
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rule Congress these days, and the decision to
undertake an open-ended impeachment inquiry was a no-brainer. Any
mystery that existed involved the question of how many Democrats
would join their GOP colleagues in the final vote to launch the
constitutional procedure that could eventually lead to Clinton's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   That number turned out to be 31, meaning that 31 Democrats were
either brave enough to defy their party's president or simply
scared stiff of the Clinton-haters back home. All 435 House members
face re-election Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to proceed with impeachment proceedings was a done
deal after Monday's party-line vote by the House Judiciary
Committee, which will conduct impeachment hearings and vote on any
articles of impeachment that result before sending them to the full
House for consideration. If the House votes for impeachment, a
trial will be held in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote for conviction in the Senate _ 67 senators _
would oust the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   But we're getting ahead of ourselves, as did some House
Democrats when they argued Thursday that the president should face
some punishment for his reprehensible conduct but that the
punishment should come in the form of a censure or a rebuke or a
reprimand _ something, anything, other than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A plea bargain, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, a plea bargain might be just the ticket
for resolving all this. The pundits are saying that even if the GOP
picks up as many as five additional Senate seats on Nov. 3, there
won't be 67 votes to convict Clinton in an impeachment trial. And
if there's no hope of driving Clinton from office, his enemies in
Congress might be willing to settle for raking him over the coals
with some sort of official reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises an interesting question: If there is no chance of
convicting Clinton in the Senate, why is the House trying to
impeach him?
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority in the House insists that it has a
constitutional responsibility to investigate and act upon
allegations of impeachable offenses by the president. House

THE IMPEACHMENT TRAIN IS LEAVING AS SCHEDULED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You couldn't really call it a debate. The word ``debate''
implies competition, and Thursday's House vote to initiate
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton was a no-contest
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans rule Congress these days, and the decision to
undertake an open-ended impeachment inquiry was a no-brainer. Any
mystery that existed involved the question of how many Democrats
would join their GOP colleagues in the final vote to launch the
constitutional procedure that could eventually lead to Clinton's
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   That number turned out to be 31, meaning that 31 Democrats were
either brave enough to defy their party's president or simply
scared stiff of the Clinton-haters back home. All 435 House members
face re-election Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to proceed with impeachment proceedings was a done
deal after Monday's party-line vote by the House Judiciary
Committee, which will conduct impeachment hearings and vote on any
articles of impeachment that result before sending them to the full
House for consideration. If the House votes for impeachment, a
trial will be held in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote for conviction in the Senate _ 67 senators _
would oust the president from office.
</P>
<P>
   But we're getting ahead of ourselves, as did some House
Democrats when they argued Thursday that the president should face
some punishment for his reprehensible conduct but that the
punishment should come in the form of a censure or a rebuke or a
reprimand _ something, anything, other than impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A plea bargain, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, a plea bargain might be just the ticket
for resolving all this. The pundits are saying that even if the GOP
picks up as many as five additional Senate seats on Nov. 3, there
won't be 67 votes to convict Clinton in an impeachment trial. And
if there's no hope of driving Clinton from office, his enemies in
Congress might be willing to settle for raking him over the coals
with some sort of official reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises an interesting question: If there is no chance of
convicting Clinton in the Senate, why is the House trying to
impeach him?
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority in the House insists that it has a
constitutional responsibility to investigate and act upon
allegations of impeachable offenses by the president. House
Democrats, Clinton loyalists and certain nonpartisan cynics insist
that the Republicans will do anything to embarrass and discredit
Clinton _ even it means subjecting the country to the trauma of
impeaching the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment,'' don't forget, refers only to the House's
``grand jury'' function of charging the president with ``treason,
bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   So. The experts believe that Clinton won't be removed from
office. Most Clinton-watchers believe that he will never resign.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... southern Florida.  (FR)Coach: Jacques Demers 
(FR)Record: 17-55-10 (seventh in Atlantic) 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired G Mark Fitzpatrick and a 1999
fourth-round draft pick from Chicago for D Michal Sykora; acquired
C Craig Janney from Phoenix; acquired G Bill Ranford from
Washington; signed LW Wendel Clark and F Benoit Hogue; lost LW
Louie DeBrusk as a free agent. 
(FR)Outlook: The worst team in the league last year. They have
overhauled the roster, adding former Bruins Janney and Ranford and
veterans Clark and Hogue. Vincent Lecavalier, the first pick
overall, looks like a keeper and the feel good story of the year
could be John Cullen's comeback from cancer. The Lightning will be
better (they couldn't be worse), but not enough to contend. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON CAPITALS &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Ron Wilson &QL; 
(FR)Record: 40-30-12 &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired G Rick Tabaracci from Calgary
for conditional 2000 seventh- or ninth-round draft pick; signed D
Dmitri Mironov; sent G Bill Ranford to Tampa Bay; waived D Phil
Housley. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Last year's Stanley Cup finalists made an impressive
run but Detroit was just too good. With Wilson behind the bench,
this team will always be competitive. Olaf Kolzig had a breakout
year, Adam Oates continues to be among the elite players in the
league, and Peter Bondra is an electrifying presence who has been
hampered by injuries. Former Bruin Joe Juneau should score more
than nine goals. Depth is a problem, but when you have 27 teams,
depth is a problem everywhere.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
NORTHEAST DIVISION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Boston Bruins &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Pat Burns &QL; 
(FR)Record: 39-30-13 (second) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed RW Peter Ferraro, C Chris Taylor,
and D Dennis Vaske as free agents; lost LW Mike Sullivan in
expansion draft. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The Bruins were a question mark at the start of last
season. This year, there are still a few puzzles on the horizon.
Byron Dafoe is a legitimate No. 1 goalie, Ray Bourque is still Ray
Bourque, but will the club be able to score consistently enough to
take it to the next level? Be assured Burns will get the most out
of his players. He'll either make or break Joe Thornton. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Buffalo Sabres &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Lindy Ruff &QL; 
(FR)Record: 36-29-17 (third) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed LW Randy Cunneyworth, D James
Patrick, and G Dwayne Roloson; lost D Bob Boughner in expansion
draft. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Dominik Hasek, who signed a new three-year deal in the
offseason and has led the league in save percentage each of the
past five seasons, anchors a young team filled with players whose
names no one knows despite their slaying of Goliath (Philadelphia)
in the playoffs last year. When your leading scorer has just 46
points ... well, you get the picture. Two-time 40-goal scorer Geoff
Sanderson, acquired in mid-season from the Canucks, will be looked
upon to provide some scoring punch along with left wing Michal
Grosek. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Montreal Canadiens &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Alain Vigneault &QL; 
(FR)Record: 37-32-13 (fourth) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: G Andy Moog retired; signed C Sergei
Zholtok; lost C Marc Bureau as a free agent. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: Saku Koivu is signed (and therefore happy, we presume)
and Vincent Damphousse has to have a better year than last season.
So where does that leave the Habs? It depends on goaltending. The
club has never really replaced Patrick Roy. With Moog retired, the
Canadiens are left with the young tandem of 23-year-old Jocelyn
Thibault (acquired in the Roy deal) and Jose Theodore, 22. Right
wing Mark Recchi (32 goals, 74 points) in the offseason received
$4.5 million in the highest arbitration award in NHL history. In
the Eastern Conference, Montreal has enough to be competitive. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ottawa Senators &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Jacques Martin &QL; 
(FR)Record: 34-33-15 (fifth) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed RW Steve Leach and RW David
Oliver; lost LW Randy Cunneyworth, LW Denny Lambert, and RW Pat
Falloon as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: A good coach and terrific young forwards, but the
roster lacks depth. Once you get past oft-injured star Daniel
Alfredsson (45 points in 55 games and seven playoff goals), Alexei
Yashin, and Shawn McEachern, there isn't much but scrappiness. That
helps, but it's not enough. Is Damian Rhodes that good? We'll see.
A young defense is headed by 21-year-old Wade Redden (plus-21 last
season) and Chris Phillips, the top pick in the '96 draft. This
club, as it proved in the playoffs, has the potential to make some
noise.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Toronto Maple Leafs &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Pat Quinn &QL; 
(FR)Record: 30-43-9 (sixth in Central) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed G Curtis Joseph, LW Steve Thomas,
LW Scott Pearson, and LW Niklas Andersson; lost LW Wendel Clark as
a free agent; LW Nick Kypreos retired. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: You have to love the decision to move the Maple Leafs
to the East. Well, OK, they were already in the East, but it was
good of the league to take them out of the Western Conference.
No-nonsense coach Quinn has arrived, Joseph is in net, and the
games between the Leafs and Canadiens should be entertaining.
Toronto is rebuilding but the construction should be fun to watch.

SOUTHEAST DIVISION &QL;

<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Carolina Hurricanes &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Paul Maurice &QL; 
(FR)Record: 33-41-8 (sixth in Northeast) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Acquired D David Karpa and a 2000
fourth-round draft pick from Anaheim for D Kevin Haller and LW Stu
Grimson; signed C Ron Francis, G Arturs Irbe, and C Steve Martins;
lost LW Jeff Daniels as a free agent. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The return of Francis to the franchise certainly can't
hurt. The 'Canes need Ray Sheppard to return to form. Keith Primeau
and Sami Kapanen are fine players, but the fact is this is only a
so-so club. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Florida Panthers &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Terry Murray &QL; 
(FR)Record: 24-43-15 (sixth in Atlantic) &QL; 
(FR)Key personnel changes: Signed G Sean Burke; lost D Dallas
Eakins and G John Vanbiesbrouck as free agents. &QL; 
(FR)Outlook: The Panthers have a new building and new coach, but
will that be enough to inject life into a club that finished 12th
out of 13 teams in the conference last year? Will Kirk McLean, who
played for three teams last year, and Burke, who also played for
three teams, be enough to offset the loss of Vanbiesbrouck to the
Flyers? Look for a drought in southern Florida. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tampa Bay Lightning &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR)Coach: Jacques Demers &QL; 
(FR)Record: 17-55-10 (seventh in Atlantic) &QL;

DRESS UP A TABLE SETTING WITH ANTIQUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. _ Setting a beautiful table can be half
the fun of creating a great dining experience.
</P>
<P>
   In her latest book, ``Modern Antiques for the Table'' (Viking,
240 pages, $39.95), author Sheila Chefetz takes the novice and
seasoned collector through the paces of gracious table settings
with tableware antiques from about 1890 to 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``An empty table is like a blank canvas awaiting the touch of
the painter's brush,'' Chefetz said in a recent interview at her
store that specializes in table settings, The Country Dining Room,
in Great Barrington, Mass. ``Don't forget that many of the great
hostesses often spent days supervising the setting of their tables
with hundreds of pieces from their fabled tableware collections.
You can too, by using your imagination and an artistic eye. You
don't need to be an heiress or a great decorator to dine with
antique tableware.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of how Chefetz coordinates different settings, she
mixes several periods in her book. For one setting, she combines
glass Art Nouveau celery vases as flower vases and a mix of silver
and ivorine flatware, solid yellow basket-weave scallop-edge plates
and a Chintz coffee set in yellow, green, orange and white.
</P>
<P>
   You better shop around. Chefetz advised the best way to add to
your existing table settings is to shop around at garage sales,
auctions, antiques shops and specialty stores, where you can find a
myriad of buys, from a separate set of salad plates to cups and
saucers and serving pieces. Mixing and matching is what makes a
table interesting and come to life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the popularity of Chefetz's first book, published in
1993, ``Antiques for the Table,'' that inspired her latest book. It
depicted memorable table settings for every occasion using 18th-,
19th- and 20th-century china, glass and silver, along with the
history of each piece and customs for using them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Modern Antiques for the Table,'' Chefetz covers the four
principals of modern design _ Art Nouveau, Arts &AMP; Crafts, Beaux
Arts and Art Deco. She does so through two cities she considered to
be the ``pulse points'' of America: Detroit for its industry, and
Los Angeles for its fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good design can harmonize with and enhance well-designed
tablewares of any era,'' Chefetz said. ``Never try to re-create
history, but rather bring your own personality to the mix to create
a melange of your favorite accessories and table service.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefetz suggests thinking about setting a dinner table in the
same way one would accessorize a model. This is a comparison
Chefetz has had firsthand experience with, having been a fashion
director for Gimbles in New York City years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make the dress stand out, you need the right jewelry, shoes
and purse,'' she said. ``Setting the table utilizes the same
principal. A friend once told me that silver is a table's or a
room's jewelry. An outfit is never complete without jewelry. Silver
and jewelry provides the glow or shine to make other things stand
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you do, don't be afraid to mix and match,'' Chefetz
said. ``A table setting should always be a mix of the unexpected to
create a conversation piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Chefetz said that the best route to table setting is to start
with what you have or like to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always best to bring a few pieces of your table service
with you when shopping,'' she said. ``You should also bring a
sample of your wall color, paper or fabric and measure the space on
the table that you plan to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In English porcelain dinner sets, dating up to the 1920s, there
were always separate dessert services, according to Chefetz, as
well as separate sets for breakfast, fish courses, tea and coffee.
The latter two, were more or less an American invention, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A really early set of fine china, for middle- to upper-class
homes, would never have had bread-and-butter plates,'' Chefetz
said. ``An early set would have had a set of crescent-shaped dishes
in which to discard fish or meat bones from your dinner plate.
People are buying these crescent-shaped dishes today and using them
as salad plates. Demitasse cups are perfect for serving sorbet.''
</P>
<P>
   Early sets of china also came without matching cups and saucers.
There would be a separate dessert set that was placed after all of
the dinner dishes were removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to mix teacups, as many of the decorative ones tell a
little story,'' Chefetz said. ``These can start as low as $20 to
$30 and up to the $200 range for one cup and saucer. It's easy to
start a set of your own by carefully mixing color and designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tea also required its own service. The small plates that
accompanied a tea service were for sweets or finger sandwiches.
``Today, these make very nice plates for salad, which Americans
serve as a first course,'' Chefetz said. ``Tea and dessert services
were always more decorative than the dinner plates, to show off the
dessert. It's always nice to pre-set and start with the prettier
plate, because that's what people see first.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Modern Antiques for the Table,'' Chefetz notes that the
beauty of china made during the Arts &AMP; Crafts period, is in its
subdued patterning. That allows it to mix with contemporary pieces
without fear of clashing. Its predominantly subtle colors work well
with today's tableware, affording an opportunity to combine the
best of the old with the new.
</P>
<P>
   Antique silver and glass are also able to meld well with
contemporary settings, Chefetz said.
</P>
<P>
   The richly decorated silver from the Arts &AMP; Crafts period can be
used for a special dinner party or be interspersed with new pieces
for a Sunday brunch or luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   The rich colors that were used in stained glass windows and
showed up in the table glass of the period are particularly
appealing, Chefetz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, what could be lovelier than a luncheon table set with
Depression-era glasses of pink and green, maybe set off with a
centerpiece of complementary roses?'' she said. ``The mix and match
possibilities are endless, and Depression glass still remains
well-priced, making it particularly attractive to young people with
a lifelong love of collecting vintage glass. You see many of
America's greatest financial titans choosing reproductions for
their American manor homes, because of the new pride in
machine-made goods.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1920s, Arts &AMP; Crafts and Art Nouveau gave way to the
modern look of Art Deco. Exotic designs associated with Art Deco
were lavishly used on both tables and decorative glass by almost
all of the major china, silver and glass manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   As styles changed and more and more women entered the work
world, fine china, crystal and silver flatware were commonly left
in their cases and cabinets. These ornate and delicate settings
were replaced by the more functional and gaily colored plates made
of Bakelite (the first synthetic plastic, developed in 1907) and
Depression glassware.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variety of plates changes as each decade progresses,''
Chefetz said. ``For instance, the geometry of some of the china
made during the 1920s and '30s was so it was possible to wedge
pieces together to conserve needed space in the trunk or rumble
seat of the Model T car. Many china companies responded to the rage
for traveling by car by designing attractive breakfast, bachelor,
tete-a-tete, or tea-for-two sets that were easily packed.''
</P>
<P>
   All kinds of services were made for travel by public and private
train cars and water on yachts and passenger steam ships. Chefetz
said these pieces make wonderful accents.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the holidays at hand, it's great fun to search for
holiday motifs on tableware,'' Chefetz writes in her new book.
``There is an abundance of turkeys, evergreens, rabbits, cherubs
and reindeer to be found on tableware made between 1880 and 1940.
... Pine cones were particularly popular during the Arts and Crafts
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be argued that for a table to be truly spectacular, it
must be placed in a truly spectacular setting _ and yet, a
thoughtfully planned table, lovingly set with treasured heirlooms,
is very much a world unto itself, much like a stage set, conjuring
up an exotic ambiance that transcends even the plainest environs,''
she added.

   Is it OK to admire Christopher Columbus again?
</P>
<P>
   You may recall that in 1992, the quincentennial of Columbus's
discovery of America, it most assuredly was not OK. Why, just using
a phrase like ``Columbus's discovery of America'' was enough to get
you in trouble with the commissars of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the National Council of Churches was accusing
Columbus of an ``invasion'' that led to ``genocide, slavery,
`ecocide,' and exploitation.'' The American Library Association
proclaimed that Columbus's arrival heralded ``a legacy of European
piracy, brutality, slave trading, murder, disease, conquest, and
ethnocide.'' The historian Glenn Morris indicted Columbus as ``a
murderer, a rapist, the architect of a policy of genocide that
continues today.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest teachers union, the National Education
Association, vowed that ``never again will Christopher Columbus sit
on a pedestal in United States history.'' In New York, the
Amsterdam News published a ``Wanted'' poster showing ``Columbus the
Thug.'' Russell Means, the American Indian activist, announced:
``Columbus makes Hitler look like a juvenile delinquent.''

   Nice talk. Makes you wonder why a national holiday was ever
created to honor the man. Or what the eminent Harvard historian
Samuel Eliot Morison could have been thinking when he wrote of
Columbus in 1954 that ``his fame and reputation may be considered
secure for all time.'' Or why generations of US schoolchildren were
taught to regard this 15th-century Genoan _ who believed to his
death that he had sailed not to America but to eastern Asia _ as
the first great American hero.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Columbus was not a sensitive 1990s male. He was
a zealot, greedy and ambitious. He was capable of cruelty and
deception. He was a mariner made harsh by many years at sea. But he
was also the man who sowed the seeds of Western civilization in the
New World _ a world that until then had known little more than
superstition, slavery, and savagery. ``The Aztecs of Mexico and the
Incas of South America performed elaborate rites of human
sacrifice, in which thousands of captive Indians were ritually
murdered, until their altars were drenched in blood ... and priests
collapsed with exhaustion from stabbing their victims,'' wrote
Dinesh D'Souza in a 1995 article in the journal First Things.
``When men of noble birth died, wives and concubines were often
strangled and buried with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Europe in 1492 was awash in its own superstition,
slavery, and savagery. Some of it came to the Americas with
Columbus. But what also came over were the distinctive Western
qualities that make it possible for human beings to rise above
brutality and enlighten themselves: a thirst for knowledge, a
passion for progress, notions of natural law and human rights, and
a Judeo-Christian ethic of justice and morality.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 20 years after Columbus reached San Salvador, Spanish
priests were decrying their countrymen's abuse of the American
natives. Bartolome de Las Casas, who sailed with Columbus on his
fourth voyage in 1502 and joined in the bloody conquest of Cuba,
became the 16th century's foremost champion of Indians' rights. He
took holy orders in 1512, freed his slaves in 1514, and spent the
next 50 years vehemently denouncing ``the robbery, evil, and
injustice'' done by European colonists.
</P>
<P>
   But no Indian holy men thundered against Indian cannibalism and
child sacrifice _ just as no Indian mariner sailed east and
discovered Europe. Only the culture that made possible an Age of
Exploration could make possible ``We hold these truths to be
self-evident; that all men are created equal.'' Columbus's glory is
not that he discovered America, but that he set in motion the
American epic, the highest flowering of the Western idea.
</P>
<P>
   He was a great man. Unschooled, he taught himself to read and
write _ Castilian, not Italian _ then studied geography,
cartography, theology, and cosmography. He was a seaman of
extraordinary skill, whose pre-1492 career had taken him north of
the Arctic Circle and south nearly to the equator. He was
monomaniacal on the subject of reaching the fabled East by sailing
west. For nearly eight years he struggled to find a patron to
finance his ``Enterprise of the Indies.'' Time and again he was
rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   And when Isabella of Spain finally agreed to stake his venture,
there were the journeys themselves to accomplish: thousands of
miles across uncharted ocean with no method but dead reckoning to
find his bearings. Columbus sailed without celestial navigation,
without longitude, without any reliable way to measure speed. It
was remarkable enough that he found his way to the Caribbean; even
more remarkable that he found his way back. And then to repeat the
trip three times! Even if he had discovered nothing, his nautical
achievements were phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   Admire Columbus? How can we not? For all his flaws, he was
magnificent. The dogs bark, but the Nina, the Pinta, and Santa
Maria sail on.

   BOSTON _ You know Oprah Winfrey. We all know her: She's
everyone's best buddy, the lady down the street with the warm-bread
voice and the infectious belly laugh. What's more, she knows we
know her _ she seems to understand that wherever she goes, she'll
be treated as a longtime friend. She is our crowned queen of
amiability.
</P>
<P>
   So when Winfrey breezed into Boston on a press tour for her new
film ``Beloved,'' she greeted reporters with an easy, unaffected
familiarity. She made eye contact. She memorized names. Articulate,
quick-witted, self-deprecating and smart, she answered questions
with candor and heat, discussing the film and the Toni Morrison
book on which it's based in impassioned bursts of talk. Here,
clearly, was a woman with zeal for her subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book spoke to me. The book deepened me in a way that I do
not have words to express,'' said Winfrey, wearing a simple brown
sweater with slacks. For ``Beloved,'' she earned two credits, one
as star (her first role in a feature film since ``The Color
Purple''), the other as a producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened me up to the experience, the humanity, of people who
every day reconstructed their lives and had the faith to love in
spite of their pasts. ... I wanted to create a movie where people
would feel the same thing. So when people come away feeling numbed,
they feel dumbfounded, staggered, they feel devastated,
overwhelmed, all of that _ I felt all of that when I read that
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jonathan Demme, ``Beloved'' examines the tortured
past and conflicted present of Sethe (Winfrey), an ex-slave haunted
by the ghost of her dead baby. When an old friend (Danny Glover)
becomes Sethe's lover, the apparition leaves. But the ghost
rematerializes in the form of an enigmatic young woman named
Beloved (Thandie Newton), and Sethe is forced to confront the past:
her life in slavery, her bloody escape and her role in the baby's
death. The story of Sethe and Beloved ``connects to all
experiences, all human experiences. The denial of your past, the
denial of your true existence, is the real death. To deny who you
really are is the real living death, and that's part of what Sethe
understood,'' Winfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past does have a life of its own ... and it will walk into
your house and sit at your table and call (itself) something else,
unless you're willing to look at it in truth. It just bleeds into
the future all the time. You can't deny it,'' she said. ``You can't
deny it. So free yourself. So free yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has championed a movie version of Morrison's book for
years, jumping through endless hoops in the search for the right
director. Demme, best known for ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and
``Philadelphia,'' was not her first or most obvious choice. She
considered foreign directors (``I thought: foreign ... sensitivity
...''), African-American directors, female directors. She even
asked Jodie Foster, who had written a thesis on the novel at Yale
and replied with ``a lovely `no' letter saying she didn't think it
could be on the screen _ that she thought this was a piece that
worked best as a piece of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   With razor timing, Winfrey stopped for a moment and smiled.
``She has changed her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those she interviewed was director Peter Weir, who
questioned Winfrey's ability to play the main character. Winfrey
was adamant: She told him she just needed to lose weight, that
Sethe ``is here, inside me somewhere.'' Weir suggested she give him
the rights to the book, ``and then we can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter in the group wryly noted the ``parade'' of directors
that had failed to make the cut. ``I never heard it described as a
parade,'' Winfrey replied, then started humming a spry little
circus tune. ``Peter Weeeirrrrr ... Jane Campionn

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Creating a collection is fun, especially when you
have collected bibelots and find they have appreciated in value
over time.
</P>
<P>
   Some items, of course, also can turn into gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these examples: In the 1994 auction catalog from
Sotheby's on fine Chinese ceramic, furniture and works of art,
snuff bottles were valued at between $600 for a carnelian agate
melon-form bottle all the way up to $70,000 for a rare Imperial
painted Peking enamel bottle.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, an enameled glass miniature double-gourd snuff bottle
from the Qian Long period (1736-1795) in China sold at Sotheby's
for $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   These snuff bottles could have been purchased for under $20 as
late as the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the humid climate of East Asia, snuff bottles were
more practical than snuff boxes, in which the powdered tobacco
caked when exposed to moisture. They were used in China for
centuries to hold cosmetics and medicines. Snuff was considered a
medicine, aiding in dispelling colds, provoking sweating, curing
pain in the eyes and teeth, easing throat ailments, asthma,
constipation and helping digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Snuff bottles that are considered to be antiques were
manufactured in China from 1644 to 1912 during the Manchu period or
Ch'ing dynasty. The bottles, with their richly carved or painted
surfaces and in some cases interiors, seldom exceed 2 inches to 3
inches in height. Their beauty comes from the material from which
they were made and the artistry employed to create these small
works of art. The art form includes telling legends and folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Early bottles were made of incised bronze, but as the demand
grew for snuff bottles, materials would grow to include carved
layers of colored glass, cloisonne, enamel, porcelain, coral, jade,
ivory, amber, soapstone, amethyst, turquoise, carnelian and white
jade. New snuff bottles continue to be made today in Hong Kong and
mainland China at affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   These tiny embellished bottles, corked with a domed cap that's
attached to a slender spoon, are no longer intended to hold
tobacco, but they continue to be prized for their beauty.

CAN BRUINS LIVE UP TO HIGHER EXPECTATIONS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A year ago at this time, the Bruins had just finished
auditioning a group of young and largely unknown commodities,
hoping they would develop into a competitive, cohesive unit.
</P>
<P>
   When the club departed for its annual journey west in October,
coach Pat Burns, in his first year behind the Boston bench, was
holding his breath, crossing his fingers, and wondering what he had
on his roster.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1-1 start at home, the Bruins impressed with a 6-2 trip,
playing those eight games in 15 nights. There were little in the
way of lofty expectations for Boston, which had missed the playoffs
for the first time in 30 seasons the previous spring. If there was
such a thing as rock bottom, the Bruins had found it.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, with a promising prospect named Jason Allison, an
exciting first-round pick named Sergei Samsonov, a previously
underused goalie named Byron Dafoe, and a living legend named Ray
Bourque, the Bruins rebuilt their fortunes. They finished with 91
points, 30 more than the year before, and were on their way. The
Bruins lost to Washington in the first round of the playoffs, but
the far more experienced Capitals went to the finals. It was a
first-round loss, but it was a jumping-off point.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bruins came to training camp to prepare for the 1998-99
season, it was in some ways a repeat of the previous fall. Allison,
Kyle McLaren (whose worth isn't as quantifiable but is substantial
nonetheless), Ted Donato, Steve Heinze, and Anson Carter were
missing. Heinze re-signed in short order. Allison and Donato
returned much later but were big shots in the arm to a team
composed of players many of whose first names were ``Who?''
</P>
<P>
   So, the season starts Saturday and what do we know? Are the
Bruins better? Have the contract squabbles hurt the camaraderie?
Have other teams improved more than Boston?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is the Bruins were able to sneak up on teams last
season, especially in the first half when more powerful clubs
viewed them as little more than a fly at the company picnic. Except
these guys wouldn't, didn't buzz off.
</P>
<P>
   This year, teams will see the Bruins coming. But the $64,000
question is: What will they be able to do about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody on the team feels like they are an
established contending player in the league,'' said
president/-general manager Harry Sinden. ``For instance, I feel
Jason's line feels it can operate with the top lines in the league.
I think Tim Taylor's line feels it is as good a checking line as
there is in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most impressive results of last season was that the
players bought into Burns's system, with help from assistant
coaches Jacques Laperriere and Bobby Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took the whole season to really get it perfectly in tune,''
said Heinze. ``But everybody talked about the first long road trip
and how we jelled. I don't know if that's because the system was
totally understood or guys started to get along and we had a better
team atmosphere. The system took a good third of the season to get
down pat where (Burns) wasn't yelling at a different guy each
night, saying, `Don't lose it at the blue line,' `Cover the middle
on the forecheck,' things like that. It just ended up being, `Work
harder,' by the end of the year. The system was understood.''
</P>
<P>
   There was insecurity last season, partly because of the poor
finish the year before, partly because there were so many new
faces, partly because no one knew what to expect. That insecurity
was wiped away by modest success, and now there are, lo and behold,
real expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year they were kind of in a developmental stage,
mentally, as to were they any good or were they terrible or did
they belong,'' said Sinden. ``I think now they feel they can
compete, once we get them back together, with the best teams.
That's why I think they're going to be better. I don't think
they're going to stand for poor performances as a team. Pat
wouldn't let them do it last year, but I think they're going to
help Pat this year that way. I don't think this team, if we get it
together like I hope we will, is going to say, `Well, it's the
Detroit Red Wings. We played a good game against them.' I think
they're going to say, `Damn it, we should beat this team.' They
should have that, which they certainly couldn't have had last year
because they were just put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, because of his personality and the circumstances, is
conservative in his thinking about this season. ``There are a lot
of things we still have to work on,'' he said. ``This has been a
different training camp than I've ever been involved in. I still
don't know who is going to start the year. It's been an up-and-down
camp. We're trying to fit players in places where we don't really
know if they're going to be there on a permanent basis. We tried
some guys, then we take them out, then we tried some other guys.
It's almost like a new type of training camp again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I know who's going to be here, and who we're going to
play with on a regular basis, it's really tough to gauge how we're
going to start off. When you start the season, we're still going to
have to go through stuff on a weekly and daily basis. That's how we
did it last year, too. With the drop of the puck, it's not like I
don't have to say anything anymore. It's all starting over again.''

BOURQUE AN ENDURING PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Ray Bourque was pondering how long he wanted his
playing career to last, 20 years sounded like a nice, round number.
He has since negotiated a contract extension that will take him one
year beyond that, but for now he is one of three National Hockey
League players entering their 20th seasons, with Rangers center
Wayne Gretzky and Canucks center Mark Messier the others.
</P>
<P>
   To put into perspective how remarkable that is, consider that of
all the players in the league's history, only 20 prior to this
season had played as many as 20 years. Larry Robinson, now coach of
the Los Angeles Kings, had done it most recently, playing his final
season in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been that many 20-year guys in the history of
the league, so to have three in one year, a lot of that is a credit
to the players of today who really train a lot harder,'' said
Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden. ``They maintain
their physical fitness at a level necessary to play in this league
a lot longer than they used to. Training camp is shorter now. Guys
used to come in in horrendous shape and play their way into shape.
We would have to take 10-15 pounds off 80 percent of the players in
training camp and we had six weeks to do it, but that doesn't
happen today. If you show up like that, you might not even get on
the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has been committed to fitness throughout his career,
working out in the summers with friend and trainer Ben Leduc.
However, as much as conditioning plays a part in the longevity of
players such as Bourque, Messier, and Gretzky, it goes beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say our passion is probably the same as it's always
been,'' said Gretzky, who was in Boston last week for an exhibition
game against the Bruins. ``Your excitement level changes. Things
that energize you and get you ready and get you excited about games
obviously change over time. I think the biggest thing of all, for
the three of us, is we truly have a love for the sport and we truly
respect the sport. We've never taken this game or this league for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Gretzky and Messier have been public ambassadors for
the sport, Bourque has gone about his career in a more subdued
fashion. Where Messier is the most outspoken of the three, Gretzky
has learned to deal with the spotlight in large part because of the
success he's had individually as well as on Stanley Cup-winning
teams. Bourque, while always cooperative and accessible to the
media and fans, has preferred to let his game do the talking for
him. All three are captains of their teams and have served in those
positions with dignity and class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all three of us have the same philosophy,'' said
Gretzky. ``Your preparation and your habits and your training
become even that much greater because you want to succeed. I think
that's why the three of us have the success to be able to keep
playing _ and not just playing but contributing to our teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruins coach Pat Burns said Bourque has been invaluable both in
the dressing room and on the ice. He has tutored a boatload of
youngsters in his career, most recently second-round draft pick
Jonathan Girard, who is 18. Last year, Bourque helped Hal Gill
become a bona fide NHL player, and he is also part of the reason
Kyle McLaren came along so quickly in his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   ``His presence is very, very important for younger players,''
said Burns. ``It can be intimidating for a young player playing
with him. You can see Girard sometimes, he feels like he has to
give the puck to him. Sometimes you don't have to. You can give it
to somebody else and Ray won't be mad at you. That's one of the
things, when you're playing with a 20-year veteran it can be
intimidating. I've seen a lot of guys play with Gretzky do the same
thing. Instead of giving the puck to the winger, they'll look for
him right away and sometimes that's not the proper play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ray settles everybody down, tells everybody to relax.
He just likes to be treated like one of the boys. He's the type of
player everyone would like to have on your hockey club. I feel
blessed just to be able to have him for the amount of time I'll be
here or he'll be here. I think he might be here longer than I am.
He might decide to sign another contract.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bourque came into the league, fans and media were comparing
him with one of the greatest players of all time _ Bobby Orr. After
Orr's career was cut short by injuries, Bruins devotees were hoping
for another superstar. Bourque said he never worried about the
comparisons because he knew there was only one Orr.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden argues that as great as Orr was and Bourque is, the two
couldn't be more different. ``They're absolutely totally different
people,'' he said. ``I don't say that in a negative way; they were
just totally different. They were in different eras. In a lot of
their good points, both of them are similar. But Bobby was much
more high strung than Ray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray holds a lot inside him. He contains his emotions and his
temper. He contains them very well. He doesn't have to let it out
to perform well. Some players have to get mad at the coach or
management or yell at somebody or go fight somebody or yell at the
referee. Ray doesn't have to do any of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes Bourque so special is that he has never made
a misstep since becoming a Bruin. When the Bruins were mired in
contract squabbles with several free agents at the start of
training camp, Bourque quietly went in to the team's offices with
his agent, Steve Freyer, and within 90 minutes had a new two-year
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't stop with Ray from the day he came here until
the other day when he signed,'' said Sinden. ``The example he sets
and the things he does always reconfirm and reassure that he is
what he really is. This hasn't been some kind of an act.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque contends he will keep playing as long as he's having
fun. ``I'm still looking at it like a little kid,'' he said. ``I
still feel like I've got something to prove. Every day you've got
to prove yourself, and that's how I've played this game my whole
career.''

   RUSSIA-KOSOVO _ MOSCOW _ In the United States' bid to convince
it's NATO allies of the need for military airstrikes against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the fighting in Serbia's
Kosovo province, persuading Russia has been the toughest task.
Although U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other U.S.
officials have said if a decision is taken to strike the Serbs the
Russians will not be able to stop it, most point to Russia's
outspoken resistance as a key reason the strikes have not happened
-- despite repeated warnings they could happen within days. A
longtime ally of the Serbs, Russia is butting heads with the U.S.
much in the same way it did with Iraq. Why? What does Russia stand
to gain? (Holmes, Cox News Service).

WILLIAMS DEFENDS WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT THE ALCS _ I was in my New York hotel room when the phone
rang at 9 a.m. yesterday. Ted Williams was responding to a week-old
message I'd left when our crack sports staff was assembling a
massive Red Sox-Yankees, American League Championship
Series-Armageddon preview. Our special section would have been
longer and jucier than the Starr Report but ... the Red Sox didn't
hold up their end.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there was no need to revisit the golden days of
Sox-Yankees when Ted called, but the greatest hitter who ever lived
was on the phone ready to talk. So I listened.
</P>
<P>
   Ted was wound up. Calling from Hernando, Fla., he hardly needed
a telephone to be heard in Times Square. Like all baseball fans,
this is his time of year _ playoff games every day, sometimes two
in one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is still the game,'' he said. ``I love to watch it
and I have three of my best friends here right now and all we're
doing is talking about the Braves and what happened last night and
the Yankees _ whether the guy was out of the base line going to
first. And they're all becoming experts, just like the Boston
writers. They don't know much, but they're experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Ted can say the word ``writers'' and make it sound like a
profanity. The Kid wasn't happy about the treatment Sox manager
Jimy Williams got from Boston sportswriters during the ill-fated
Cleveland series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manager did a stupendous job, and the thing I can't
understand is, how can the Boston writers second-guess what a great
manager like Jimy Williams does with his starting pitchers and his
closer? That is bush league. I'd have to take the manager's
expertise far and away over any of those writers. How they can even
look him in the eye if they wrote some of that crap when they know
nothing about it ... it just amazes me. I can't hardly get over it.
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted wasn't buying into the disappointment that engulfed Red Sox
Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched 'em on TV and I pulled like hell for 'em,'' he said.
``I think they did a hell of a job. Nobody picked the Red Sox to
win, and still, they were right there at the end. I think they
probably did as well as any club in the league with what they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that last game, I thought everything worked out exactly the
way they wanted it to work out. The kid starter pitched a hell of a
game and then they had as good a reliever as there is in the game
... and he gets beat. But how you can second-guess Jimy Williams?''
</P>
<P>
   The Kid still calls Nomar Garciaparra ``one of the greatest
hitters to come along in the last 20 years.'' He didn't know much
about Mo Vaughn's contract status but said, ``I'll just bet you he
stays with the Red Sox. That's just a wild guess from a tired old
ballplayer. I don't know how much money they've got to give him,
but he's a hell of a player and a good first baseman. He has
improved as a hitter and learned how to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bob Feller and other old-timers, Williams does not live
in the past. He's never claimed the game was better in his day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my lifetime of looking at baseball _ 70 years now _ I've
never seen more talent, more strength, more speed than I do in the
present array of players. But you guys don't realize that. You'll
be talking about it in 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   He loved watching Mark McGwire's march toward 70 homers (``He's
about as devastating as anybody I ever saw''). And, contrary to
popular opinion, Ted says it's possible to hit a home run when you
are trying to hit one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure. You try once in a while. The only time I tried to pull
the ball and hit a long one was when I had a count where I'm ahead
and a pitch where the ball looks like a watermelon. You take that
extra swing. But any time you got for a home run, you're hurting
yourself a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had tried to hit only homers, he said he'd have hit 50-80
points lower and added about 20 percent more homers. Williams said
he was going for the fence on about 21 of 521 career homers.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Sox' ill-timed batting slump against
Cleveland?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this for 50 years. It's harder to hit in the fall.
Like it is now. The weather's colder. The sun's lower on the
equator. The shadows are longer. The ball doesn't carry quite as
well and some of these pitchers are kind of revived by the cooler
weather. And the colder it is, the slower you can get the bat
around.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it. He was done talking, done ripping the Boston
writers. But he was back in front of his TV last night to watch the
Braves and Padres. Too bad he can't be in Boston tonight to throw
out the first ball of Game 3 of that Red Sox-Yankees series.

IS THERE A STORM AHEAD FOR THE BRUINS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Word from the West Coast has it that UCLA will make a decision
in the next few days on whether to reschedule its canceled game
against the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   What decision? Play the game. It's that simple. But of course,
it really isn't that simple.
</P>
<P>
   The game was scheduled to be played Sept. 26 in Miami, but then
Hurricane Georges came calling and the game was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Miami officials say they would love to play the game on the
first available date, which would be the weekend of Dec. 5.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA? Well, there's a problem. It seems the Bruins' regular
season ends two weeks earlier against Southern California. It seems
that the team banquet is scheduled for the week of Dec. 5. It seems
that it would hurt the Bruins in recruiting and that it would cut
down on the players' Thanksgiving vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Let the Bruins duck out and finish with a 10-0 record
instead of 11-0 or, heaven forbid, lose a game and finish 9-1. Then
let the computer spit out the numbers that will deterimine who will
play in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Let it compare UCLA's 10-0 or 9-1 with the potential 11-1 record
of a Florida State, which plays as tough a schedule as anyone in
the country and will play all of the games on its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   And then let's drop UCLA like a boulder in the polls. Don't want
to play a potentially tough Miami team at the Orange Bowl? Fine.
Then there's no reason for the Bruins to play for the national
title in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Let them stay home and play in the Rose Bowl against someone
like Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said he will make his
decision perhaps as soon as Friday, no later than Monday.
``Ultimately, it's my decision,'' he said. ``I'm certain I'll
disappoint people one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappoint? If Dalis chooses to duck the Hurricanes _ and that's
how this would be perceived _ he'll do more than disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   On a weekend when teams from the Southeastern, Big 12, and
Western Athletic conferences are putting their records on the line
in an attempt to win league championships, the prospect of an
unbeaten UCLA team staying home and digesting turkey leftovers is
simply outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the point may be moot. The Bruins travel to Tucson
Saturday night for a game against unbeaten Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   A UCLA loss will make the matter of whether the Bruins want to
play in December meaningless. But if they win and run the table,
then the final game of the regular season should be against Miami,
not USC.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA is worried about television, forget about it. CBS, which
owns the rights to the game, could schedule it in prime time as
part of a sports tripleheader that would include the Army-Navy game
and a college basketball regional package involving Connecticut,
Kentucky, and Michigan State, all of whom will be in the Top 10 in
the preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, CBS could switch it to prime time Friday night or
let ESPN pick up the game and show it Thursday night in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   When you look at all the factors, there is no good reason not to
play the game.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Poll position
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has been No. 1 in the Associated Press poll since the
preseason. Since the AP began a preseason poll in 1950, no team has
gone wire to wire at No. 1 ... South Carolina coach  &UR; Brad Scott  &LR; is
going through a rough year. Not only are Scott's Gamecocks off to a
miserable 1-4 start, but his wife,  &UR; Daryle &LR; , &UR;  &LR; broke her left ankle
and sprained her right ankle while leaving the stands following
last week's 30-28 loss to Mississippi. Said Scott, ``She's probably
out for the season.'' Unless South Carolina turns it around, in all
likelihood, so is Scott ... UCLA has not beaten Arizona in Tucson
since 1988 ... The first poll of the Bowl Championship Series
(which will decide who will play in the Fiesta Bowl) will be
released Oct. 27 or Nov. 3 ... It's been quite a recent few weeks
at Prairie View. Two weeks ago, the Panthers broke their record
80-game losing streak with a win over Langston. Then the program
was suspended by the Southwestern Athletic Conference after the
Prairie View adminstratrion ignored a two-week suspension issued to
the band, which was involved in a brawl with the Southern band
Sept. 19. Earlier this week, however, the SWAC backtracked and
lifted the suspension, saying it will take the matter under
consideration ... Nebraska, which barely survived an upset bid by
Oklahoma State last week, must travel to Texas A&AMP;M Saturday with a
huge question mark at quarterback. Both starter  &UR; Bobby Newcombe
 &LR; and backup  &UR; Eric Crouch  &LR; are hurt. ``You'd like to have your No. 1
guy ready to go,'' said coach  &UR; Frank Solich &LR; . ``You'd like to have
your No. 2 guy ready to go. We'll just see how that develops.''
Worst-case scenario? Former walk-on  &UR; Monte Christo &LR;  ... If Notre
Dame can get past Arizona State Saturday, the Irish could roll into
a bowl game. After the Sun Devils, who are off to a 1-3 start, the
Irish face Army, Baylor, Boston College, and Navy in the next four
weeks. The Irish should be favored in all of those games, and wins
would put them at 8-1, with a home game against Louisiana State and
a game at USC topping off the season. A loss against Arizona State
would put the Irish back where they were last month after getting
blown out by Michigan State ... Added to the Irish uncertainty is
the sore shoulder of starting quarterback  &UR; Jarious Jackson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; which
could leave freshman  &UR; Arnaz Battle  &LR; as the starter ... The
quarterback experiment is over at Florida _ for the time being.
 &UR; Jessie Palmer  &LR; has the job after alternating all season with  &UR; Doug
Johnson &LR;  ... UCLA must face Arizona without its rushing and scoring
leader. Tailback  &UR; Jermaine Lewis  &LR; was suspended for a week by coach
 &UR; Bob Toledo  &LR; because of his involvement in a fight at a party over
the weekend ... Syracuse is 2-2 and barely in the Top 25 after its
loss last weekend to North Carolina State. So how do the Orangemen
feel about their plight? ``We've watched film and are pretty
disgusted about how horrible we played,'' said safety  &UR; Jason
Poles &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tough question
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Want to know who has the toughest schedule? According to the
NCAA, it's Auburn. Based on last season's records of opponents on
this year's schedules, the Tigers are said to have the toughest
road in Division 1-A, followed by Florida, Alabama, Washington, and
Southern California. Interestingly, the only team in the Top 10 in
both this week's polls and the toughest-schedule ranking is
Georgia, which is No. 7 in the polls and has the sixth-toughest
schedule ... This week's sleeper team to watch is Wisconsin, which,
as predicted because of a cupcake schedule, is unbeaten and rising
steadily in the polls ... Some people don't learn _ or don't want
to learn. During last week's Ohio State-Penn State game, Buckeyes
quarterback coach  &UR; Joe Salem  &LR; inadvertently punched out the window
in the coaching booth, showering reporters below with glass. One
reporter,  &UR; Kim Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; was slightly cut. Jones, who covers Penn
State, is still waiting for an apology from Salem or another Ohio
State official. The response has been not only silence but
arrogance. Salem told  &UR; Bruce Hooley &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who covers the Buckeyes for
the Cleveland Plain Dealer, ``I'm going to start off by saying that
for every person who asks me about this glass-punching incident,
I'm going to make sure the next three home games you're sitting in
front of our damn booth. So if you've got a question, just be
prepared to sit in front of us for the next three games.'' Asked if
he would do it again, Salem said, ``That will just keep you alert,
that's all I know.'' Maybe Salem would think differently if Ohio
State officials put the families of the coaching staff in the row
beneath him. Then again, maybe not ... College football doesn't
have many legends in New England, but one of them, former Brandeis
athletic director and coach  &UR; Benny Friedman &LR; , &UR;  &LR; will be honored Oct.
16 at the Hall of Fame dinner held in conjunction with the
university's 50th anniversary. Brandeis's first athletic director
and football coach, Friedman, who died in 1982 at age 77, first
gained fame as a football player at the University of Michigan in
the 1920s ... Bryant, which is in its first season of football,
will try to go 3-0 vs. Pace Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You know Oprah Winfrey. We all know her: She's
everyone's best buddy, the lady down the street with the warm-bread
voice and the infectious belly laugh. What's more, she knows we
know her _ she seems to understand that wherever she goes, she'll
be treated as a longtime friend. She is our crowned queen of
amiability.
</P>
<P>
   So when Winfrey breezed into Boston on a press tour for her new
film ``Beloved,'' she greeted reporters with an easy, unaffected
familiarity. She made eye contact. She memorized names. Articulate,
quick-witted, self-deprecating and smart, she answered questions
with candor and heat, discussing the film and the Toni Morrison
book on which it's based in impassioned bursts of talk. Here,
clearly, was a woman with zeal for her subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book spoke to me. The book deepened me in a way that I do
not have words to express,'' said Winfrey, wearing a simple brown
sweater with slacks. For ``Beloved,'' she earned two credits, one
as star (her first role in a feature film since ``The Color
Purple''), the other as a producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened me up to the experience, the humanity, of people who
every day reconstructed their lives and had the faith to love in
spite of their pasts. ... I wanted to create a movie where people
would feel the same thing. So when people come away feeling numbed,
they feel dumbfounded, staggered, they feel devastated,
overwhelmed, all of that _ I felt all of that when I read that
book.''

   Directed by Jonathan Demme, ``Beloved'' examines the tortured
past and conflicted present of Sethe (Winfrey), an ex-slave haunted
by the ghost of her dead baby. When an old friend (Danny Glover)
becomes Sethe's lover, the apparition leaves. But the ghost
rematerializes in the form of an enigmatic young woman named
Beloved (Thandie Newton), and Sethe is forced to confront the past:
her life in slavery, her bloody escape and her role in the baby's
death. The story of Sethe and Beloved ``connects to all
experiences, all human experiences. The denial of your past, the
denial of your true existence, is the real death. To deny who you
really are is the real living death, and that's part of what Sethe
understood,'' Winfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past does have a life of its own ... and it will walk into
your house and sit at your table and call (itself) something else,
unless you're willing to look at it in truth. It just bleeds into
the future all the time. You can't deny it,'' she said. ``You can't
deny it. So free yourself. So free yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has championed a movie version of Morrison's book for
years, jumping through endless hoops in the search for the right
director. Demme, best known for ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and
``Philadelphia,'' was not her first or most obvious choice. She
considered foreign directors (``I thought: foreign ... sensitivity
...''), African-American directors, female directors. She even
asked Jodie Foster, who had written a thesis on the novel at Yale
and replied with ``a lovely `no' letter saying she didn't think it
could be on the screen _ that she thought this was a piece that
worked best as a piece of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   With razor timing, Winfrey stopped for a moment and smiled.
``She has changed her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those she interviewed was director Peter Weir, who
questioned Winfrey's ability to play the main character. Winfrey
was adamant: She told him she just needed to lose weight, that
Sethe ``is here, inside me somewhere.'' Weir suggested she give him
the rights to the book, ``and then we can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter in the group wryly noted the ``parade'' of directors
that had failed to make the cut. ``I never heard it described as a
parade,'' Winfrey replied, then started humming a spry little
circus tune. ``Peter Weeeirrrrr ... Jane Campionn

CHECK TAX EFFECTS BEFORE SELLING VANGUARD POSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 11, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER

<P>
   Q. I retired this past year. I am 69 and my wife is near 65.
Soon we will be receiving Social Security benefits totaling $12,500
a year. We have had the following portfolio for about 10 years. It
totals about $650,000. IRA accounts consist of $67,600 in Fidelity
Puritan, $40,000 in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, and $22,000 in
Fidelity High Income. Our taxable accounts consist of $203,000 in
Fidelity Cash Reserves, $42,000 in Fidelity High Income, $79,000 in
Vanguard GNMA, $76,000 in Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond, and
$76,000 in Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth. Finally, we
have $44,000 in Janus fund. I plan to buy property in Florida for
$130,000 and to realign the portfolio as follows: $123,000 in
Vanguard GNMA, $124,000 in Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond,
$120,000 in Fidelity High Income, $67,600 in Fidelity Puritan,
$40,000 in Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, and $44,000 in Janus. With
Social Security, I would like to pick up an income stream close to
$40,000 a year, while being pretty conservative and staying in the
15 percent tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   P.D., Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you've thought this out pretty carefully, and the
portfolio you suggested should, combined with Social Security,
deliver an income stream a couple of thousand dollars in excess of
your $40,000 target. If I read correctly between the lines, you
plan to leave the IRA accounts as they are, selling the entire
positions in Fidelity Cash Reserves and Vanguard LifeStrategy
Conservative Growth. After taking the $130,000 for your real estate
purchase, the remaining proceeds would be used to build the
positions in Vanguard GNMA, Vanguard Short-Term Corporate Bond, and
Fidelity High Income funds. This is fine as far as it goes; there
are no tax implications of selling the Cash Reserves position.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder about what might happen upon the sale of the
Vanguard fund. You report the portfolio is about 10 years old, but
that certainly can't be the case with Vanguard LifeStrategy
Conservative Growth, which was launched only in the fourth quarter
of 1994. My suggestion is that you analyze the tax effects of
selling that $76,000 position before you make a move.
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, there would be no immediate tax implications if
you were to sell the shares in Fidelity Puritan and use the
proceeds to build your positions in the fixed-income funds.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in a perfect world I would rather hold Fidelity Puritan
than Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth. But the first thing
I think of when contemplating the imperfection of the world is the
existence of the IRS. And what's the difference between the two
funds? Both balance investments between stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Puritan's portfolio is usually about 60 percent stocks
and 40 percent fixed income; the portfolio of Vanguard LifeStrategy
Conservative Growth typically is the opposite _ 60 percent
fixed-income and the rest equities. Over three years the results,
as reported in the latest Morningstar Mutual Funds report, are very
similar _ 12.32 percent average annual returns for the Vanguard
offering versus 12.24 percent for Puritan. Over the long haul, the
heavier stock position in Puritan should make it the better fund,
but for the moment, I think I'd sell the Puritan, simply to avoid
the tax consequences. One tactic you might adopt if you agree with
me about the merits of Puritan would be to sell small parts of the
Vanguard LifeStrategy Conservative Growth position each year,
keeping the amount of the sale small enough so that it wouldn't
cause you great grief on April 15. You could then use the proceeds
of the sales to rebuild a taxable account in Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 50 and would like to retire at age 63. At that time I
will have Social Security and a company pension based on 22 years'
service. My 401(k) account is currently worth $124,000, and is
divided among these Vanguard funds: Windsor II, 30 percent,
Institutional Index, 25 percent, Primecap, 20 percent, Asset
Allocation, 15 percent, and International Growth 10 percent. I am
maximizing my contributions to the plan, and my employer adds 4
percent, so the annual contributions come to $12,000. What will my
401(k) grow to in 13 years? Am I too diversified? The other options
in the 401(k) are Vanguard's LifeStrategy Conservative Growth,
LifeStrategy Moderate Growth, and LifeStrategy Growth funds. In
addition to the 401(k) I have a $21,000 deductible IRA invested in
Fidelity Growth and Income, and another deductible IRA invested in
zero-coupon government bonds, which will mature in the year 2016,
at which point they will be worth $102,000. What do you suggest for
an investment for a Roth IRA, into which my wife and I will each
contribute $2,000 a year for the next 10 to 12 years?
</P>
<P>
   J.D., Murrieta, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's start with the good news _ if you achieve 10 percent
average annual portfolio growth over the next 13 years, and
continue contributions at current levels, your 401(k) should grow
to $735,839. I'm not particularly enamored of the options on the
401(k) menu; with the exception of the international fund, these
eight options limit your stock market exposure substantially to the
large-cap universe, giving you no choices in the mid- cap or
small-cap arenas, and no other attractive options such as Vanguard
Specialized Health Care. Given the limited menu, I think you've
done as good a job of allocating the portfolio as you can, but
you're certainly not overdiversified. My suggestion would be to
lobby your company's officers for a broader menu of options,
including Vanguard Health Care, its Small-Cap Stock Index fund, and
(for selection as you get closer to retirement) its GNMA,
High-Yield Corporate Bond, and other fixed-income funds.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, since it's likely to take some time to get a
change there even if you are successful, I would make my selection
of investments for Roth IRAs serve to fill some of those gaps.
Since you won't be limited to Vanguard for those investments, I
suggest a good value-oriented small-cap stock fund such as Fidelity
Low-Priced Stock, and a health care fund focusing on
pharmaceuticals and medical equipment stocks, such as Vanguard's
Health Care fund or Fidelity Select Health Care.

SHARES OF FINANCIAL FIRMS UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is the stock market warning us about the future well-being of
Massachusetts financial services companies?
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope not. Financial stocks took another pounding
yesterday, extending the rout that began in mid-summer. Some
improved amid the market's furious last-hour rally, but most
remained under water.
</P>
<P>
   Other Massachusetts stocks have been hurt in the market
gyrations of the last week, including 50 with prices trimmed at
least 25 percent over the last five sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these steepest losses have taken place among high
technology companies like Aspen Technology Inc., down 70 percent in
the last week, Security Dynamics Technologies Inc. off 44 percent
in the last week and off 76 percent since May, and Pegasystems
Inc., which slumped 43 percent in the last week and 73 percent
since July. All three companies are based in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   These tech wrecks tend to be driven by a disappointing quarter
or some other events specific to those companies, which are
generally small. The financial stock debacle is broader and often
more painful. Nearly all financial companies, which are crucial to
the state's economic health, have suffered steep losses in the
stock market. Consider that:
</P>
<P>
   _BankBoston, hurt most by fears over its large Latin  &QC; 
American operations, has lost more than 50 percent of its stock
value since a peak set just three months ago. Fleet Financial Group
shares have slumped nearly 28 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   _Analysts believe pending acquisitions of Springfield
Institution for Savings and Sandwich Cooperative Bank appear to be
in serious trouble or headed for possible renegotiation, based on
recent stock activity.
</P>
<P>
   _Bank stocks may have received the most attention, but shares in
money management firms, insurance firms, and public businesses that
serve leading financial industries have also been rocked.
</P>
<P>
   Allmerica Financial Corp., the Worcester-based insurance
company, has shed more than 45 percent since August. Pioneer Group,
the Boston money management firm with interest spread around the
globe, is down 60 percent since July. Investors Financial Services
Inc., which performs back-shop duties for big money managers, has
lost 47 percent of its value since August.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston shares slumped to their lowest level in more than two
years yesterday, falling to as low as 25 3/4 before recovering to
27 5/8, off 1 1/4 for the session.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts warn that even if big banks generate some good news
soon _ and many are scheduled to report third quarter results next
week _ it will take longer to establish a firm bottom from which
stock prices can rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't emphasize enough that this is a market with no
conviction in anything, not earnings, not credit quality not
exposure to hedge funds,'' said analyst Nancy Bush of Ryan, Beck &AMP;
Co. ``The banks just don't have a lot of credibility in this
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two Massachusetts thrifts that had agreed to mergers
have suffered stock declines so serious they suggest the deals may
either be restructured or called off.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Springfield Institution for Savings have fallen from a
July peak of 52 5/8 to 29 1/2 yesterday. That 44 percent decline,
including a loss of 3 per share yesterday, reflects the slumping
shares of acquirer Peoples Heritage Financial Inc. of Portland,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Heritage had agreed to swap stock to buy the Springfield
bank. The deal was valued at $428 million at the time it was
announced in July.
</P>
<P>
   SIS can call the deal off if Peoples Heritage stock calls 20
percent or by 15 percent compared to the performance of a group of
other thrifts. Peoples Heritage shares, which have fallen nearly 50
percent since July, is near the 15-percent limit compared to other
thrift stocks, according to analyst James Ackor of Tucker Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   But Ackor said both thrifts appear committed to the merger and
would probably adjust the terms of the stock swap before calling it
off. ``Peoples is the preferred buyer in the eyes of (Springfield
chief executive) Bill Marshall,'' he said. ``The toothpaste is out
of the tube.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not quite the case on Cape Cod, where Sandwich
Cooperative Bank has agreed to be purchased by Seacoast Financial
Services Corp., the new holding company of Compass Bank for Savings
in New Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich shares, which were valued at 57 1/2 at the start of the
week, plunged by 16 1/2 to 37 yesterday. Officials at Sandwich and
Seacoast both said there was no news at their firms yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The real worry: Seacoast is a mutual holding company that must
covert to a public stock format to make the Sandwich deal work. But
the market for thrift conversions, which boomed only months ago, is
considered to be very doubtful today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Compass is going to to have a hard time finding the
(investor) demand to pull this deal off,'' said Ackor.

BRISBY HAS MOVED UP BY STAYING PUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ If you haven't noticed, there's a Vincent
Brisby revival going on.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year veteran, who came into the NFL with Drew Bledsoe,
has been to the valley and now is beginning to climb back to the
peak he reached in 1995 when he caught 66 passes for 974 yards, a
14.8-yard average. The strong season as one of Bledsoe's favorite
targets earned him a long-term deal with the Patriots through 2000
that averaged more than $1 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   But Brisby became a virtual nonperson in Bill Parcells's
thinking when he missed most of the '96 season with a hamstring
pull. He made it back last season and had one of the best training
camps of any receiver. In fact, his first four games of 1997 were
very impressive _ 11 catches, including a 31- and a 24-yarder. But
after that, he disappeared. When Terry Glenn was injured, Troy
Brown emerged as the top receiver, while Shawn Jefferson had one of
his best years.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding his plight, Brisby was openly scolded by Bledsoe for
not getting open while the quarterback was running for his life
against Jacksonville. Quarterback and receiver exchanged heated
words on the sideline, and confrontation seemed to get Brisby
going. Bledsoe went right back to him as Brisby caught four passes
for 58 yards in that game.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, he disappeared again, not resurfacing until the
7-6 playoff loss at Pittsburgh, where he caught three passes for 37
yards.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Brisby and his agent, Michael George, had
extensive conversations with the Patriots about a trade. The
Patriots permitted George to discuss Brisby with other teams. There
was interest, but no team was willing to give up a second- or
third-round draft pick, which the Patriots wanted. So Brisby stayed
with New England, committed himself to the offseason training
program, and became an intriguing part of Ernie Zampese's new
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese and the Patriots had been searching in the offseason for
a big, physical receiver, as the offensive coordinator had with
Dallas in Michael Irvin. The Patriots drafted Tony Simmons, who is
6 feet 2 inches, but they knew he was a longer-range solution.
</P>
<P>
   So they decided to look no further than their own backyard _ to
the 6-3 Brisby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just needed an opportunity to be involved,'' he said
Thursday. ``As a player, you want to see that you're in the game
plan. So right now I probably have more motivation because I see
that I'm in the game plan every week and that they have a role for
me and a need for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In training camp, Brisby wanted more than a role, he wanted to
start. Coach Pete Carroll told him he would get the chance to
compete and he was in the starting lineup for a couple of
exhibition games, but once the season began, Jefferson was back in
his starter's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both situations were tough,'' said Brisby. ``I think family,
players, and friends were all helping me believe in myself when
other people weren't. People were telling me that regardless of
what was going on, `you're a better player than how they're
treating you. Just keep going and keep praying you'll overcome it.'
That's what I did. I just kept working hard, and then when I had
the opportunity to voice my opinion, I did. I just let everything
else take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said not playing after he was healthy was tougher than
having his masculinity questioned by Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like when you're able to perform and you're not being
put in a situation to do it, that hurts even more than when you're
injured,'' said Brisby. ``Even though you want to be out there when
you're hurt, you can't be. It's physically impossible, and there's
nothing you can do about it. To be able to perform and not being
put in the position to make plays, that's tough, so I think last
year was tougher than the year before.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Parcells, ``Bill had his ways,'' said Brisby. ``Some of
them were based on negative criticism. As a player, I had the
experience with Bill, so I knew his style. I didn't make a big fuss
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll made it clear that Brisby would be part of a four-man
rotation in which the receiver with the hot hand would play. Last
week against New Orleans, Brisby made two key catches _ a 6-yard
touchdown on a diving grab of a low ball in the end zone in the
second quarter and a 27-yarder on which he faked inside, went
outside, and got knocked out of bounds as he held the ball high,
away from the defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the system works,'' Brisby said of the
rotation. ``When the opportunity presents itself, I have to make
the most of it. You can't be selfish about it, because we figure
all of the other guys deserve to play, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby said his rapport with Bledsoe has never been better. They
seem to know one another as well as Bledsoe and Ben Coates do.
There are times now when Brisby will tell Bledsoe if there's a
certain route that works best in a given situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say, `Drew, the curl route is going to work,''' said
Brisby. ``When I speak, I just tell Drew something that I think
would be good to run because of what I see out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm in there, Drew has indicated that he'll go to me if I
get the job done. If somebody is making plays, Drew is going to get
you the ball. I'm just trying to be consistent and not only catch
the ball but block for the other guys also.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby is expected to play a bigger role Sunday against the
Chiefs because Kansas City's two cornerbacks _ Dale Carter and
James Hasty _ are very physical and he has the strength to
outmuscle them. Such was the case in October 1995, the last time
the Patriots faced the Chiefs, when Brisby had a day that KC coach
Marty Schotteheimer mentioned during his press conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it was a real physical game and Dale and Hasty were
playing a lot of bump,'' said Brisby. ``The first play of the game,
I was trying to be physical with them just to let them know that
they weren't going to be able to take advantage of me physically.
We just battled all game. I made some plays. I felt like I won the
battle that day.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Schottenheimer's laudatory words, Brisby said, ``When I
play, I do my best. When I'm involved in a system, I do the best I
can. That's probably why he has high praise.''
</P>
<P>
   Brisby is putting personal considerations aside for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to make the most of it,'' he said. ``I'm
putting the team first. Any time I get the opportunity to do
something, I'm there for the team. I'm not really worried about it.
At the end of the season, then I'll look back and see what I did
personally and how did I take advantage of the opportunities I
had.''

QUIETLY, VIRGINIA BATTLE ENDS OVER COMATOSE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ The Bible-waving protesters outside the nursing
home have all gone away, the governor of Virginia has made and lost
his case in state Supreme Court, and the media have retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Only Hugh Finn's family now is holding vigil in Manassas, Va.,
since his feeding tube was removed last week, waiting for the
moment that will bring an end to anguished attempts to wake him
from three years of life without consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of the summer, the family has battled over the
fate of Finn, a 44-year-old former newscaster and father of two who
emerged from a car accident three years ago in a persistent
vegetative state. Their private agony has become a pitched battle
that has pitted in-laws, sisters, brothers, and parents against one
another, galvanized the public, and resulted last week in a
last-ditch court manuever by the governor of Virginia to delay the
tube-removal.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a federal judge rejected an emergency request by a
state legislator to have the tube reinserted.
</P>
<P>
   The case revisits the life-and-death question of who has the
right to decide whether to remove a feeding tube that is the
lifeline for people in a vegetative state. That question was
supposed to have been settled by a US Supreme Court ruling in the
Nancy Cruzan case in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   It also underscores the moral and emotional conflicts that roil
families whose loved ones are saved _ and perhaps also cursed _ by
medical technology that keeps them sitting upright, eyes open,
mute, physically alive but mentally and emotionally frozen. And it
is but a harbinger of the struggles to come, medical ethicists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing compared to how difficult it is going to be in
10 years to make these kinds of decisions,'' said Dr. Ron Cranford,
a Minnesota neurologist and expert witness in the Cruzan case.
``Hugh Finn is completely unconscious. What will happen when we
start to see people who are just outside the vegetative state,
severely brain-damaged with a little bit of consciousness?''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict erupted publicly this summer after Finn's wife,
Michele, 39, received confirmation of his diagnosis from a sixth
doctor: that he was paralyzed in a persistent vegetative state. Dr.
Robin Merlino, Hugh's attending physician at Annaburg Manor in
Manassas, said Finn was unable to respond to pain, feel thirst or
hunger, or ``communicate in any meaningful manner'' since his
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Finn had told his wife and his laywer, who had drawn up a living
will, that he prefered to die rather than persist in a vegetative
state. Without the hope of recovery, and in accordance with his
wishes, Michele decided it was time to remove his artificial
feeding.
</P>
<P>
   But members of the family, including Finn's parents and
siblings, as well as Michele's own sister, protested.
</P>
<P>
   They refused to accept the diagnosis, saying he was not dead to
the sensory world but had in fact communicated with them and others
by blinking in agreement, following individuals visiting him with
his eyes, speaking words and shedding tears. They also disputed his
wishes to die.
</P>
<P>
   The courts sided with Michele, determining that he would not
recover consciousness, that Michele had taken every measure
possible to rehabilitate her husband, and that she should remain
his legal guardian with the power to make health-care decisions for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Michele's sister Elaine Glazier wrote to state
Delegate Robert G. Marshall, a conservative Republican in the
district of Finn's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother-in-law, she wrote, ``has been speaking
intermittently since and before leaving Moss Rehab in Philadelphia,
began to develop a gesturing system for yes and no. ... Hugh's
feeding tube will be pulled on August 19, 1998, and he will be
allowed to starve to death by order of his guardian, and in keeping
with the Virginia Health Decisions Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is one of a few states with a law specifically stating
it is legal to remove feeding in such cases. Massachusetts has no
such law.
</P>
<P>
   After Michele had won her case, the family agreed not to appeal.
After weeks of turmoil and anguish, the family reluctantly decided
to remove the feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore, having been alerted by
Marshall, stepped in. Only days before Finn's feeding tube was to
be removed, the state announced it would appeal the case in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job as governor and my role is to protect those people who
are most frail in society and cannot necessarily protect
themselves,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, politicians, and lawyers around the country accused
Gilmore of exploiting a family tragedy to score points with social
conservatives, while antiabortion groups and others lauded his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   In its appeal, the state argued that removing the tube amounted
to euthanasia. The state's own examining physicians, however, had
ruled Finn to be in a vegetative state, and the Virginia Supreme
Court immediately rejected the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the question persists of why Finn's family and friends
insisted he showed signs of consciousness. Doctors like Cranford
explained that it is ``very typical'' for people to mistake signs
and gestures for consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the person is interacting with their environment,
their eyes move about and they randomly blink and look perfectly
normal,'' he said. ``It takes families weeks, months, years,
sometimes forever to see the person is in a vegetative state. Some
can never bring themselves to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only three known cases in the world where people who
suffered injuries like Finn's emerged from unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Cranford says that it is difficult to misdiagnose a persistent
vegetative state.
</P>
<P>
   For some members of the Finn family, this explanation may never
be acceptable. And for Michele, and those who supported her, the
bitterness toward the state may never fade, said her lawyer,
Gregory L. Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Michele was ``absolutely devasted and emotionally
torn apart'' by having to fight the state for the right to remove
the feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Gilmore and Delegate Marshall &UR;  &LR; have put me through
sheer hell,'' Michele said in a public statement after the state
Supreme Court ruled against the state. ``I don't see where they can
run roughshod over the law.''

STAR OF `BELOVED' IS BELOVED HERSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiled due to garbled text)  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union

   BOSTON _ You know Oprah Winfrey. We all know her: She's
everyone's best buddy, the lady down the street with the warm-bread
voice and the infectious belly laugh. What's more, she knows we
know her _ she seems to understand that wherever she goes, she'll
be treated as a longtime friend. She is our crowned queen of
amiability.
</P>
<P>
   So when Winfrey breezed into Boston on a press tour for her new
film ``Beloved,'' she greeted reporters with an easy, unaffected
familiarity. She made eye contact. She memorized names. Articulate,
quick-witted, self-deprecating and smart, she answered questions
with candor and heat, discussing the film and the Toni Morrison
book on which it's based in impassioned bursts of talk. Here,
clearly, was a woman with zeal for her subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book spoke to me. The book deepened me in a way that I do
not have words to express,'' said Winfrey, wearing a simple brown
sweater with slacks. For ``Beloved,'' she earned two credits, one
as star (her first role in a feature film since ``The Color
Purple''), the other as a producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened me up to the experience, the humanity, of people who
every day reconstructed their lives and had the faith to love in
spite of their pasts. ... I wanted to create a movie where people
would feel the same thing. So when people come away feeling numbed,
they feel dumbfounded, staggered, they feel devastated,
overwhelmed, all of that _ I felt all of that when I read that
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Jonathan Demme, ``Beloved'' examines the tortured
past and conflicted present of Sethe (Winfrey), an ex-slave haunted
by the ghost of her dead baby. When an old friend (Danny Glover)
becomes Sethe's lover, the apparition leaves. But the ghost
rematerializes in the form of an enigmatic young woman named
Beloved (Thandie Newton), and Sethe is forced to confront the past:
her life in slavery, her bloody escape and her role in the baby's
death. The story of Sethe and Beloved ``connects to all
experiences, all human experiences. The denial of your past, the
denial of your true existence, is the real death. To deny who you
really are is the real living death, and that's part of what Sethe
understood,'' Winfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past does have a life of its own ... and it will walk into
your house and sit at your table and call (itself) something else,
unless you're willing to look at it in truth. It just bleeds into
the future all the time. You can't deny it,'' she said. ``You can't
deny it. So free yourself. So free yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey has championed a movie version of Morrison's book for
years, jumping through endless hoops in the search for the right
director. Demme, best known for ``The Silence of the Lambs'' and
``Philadelphia,'' was not her first or most obvious choice. She
considered foreign directors (``I thought: foreign ... sensitivity
...''), African-American directors, female directors. She even
asked Jodie Foster, who had written a thesis on the novel at Yale
and replied with ``a lovely `no' letter saying she didn't think it
could be on the screen _ that she thought this was a piece that
worked best as a piece of literature.''
</P>
<P>
   With razor timing, Winfrey stopped for a moment and smiled.
``She has changed her mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those she interviewed was director Peter Weir, who
questioned Winfrey's ability to play the main character. Winfrey
was adamant: She told him she just needed to lose weight, that
Sethe ``is here, inside me somewhere.'' Weir suggested she give him
the rights to the book, ``and then we can decide.''
</P>
<P>
   A reporter in the group wryly noted the ``parade'' of directors
that had failed to make the cut. ``I never heard it described as a
parade,'' Winfrey replied, then started humming a spry little
circus tune.

   MOSCOW _ Imagine that your parents suddenly lost their jobs
because their bosses could no longer afford to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that your family could not get its money out of the bank
because the doors were locked and the automatic teller machine
(ATM) was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you went with them to the grocery story to get your
favorite breakfast cereal, only to find it was gone from the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is what life is like in Russia today for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   A SHORT HISTORY LESSON: Russia used to be part of the Soviet
Union, a vast country ruled under communism. The Soviet government
ran the economy and provided jobs for its people, but did not allow
them many personal freedoms like travel and public speech and
religion. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke up because it could not
keep its economy going and more and more people were demanding
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and many other countries once ruled under communism have
tried to change their political systems and economies to become
more like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, the change has been slow and the result in August
was an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENED: Russia has been spending more money than it
brings in. After several difficult years, it appeared that Russia's
economy would grow in 1998, but foreign investors began leaving and
Russia was forced during the summer to borrow billions of dollars
from the United States and others. When that ran out, the crisis
hit on Aug. 17. Seeking a solution President Boris Yeltsin fired
his government, but that only made things worse. After weeks of
turmoil, Yeltsin appointed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in
September. He is working on a plan to help the Russian economy and
hoping that the U.S. and other nations will give more financial
aid.
</P>
<P>
   BIG BUT SMALL; RICH BUT POOR: Russia is the largest country in
the world, almost twice the size of the United States. It is rich
in natural resources like oil, gas, timber and minerals, but its
people are very poor. In terms of the country's total output of
goods and services, Russia does not make the list of the world's
top 20 economies.
</P>
<P>
   It has 146.5 million people. But the number is declining as the
death rate outpaces the number of babies born. Poor health-care and
alcoholism means the life expectancy for males is 58 years old; 72
for women.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has moved slowly
towards a free-market economy. However, the bulk of the country's
wealth is in the hands of a small number of industrialists and
financiers. Meanwhile, most ordinary Russians have seen their
standard of living drop and many workers wait months for their pay.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM: Pretend you live in Moscow. The
national currency in Russia is the ruble. Every time you babysit or
mow a lawn, you make 50 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of August, that 50 rubles was worth about $8 (6.2
rubles  &QC;  $1). Now, because the ruble has been losing value in the
bad economy -- a process called devaluation -- the ruble is worth
only about $3 (16 rubles  &QC;  $1).
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of things you want to buy such as t-shirts, video
games and compact discs are rising rapidly, even as the ruble is
falling in value. And you can't raise your price of 50 rubles for
babysitting or mowing because the people who pay you are losing
their jobs and cannot afford to pay more, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Living standards in Russia were never as high as they were in
the United States, so the impact is felt even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly household income in Russia in June was 861
rubles, about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the
same income of 861 rubles is now worth about $50. Meanwhile,
inflation -- the measure of the increase in the cost of living --
was up 38 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   FIXING RUSSIA: It won't be easy. The crisis has raised a
fundamental political debate over whether Russia should revert to a
government-run economy as it had during Soviet times, or pursue
meaningful reforms to seek a free-market economy. The U.S. and
other countries are nervous about giving more aid, fearing it will
only be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA TROUBLES ARE U.S. TROUBLES: From 1946 until 1991, the
Soviet Union and America were involved in the Cold War, where they
sought to influence other countries and they built huge arsenals of
powerful nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic problems have forced it to cut back its armed
forces, but it remains the world's second largest nuclear power.
Russia has an estimated 22,000 nuclear weapons and caches of
weapons-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   So, a stable Russia is considered important not only for
Russians, but for the safety of the world.

MISSION

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As American John Glenn prepares for his return to space
later this month aboard the U.S. space shuttle, no one is watching
with more interest or envy than German Titov, Russia's second man
in space and the retired dean of the cosmonaut corps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am jealous of him. I would also like to fly again,'' Titov
said in a recent interview at the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics
in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Like Glenn, Titov is the senior surviving space traveler from
his country. And like Glenn, his space glory led him to a career in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that when I am as old as John Glenn I'll also be able
to fly in space again,'' quipped Titov, now 63 and a member of the
Russian parliament. But his smile faded as he added: ``I don't
think that is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian space program has been plagued by cash shortages and
technical glitches. Its troubled space station Mir, is scheduled to
end its service and plummet to earth next year. Amid the country's
economic crisis, Russia cannot afford to meet its obligations under
the planned international space station.
</P>
<P>
   But the Right Stuff lives on in Titov. He dismisses critics in
his own country who criticize public spending on space exploration.
``These people don't understand the critical importance of science
and explorations. It is what being human is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Titov followed Russian Yuri Gagarin, and Americans Alan Shepard
and Gus Grissom to become the fourth human to travel in space.
After Gagarin's sensational first flight, Titov gave the Russians
yet another coup over the fledgling U.S. space program.
</P>
<P>
   Then 25, Titov was the first man to spend a full day in space in
prolonged weightlessness, orbiting the earth 17 times on August
6-7, 1961. The experience also gave Titov the dubious bragging
rights as the first human to suffer the seasickness-like effects of
zero-gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Titov and Glenn met first in 1962, the year after each of them
flew in space. It was the first close encounter of an American
astronaut and Russian cosmonaut during the Cold War. (The two last
met in the summer of 1997 at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum
in Washington to promote an exhibit on Russian space exploration.)
</P>
<P>
   A scientific conference brought them together in Washington,
each man reflecting his country and the times. Glenn hosted the
Russian at an impromptu cookout at his home in suburban Virginia;
Titov brought the vodka.
</P>
<P>
   They have met several times since. But neither Glenn nor Titov
could have imagined in 1962 that they would each end up in politics
-- Glenn in the U.S. Senate and Titov as a Communist Party member
elected to the Duma, the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought our space careers would end with a trip to Mars.
The space programs were evolving that rapidly. But the end was
somehow different,'' said Titov.
</P>
<P>
   Titov and Glenn's path to space began much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Soviet military pilots were selected to train as
cosmonauts at a secret base, now known as Star City, outside Moscow
in 1960. By the end of the year the group was pared down to six,
including Titov and Gagarin.
</P>
<P>
   Titov was the backup for Gagarin's mission. The diaries of a
Soviet space administrator published in 1995 recalled that Titov
was perhaps more qualified than Gagarin -- but in the end Gagarin
was picked because of his easy smile and everyman appeal as the son
of peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Gagarin, who died in a 1968 jet crash, is a legend. He is buried
within the Kremlin walls and his name adorns streets and parks in
cities throughout Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Titov went on to become an air force general and was elected to
the Duma in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two birthdays -- Sept. 11, 1935, when my mother bore
me, and August 6-7, 1961, when the entire world knew there was this
person called Titov,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his fame never came close to the hero status reached by
Gagarin in Russia and Glenn in America.
</P>
<P>
   In those early meetings with Glenn and other American
astronauts, Titov recalls comparing notes about weightlessness and
the mechanics of eating, drinking and sleeping in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cold War was among politicians and military planners and
speechmakers. Cosmonauts and astronauts -- we had no problems. We
have a special bond,'' Titov said.
</P>
<P>
   But the years may have colored his recollections.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Glenn during their 1962 meeting in
Washington, Titov was guarded in answering questions about his
Vostok-II spacecraft and would discuss space cooperation only in
the context of disarmament, the Washington Star newspaper reported
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's historical summary of the early years of the space
program reflects the anxiety Americans felt over Titov's flight in
an age that fueled fears of the Soviets lobbing warheads from their
capsules in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people admired the Soviet's technological proficiency but
were concerned by the strategic implications. The fact that Titov's
orbital track in a near-polar plane carried him over the United
States three times was alarming to some people,'' the NASA history
says.
</P>
<P>
   Titov hopes Glenn's shuttle flight will renew interest in space
exploration, both in America and Russia, and that cooperation
between the two countries will continue.
</P>
<P>
   But he notes with sadness that his own nine-year-old grandson

   Finally, the long line of aspirants led to Demme. She knew from
the first meeting. ``And I never, ever regretted it, even when I
disagreed,'' Winfrey said. ``You know, there were some days when I
had disagreements, but he was always right I have to tell you. He's
always been right, and that's really not an easy thing for me to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would have been a different movie without him,'' she
continued. ``Because, if I'd had a director I could have pushed
around, I would have played (Sethe) with a greater sense of
sentimentality _ and I would have ruined the movie. It would have
ruined the movie for her to be sentimental, because she isn't.
That's what makes her what she is _ there's not a moment's sympathy
she has for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Winfrey shed tears while uttering some of Sethe's most
painful dialogue _ including an agonizing recollection of white men
sucking milk from her breasts. Winfrey couldn't speak the lines
without crying. So Demme corrected her. And corrected her: Sethe
would not weep for herself. ``So he said to me, `Listen. Go empty
yourself. Do whatever you need to do.' So I cried in the corner,
just boo-hooed in the corner, then I came back. I was clean. I did
it his way _ the best way, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   She played the scene without tears.``I've always wanted to be an
actress, and my father didn't want me to be,'' said Winfrey, who
received an Oscar nomination for her performance in Steven
Spielberg's ``The Color Purple.'' ``My father said: `No daughter of
mine ...,' and, `How do you think a negro girl's gonna get a job
acting?' To my father, acting is synonymous with stripping your
clothes off and running nude around a room.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Winfrey would allow his daughter to teach acting,
however, so she majored in speech and drama with an eye toward a
career in education. She was a student (and radio broadcaster) at
Tennessee State University when a local news director phoned and
offered her a job in television. So began one of the most
extraordinary _ and fruitful _ careers in broadcasting, culminating
in last month's decision to extend her daytime talk show through
2002. She'll wear the producer's hat again for ``Tuesdays with
Morrie,'' a film version of Mitch Albom's best-selling book. Her
goal, she said, is ``finding something that speaks to me. ... It
takes a lot of work to do this well. It really does. And it takes
as much time to do it poorly as it does to do it well. If you take
the time off to do a movie, for me, it needs to speak to you or be
meaningful in a way that it's going to speak to other people
because it's a lot of your energy. I think acting is the ultimate
in compassion, and empathy, because you've got to step into
somebody else's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey, it turns out, is a profound believer in art and its
power to change lives. ``That's what art does for you,'' she said.
``That's what real art does for you. You know, you hear a beautiful
pianist, and even though I can't play a note on the piano, I feel
like it touches something inside me, and I can be a better person.
... When I saw `Phantom of the Opera,' I heard those voices, and I
went out thinking, `I'll do my own theme song.' She laughed. Only
kidding. ``No, I went out thinking, `Tomorrow's gonna be better for
me. I'm gonna do better,' she said. ``And isn't that what art
does?''

IT'S THE GREAT WHITE WAY, CHARLIE BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is a little-known fact, but the most-produced American
musical of the past quarter-century is ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown.'' Why? Mainly because high schools, community theaters, and
summer-stock companies can mount the 6-person show cheaply _ it ran
for years in New York's Greenwich Village with a two-piece
orchestra and virtually no set _ and fill the house. The animating
spirit of Charles Schulz's comic strip characters, and the music,
lyrics, and book by Clark Gesner have delighted millions of
theater-goers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 31 years after its debut, a ``Charlie'' revival is headed
for Broadway. But the new ``Charlie'' ain't the old ``Charlie.''
The producers are promising an ``ethnically diverse,'' grandiosely
designed show by hot Broadway director Michael Mayer. Schroeder is
an African-American. B.D. Wong of ``M. Butterfly'' is playing
Linus, and Anthony Rapp, the original Mark Cohen from ``Rent,''
will be Charlie. ``It's going to be a `Charlie Brown' for the
90s,'' says Michael Leavitt, an executive for the show's
co-producer, Chicago-based Fox Theatricals.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Gesner hadn't paid much attention to the
revival. He spent the summer acting at the Weston Playhouse in
Vermont, and producing his own cabaret show in New York, called
``The Jello is Always Red.'' But when he learned that Fox had
booked the show into Broadway, and that Matthew Broderick was being
wooed for the lead, he started to get nervous. ``I've said no to a
Broadway revival for 30 years,'' says Gesner, who must approve any
script or song changes for the new, megabucks ``Charlie.'' ``What I
heard about it made me uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mayer _ who once acted in ``Charlie'' _ is planning
some changes. He may re-name one of the six characters, and add at
least one new song to the show. The show's backers emphasize that
the proposed changes are copacetic with Peanuts creator Charles
Schulz, and with Arthur Whitelaw and Gene Persson, who produced the
1976 original. Says Persson: ``Obviously we want Clark to be part
of the process. We expect him to be happy with the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gesner and Mayer sat down for lunch about a month ago, and it
came off amicably. Says Gesner: ``We did agree about keeping the
core of the show.'' Gesner is the world's last gentleman and will
go to extraordinary lengths to avoid a conflict with ``Charlie'''s
new friends. On the other hand, he notes: ```Charlie Brown' is such
a delicate and small thing, I don't want them to ruin it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DURRES, Albania _ Many nights, Sahit Tola's 4 1/2-year-old
daughter will awaken in terror and crawl from her mat to seek the
sanctuary of her father's bed.
</P>
<P>
   The crackle of gunfire, an almost nightly phenomenon in this
unsettled country, startles her from slumber. The sounds play a
cruel trick on her sleeping mind, making her think for a brief
horrible moment that she is back home in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, after days of thunderous shelling near their small
hamlet of Djakovo, her parents decided the time had come to go. The
couple gathered their daughter, 8-year-old son and what things they
could carry.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving in mid-afternoon, they walked away from their village of
300 and headed west. For two days, the parents subsisted only on
the cold fresh water that flows in the Dinaric Alps, the jagged
mountain range that rises between Kosovo and Albania. The children
also had rations of candy. At night, they huddled together to keep
warm, not lighting any fires for fear they would be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, standing outside the half-built apartment house where
his family has found shelter near the port city of Durres, Tola
looked thin and tired as he retold his family's tortured odyssey.
He still wore the pale green sport shirt and jeans he wore the
afternoon he decided to flee. As he spoke, his daughter clung to
him, her blue saucer-like eyes not blinking as she studied a
visitor. She didn't return smiles; she said nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's suffering from some kind of trauma,'' said Tola,
a 38-year-old factory worker. ``I've told my children about the
fighting -- they know who the Serbs are. But what more can I say to
them?''
</P>
<P>
   The fighting in Kosovo has made refugees of thousands of
families like this one. International monitors estimate that
250,000 ethnic Albanians have fled their homes during the seven
months of intense fighting between Serb forces and rebels of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, or KLA.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, which is about 90 percent ethnic Albanian, is the
southernmost province of Serbia, one of the two remaining republics
of Yugoslavia. Kosovo was largely self governing before 1989, when
Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic placed the region under
direct Serb rule.
</P>
<P>
   The loosely organized KLA is fighting for independence, while
Serb officials say they are trying to quell a rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   While most refugees have found shelter, up to 50,000 remain out
of doors in the rugged mountains of Kosovo. If they remain
unprotected, relief and government officials fear many may die when
the winter arrives in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 refugees have come to Albania, with officials here
preparing for another 20,000 -- in the belief that most of the rest
either will remain in Kosovo, or go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But what if more -- perhaps many more -- decide to turn to their
fellow Albanians for shelter?
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the question, Esma Boksi, an official in the northern
Albania town of Shkodra, takes a deep breath and lets the air
escape slowly through pursed, downturned lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then God help us,'' she says somberly. ``We can do no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Since June, 4,800 of the refugees have registered with Boksi, a
town hall worker pressed into service as refugee registrar. They
have come in waves of 1,000 or more, the ebbs coinciding with Serb
advances. These days, weeks after officials believe the refugee
flood has subsided, 20 or so a day still trickle into Boksi's
office. They seek identification cards, and information about food
and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Boksi sees some irony in the Kosovars' asking for help in a
place like Shkodra. ``This is the poorest place in Albania,'' she
says, noting a 20 percent unemployment rate and the that about a
third of the families here are on government relief. ``Yet, we give
them bread and cheese when they come, all we can give.''
</P>
<P>
   She needs no statistics to support her point.
</P>
<P>
   Outside her small office in a decaying building in central
Shkodra, the street is more pothole than pavement. Craters in the
street and sidewalks are filled with a milkshake thick ooze of
standing water and the gray silt that covers everything.
</P>
<P>
   A few streets away, venders sell fruits and vegetables from
blankets laid down over mud. Nearby, goats, bone-thin wild dogs and
pigs rummage through the garbage and rotting unsold produce. Many
windows have no glass, and few buildings seem to enjoy even basic
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   It is no easy task to distinguish between the living conditions
of host and refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, about 2,500 refugees remain in the Shkodra district, many
in private homes, where the government has paid locals a supplement
of $10 a head to defray the costs of sheltering on average 15
refugees per family.
</P>
<P>
   Others have been placed in modest hotels and makeshift
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 have found shelter in a warehouse adjacent to the
Catholic Church of Lady Rosare. On Wednesday, construction workers
were laboring to convert the warehouse into living quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, more than 50 families -- usually two families to a room
-- live in the dormitory that rumbles all day with the sounds of
hammering and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Fatos Stogha and her family of eight live in a room the size of
an American master bedroom. Stogha, 44, stands barefoot at the door
with her tall, lanky 15-year-old son Ruke, a bright-eyed boy who
seems eager for a diversion.
</P>
<P>
   The room is dark, poorly ventilated and affords no privacy.
There are two toilets in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Stogha said her family left Decani four months ago. The town,
about 44 miles from Pristina, the Kosovo capital, has seen some of
the war's fiercest fighting. She believes her house was destroyed
in a Serb offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In her room are four steel-framed beds. Along the walls are
cardboard boxes of their possessions. They take their meals in a
makeshift canteen.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the conditions seem harsh to an outsider, she says
she has been well cared for and expressed deep gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to go home,'' she says. ``I want to go there as
soon as it is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With winter coming, officials are struggling to cope with the
needs of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be plenty of food thanks to international relief
organizations, but there is some concern about distribution once
winter comes and already difficult roads become impassable.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, the single largest concern remains getting and
keeping roofs over the refugees' heads.
</P>
<P>
   It is a prospect made difficult because of the complex and
unstable political and legal conditions in this impoverished former
communist state. ``For example, they have the money to remodel
public buildings to make the dormitories,'' said Boksi, the Shkodra
official. ``But the town government has sold the public buildings
to private owners. There are very few public buildings left.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the refugees will have to leave, but no one hazards
a guess when that time will come. There are no plans to close the
border, and government officials and humanitarian groups are
planning for an indefinite stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will care for them as long as it is necessary,'' said
Tauland Dedja, the government official assigned to coordinate
refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet international observers worry the presence of the Kosovars
is providing a destabilizing force for an already fragile
government. The country is a tinderbox where government armories
have been looted and most nights feature various levels of gunfire
-- usually just young men enjoying the power of firing a
semi-automatic rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can take care of the humanitarian needs,'' said
Daan Everts, the ambassador here for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. ``The bigger matter is the political
problem this poses for an already very difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian President Rexhep Meidani also worries that the Kosovars
will be destabilizing. ``This is a serious concern,'' he said
through a spokesman. ``Without international support, Albania does
not have a proper infrastructure to support the accommodation of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult with a poor economy, great unemployment,
a lack of security and a high degree of criminality,'' he said.
``The influx of refugees makes an already bad situation even
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some refugees are angered by what they view as the
government's appeasing stance toward Milosevic. The Albanian
government does not support full independence for Kosovo but does
favor more autonomy for the province. ``We want a balance between
the right of the Kosovars to self determination and the right of
Yugoslavia to territorial integrity,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But for refugees eager to lash out at the Serbs, this position
is too conciliatory, and Meidani worries they may be fomenting
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 200 refugees were among those arrested during the
September uprisings in Shkodra and the capital Tirana, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Meidani sees no easy and quick solution. ``With all that has
happened, all the killings and atrocities, there is a new memory,''
he said. ``This will take a long time for everyone to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Refugees are in near unison in their assessment of what it will
take to make it possible for them to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry to see the power of the U.S. military employed to avenge
them, they want NATO forces to strike hard at the Serbs and drive
them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the Americans to deal with the Serbs,'' says Skender
Idrizaj, who is among the 50 or so refugees housed at the Hotel
Rozafa in Shkodra. The 52-year-old construction worker seethes over
the way he says the Serbs treated him and the other men from Decani
who escaped together last July.
</P>
<P>
   Idrizaj, a thin man with an enormous gray mustache, sits on his
haunches between two sofas in the hotel's large, dimly lit lobby
rolling cigarettes with thin white paper and finely chopped tobacco
as he talks.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces intercepted the group of Kosovars with which he and
his family were traveling in September, he said. The Serbs
separated the men from the women. ``They told us they were going to
liquidate the men,'' he said. ``They made us stand up for two days
and made us drink sewage water.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian authorities deny mistreating the Kosovars and say
such stories are exaggerated to help convince the West to take
military action.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this and similar stories were repeated frequently and
consistently last week by Kosovar refugees in different parts of
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Serbs freed them: Idrizaj believes they feared
being caught by Red Cross and other relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   How long will the Kosovars remain in Albania?
</P>
<P>
   He closes the metal box of tobacco and stows in in his jacket
pocket. ``We will stay away until the Serbs leave,'' he says,
licking the paper and rolling it closed. ``But if NATO and the
Americans don't act, maybe we will go back anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't live in this hotel the rest of our lives,'' he says,
lighting the twist of tobacco-filled paper and taking a deep drag.
``We'll go back to die there, to die together.''

NEVADA GAMBLING GROUPS BATTLING CALIFORNIA'S INDIAN GAMING
INITIATIVE WITH BIG MONEY 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMECULA, Calif. _ Turn on a television anywhere in California
these days and you're going to get an expensive earful on the
state's Indian gaming initiative.
</P>
<P>
   With the vote still weeks away, the massive amount of airtime
being bought by both sides virtually guarantees that Proposition 5
will break the state's previous $58 million record for spending on
a ballot measure _ thereby setting a national record as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before all is said and done, I think Proposition 5 is going to
do like Mark McGwire _ not just break the record but shatter it,''
said Mitch Zack, a spokesman for California Gov. Pete Wilson's
political office.
</P>
<P>
   The issue before voters is whether the state's Indian tribes
will be allowed to operate legally the slot machines they have had
in their casinos for years.
</P>
<P>
   But a huge amount of money is at stake: how much more the Indian
tribes stand to earn from this already-lucrative industry, and how
much neighboring Las Vegas stands to lose at the hands of their
nascent competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For the campaign reporting period that ended Sept. 30, the
coalition of Indian tribes supporting Proposition 5 had raised
$42.7 million. The opponents report contributions of $15.5 million
- which means the two sides raised a combined amount of money equal
to the 1996 spending record with five weeks until the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their history of poverty, the tribes are outspending
their moneyed opponents - a Las Vegas coalition whose big donors
have been Hilton Hotels Corp. with $ 4.3 million, Circus Circus
Enterprises with $4.4 million and Mirage Resorts with $4.3 million
</P>
<P>
   Proposition backers, who call themselves Californians for Indian
Self-Reliance, have spent about $36 million to date, said spokesman
Dan Pellissier.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us the spending issue is driven in large part by what we
have to do to compete with the misinformation being spread by our
opponents,'' Pellisier said. ``The burden of proof is on us to
educate the voters. We've been largely successful in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The state government has been quarreling with the tribes for
years over what kind of gaming is legal in the Indian casinos, all
of which sit on reservation lands. The federal Indian Gaming
Regulatory Act of 1988 restricts the tribes to types of gaming
already legal in the state, and requires the tribes to sign
compacts with the state government.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos, many of which started as bingo parlors, evolved
into rather large-scale, highly profitable operations over the past
decade without compacts. And while California law allows a lottery,
bingo, off-track betting and card clubs, the state's constitution
specifically prohibits ``casinos of the type operating in Nevada
and New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   The major sticking point is the thousands of video slot machines
which proliferate in the Indian casinos. U.S. attorneys in
jurisdictions throughout the state have in recent months threatened
to seize the machines as illegal, because players were ``betting
against the house,'' as in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson, saying he would only deal with tribes who were
not breaking the law, negotiated a restrictive compact for a
limited number of slot machines with the Pala Band of Mission
Indians, who do not have a casino. He also forced a handful of
other tribes to accept the agreement with threats of seizing their
illegal machines. But some of the wealthier gaming tribes called
the deal unworkable and began seeking signatures to force the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And legal observers still predict a court fight even if
Proposition 5 passes.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents' advertisements hope to convince the average
Californian that a vote for Proposition 5 will fuel a huge boom in
unregulated, untaxed gambling, turning the state into a place where
no residential neighborhood is safe from a casino.
</P>
<P>
   But the Indian tribes backing the gaming initiative have the
clear public relations advantage, both in terms of the real poverty
still experienced by many non-gaming California tribes (who would
receive a percentage of the casino tribes' profits under
Proposition 5), and a reservoir of public guilt over the tribal
history of mistreatment at the hands of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   One brochure distributed by the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians
features an illustration of what looks like Custer's Last Stand,
and advises, ``The old way to steal from the Indians was to send in
the Cavalry. Today it's Las Vegas casinos, politicians, slick
lobbyists.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate a majority of California voters intend to
vote for Proposition 5.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pechanga casino in Temecula, a voter registration booth
sits prominently in a courtyard that players pass while moving from
one gaming room to another. One volunteer said they have registered
about 2,000 people to vote at the casino in recent weeks - many of
them people in their 50s and 60s who say they have never voted
before.
</P>
<P>
   In a small office up the hill from the casino, surrounded by
boxes of Proposition 5 support material and brochures, tribal
members and Proposition 5 organizers Jill Sherman and Donna Baron
said there is no reason to believe passing the initiative would set
off a boom in Indian casinos. A lot of the reservations are in
areas that are just too remote to support a casino, Sherman said.
``So it's an Indian issue. It's not going to up the ante for anyone
else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of gaming are obvious, according to tribal council
member Andrew Masiel. ``Tribal members have been able to buy mobile
homes, fix their homes, purchase better vehicles. We've been able
to build a fire station, a playground, a park, a government
center.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventy-five percent of our business will be gone if
Proposition 5 doesn't pass, because they'll force us to shut down
those (non-lottery style) slot machines,'' Sherman said. The tribe
estimates it would cost about $13 million to buy the kinds of game
machines described in the Pala compact that have not yet been
designed.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue goes beyond the money. ``They said they'd close
the door before they'd sell our sovereignty,'' Sherman said,
referring to the tribal council.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the Indian casinos in California are no match
for the glitz of Las Vegas. But studies show that Las Vegas draws
about 35 percent of its clientele from neighboring California.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of
Gambling and Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada at Reno,
explained that growth in Las Vegas has been ``soft'' for the past
two years, both in terms of visitors and gaming revenues. Air
carriers have reduced the number of flights to and from Las Vegas
in favor of more profitable cities. And casinos have noticed a
measurable drop in high end players because of the Asian economic
crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to panic, five major hotel projects will be
completed next year, adding 20,000 more hotel rooms to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mulhal, spokesman for the Nevada Resort Association, said
despite his state's obvious financial stake in the outcome of
Proposition 5, Nevada gaming companies also know from their own
cities' history that tight regulation of gaming is necessary _
something he says is absent under Proposition 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the claims by proponents of Proposition 5, the clear
reality is the federal government has not yet dedicated the
resources ... to come anywhere near the levels of scrutiny and
diligence the New Jersey gaming control or Nevada gaming control
operations have,'' Mulhal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You add to that the tribes are not taxed, don't have any of
the community obligations, they don't have to provide workers
compensation _ you can see how unfair the competition would be,''
Mulhal said. ``Because make no mistake about it, the competition in
the gaming industry is there and it's growing because gaming has
proliferated around the country. There's no doubt Las Vegas is up
to the challenge, but if it's unregulated and untaxed, that's
tilting the playing field.'' &QL;

`CRIME' DOESN'T PACK ENOUGH PASSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, well. A network known for crashing asteroids and other
supernatural wonders takes on a classic novel, one of literature's
most memorable characters and an intricate premise that remains
rich even by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   The result for NBC is a handsome-looking and well-acted, if not
somewhat tedious, adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky's ``Crime and
Punishment'' with Patrick Dempsey as the young, guilt-ridden
student Rodya Raskolnikov. Those who labored through the novel
won't be satisfied that due reverence has been paid, but I can't
remember when a film adaptation, let alone a TV movie (even from
the well-respected Hallmark, as here) lived up to its literary
source.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the major problem with ``Crime and Punishment'' (8 p.m.
CDT Sunday, NBC) is that the core issue of Dostoevsky's novel _ do
extraordinary people, because of their greatness, have the right to
commit any crime and remain unpunished? _ goes practically
unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   We are left with dream sequences and ever-too-brief exchanges
between Raskolnikov and Magistrate Porfiry (Ben Kingsley), who
suspects Raskolnikov in the killing of a corrupt pawnbroker and her
sister, an innocent bystander returning home while Raskolnikov was
still in the apartment rifling through his victim's valuables.
</P>
<P>
   Raskolnikov is a brilliant but impoverished student, and Dempsey
portrays him as a mixture of upper-crust snob and liberal
revolutionary. No wonder that immediately after the murders,
committed with an ax, he suffers debilitating pangs of conscience.
This is, after all, a man who rushed into a burning home to save
small children, and verbally scolded his sister for marrying for
money. Unable to keep his tortured soul from taking over his
exterior, Raskolnikov attracts the attention of the magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the psychological wars ensue, though ``Crime and
Punishment'' doesn't exploit that, either. Magistrate Porfiry is
convinced that people who get away with crimes become tortured
souls begging for forgiveness, and even before he lets Raskolnikov
know that something is amiss, we can see that he is merely waiting
for Raskolnikov to burst.
</P>
<P>
   As Raskolnikov says shortly after the murders: ``I'm not ashamed
of what I've done. I will not let guilt betray me.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of Dostoevsky's book lies in its recognition of the
fact that we all may have a murderous side, and of how committing
such a crime could make one confess, if only for the sake of a
peaceful soul.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey is magnificent as Raskolnikov. In fact, by the film's
end, he doesn't look like a recognizable human being.
</P>
<P>
   While their scenes are far too brief, there is also instant
chemistry between Raskolnikov and his love, played by Julie Delpy,
who is well-cast here. I can't think of anyone with a more perfect
European face.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   One of the many insanely preposterous fight scenes in ``Dollar
for the Dead'' is when Emilio Estevez, as a young gunslinger with
no name and little patience, is trapped inside an upstairs room.
With bars on the window and a dozen gun-wielding bad guys fast
approaching, he pulls out two large pistols, points them at the
floor and starts firing, spinning in a circle.
</P>
<P>
   As the bad guys burst in, Estevez smiles, then conveniently
drops through the punctured floor. Waiting for him on the ground
floor are a half-dozen others, guns drawn. As they fire countless
rounds, a running Estevez raises his pistols and fires, hitting
them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mister, you're sure pretty good at killin','' an
impressed stranger tells him at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Quips Estevez in an almost apologetic tone. ``Not a talent I
wish for.''
</P>
<P>
   The tawdry pleasures of B-moviedom don't get much better than
``Dollar for the Dead'' (7, 9 and 11 p.m. CDT Sunday, TNT), which
bills itself as a movie about a treasure hunt played out during the
chaotic, almost lawless badlands of the post-Civil War era. But it
does so with such a decided wink of the eye that it's enjoyably
digestible.
</P>
<P>
   William Forsythe is Estevez's partner, and Howie Long is one of
the many in pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Producer Stanley M. Brooks wants so desperately to
usher the ``spaghetti western'' into the '90s that he shot this
film on the Almeria, Spain, sets where ``The Good, the Bad &AMP; the
Ugly'' and ``Once Upon a Time in the West'' were filmed.
</P>
<P>
   From what I can see, writer/director Gene Quintano has no
interest in developing characters beyond a comic-strip level. And
yet, like Sergio Leone, the filmmaker who obviously inspired this
project, Quintano succeeds in letting the characters use their
bullets like words, creating a dusty, stylized universe of sheer
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam: The Soldiers' Story'' (8 and 9 p.m. CDT Sunday
through Tuesday, TLC) isn't a political or social analysis of the
war; it's the ``human'' story of soldiers' experiences. In six
parts, ``Soldiers' Story'' features accounts of POWs and medics,
cameramen and pilots, making good use of archival film from ABC
News (a co-producer), the U.S. military and North Vietnamese
footage. ...
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that if God picked someone to play a
contemporary Noah in a family film he'd go for the durable Tony
Danza. ``Noah'' (6 p.m. CDT Sunday, ABC) is a sweet, modern-day
version of the biblical patriarch chosen to build an ark and fill
it with animals before a flood threatens their existence. Perfect
for ``Wonderful World of Disney.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   What could possibly bring the world's fastest city to a
standstill? A cab strike? Greg Evigan and Cynthia Gibb find out in
``Earthquake in New York'' (7 p.m. CDT Sunday, Family Channel), a
so-called disaster thriller that even tosses in a ruthless serial
killer. ...
</P>
<P>
   How plausible is it that a judge would order strangers (Jane
Seymour and James Brolin) fighting over custody of a child to get
married? It happens in ``A Marriage of Convenience'' (8 p.m.
Sunday, CBS) and, lo and behold, they fall in love! Hey, at least
CBS calls it a romantic ``fantasy.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS APPROVES SSI CHANGES
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress has passed and sent to President Clinton
legislation to continue providing Supplemental Security Income
benefits to certain immigrants and to disregard charitable
contributions when determining children's eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, sponsored by Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., passed the
House in September and the Senate late Thursday. The president has
indicated he will sign it.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 immigrants _ mostly elderly and disabled people who
are unable to document their immigration status _ will be allowed
to continue receiving SSI benefits at a cost of about $80 million
over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also allows children with life-threatening illnesses to
receive charitable contributions up to $2,000 from organizations
such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation without jeopardizing their SSI
eligibility.

 DeBARTOLO'S LEGAL ORDEAL MAY BE JUST BEGINNING  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Pleading guilty to a felony in federal court
was a doubly humiliating experience for Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. It
showed on his face and in his hangdog demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he admit to a crime, he also had to tell the world
he was not a stand-up guy and would spill the beans on an old
friend in exchange for lenient treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Living with that decision may prove painful for DeBartolo when
he is cross-examined by lawyers for former Louisiana Gov. Edwin
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   They will try to define him as a snitch _ the exact opposite of
the public persona DeBartolo has cultivated as a resolute man's
man, a business tycoon with linebacker eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And if the characterization of DeBartolo as a victim of Edwards'
extortion scheme crumbles in court, the National Football League
may be less sympathetic to DeBartolo's effort to regain control of
the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo is regarded as a vital witness in the public
corruption case against Edwards, and for that reason had leverage
in working out a deal with federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Had he chosen to proceed to trial in a joint defense with the
Edwards team, he would have been taking the risk of a hefty prison
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo, 51, pleaded guilty to the obscure crime of misprision
of felony _ the failure to report an alleged extortion attempt by
Edwards arising from DeBartolo's efforts to obtain a riverboat
gambling license in Louisiana. He was sentenced to probation for
two years and fined $1 million _ on condition that he cooperate
with the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Misprision is ``a charge that is used a lot when you get
individuals that you want to flip and they want to negotiate an
agreement,'' said John Volz, the former U.S. attorney in New
Orleans, who prosecuted Edwards in 1985 and 1986 on charges of
illegally selling hospital permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You charge them with the lesser offense. You could get them
for a bigger offense, but to get their cooperation you have to give
them something,'' Volz said. ``Not only did he (DeBartolo) get a
much lesser felony than he would've been charged with, but he was
facing RICO, and that's 20 years in the pen.''
</P>
<P>
   RICO is the acronym for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, the federal statute under which Edwards, his son
Stephen and at least one associate are expected to be indicted by a
Baton Rouge grand jury as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Volz also noted that in allowing DeBartolo to plead guilty to a
minor criminal offense, the prosecution ``makes him a much better
looking witness'' than if he had been let off. ``You can't just let
him go. That would destroy him (as a witness),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Volz noted, ``defense lawyers are going to ask, `How
many years did you get?' And he says, `I didn't get any,' so they
say, `So you had an incentive to lie, didn't you?' and he'll have
to take his lumps on that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Portman, a federal public defender in San Francisco, said
the prosecution appears to be trying to create the image of
DeBartolo as ``Red Riding Hood who didn't yell `wolf.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe the spin being given (to DeBartolo's plea), it
is that `I am being sentenced because I, as a victim of a wicked
extortion plot, didn't tell the government soon enough of my sad
plight.' But that obviously did not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Portman said U.S. District Judge John V. Parker hit the nail on
the head in a comment from the bench when he accepted DeBartolo's
guilty plea Tuesday: ``The criminal justice system rewards the
fellow who gets to the courthouse quickest, and (DeBartolo attorney
Aubrey) Harwell has secured you a prime seat on the train that
seems to be leaving the station. In fact, you may have a private
car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an unfortunately very accurate statement about the
nature of the criminal justice system and the use of informants
these days,'' Portman said. ``It was striking because of its
candor.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, a Democrat, has made light of the damage DeBartolo
could inflict on him as a witness. ``If he told the truth, it
certainly would not hurt me,'' he said. ``Anybody who jumps to the
conclusion that he's a victim ... ought to listen to the tape of
our telephone conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the allegation that he victimized DeBartolo by insisting
on a wad of cash for using his influence to secure the riverboat
casino license, Edwards said, ``If I had victimized him, I would
have done it for a lot more than $400,000.''

   Anxiety about a genetic engineering technique that prevents
plants from germinating has prompted the U.S. government to clamp
down on the scientists working on it. A memo leaked from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture says that all research into what
opponents have dubbed ``terminator technology'' must now be vetted
by senior managers.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, which was invented by researchers at the USDA,
works by attaching a promoter from a gene called Late Embryogenesis
Abundant, or LEA, to a gene that stops germination and inserting
this into a seed. When the seed has grown into a plant, the
promoter triggers the terminator gene, which sterilizes the plant's
maturing seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The leaked memo, an e-mail from Darwin Murrell of the USDA's
National Program staff to the department's researchers on Sept. 14
reveals that scientists are interested in combining the technique
with others, such as introducing genes for resistance to disease or
frost.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ``sensitive issue,'' Murrell says in the memo.
``Imposing an extra level of review for this research will not
create undue delays nor will it restrict the creative talents of
our scientists, but it will help them avoid potential political and
legal pitfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Terminator technology has already led to widespread protests.
The Indian government has banned the import of terminator seeds,
fearing they will threaten traditional crops. Last week, farmers'
pressure groups, led by the Rural Advancement Foundation
International in Canada, launched a global campaign against the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the USDA argue that the technique will benefit
poor farmers because it will let companies protect their
intellectual property, while marketing a wider variety of
genetically engineered seeds to suit many growing conditions. &QL;

   Anxiety about a genetic engineering technique that prevents
plants from germinating has prompted the U.S. government to clamp
down on the scientists working on it. A memo leaked from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture says that all research into what
opponents have dubbed ``terminator technology'' must now be vetted
by senior managers.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, which was invented by researchers at the USDA,
works by attaching a promoter from a gene called Late Embryogenesis
Abundant, or LEA, to a gene that stops germination and inserting
this into a seed. When the seed has grown into a plant, the
promoter triggers the terminator gene, which sterilizes the plant's
maturing seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The leaked memo, an e-mail from Darwin Murrell of the USDA's
National Program staff to the department's researchers on Sept. 14
reveals that scientists are interested in combining the technique
with others, such as introducing genes for resistance to disease or
frost.
</P>
<P>
   This is a ``sensitive issue,'' Murrell says in the memo.
``Imposing an extra level of review for this research will not
create undue delays nor will it restrict the creative talents of
our scientists, but it will help them avoid potential political and
legal pitfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   Terminator technology has already led to widespread protests.
The Indian government has banned the import of terminator seeds,
fearing they will threaten traditional crops. Last week, farmers'
pressure groups, led by the Rural Advancement Foundation
International in Canada, launched a global campaign against the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the USDA argue that the technique will benefit
poor farmers because it will let companies protect their
intellectual property, while marketing a wider variety of
genetically engineered seeds to suit many growing conditions. &QL;

<P>
   By lacing goat's milk with synthesized spider proteins,
researchers in Quebec plan to make an incredibly light fabric that
is both biodegradable and strong enough to stop bullets. Called
biosteel, it could become a green alternative to the high-strength
plastics used to package shampoos or make commercial fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Turner, president of Nexia Biotechnologies, says the
biodegradable fabric would need to be sealed from the environment
if used in critical applications such as body armor or spacecraft.
This is because bacteria could get in and digest it.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's team has already taken the first step toward creating
biosteel by transferring the spider gene for the protein into goat
mammary cells and collecting soluble protein from the milk. And
they expect genetically engineered goats to start producing the
protein in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   While nobody has yet made a fabric from biosteel, Turner is
convinced the protein can be turned into a supermaterial because of
its natural role in the silk of a spider's web. ``When you think of
what a web has to do, its extreme strength makes perfect sense,''
he says. The silken threads of the web must be nearly invisible to
prey and yet be able to bring a fly to a screeching halt.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution came up with a two-pronged answer to this problem.
First came a rock-solid protein, capable of making many bonds with
its neighbors. Then, the spider developed a unique way of spinning
the protein into a whisper-thin thread. As the spider secretes the
protein solution, the silk dries and pulls taut, transforming the
proteins into a nearly crystalline and completely insoluble cable.
This explains why webs don't dissolve in the rain. Tests on natural
silk show that it can be stronger and more elastic than
high-tensile steel or the Kevlar found in body armor.
</P>
<P>
   But the very properties that make silk proteins strong also make
them difficult to produce. When bacteria are engineered to produce
large quantities of the protein, for example, it links up in chains
into a disordered, insoluble mess.
</P>
<P>
   Its ability to bond with its neighbors can happen in a very
ordered or a disordered fashion _ depending upon how the proteins
fold as they form. Which is why Turner and his colleagues decided
to mimic the spider's own method of production by using goat
mammary cells. It turns out that the way mammals produce milk
proteins and spiders make silk proteins are broadly similar. Both
are produced in skinlike epithelial cells, then held in a space, or
lumen, where shear stresses on the protein are minimized.
</P>
<P>
   So far so good. But Turner cautions that the work is still in
its early stages. It will take about a year before the herd of
biosteel goats is large enough for Nexia's scientists to collect
the protein they need to start making fabric. Then they will face
the next great hurdle: how to match the spider's spinning skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature probably took a long time to get this process right,''
he says. ``I suspect the same will be true for us.'' &QL;

<P>
   Fur farmers, already vilified by animal-rights activists, could
be in for more trouble. The latest research suggests that many of
the mink farmed for their pelts are killed using a technique that
causes unnecessary suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Farmed mink may be gassed with carbon dioxide or carbon
monoxide, injected with a lethal dose of barbiturates or have their
necks broken after being stunned by an electric shock.
</P>
<P>
   Gassing with CO2 is common in Scandinavia, where more than half
the world's 26 million farm mink are reared. And at the last
official audit in November 1997, four out of 15 licensed farms in
Britain also used CO2.
</P>
<P>
   So Jonathan Cooper and Georgia Mason of the University of
Oxford, and Mohan Raj of the University of Bristol, devised an
experiment to test the response of mink to high levels of CO2. The
researchers trained eight of the animals to find a reward in a test
chamber that could be filled with CO2. Mink are naturally curious,
and the reward was a novel object that they could play with, such
as a traffic cone.
</P>
<P>
   When there was no CO2, the mink would enter the test chamber
after being released from a holding pen and spend several minutes
playing with the novel object. But when the chamber contained CO2,
the mink immediately turned tail on entry and headed for fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recoiled backward very quickly, coughing and
spluttering,'' Cooper says.
</P>
<P>
   In other experiments, which have not yet been published, the
researchers replaced CO2 with argon. In this case, the mink entered
the chamber without any apparent aversion, but after several
seconds they made a swift exit. This suggests that in addition to
avoiding CO2, mink can detect low levels of oxygen, Mason says.
Wild mink spend much of their time underwater, she notes. ``As
diving animals, mink can recognize low oxygen and have an instinct
to move from it,'' Mason says, ``whereas you or I would become
woozy or euphoric and then pass out.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers argue that any method of gassing that causes
distress before rendering the mink unconscious may not be humane.
In the Netherlands, mink are often gassed with carbon monoxide
delivered at 1 percent from a pure bottled source, and carbon
monoxide is also recommended for killing mink in Canada. This
method may be more humane than using pure CO2 or argon, the
researchers suggest, although they have yet to examine mink's
reaction to the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Len Kensall, who chairs Britain's National Fur Breeders'
Association, disputes the conclusion that gassing with CO2 is not
humane. But in Britain, the issue may soon be overtaken by events.
The government plans to phase out mink farming when Parliament has
time to pass the necessary legislation. &QL;

<P>
   The combined might of 11 radio telescopes has finally pierced
the hazy veil of dust obscuring the massive black hole at the
center of our Galaxy. An international team of astronomers says the
unexpected nature of the radiation emanating from it may force
astrophysicists to rethink the way matter falls into the jaws of
hungry black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Smack in the middle of our Galaxy, in the direction of
Sagittarius, is a mysterious object called Sgr A which emits bright
radio waves. Astronomers think that it contains a black hole as
heavy as 2.6 million Suns because stars whirl about it very
rapidly. Matter ``accreting'' or falling into the hole would be
heated to huge temperatures and emit the bright radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But because the object is at the center of the dense disc of the
Galaxy, obscured by clouds of dust and gas, getting a clear view of
Sgr A is difficult. Another problem is that because the region is
swarming with stars, it is difficult to distinguish the stellar
light from the black hole's radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Paul Ho and Jun-Hui Zhao, astronomers at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
and their colleagues in Taiwan and China, have trained 11 radio
telescopes on the center of the Galaxy to get an unprecedented look
at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Much to their surprise, they discovered that the radiation from
Sgr A has a highly elliptical shape. It measures about 30 by 8
light minutes, making it more than three times as long as it is
wide.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't fit in with theoretical models of how matter falls
into black holes, according to Ho. ``The most popular models are
spherical accretion models _ they look like a round ball,'' he
says. ``There's no structure, no elliptical shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho and his colleagues then thought the elliptical shape of the
radiation might be caused by jets of gas, which often erupt from
black holes. But they say that models predict jets that are either
too big or too small for Sgr A _ none explains its shape precisely.
The team's results will appear in a forthcoming issue of
Astrophysical Journal Letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very interesting result, and it does look pretty
convincing,'' comments Wei Cui, an astronomer at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge. However, Cui believes that
existing jet models might be flexible enough to explain the
elliptical shape of the radio source. ``You can't take the
theoretical calculations too literally,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Backer, an astronomer from the University of California
at Berkeley, agrees. ``As a class of models, I think there is room
to wiggle,'' he says. But he thinks that the observations could
play an important role in weeding out models of how a black hole
behaves. ``There's a good sense we're closing in on it in a rather
dramatic fashion here,'' he says. ``We're putting a face on the
black hole.'' &QL;

   The combined might of 11 radio telescopes has finally pierced
the hazy veil of dust obscuring the massive black hole at the
center of our Galaxy. An international team of astronomers says the
unexpected nature of the radiation emanating from it may force
astrophysicists to rethink the way matter falls into the jaws of
hungry black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Smack in the middle of our Galaxy, in the direction of
Sagittarius, is a mysterious object called Sgr A which emits bright
radio waves. Astronomers think that it contains a black hole as
heavy as 2.6 million Suns because stars whirl about it very
rapidly. Matter ``accreting'' or falling into the hole would be
heated to huge temperatures and emit the bright radiation.
</P>
<P>
   But because the object is at the center of the dense disc of the
Galaxy, obscured by clouds of dust and gas, getting a clear view of
Sgr A is difficult. Another problem is that because the region is
swarming with stars, it is difficult to distinguish the stellar
light from the black hole's radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Now Paul Ho and Jun-Hui Zhao, astronomers at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.,
and their colleagues in Taiwan and China, have trained 11 radio
telescopes on the center of the Galaxy to get an unprecedented look
at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Much to their surprise, they discovered that the radiation from
Sgr A has a highly elliptical shape. It measures about 30 by 8
light minutes, making it more than three times as long as it is
wide.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't fit in with theoretical models of how matter falls
into black holes, according to Ho. ``The most popular models are
spherical accretion models _ they look like a round ball,'' he
says. ``There's no structure, no elliptical shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho and his colleagues then thought the elliptical shape of the
radiation might be caused by jets of gas, which often erupt from
black holes. But they say that models predict jets that are either
too big or too small for Sgr A _ none explains its shape precisely.
The team's results will appear in a forthcoming issue of
Astrophysical Journal Letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very interesting result, and it does look pretty
convincing,'' comments Wei Cui, an astronomer at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge. However, Cui believes that
existing jet models might be flexible enough to explain the
elliptical shape of the radio source. ``You can't take the
theoretical calculations too literally,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Backer, an astronomer from the University of California
at Berkeley, agrees. ``As a class of models, I think there is room
to wiggle,'' he says. But he thinks that the observations could
play an important role in weeding out models of how a black hole
behaves. ``There's a good sense we're closing in on it in a rather
dramatic fashion here,'' he says. ``We're putting a face on the
black hole.'' &QL;

TEXAS A&AMP;M STUDENTS INTENT ON HUMANELY SOLVING PROBLEM OF FERAL CATS
PROWLING UNIVERSITY  
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ By day, the sprawling Texas A&AMP;M
University campus almost buzzes with excitement as more than 43,000
Aggies hotly pursue their dream of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   But when darkness falls and students retreat, the cats appear.
</P>
<P>
   From basement, window sill and drain pipe, they come. Three
hundred of them, by best estimate. Howling, prowling, without
pedigree or permanent home, they do what vagabond cats do _ fight,
scavenge and make more kittens.
</P>
<P>
   It's been this way for decades. And, although some have agonized
over the animals' welfare or fretted that they might spread disease
or kill too many birds, for the most part the situation has been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, comes the Aggie Feral Cat Alliance (AFCAT), a
volunteer group of students and professors intent on humanely
solving A&AMP;M's stray cat problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some view these cats as just carnivores out in the wild,''
said AFCAT faculty sponsor Margaret Slater. ``They're satisfied
that their population will just wax and wane with the food supply,
as with foxes. My personal perspective is that this is a domestic
species and we have a responsibility for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slater, an associate professor at A&AMP;M's College of Veterinary
Medicine, said AFCAT's goal is to reduce the number of on-campus
stray cats by neutering them. To that end, as many as 12 cats a
month are being trapped and sent to the vet school's small animal
clinic on the edge of campus for an operation that will change
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   While there, they are tested for fatal diseases, vaccinated,
implanted with information-laden computer chips and fitted with
special radio collars for later tracking.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy kittens are ``rehabilitated'' for adoption. The adults,
which are skittish, hostile and hardly can be handled, are released
into the wilds of the A&AMP;M campus, now the site of 12 cat-feeding
stations monitored by student volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's approach _ modeled after a similar effort at California's
Stanford University _ is a dramatic step away from the standard
method of dealing with colonies of stray animals: trapping and
destroying.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other institutions, A&AMP;M never has destroyed large
numbers of feral cats. In fact, the cat problem officially came to
light only when traps set for marauding skunks or raccoons snagged
an occasional kitty.
</P>
<P>
   While a smaller neutering program is in place at the University
of Texas in Austin, it is the College Station effort that has drawn
regional and national attention. Earlier this month, a Discovery
Channel video crew visited campus to document the group's efforts.
Financial support for the $50,000, two-year program, which began in
August, has come from foundations and vaccine and cat food
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is every indication that these types of programs can be
successful,'' said AFCAT founder Dawn Fradkin, a first-year
veterinary medicine student. ``But the critical element for our
success is educating the public. As long as there's a source for
more cats, we can neuter all we like and we're still going to have
this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Local animal advocates noted that A&AMP;M is not unique in its
homeless cat problem.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Bice, executive director of the Brazos Animal Shelter,
which serves 10 Texas counties, said her agency receives 10,000
animals a year, roughly two-thirds of them strays. The phenomenon
of ``throw away pets'' leaves the normally placid Bice apoplectic.
``It cheapens life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of stray animals, though, isn't limited to cats.
Packs of feral dogs have been reported in rural Brazos County.
Often, though, they are quickly corralled. Cats, leading lives of
stealth and inconspicuousness, are another matter. And, Dawn
Boothe, vet school associate professor and AFCAT adviser, noted
that many people simply view the lives of cats as unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dogs are working animals,'' she said, ``and you can see a role
for food animals. That makes sense. But there's not a real role for
cats in society. They've always been an extra.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people say, `Ugh! I don't like cats.' or that cats
are aloof?''
</P>
<P>
   At A&AMP;M, Slater, Fradkin and others associated with AFCAT,
believe many of the campus cats were abandoned by students, who had
brought the animals into their dormitories in violation of
university policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students can be idealistic,'' Fradkin said. ``They aren't
knowledgeable about the cost _ vaccinations and so forth _ involved
in being responsible pet owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cats were dumped on campus by townsfolk who concluded the
animals would be cared for by kind-hearted college kids.
</P>
<P>
   While feral cats usually fall victim to their environment within
three years _ house cats can live 15 years or more _ a fertile
female can deliver several litters annually.
</P>
<P>
   The strays' presence on campus has stirred passions among cat
lovers and those who fear their impact on birds and other ``urban
wildlife,'' but most students probably aren't aware they are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd see a few cats hanging around,'' Slater said, ``but
they never thought about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A nocturnal stroll through the nearly deserted campus with Sara
Ash, a wildlife and fisheries graduate student working with AFCAT
to track neutered and radio-collared cats, is revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with an oversized flashlight and antenna, Ash, 26,
combs the campus nightly to document their lives and travels. On
one recent outing, she found collared cats in window sills, hidden
in shrubbery around campus buildings and just skulking about in the
shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Led to each subject by the beeping of her monitor, she
spotlighted the cat, then meticulously noted the details of its
location. Such data should help AFCAT judge the success of its
efforts as well as lay the groundwork for future studies.
</P>
<P>
   Passing students good-naturedly greeted the young woman and her
cumbersome apparatus. ``Some of them ask me if I've got cable,''
she said. ``They meow at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ash said she has been struck by the affection many on campus
feel for the strays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one woman tell me that she was worried that one cat's
radio collar was on too tight,'' she said. ``She said she thought
the cats had `sweet faces.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ash, though, is not among the cats' admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Contending that studies have shown even well-fed cats will prey
on birds and other wildlife, she dispassionately admitted her
sympathies lie not with the strays, but with their meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two parts of a cat's brain,'' she said. ``One that
addresses hunger and one that deals with hunting. Even when a cat's
hunger is satisfied, it will still hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   AFCAT officials conceded that ``if anything moves fast, cats
will try to catch it,'' but countered that the rampant growth of
A&AMP;M _ the campus now encompasses more than 5,000 acres _ likely has
done more damage to wildlife than the cats.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sterling Evans Library in the heart of the main campus,
the stray cats for years have had a home away from home. Each
morning, the cats queue up for a free breakfast, emerging from the
shrubbery as staff opens the building for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been feeding them for two years,'' said one employee, who
asked not to be identified. ``There are four or five people here
feeding them. You just feel so sorry for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just get started and you can't stop.'' &QL;

   In the annals of rock 'n' roll no band has toured this way:
Twenty-one years after its album debut, the band, still intact and
rocking, is revisiting its first three studio albums by playing
each album, in its entirety, in order, on successive nights in the
same city.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Cheap Trick plays Boston's Paradise, where it made
its area debut two decades ago. On Thursday, the band plays its
eponymous first album; Friday, it's album two, ``In Color''; the
group wraps it up on Saturday with ``Heaven Tonight.''

<P>
   Of course, many of the songs on these albums were included on
the 1979 live album breakthrough, ``At Budokan,'' when singer Robin
Zander became a young girl's pop dream and goofball guitarist Rick
Nielsen became ... well, America's uber-guitar geek with hot licks.
Fleshing out the Trick experience were handsome bassist Tom
Petersson and pudgy, chain-smoking, alleged Venezuelan drummer Bun
E. Carlos. (He's actually Brad Carlson and hails from the same
Rockville, Ill., parts as the others.)
</P>
<P>
   So, what have we here in 1998? A retro thrill? A flashback to
the late '70s? An acid-damaged casualty trip?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, I think all of those,'' says Nielsen. ``I don't know. It's
just we're playing real good and this is the soup du jour of the
week. See, we never did these albums like that then, so it's still
new and fun with us, not like some drudgery we're going through.
When we did them we meant them to be played like this (the songs in
order). We wanted each record to stand alone _ there are highs,
lows, fast, slow, a whole bunch of different stuff. Now, we when we
get done with the first side, we turn all of the equipment around
and flip over.''
</P>
<P>
   A little joke there from the band's main songwriter, who has
pumped many a Cheap Trick song with both sly jokes and strong
melodies, bright hooks, and double-edged lyrics. Nielsen always has
been a hyperactive guitarist-foil to the classically styled rock
singer Zander. Says Nielsen: ``People used to say to me, `Whatever
Rick's on, I'd like to get some.' Now, they say, `Whatever Rick's
on, I don't want any.' Actually, I'm on the same thing every night
I play: I actually like people and I like to play. I don't always
feel like a million dollars, but I try not to let anybody know.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Carlos, of this club tour: ``It's weird to look back and
celebrate a little bit. When those albums came out, we were living
in a motor home or on the bus on the road. There was more struggle,
just to keep your head above water. ... (Playing these songs) is
like going to your high school reunion, where some of the people
you're glad to see again, and then you remember why you haven't
seen some of them in 20 years. Occasionally, some of the lyrics
might be dated, but luckily Rick wrote three great albums in the
first place, so they hold up real good.''
</P>
<P>
   The tour has a practical and promotional purpose, too:
Sony/Legacy has remastered, remixed, and re-released those first
three albums (with bonus tracks) as well as an expanded, complete
version of ``At Budokan.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, an album a night does not a concert make. Albums _ 12
inches round, two sides of polyvinyl chloride _ tended to clock in
under 45 minutes. So, Carlos explains, Cheap Trick plays the album
that is the soup du jour and ``a couple of hits and whatever.'' The
band will spread about 50 songs over three nights. There will be
some obvious repeats but not that many. ``Surrender,'' the big,
early rock-as-generational-bonding hit, will likely be played
twice. ``The Flame'' _ a treacly power ballad not written by Cheap
Trick but played and sung by them, a 1988 song that reached No.1. _
will not make an appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of our history,'' says Nielsen, of ``The Flame.''
``Whether we care to do it or not ... It left a bad taste in our
mouths. But, like I say to people in my own family, if there is
something buggin' you, get over it. So I say, `Hey, Rick, get over
it.' Having something go to No.1 is not something many people get a
chance to do. I wish it would have been with `Dream Police,' but it
wasn't and everything's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheap Trick has gone through peaks and valleys, weathering the
lows spots by working through them, and, occasionally, connecting
with whatever direction the mainstream is headed. ``I don't have a
clue,'' says Nielsen, as to when or why that happens. As to the
glow that surrounds pop stardom, Nielsen says, ``Once you start
believing all that baloney you read, it's like, `Yikes! I'm not
like that.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen and company are planning a new live CD; they'll be
recording new songs this spring. Having parted company with their
last label, Red Ant, which released ``Cheap Trick,'' (yes, their
second eponymous disc), they're looking for a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap Trick has played with big hip bands like Smashing Pumpkins
and big unhip bands like Heart. It has some underground cachet. Its
early song, ``He's A Whore,'' was covered by Steve Albini's Big
Black. Band members are unabashed Beatles fans, having covered
``Magical Mystery Tour.'' Cheap Trick has played tiny clubs and
cavernous arenas. Self-described road dogs, they've played 200
shows a year for 20 years. ``More than any other American band,''
says Nielsen. ``Maybe more than any band anyplace, as for a
traveling band. I mean Wayne Newton's played more shows than
anybody ever, but he just crawls out of bed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin sidebar) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't be shocked when you hear Cheap Trick playing on ``I'm
Losing You,'' the lead track from the upcoming John Lennon
boxed-set anthology. Don't be stunned when today's video wizardry
allows for a ``new'' video that combines the guys in Cheap Trick
with the late Beatle's visage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Nat Cole and Natalie Cole,'' says a bemused Rick Nielsen,
guitarist for Cheap Trick.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Cheap Trick _ minus singer Robin Zander _ recorded some
backing tracks to Lennon's last album, 1980's ``Double Fantasy,''
and they just got word that Yoko Ono, the arbiter of all things
Lennon _ has decided to use their backing on ``I'm Losing You,''
despite the fact that it was initially scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took us off and now, here, 18 years later, it's coming
out,'' says Nielsen. ``Maybe, it wasn't so bad after all. What they
told us back then was the reason they didn't use it was because we
sounded too heavy compared to the rest of the album.''
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Bun E. Carlos recalls meeting Lennon, who first said,
```Oh, you guys are in Cheap Trick. They told me your names, but
they didn't tell me what band you were in.' That felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of the five-hour session? Carlos says he was sitting in
the recording booth with Lennon watching Nielsen blister through a
solo. ``We were smoking a doobie,'' says Carlos, ``and he was
jumping up and down going like, `Boy, we could have used this guy
when we did `Cold Turkey.' Clapton was all stoned out.''

DESPERATE BEAUTY IN PORTRAIT OF ARTIST'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a scene in ``Love Is the Devil,'' the shockingly real
film subtitled ``study for a portrait of Francis Bacon,'' in which
Derek Jacobi, who plays the celebrated British painter, starts to
paint a picture.
</P>
<P>
   Alone in his studio, no music to accompany him, he approaches a
blank canvas, fiddles around with his brushes, finds a photograph
to use as an aid, traces a circle on the canvas using a trash can
cover _ taking his time to do all of it _ and then, ready at last,
attacks the canvas with a brush laden with paint the color of
coagulated blood.
</P>
<P>
   Fury shaped and controlled by deliberation equals art _ at least
an art as emblematic of mid-century existentialism as Bacon's _ and
it has probably never been captured on film with such sympathy.
Usually the director, not really understanding creativity, overdoes
it. The actor grimaces, spouting nonsense as music swells. He might
as well be portraying constipation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Is the Devil'' is the best film I've ever seen about an
artist's life. It is also one of the best I've ever seen about gay
life and homosexual relationships. To pile on the praise, it is
also one of the most honest movies I've ever seen about the effects
of alcoholism and drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Bleak and depressing, it is relieved by outbursts of great
humor, and it is also desperately beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The film, written and directed by John Maybury, his first
feature, tells the story of the tortured but strangely tender
relationship between Bacon (1909-1992) and his lover George Dyer
(Daniel Craig).
</P>
<P>
   It opens in 1971 with Bacon returning to his squalid London flat
after the opening of his retrospective in Paris, the first British
artist since Turner to have been so honored. He approaches an
unmade bed, picks up a pillow, sniffs it and then begins to sob
into it.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who had almost literally fallen into Bacon's arms while
breaking into his house in a bungled attempt at burglary a number
of years earlier, had died messily of an overdose of pills and
alcohol while Bacon was receiving the press at his opening (in
fact, his suicide occurred a couple of nights before).
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film is a flashback detailing Bacon's and Dyer's
attempts to forge a relationship across the chasms of class and
personal philosophy. It is dazzlingly edited, the narrative
intercut with subliminal images, for instance of a naked man
covered in blood howling before he topples over into the void, that
capture variously Bacon's blood-steeped philosophy and the horror
of Dyer's mind.
</P>
<P>
   The Colony Room, the Soho drinking club where Bacon and his
cronies hang out, is the setting of much of the action, which is
heavy in bitchy repartee. (Example: Bacon, as he pours champagne
over the head of his dutiful photographer, John Deakin, ``Champagne
for my real friends; real pain for my sham friends.'') Tilda
Swinton gives another memorable performance as Muriel Belcher,
Colony Room proprietor and resident harpy.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of obtaining the rights to reproduce Bacon's images of
screaming popes, of naked men wrestling, of people vomiting into a
sink or sitting on a toilet was prohibitive, but Maybury turned the
disadvantage to his favor. He filmed with distorting lenses that
capture a sense of Bacon's own smeared images without being
literal.
</P>
<P>
   The events surrounding Dyer's death are brilliantly filmed to
simulate the triptychs Bacon subsequently painted of the horrific
event, some of his greatest ever. The scenes in which Maybury
shoots the inebriated Colony Room drinkers apparently through
bottles gives a real sense of what it's like to be drunk and
sparring verbally with similarly lubricated and witty friends (and
enemies).
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi gives an astonishing performance. Visually, he is Francis
Bacon, and he plays the aging ponce with a taste for leather
brilliantly. The bluntly handsome Craig, a sort of Cockney James
Dean, perfectly captures the confusion and desperation of an
uneducated, neurotic, petty criminal more at home with boxers than
with artists.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure authenticity, the rest of the cast includes London art
world figures, both from Bacon's day and the present.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, voice-overs of Bacon's existentialist personal
philosophy structure the film. (Example: ``Is my lover to be my
assassin, or I his?'') In an age when mood-enhancing drugs are
prescribed for every minor depression, it all seems long ago and
far away. ``Love Is the Devil,'' however, brings it all vividly
back to life.

AMBITION KILLS INDIVIDUAL TALES IN `VIETNAM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
VIETNAM: THE SOLDIERS' STORY 
Produced by: Lisa Zeff and Ed Hersh 
On: The Learning Channel (TLC) 
Date: Sunday-Tuesday, 9-ll p.m. and midnight-2 a.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You're covered in blood all day,'' says Army pilot Wayne Coe
in the documentary miniseries, ``Vietnam: The Soldiers' Story.'' At
19, Coe flew support missions in Vietnam. So profuse was the
arterial blood pumping from the wounded, rescued men in his
helicopter, that it had to be hosed out every night.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of tough, evocative testimony you expect to
hear in a documentary like this six-parter created by ABC News
Productions and airing on the TLC cable channel, beginning Sunday.
(Two hour-long segments run nightly at 9 and again at midnight,
through Tuesday.)
</P>
<P>
   After all, why call it ``the soldiers' story'' if it doesn't
honor the voices and closely, sympathetically detail the harshest
experiences, deepest fears, and innermost thoughts of individual
combatants?
</P>
<P>
   But oddly, whatever its other virtues, this ``Vietnam'' isn't
really driven by the voices of the many veterans interviewed on
camera. This judgment is based on viewing three of the series' six
hours. Despite a few riveting recollections like Coe's, too many of
the interviews seem tamely factual, and all of them exist to
personalize larger, sweeping narrative segments like ``War in the
Skies'' rather than as stories on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a whole fine segment could have been drawn from the
experiences of the series' host, ABC correspondent Jack Smith,
himself a decorated Vietnam veteran. Smith was a 20-year-old
rifleman when he fought in the war's first major battle in 1965.
After being wounded in what he calls ``a massacre,'' he was taken
for dead by North Vietnamese regulars, who then used him and the
corpse of another American soldier as sandbags for their machine
gun. He felt the hot casings of their shells falling on him as they
fired at his fellow soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Even material as powerful and disturbing as this is somehow
diminished if not overwhelmed by its context. Smith's recollections
are only a small part of the much larger story covered in Part 1,
called ``Ambush: The Battle of Ia Drang,'' a bloody, several days'
long action with complex ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   This documentary tries in vain to be two generally incompatible
things at once: deeply personal and historically panoramic. While
it often manages to survey major operations or themes quite well _
the broad ``War in the Skies'' segment is a good example _ the
intimate stories tend to get lost in the epic subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems with the interviews, the gravest one
being the lack of leisurely introspection that would almost
certainly have made many of them unforgettable. Senator John
McCain, for example, is given remarkably short shrift in ``The War
in the Skies'' segment, which merely sketches the experiences of
POWs like him, rather than painting full-blown portraits. It
doesn't help that most of the uniform-looking interviews were
filmed in a studio, where the participating veterans couldn't feel
entirely at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam: The Soldiers' Story'' is not without interest and
flashes of intensity, but its hidebound refusal to let the
interviews expand to tell more of this war story in intimate human
terms severely limits its achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the series takes explicit pains to detach its treatment of
the Vietnam War from politics, which of course is impossible, and
it does no such thing.

A RUSSIAN CLASSIC AS CLIFF NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
CRIME AND PUNISHMENT 
Starring: Patrick Dempsey, Ben Kingsley, Julie Delpy 
Directed by: Joseph Sargent 
On: NBC 
Time: Sunday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feodor Dostoevski and Patrick Dempsey _ it's not often you'll
find those names in the same sentence. But a lightbulb went off at
NBC at the idea _ Dempsey is Raskolnikov _ and so Sunday night at 9
we have ``Crime and Punishment'' network-style, with that tormented
ax-murdering Russian dude swigging shots of ``wadka'' and
submitting guiltily to that wise Columbo of a police inspector,
Porfiry Petrovitch. And with the requisite touch of British class,
also known as the Honorary Vanessa Redgrave Casting Coup, we have
Ben Kingsley (and _ whew! _ not Patrick Stewart) Shakespearing it
up as the baldheaded magistrate.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? It's not half bad, this Cliff Notes of a
Cliff Notes of ``Crime and Punishment.'' Partly that's because it's
always a happy moment whenever network TV aims higher than its
usual
a-woman-murders-her-stalking-ex-who-looks-like-her-abusive-father
story lines, for something low in the exploitation department.
Truly, you can't choose too many classics that are more high-minded
than ``Crime and Punishment'' if you're looking for a cerebral,
barely filmable property that just screams ``Do Your Homework!''
</P>
<P>
   But NBC's ``Crime and Punishment'' is also a fairly engaging two
hours of drama, with a committed performance by Dempsey, authentic
settings filmed in Budapest, and an idea-driven script that more or
less encapsulates Dostoevski's story. Certainly the TV movie is not
going to hold up against comparisons to the novel, not just because
characters and subplots have been dropped, but because it's a
mainstream version of a complex story. The grayer, more
intellectual aspects of its hero's thinking about ordinary versus
extraordinary men have been dulled into simplistic terms, and the
motives behind his actions are given a decidedly conventional
twist. Still, the NBC movie is driven by a few literary ideas _
about society, about conscience, and about redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey's Rodya Raskolnikov is a poor scholar who kills a
miserly pawnbroker and her sister for money. He is physically
sickened by his guilt, but refuses to turn himself in to the
patient but knowing Porfiry, even after an innocent man claims
responsibility. He is drawn to Sonia (Julie Delpy), whose poverty
and familial trials have led her to prostitution, and she tries to
offer him moral guidance. Meanwhile, his governess sister is
victimized by the wealthy family she works for, and may need to
marry a despicable man for security.
</P>
<P>
   When the script of ``Crime and Punishment'' tries to re-create
Raskolnikov's interior process, it is most awkward. ``This is the
only evidence there is,'' he says out loud to himself. ``I'll throw
it in the river. ... No, no, no, if I throw it away what is the
point of what I have done?'' The writers should have protected
Dempsey from having to spell it all out in this manner, and saved
the lead-footed narration for Books on Tape.

IMMIGRANTS' `HUNGER' LEAVES THEM STARVED OF PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HUNGER 
By Lan Samantha Chang 
Norton, 191 pp., $22 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some people just live in the past, spewing story after story
to anyone who will listen. Others, like many of the characters in
Lan Samantha Chang's new story collection, ``Hunger,'' refuse to
discuss their past lives at all.
</P>
<P>
   As immigrants, Chang's characters want to focus on achievement,
not family history. But through her six stories, Chang reveals
(among other things) how this culture of silence can drive a wedge
between parent, child, and spouse, creating feelings of
misunderstanding, resentment, and rejection. The book also unveils
how, in turning away from their past, some immigrants place unfair
and unwise expectations on their greatest future hope _ their
children.
</P>
<P>
   The book, through its many characters, is moving and
thought-provoking. While it primarily focuses on the Chinese
immigrant experience, ``Hunger'' could really be a group of stories
about any race or nationality. The desire for love, prosperity,
parental approval, and strong family ties is universal.
</P>
<P>
   Chang begins her first story, which bears the same title as the
book, with the recent arrival of Min in New York City from Taiwan
in 1967. A hostess in a restaurant, Min soon meets her future
husband, Tian Sung, a violin instructor.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's relationship is strained from the beginning. Min
believes it's more important to please Tian than to understand him.
So she never questions why he insists on keeping chopsticks in a
certain drawer or why he has a plan for where each piece of
furniture is placed.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Min confronts Tian about his indifference to her
pregnancy does he briefly reveal some of his demons _ that he'd
been raised to become a scientist and support his family in Taiwan.
When his love for music drew him to the United States, his family
disowned him, telling him he had no right to ever think of them
again. ``I began to see that all of Tian's specifications _ the
chopsticks, ... the placement of lamps _ were slips of willpower,
signs of a forbidden loyalty to this other house that he had been
barred forever from entering,'' Min says.
</P>
<P>
   Tian's mechanism for forgetting his pain, it seems, is his
music. With the birth of daughters Anna and Ruth, Tian forces his
music on them as the one and only means for them to get to know
their father and earn his love and attention. Childhood memories
are never discussed. But when the children discover they don't have
their father's passion for the violin, their relationship with him
dissolves. Why, they're left wondering (as Tian's family did before
them), is music so consuming? Isn't family more important?
</P>
<P>
   The story ``The Unforgetting'' has a similar theme. Ming and
Sansan Hwang move to Iowa from China in 1967 with the great hope
that their son Charles might have a better life in the United
States. ``We're getting old. How will we make the space in our
minds for everything we'll need to learn here?'' Sansan asks early
in the story. Ming responds, ``We will forget.''
</P>
<P>
   And forget they do: that Ming had really wanted to be a
scientist, not a photocopy machine repairman. That Sansan loved
reading Chinese classics, not watching TV to practice her English.
That stored in their house are six rice bowls once used in the
emperor's household. Rather than display them with pride, the
Hwangs store them in the basement, with their red-bound Chinese
history text. When a schoolteacher suggests the Hwangs speak less
Chinese at home so that Charles can learn English faster, they
comply.
</P>
<P>
   With less Chinese culture in the home _ Sansan even cooks
sometimes using Betty Crocker recipes and canned and frozen foods _
it's no surprise that Charles grows to become a typical American
teenager: He locks his bedroom door, cuts short conversations with
his parents, and becomes alienated from his culture. In the end,
Ming and Sansan realize that while they've achieved their American
dream, they've lost their identity and perhaps their son as well.
</P>
<P>
   Chang's stories open up readers to a world of sadness and
regret. So often, her characters can't break barriers of silence
with one another to uncover true feelings. The end result is that
sometimes well-meaning parents, despite all their sacrifices, can't
give their children what they need the most: a firm foundation of
cultural and family history.

ONE PREDICTABLE NYPD PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ONE TOUGH COP 
Directed by: Bruno Barreto 
Screenplay by: Jeremy Iacone, based on Bo Dietl's autobiographical
novel 
Starring: Stephen Baldwin, Chris Penn, Mike McGlone, Gina Gershon,
Paul Guilfoyle, Amy Irving, Victor Slezak 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence and language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Authentically gritty street settings and characters are
undermined by melodramatic contrivance in ``One Tough Cop.''
Although based on the specific experiences of retired New York City
detective Bo Dietl, who lives up to the film's title, it comes
close to flattening them into cliche. Too bad, because in doing so,
it wastes what could have been Stephen Baldwin's breakthrough
performance as Dietl, who was more concerned with results than with
career politics. He comes across as the kind of cop you like to
know is out there on the streets _ smart, tenacious, solving most
of the crimes he investigates, even if it sometimes meant turning a
blind eye to due process.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilante cops have been meat and drink to the movies long
before Dirty Harry ever fired a shot from his block-long revolver,
and Baldwin's taciturn Dietl persuades us that he has developed a
world view that allows him to do things his own way as long as he
lives up to his code of honor. Essentially, it's the old
Love-Your-Friends-Crucify-Your-Enemies code, which means he's
thrown into conflict with his police colleagues because he insists
he can do his job without compromising himself while still
remaining close with the rising mafia underboss who had been his
friend since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes a dim view of the workings of the justice
establishment, which puts the squeeze on him when he refuses to
wire his mafia buddy. He's also unswervingly loyal to his
self-destructive partner, Chris Penn, in another of the
good-hearted, slow-thinking lug roles into which he's been
pigeonholed for too long. Specifically, the cop Penn plays is
lumbered by severe alcohol and gambling addictions, which of course
make him vulnerable to his superiors, to say nothing of his mob
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Baldwin and Penn play cops under the gun, but
brave all the same, and so effective that they embarrass their
politically-oriented bosses, who would love to can them, but can't
because they keep breaking big cases and maintain impressive arrest
and conviction records. They're tough, they're tenacious, and they
succeed because they throw out the rulebook, hit hard and worry
about the legalities later. Baldwin at least underplays
convincingly and never shows any sign of sadistically reveling in
the tough-guy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The film goes off the track, however, when it plays out a
triangle involving Dietl, his mafia buddy and the latter's mistress
(Gina Gershon), who transfers her affections from the married crime
boss to the unmarried cop. Throughout, mob stereotypes undercut the
streetwise flavor, which peaks in the cops' bulldozing through the
ghetto and breaking heads until they collar a couple of thugs who
break into a convent, rape a nun and leave her for dead. Given the
flawed script, it takes more directorial savvy than Bruno Barreto
can deliver to move ``One Tough Cop'' away from genre cliche. TV
cop shows do this stuff better every week.

   Home-based businesses are exploding. Young and old,
professionals and hobbyists, singles and working parents are
capitalizing on the technological revolution that has made working
at home a viable option. Steven Jobs and Calvin Klein launched
their businesses from home. Weltman examines the growth as well as
the pros and cons of the work-at-home trend. (slugged:

   ``Odgen Nash was onto something when he observed that progress

long,'' begins Glicksman in this humorous essay. She fondly recalls
the days when ``a laptop was where you sat a child'' and ``a

Echoing the frustration of many a PC user, she wonders, ``Why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).
</P>
<P>
   Two extras you'll find handy are the Direct Mail Manager, a
program for developing and managing direct mail lists, and Expedia
Streets 98, an easy way to locate key customers and integrate maps
into your marketing materials. Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $500.

   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download
postage by phone with a 30-second tollfree call. The meter prints
l0 envelopes per minute and holds up to $1,000 in postage _ making
trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,

`LIMITS' GOES ALL OUT ON LIFE OF AN ATHLETE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WITHOUT LIMITS 
Directed and written by: Robert Towne 
Starring: Billy Crudup, Donald Sutherland, Monica Potter, Jeremy
Sisto, Billy Burke, Matthew Lillard, Dean Norris, Gabe Olds, Judith
Ivey, William Mapother, Adam Setliff 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't have to be a runner to get caught up in Robert Towne's
``Without Limits,'' although the running world is likely to know
everything about the film's subject, Oregon runner Steve
Prefontaine, going in. He was a naturally gifted athlete who ran
with a fierce purity, he set a handful of world records by rushing
to the front of the pack and staying there, and he died at 24 when
a logging truck demolished his sports car.
</P>
<P>
   So why, then, should ``Without Limits'' be so gripping? Apart
from the fact that Towne, the writer and director, draws an
electrifying performance from Billy Crudup as Prefontaine, the
answer is that while Towne is much better known as a writer than as
a director, the film grabs you less with its dialogue than with its
sheer physicality _ not only the running, but the suspension of
time as the camera serves up speed in slow motion and the sight of
thousands of screaming spectators recedes and we breathe the highly
charged air barely separating the runners on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits'' makes us realize that Towne is something of a
long-distance runner, too, having conceived it 10 years ago for Tom
Cruise, who now serves as its producer. The irony in the title of
course is that, like Prefontaine, we are being confronted with
limits at every turn. It is with more gallantry than hubris that
Prefontaine refuses to accept them, even though he's well aware
that the ultimate limits against which he and all runners compete
are the limits of the human body, pumping blood to furiously
pounding muscles as they try to chip a few hundredths of a second
off the best previous time.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the concentration that turns ``Without Limits'' into
such a heart-racing rush is the very concentration that made its
subject the phenomenon he was. To Towne's credit, and Crudup's, the
Prefontaine we get is uncompromising in his all-out approach to
running. Off the track, too, he's a cocky, refreshingly unplacating
hotdog, and even though he's right to seethe at the blatant
injustices of the Amateur Athletic Union, he's hard-headed and
difficult to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally breaking through his star runner's stubbornness
gives Donald Sutherland's coach, Bill Bowerman, something to do
when he isn't tinkering with the waffle-soled running shoe he
invented on Prefontaine's foot, the shoe that became the Nike.
Sutherland superbly expresses the canny long view of an old head as
he fights Prefontaine's nothing-held-back insistence on being a
front-runner instead of saving a last burst for the finish. The
weight of Sutherland's presence enables the film to avoid seeming
an exercise in iconography and turn it into an ongoing tug-of-war
between seasoned experience and raw impulse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits'' gives us the achievement and the disarmingly
unpremeditated Prefontaine's flaws alongside his considerable
appeal, and makes us feel the abruptness of his death. Nor do
Crudup's focus and concentration preclude the occasional glint of
sly humor and masochistic drive (at one point he tells Bowerman he
can beat anybody because he can endure more pain than anybody).
``Without Limits'' is miles beyond the previous film,
``Prefontaine,'' which earnestly gave us the same information.
</P>
<P>
   Towne surpasses it with nuances and details that nail down a
world that could easily seem generic. But there's nothing
stereotyped or simplistic about ``Without Limits.'' I had no idea I
could become so engrossed in a film about running. But as ``Without
Limits'' easily carried me across its finish line, I realized that
it worked because it made running seem a subdivision of being
maniacal about something in which you've held nothing back. Nothing
works better in a movie. Or as an approach to moviemaking.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

HERE'S ONE TIRED `COP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enjoyment of ``One Tough Cop,'' the new film directed by Bruno
Barreto and starring Stephen Baldwin in a fictionalized account of
real-life New York policeman Bo Dietl, is entirely dependent on the
expectations the viewer brings to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   If you want some gritty mean streets drama about a loner cop
bucking the system, kicking tail and throwing televisions out of
tenement windows _ Bingo, you're there.
</P>
<P>
   If you expect the deeper tale of loyalty, friendship, betrayal,
love and justice promised by the film's publicists, you'll likely
be disappointed. The script by Jeremy Iacone is just too
predictable, and the audience is asked to take too much for granted
about Baldwin/Dietl's righteousness as he stomps people in the name
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Dietl was a highly decorated New York City cop who amassed more
than 1,400 felony arrest before his retirement in 1985 at the age
of 35. He also had a conviction rate of 98 percent, which is even
more impressive. Dietl is also a relentless self-promoter who
always courted crime writers, wrote his own book on his exploits
and now runs his own private security business.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin's Dietl gives no hint of self-promotion. He has his own
code of the streets, which involves solving crimes by his own
methods, maintaining his friendships with both a boyhood pal who
grew into a major Mafioso and a drunken partner whose $10,000
gambling debt is exceeded only by his $11,000 parking ticket debt.
I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want to be hunting thugs
with a cop partner who doesn't even know how to get out of a
parking ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The plot revolves around an actual case, the vicious rape and
beating of a nun. In real life, Dietl beat the bushes to find the
bad guys. That pretty much also happens in the movie, except
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the police brass don't want Dietl near the case and form a
task force and look like peckerwoods who don't much care about the
victims and would rather keep Dietl down than solve the case.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in some FBI types who also want to nail Dietl because he
won't rat out his mob buddy Richie La Cassa (played by Mike
McGlone), Gina Gershon as La Cassa's mistress Joey who gets to walk
around being Gina Gershon, partner of the year Duke (Chris Penn)
and assorted pimps, players and junkies, and you have a decent cop
movie, a step up from video fare.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets so heavy-handed as we're preached to about morality
and all that stuff _ time better spent killing people or at the
very least smashing their heads against the bar _ and ``One Tough
Cop'' starts to become One Tough Hour-and-a-half.
</P>
<P>
   Barreto, the Brazilian director twice nominated for Oscars for
``Dona Flor and her Two Husbands'' and ``Four Days in September,''
earns his pay by capturing the intensity and feel of the tough New
York streets _ no small feat since most of the movie was filmed in
Toronto.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the

   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.

   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.

   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,

   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.

 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;

   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models

without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,

   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley

   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.

   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download

trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

 Color slides and black and white photos of Sharon Stone, Kieran
Culkin and other actors in scenes from ``The Mighty.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Interviewing Sharon Stone these days comes with a built-in
warning _ not to mention a beefy bodyguard and a publicist poised
at her shoulder.
 &HT;    Three hours before Stone showed up for our interview at Beverly
Hills' Four Seasons Hotel her publicist marched into the room,
denied published stories that said Sharon was pregnant and warned,
``If you ask any questions about the pregnancy or her marriage the
interview will end right there. ''
 &HT;    When Sharon eventually showed up she looked gorgeous as always
but seemed something less than exuberant, admitting, ``I'm tired.
I'm fighting a cold. I always get this way when I do publicity
tours.''
 &HT;    Stone's mission was to talk up a storm about ``The Mighty,'' a
film in which she plays the unglamorous mother of a severely
handicapped young son, played by 15-year-old Kieran Culkin, younger
brother of McCauley Culkin.
 &HT;    It's a warm, sad tale about two boys handicapped in different
ways who use their imaginations and fondness for the legend of King
Arthur to forge a remarkable friendship.
 &HT;    The picture _ a hit at Cannes this spring, also stars Gena
Rowlands, Harry Dean Stanton and ``X-Files''' Gillian Anderson in
an offbeat role as a loose, boozy broad.
 &HT;    But it's Stone who must sell the picture. She talks slowly and
without much fire, but looks pretty sensational in a gray cashmere
sweater and knee-high blue denim skirt, her blonde hair cut ultra
short _ ``I chopped it all off myself in a wild moment,'' she
explains.
 &HT;    ``Mighty'' director Peter Chelsom (``Hear My Song,'' 1991) says
when Stone read the script and agreed to play the plain-Jane role
he cautioned, ``Are you prepared to come as you are? You don't get
any special lighting or foggy filters for your shots.''
 &HT;    Stone, who also produced the picture, agreed; Chelsom says, ``It
was a commendable, noble ... and very intelligent thing for her to
do.''
 &HT;    The star herself makes light of the fact that Sharon Stone,
reigning Hollywood sex symbol should play a working-class mom. The
sexy image, she insists, is something male journalists have stuck
her with.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't exactly glamorous in `Last Dance,' was I?'' she
challenges, and indeed she did play a death row inmate in that 1996
picture. But it's difficult to forget that she zoomed her way to
the top of Hollywood's must-hire list after her role as the
psychopathic seductress opposite Michael Douglas in ``Basic
Instinct'' (1992).
 &HT;    Making ``The Mighty'' was different: ``I was impaled by the
emotion of this film,'' she says.
 &HT;    There have of course been big changes in her life in the last
year. For starters she got married, last Valentine's Day, to San
Francisco newspaper editor Phil Bronstein which caused her, she
says, to put less emphasis on her career.
 &HT;    It also brought her another home. In addition to the house she
owns in an upscale Los Angeles suburb, she now lives with her
husband in a high-rise apartment in San Francisco. And while Stone
wants to avoid motherhood and marriage topics, she did recount a
scary incident which took place a few weeks ago in the skyscraper
in the city by the bay.
 &HT;    The actress was trapped in an elevator for two hours between the
20th and 21st floors. She used her cell phone to call Bronstein,
who rushed to the building and talked her through the ordeal before
emergency rescue crews smashed their way to her from the adjacent
building and pulled her to safety.
 &HT;    ``The day after the rescue,'' Stone recalls, ``I fell apart when
I realized that the elevator could have crashed to earth and I
would have ended up an oil stain on the concrete. But strangely,
going through something like that brought Phil and I much closer
together. The rescue people were telling me to do one thing that
went against my gut instinct _ and Phil supported me by saying, 'Do
what you think is right.'''
 &HT;    Stone says she has become a regular housefrau and likes nothing
better than to bake up batches of cookies for her husband to take
to the guys on the paper. She's also developed a liking for writing
and has penned several short stories. ``I took a few lessons on how
to use a computer and finally was able to shop for three pairs of
jeans on the Internet. But it's not for me so Phil finally bought
me an old-fashioned typewriter.''
 &HT;    Besides ``The Mighty,'' she also stars opposite Woody Allen as
the voice of the princess in Dreamworks' new hit movie ``Antz.''
 &HT;    ``That was great,'' she says. ``I was able to do the voice-over
work in San Francisco without having to dress up in costume or
spend hours in a makeup chair.''
 &HT;    Her re-marriage and the fact that she hopes to become a mother,
says Stone, helped her weather turning 40 in March. (Her marriage
to producer Michael Greenberg ended after three years in l987.)
 &HT;    ``I often picked the wrong guy,'' she admits. ``I had problems
finding the right man simply because I never considered myself very
lovable. When boys came to my house when I was growing up it was to
see my younger sister Kelly. I was the ugly duckling in our family,
a real geek at high school. I had no sense of myself as a woman.''
 &HT;    But all that has changed since she met the macho Bronstein after
coming to San Francisco to star in this year's science fiction
movie ``Sphere.'' The film flopped but the romance blossomed.
Bronstein, say his friends, is a confident man with a strong sense
of his own identity who doesn't worry about becoming Mr. Sharon
Stone.
 &HT;    And he has certainly changed her perspective. ``I used to be in
love with my job _ and now I'm in love with my life and like my
job,'' says Stone. ``Stardom isn't the fuel of my soul any more.''

SEVERAL CURES FOR BATH WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 11, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a window in the tub area of my bathroom. I hate
plastic curtains, which seem to be the only solution for keeping
that window from getting soaked during showers. Is there any other
solution that would work?
</P>
<P>
   KEITH DINSMOOR, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are certainly solutions, but not necessarily ones that
would work for you. But what the heck, here they are:
</P>
<P>
   1. Take out the window and wall in the opening. Properly done,
this walling in is invisible. But it will work only if you install
an exhaust fan venting to the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   2. Take out the windows and put in one with glass blocks. It
will provide light and be watertight, but this installation would
also require an exhaust fan.
</P>
<P>
   3. Paint the window and frame with Zinsser's Perma-White
Mildew-Proof bathroom paint. It claims to resist mildew for up to
five years and to go over virtually any old painted surface.
</P>
<P>
   4. Despite your aversion to plastic curtains, consider a new one
anyway. The new shower curtains and curtains are quite soft and
remain that way; they can be quite attractive, some with patterns,
and are not the old-fasioned plastic that gets stiff and
unmanageable with age.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My black walnut trees are staining my concrete steps. I tried
bleach on without success. How can I clean the steps and keep them
clean?
</P>
<P>
   EDWIN GRAB, Newton
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try the bleach again, but this time leave it on the steps for
several minutes before scrubbing and rinsing. Wear skin and eye
protection when working with bleach. Or, make a strong solution of
Spic and Span and water, add a cup of bleach, apply this solution,
let it sit a while, then scrub and rinse.
</P>
<P>
   Or, try muriatic acid. This usually does nothing for stains, but
will etch off a very thin layer of concrete, possibly taking the
stains with it. Mix one part acid with one part water, and always
pour acid into water. Paint this solution on the stains, let it sit
a few minutes, then scrub and rinse. Wear skin and eye protection
when working with acid.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever cleans the concrete, you can then seal it with masonry
sealer, which will make the concrete resistant to water and stains.
The sealer must be renewed every year or so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I fill holes in vinyl siding left when wires and
small pipes were removed?
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT LOUT, Holyoke, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Almost any short plug will work: a round-headed stainless
steel bolt, or a plastic toilet bolt will do. You may have to cut
them short so they will fit in the small space behind the siding.
You can also seal the bolts with caulking. Paint them to match the
siding; a round-headed bolt might show as a slight bump, but
otherwise will be invisible.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. All the cedar shingles on my daughter's neighbors' houses in
Hingham have turned black over time. She is concerned about the
white cedar shingles on her new house. How can she prevent that
blackness?
</P>
<P>
   DONALD RUSSELL, Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The black is a natural aging and weathering process,
aggravated by mildew. The same could happen to your daughter's
white cedar shingles, designed to turn to an attractive, fairly
even silver color, without treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Painting or staining them is is not the answer. I suggest she
apply a coat of Cabot's bleaching oil, which will provide a light
gray color and enhance the weathering process, making the color a
little more even and the shingles a little more resistant to
mildew.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Piana of Canton, Mass. was another homeowner plagued by
little black dots that appeared on her siding. They did not respond
to bleach, so they were not standard mold or mildew but were rather
sticky dots, like tar.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Cynthia Piana did: ``I replaced a lot of wood chip
mulch around my house with crushed stone, going about two feet from
the foundation outwards. Then I took the dots off with a nylon
scrubber dipped in paint thinner, finally wiping with a dry
cloth.''
</P>
<P>
   You did right, Cynthia Piana; those black dots were probably
spores fired by a particular fungus lurking in that wood chip
mulch. Get rid of the mulch, and the fungus will leave.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I ordered a solar-powered pathway light for my back yard. Now
I am wondering if it will work in New England. It needs several
hours of charging from the sun in order to provide a few hours of
light. It was not expensive so I am not out a lot of money, but
with our overcast days in winter, I wonder if I will be without
light on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   J.S., Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You probably will, but that is a chance you have to take. All
you can do is try; there are plenty of sunny times in New England
winters, and if you locate it so it gets as much sun (when it is
shining) as possible, you'll get adequate light.
</P>

CLINTON'S WISE MEN HAVE ARRIVED 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have arrived. Not from the Orient, but from the Palm. Drawn
not by a star, but by a Starr. Bearing not holy gifts, but
unsolicited advice.
</P>
<P>
   The Wise Men are everywhere, again. Former White House Counsel
Lloyd Cutler, ``counselor to presidents,'' is trying to broker a
censure compromise to prevent impeachment. He, in turn, is aided by
two eminences-in-training: former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell and former White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta. Former
Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and former White House Counsel
Abner Mikva have joined them in opposition to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Gerald Ford proposed his remedy _ a
congressional rebuke _ in Sunday's New York Times. Former
presidential candidate Bob Dole and former Sen. Howard Baker have
suggested they would serve as intermediaries to the GOP if the
country demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   (Ford and Dole! Maybe they could join forces with Ross Perot,
who is flacking a resignation petition. The three could tour
together: ``America's Worst Presidential Candidates Advise the
President.'')
</P>
<P>
   Washington is supposed to be honored that all these Formers
would take time off from their day jobs (influence-peddling and
long lunches) to weigh in on Flytrap. The Wise Men, after all, are
our political elders. They have gravitas and worthy principles such
as ``nonpartisanship'' and ``preserving the dignity of the
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Washington, I am saddened to report, does not care. The
Republican impeachment steamroller has flattened the Wise Men.
Cutler's effort to gather congressional support for censure is
``dead on arrival,'' says one Democratic House Judiciary Committee
staffer. So is Ford's proposed rebuke. Dole has retreated, saying
that there can be no agreement before the election. Democrats cling
to the Wise Men, but congressional Republicans aren't bothering
with the pleas of a few old-timers. (What, after all, do
Republicans owe Dole, who drowned them in 1996?)
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Wise Men's acolytes believe their time may still
come. After the election, when Republicans realize the folly of
impeachment, they may well turn to the Wise Men to forge a
sufficiently punitive compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The indifference that has greeted the Wise Men so far has
prompted a great outpouring of nostalgic hoo-ha. Former
Something-or-Other Robert Strauss (``Mr. Democrat'') commented
mournfully in the Wall Street Journal about the degradation of the
polis.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, Strauss averred, the public never would
have heard about Flytrap. It would have been hushed up by Strauss
and his cronies, and a good thing too! The New York Times, too,
mourned the decline of Sage Culture in a recent ``Week in Review''
piece.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying sentiment of the hoo-ha seems to be: Wouldn't
everything be better if Cutler, Newt Gingrich, Trent Lott, and
Erskine Bowles sat down at the Metropolitan Club, shared a few
drinks, settled everything like gentlemen, and got back to work?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not necessarily. I'm all for a Flytrap compromise _ even
one brokered by Washington elders _ and I suppose Cutler was a
</P>
<P>
   (slightly) better presidential adviser than Harry Thomason. But
the decline of the Wise Men was both inevitable and desirable.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rise of cable news television and aggressive
investigative journalism, there is no behind-the-scenes anymore:
The backroom deals the Wise Men depended on are nearly impossible
today. Journalists don't cooperate in suppressing unsightly news.
The decay of party discipline crippled the Wise Men: They needed
strong political parties to enforce the deals they struck with
congressional leaders. Today's Congress is too chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   And the Wise Men don't fully deserve their romantic reputation.
As Evan Thomas, co-author of The Wise Men, notes, the Wise Men of
the '50s and '60s didn't compile a perfect record. They let
McCarthyism flourish, tolerated J. Edgar Hoover, and pushed a
disastrous Vietnam policy. They kept the press quiescent and
cooperative, allowing corruption and insider-dealing that would
never be tolerated today. Wise Man politics is elitism of the worst
sort: It distrusts democracy, so it circumvents it.

SUDDENLY MODERATION LOOKS GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, ``a source'' told the Washington Post that Paula
Jones' lawyers were blowing their chance at a settlement of their
case. According to the source, President Clinton ``was enraged'' at
the Jones team for spinning the settlement as an admission of
guilt. ``You cannot underestimate the personal feelings about
this,'' the source said. ``They've just really overplayed their
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, ``Democratic sources'' told the Post that Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., had ``discouraged'' an effort,
brought to his attention by Clinton, to head off an impeachment
inquiry altogether. Despite the ``intensive behind-the-scenes
lobbying Clinton is doing,'' the Post reported, the ``skepticism of
Daschle and other Democrats'' shows that they ``are placing clear
limits on what they will do to short-circuit the constitutional
process.'' ``White House and House Democratic sources made clear''
to the Post ``that what the administration wants has little effect
on how the Democrats shape their strategy.'' A source said House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., ``has made it clear that
nobody falls on his sword for Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Methinks the Democrats doth protest too much. In the impeachment
proceedings, as in the Jones case, Clinton is staking out an
extreme position in order to facilitate a deal in the middle. The
more he ``lobbies'' for acquittal while letting it be known that
Democrats are rejecting his entreaties, the more moderate and
reasonable the Democrats look, even as they obstruct and trash the
Republican-led inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when Republicans took over Congress, Clinton and
his new adviser, Dick Morris, embarked on a strategy called
``triangulation.'' According to this strategy, Clinton would stake
out a position between congressional Democrats and Republicans. By
rejecting the Democrats' views as too liberal, Clinton would help
himself look moderate, even as he obstructed and trashed the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Clinton has become a paragon of the moral laxity
many Americans (rightly or wrongly) associate with liberalism, he's
triangulating in reverse. He's helping the Democrats earn the
credibility necessary to keep their jobs in the upcoming election,
without taking away his job.
</P>
<P>
   The reverse triangulation is working brilliantly. On ABC's
``This Week,'' Cokie Roberts asked Gephardt about Clinton adviser
James Carville's recent declaration of war on House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. ``It's a free country,'' Gephardt answered, but ``we've
got to all take a deep breath (and) stop personal attacks back and
forth.'' George Will brought up the proposal ``by supporters of the
president'' to head off the impeachment inquiry altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is the way to do this,'' said Gephardt.
Roberts said that ``White House lobbying ... seems to be ticking
off the members of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Donaldson said that ``a lot of Democrats on the Hill ... are
very upset the president and Mrs. Clinton (are) trying to make this
a party-line vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a buried newspaper quote, an anonymous Clinton
adviser hinted at the real strategy: ``Our focus is still on the
(impeachment) resolution and the Democratic alternative and how we
can build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In schools where corporal punishment is still administered, kids
who misbehave are sometimes offered a choice of punishments: They
can be spanked, or they can spend several afternoons in
after-school detention. Detention is painless but prolonged.
Spanking is humiliating but over in a few seconds. Kids who are
both tough and smart choose spanking. You can bet Bill Clinton was
that kind of kid.

THE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WARS, PART 37 
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH SHULEVITZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The backlash against William G. Bowen and Derek Bok's ``The
Shape of the River,'' a liberal defense of affirmative action, has
kicked into gear, and much of it won't surprise you.
</P>
<P>
   There's the attacker: Abigail Thernstrom, co-author (with her
husband Stephan) of ``America in Black and White: One Nation,
Indivisible'' and one of the loudest opponents of affirmative
action around.
</P>
<P>
   There's the old juggle-with-numbers. Is a 75 percent graduation
rate for blacks at top colleges proof of the success of
race-sensitive admissions or of its failure?
</P>
<P>
   Proof of success, according to Bowen and Bok; proof of failure,
according to Thernstrom. The white graduation rate is 86 percent,
so she reconfigures the stats to show that blacks have a dropout
rate that's 78 percent higher for blacks than for whites.
</P>
<P>
   But Thernstom's main argument is original. She says an education
at an elite college doesn't matter as much as everyone says it
does, so elite colleges shouldn't work so hard to admit more
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen and Bok claim we need affirmative action from top schools
because that's what created the black middle class in the first
place? Not so fast! says Thernstrom: ``Where are their control
groups, demonstrating in some rigorous fashion that the equally
academically strong, ambitious and discipline black student who
attends the University of South Carolina instead of Oberlin does
less well in life?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking hard data, Thernstrom supplies anecdotal evidence: a
list of blacks who did well in life even though they didn't go to
Princeton or Penn. It includes Cynthia Tucker, editorial writer at
the Atlanta Constitution, who went to Auburn University; Clarence
Page, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune, who went to Ohio; Brent
Staples of the New York Times, who went to Widener, Vernon Jordan,
who went to Depauw; and so on.
</P>
<P>
   We are charmed by a certain self-inverting quality to
Thernstrom's argument. If like her we believe in strict formal
equality in all things (rather than remedies to past
discrimination), and black people don't need fancy schools to do
well in life, why should we think white people need them either?
</P>
<P>
   Think of the current master of the universe, Disney chief
Michael Eisner, who graduated from Denison, a university in
Granville, Ohio. Or Steven Spielberg, who never graduated at all.
</P>
<P>
   But if white people don't need degrees from tony colleges to
succeed, why do Thernstrom and her cohorts care so much about these
schools' efforts to level the playing field? The better strategy
would be to cede it altogether, leaving blacks to enjoy their
Pyrric victory. More fools they, that they believe in the power of
a Harvard education!
</P>
<P>
   Thernstrom sent her daughter, Melanie Thernstrom, to Harvard, so
we know she doesn't accept the unintended consequences of her own
argument. But that doesn't undermine her case entirely. Thernstrom
is translating for broad consumption a debate raging among
economists. It is widely known that there is a huge economic return
on higher education in general.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Is there a bigger one on an education at an
elite school? In other words, does it matter where you went to
college or that you went to college?
</P>
<P>
   In purely economic terms, it turns out, it matters only that you
went to college. But pure economics doesn't explain why people like
Thernstrom care so much about getting their kids into Harvard. The
answer is that a Harvard education does more than get your child
into the middle-class, or even the upper-middle class. It plugs
your child directly into a network of people who make up what used
to be called the Establishment--which is exactly where Thernstrom
would want her daughter to be.

`HOLY MAN' CAN'T PROFIT FROM PROPHET PREMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HOLY MAN 
Directed by: Stephen Herek 
Screenplay by: Tom Schulman 
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Jeff Goldblum, Kelly Preston, Robert
Loggia, Jon Cryer, Erin McCormack 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: PG (some language) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's all the difference in the world between a great premise
and a great screenplay drawn from that premise. Sometimes the
difference turns into a yawning gap, as in ``Holy Man,'' the new
Eddie Murphy vehicle. On paper, it seems a case of a movie long
overdue, as a guru stumbles into a home shopping network and turns
out to be a dynamite pitchman without trying to be. The link
between religion and consumerism, perfected by TV, has begged to be
skewered. But ``Holy Man'' doesn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is that Murphy's beatific guru in his long white
tunic is no con man. His mile-wide smile is the real thing. Which,
of course, is what makes his character such a hot salesman. He goes
on camera knocking materialism, and obviously meaning it. But just
when the people in the control booth start going crazy, wondering
what kind of loose cannon they're dealing with, the phones start
ringing and the merchandise starts flying off the shelves because
he has neutralized people's guilt about buying it.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But the film doesn't know where to go with
Murphy's spiritual pilgrim. Or even that it ought to go with him,
and tell us more, or at least give him more screen time. What we do
see of him intrigues us, especially after a few party tricks with a
disappearing Rolex watch convince us that he could have been, or
was at one time, a very efficient scam artist. But now, for
whatever reason, the mysterious stranger who calls himself G has
genuinely seen the light.
</P>
<P>
   Fatally relegating G to catalyst status, the film bores us with
a dully earnest struggle for the soul of Jeff Goldblum's TV exec,
who exploits G's selling skills to save his own skin when Robert
Loggia's results-hungry shark buys the station. Goldblum's exec has
another incentive after falling for marketing specialist Kelly
Preston, who pertly but unconvincingly draws the line at selling
one's soul after it dawns on him that his unscheduled house guest,
G, is a human sales machine.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle for the nerdy executive's soul is frankly less than
compelling. The film spins its wheels with predictable prefab
moves, including the usual romantic complications between Goldblum
and Preston, while Murphy's G beamingly looks on, following his
bliss. Too bad he didn't have more of a script to follow. He
certainly shows up ready to do a job, and does what he can with the
stunted material he's offered. But the Murphy comeback express into
family films stalls with ``Holy Man.''

POPS RING THE SEASON IN WITH SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Lockhart's fourth CD with the Boston Pops pictures the
conductor in a Santa Claus suit in front of a Christmas tree
decorated with lollipops. But there is no other acknowledgement of
Christmas on the outside of the album, although nearly all the
music is specifically associated with the sacred or the
department-store window, cash-register aspects of the season.
BMG/RCA Victor has followed the Pops on its misguided journey onto
the thin and slippery ice of political correctness. The outside
appearance of this album eliminates Christmas from ``Holiday
Pops.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately the performances do not, and Lockhart's first
Christmas CD can keep company with its celebrated (and
best-selling) predecessors recorded under Arthur Fiedler and John
Williams, although it's short as an LP, clocking in at 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   As in Symphony Hall, one notes and regrets the absence of
anything festively baroque, but there is some very good music of
religious inspiration here, including Bizet's ``Farandole,'' which
incorporates an old French carol; the ``Shepherd's Chorus'' from
Berlioz's ``L'Enfance du Christ,'' tenderly sung by the Tanglewood
Festival Chorus; and Vaughan-Williams's ``Fantasia on Christmas
Carols,'' which features Metropolitan Opera baritone Mark Oswald as
a warm-voiced soloist. The ``Gloria'' by Randol Alan Bass has
become a Lockhart favorite; it sets out to be effective and it is,
but one wishes it had set out to be distinguished as well. Another
Lockhart favorite has been an arrangement of ``Mary's Little Boy
Child'' by Jester Hariston; this song was a hit for Harry Belafonte
30 years ago, and Lockhart learned it from a record by the Harry
Simeone Chorale that was in his father's Christmas-album
collection. A perennial favorite is the choral version of
Leontovich's ``Carol of the Bells.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Pops repertory comes a collection of traditional
wassails arranged by Patrick Hollenbeck (which includes his own
neighborhood contribution, the ``Westland Avenue Wassail,'' and a
nifty episode for early instruments); ``Christmas Time Is Here''
from ``A Charlie Brown Christmas''; ``Good Swing Wenceslas'';
``Frosty All the Way!'' (an arrangement that combines ``Frosty the
Snowman'' and ``Jingle Bells''); Leroy Anderson's ``Sleigh Ride''
(recorded by the Pops for the first time in an arrangement for
chorus and orchestra that uses the lyrics fashioned for the piece
by Mitchell Parish), and ``Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas'' from
John Williams's score for the movie ``Home Alone 2.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the album avoids Symphony Hall's most
frequent seasonal lapse of taste: there are few collisions of
sacred and secular, as if they were the same thing, or equivalent.
``Silver Bells'' may not be the best possible introduction to
``Carol of the Bells,'' but there's a worse blot in the arrangement
that includes the greatest hit from Bob Hope's movie ``The Lemon
Drop Kid'' _ a rather peculiar medley ``Christmas Waltzes'' which
includes ``My Favorite Things'' from ``The Sound of Music,'' which
is not a Christmas waltz; a bit of ``It Came Upon a Midnight
Clear'' incongrously wanders in.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christmas albums are recorded in the summer for seasonal
release; this one was made last Dec. 30 and 31 following a full run
of ``Holiday Pops'' concerts. A personnel list in the album makes
it evident that many members of the Boston Pops chose not to work
on New Year's Eve; their places were confidently taken by freelance
members of the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra. Cellist Martha
Babcock contributes an eloquent cello solo to the Vaughan-Williams
work. Lockhart contributes a high energy level and assures a high
level of polish; everything sounds well played and sung, and
producer Shawn Murphy's recorded sound is sumptuous. There's also a
sense of occasion that you don't get at each and every concert in
the ``Holiday Pops'' season. The Tanglewood Festival Chorus, which
records less often than the orchestra, clearly did not view this as
a routine assignment; the chorus sounds wonderful. So does the
children's chorus PALS (Performing Artists at Lincoln School) which
sings the ``Charlie Brown'' selection. (Like Oswald, PALS receives
no credit on the outside of the album; you have to buy it to find
out they're there).
</P>
<P>
   The formula represented by this album clearly works; a ``Holiday
Pops'' tour takes Lockhart and the Esplanade Orchestra to arenas in
17 cities; the Symphony Hall dates are Dec. 15-24 and 26-30.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart contributes breezy notes written in the style of a
family Christmas letter, with lots of exclamation points. He refers
directly to Christmas at least a dozen times, so at least he knew
what kind of album he was making.

HONDA REINVENTS THE MINI WITH THE 1999 ODYSSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, October 11, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ There has been considerable discussion over just who
invented the minivan. Some would credit the Germans _ remember the
Volkswagen Microbus? It was not exactly a mini, about the size of
some standard American vans of the time, and with seats for seven
or so, but its underpowered rear-mounted engine was mini easy on
gas.
</P>
<P>
   Others favor the Japanese who shortly after the end of World War
II had mini delivery vans, rear-drive little boxes suitable for
narrow Japanese streets, later exported to the United States as
pasenger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the front-drive, carlike mini was a Chrysler idea and a
Honda executive cheerfully credited Chrysler Corp. with the
invention of the minivan _ on the occasion of Honda's introduction
of its reinvention of the mini, the 1999 Odyssey, a ``no
compromise, take-no-prisoners vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Odyssey is very different from the old Odyssey _ which
isn't exactly old in the grand scheme of things. In some ways the
new Odyssey is different from anything else on wheels. It is the
largest vehicle ever produced by Honda and, unlike the old Odyssey,
it is built on this side of the world, in a new plant in Alliston,
Ont., an hour's drive from downtown Toronto. Honda marked the
occasion of the birth of the new van by showing off the birthplace
and the vehicular infant. The plant is impressive and Toronto is a
beautiful city, but for this columnist the real lure was the chance
to drive the new Odyssey across Canada and back to the Globe. The
resulting 1,000 or so miles behind the wheel of an Odyssey lends
support to the Honda claim that it is the ``new standard'' in vans.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Odyssey is a 3.5-liter ``variable'' horsepower
V-6 mated with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Variable? With
premium-grade fuel, the new engine puts out 210 horsepower; with
regular grades, the horsepower drops to 205 _ believe me, you can
live with that.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Odyssey isn't a van body with sedan doors like the
old model, which, by the way, Honda will continue to build and sell
in Japan. On the basic $23,200 LX, sliding doors on each side offer
passenger access; on the $25,800 EX (same price as the '98, but
with ``more stuff,'' Honda says), both doors are powered, operated
by a pair of switches on the left side of the dash or by pulling
the handle. But wait, there's more _ the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Up front is a pair of buckets with a folding tray table between
_ when folded it allows access to the rear. Behind that is a pair
of seats separated by aisle, with another folding tray table
between. You prefer a bench? Unlatch one seat and push it over; you
now have a two-passenger bench with aisle space on the side. Either
seat is easily removable by an average person (or a slightly
arthritic auto columnist). In the rear is what Honda calls the
``magic seat,'' a three-passenger bench that folds and disappears
into the floor leaving a flat cargo area suitable for hauling
4(MUL)8 sheets of plywood inside the van. Folding eliminates the
need for removal to convert to cargo, a three-passenger seat is a
handful for two.
</P>
<P>
   When it's in use, there is a well behind the rear seat _ what it
folds into _ that increases cargo area available for luggage. So
where's the spare? Inside the van under the floor between the front
and second rows.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the seats requires no fussing with seatbelt anchors;
there are shoulder belts for seven and head rests for all. Storage?
The glove box isn't much but there are drawers, bins and plenty of
places to fit stuff. And enough cupholders for a convention.
</P>
<P>
   So, after a day of tooling around Toronto in each of the two
models, visiting the factory, and listening to the spiel, it is
finally time to venture forth for home in an Odyssey EX _ north on
Route 11A to Highway 401, the longest stretch of freeway in a
single political enclave stretching 510 miles from the shadow of
Detroit across Ontario to the Quebec border. It is excellent
roadway, divided, with a 100 kilometer (62 miles) per hour speed
limit. The Canadians make me feel right at home by totally ignoring
that despite frequent signs announcing horrendous fines.
</P>
<P>
   The routine is: Drive 100 miles, then stop and get out of the
car to walk around, eat, etc. In the middle of nowhere in
particular, with traffic highballing at around 80 _ that's miles _
I spot this guy in a suit on a bridge. Why does a man in a suit
hang around bridges in the boondocks? Answer: Speed trap. I
instinctively let off the gas approaching the bridge; a quarter
mile beyond are police cruisers and officers pulling people over.
</P>
<P>
   A good part of the way runs along the north shore of Lake
Ontario, close enough to see that inland fresh-water sea. At the
Quebec border, the good road gives way to the Canadian version of
Route 1 and the Big Dig _ and it is rush hour in Montreal. Creep,
crawl and discover that Quebecois in cars are a lot like Boston
area folk _ that is to say, nutballs at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching Sherbrooke, I miss the road best taken, find myself
in a strange city as night falls, somewhat uncertain of my route
... I violate the adult male driving handbook and enter an auto
parts store seeking navigational aid. They speak French here; I do
not. But they are friendly, helpful and a gentleman in a white coat
gives me precise directions through town to Route 212. From there
it is a plasant romp through little villages to the customs post at
Coburn Gore in northwest Maine, 498.2 miles from downtown Toronto.
The customs agent climbs in, pretends not to be looking around in
search of smuggled five-gallon toilets, checks my passport, asks my
business and bids me good night.
</P>
<P>
   From here it is south along Route 27 with lakes shimmering in
the moonlight on my right, tall spooky pines on my left; 52 miles
later I pull into Kingfield, Maine _ enough driving for one day, I
think.
</P>
<P>
   It is another 143 miles home, then 86 miles to the Globe, and
... the driving continues. For 850 miles checked, the van, EPA
rated 18 miles per gallon city, 26 highway, is delivering 22.47
m.p.g.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Odyssey is a lot of classy van, nice handling, quick
enough and easy on gas; Chrysler and Ford have real competition
here.
</P>
<P>
   I like this van _ I like it a lot. What took these guys so long
to do this?

`BAD MANNERS' JUST AN ACADEMIC EXERCISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An academic couple and their house guests have a long, boozy
encounter filled with verbal sparring, sexual tension, shifting
alliances, humiliations and revelations. ``Who's Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?'' _ right? But it's also a spot-on summary of ``Bad
Manners,'' Jonathan Kaufer's new dark comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Both movies offer a curdled view of academia, lots of nasty
personal gamesmanship and the pleasure of watching talented casts
at work. But the likeness ends there. If ``Virginia Woolf'' is a
dissertation on the woes of modern marriage, ``Bad Manners'' is
more of an undergraduate essay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manners'' is based on David Gilman's ``Ghost in the Machine,''
which debuted at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater in 1993 and also ran
off-Broadway. Gilman adapted the play for director Kaufer, whose
only previous feature was the 1982 picture ``Soup for One.''
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen the play, but Kaufer's notes say the film's
producers wanted the movie to have ``more humor,'' and that it was
decided the picture would resolve a key question the play left
unanswered. These are not encouraging signs.
</P>
<P>
   The set-up: Nancy (Bonnie Bedelia) is a successful professor
living in Cambridge, Mass.; her husband, Wes (David Strathairn), a
teacher of comparative religion, is upset at having been denied
tenure. He's in no mood for guests, especially one of his wife's
old boyfriends, Matt (Saul Rubinek), a musicologist lecturing at
Harvard. Upping the ante is the presence of Matt's young paramour,
the sexually provocative Kim (Caroleen Feeney), a computer expert.
</P>
<P>
   Matt says he's discovered a quotation from a Martin Luther hymn
in the middle of a recent computer-generated musical composition, a
finding he expects to stun the music world. The acerbic Wes
suspects a hoax, and isn't shy about saying so. Meanwhile, Kim adds
to the strains on her middle-aged hosts' marriage by toying with
Wes, and suggesting that Nancy might enjoy a fling or two with
handsome young students. But the real fun begins when Wes finds a
$50 bill missing from his wallet, and is convinced Kim took it.
</P>
<P>
   The characters jockey for dominance, fret about the missing $50
and flirt with betrayal. There's plenty of trouble to go around,
and much seems to lead back to sultry Kim. But dramas of this sort
continually tease us: Who is actually doing what to whom?
</P>
<P>
   Bedelia (``Heart Like a Wheel,'' ``Die Hard''), who hasn't had
the parts she deserves, is fine here. Strathairn, probably best
known for his early roles in John Sayles' movies, offers a sharp
portrayal of a conflicted and vulnerable academic. Canadian actor
Rubinek, star of Kaufer's ``Soup for One,'' is good as an arrogant
type begging to be taken down, while Feeney is a convincing sexual
troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Kim voices a professional interest in meta-games
(games about games), which suggests Kaufer is shooting for
something ambitious that he can't really pull off. ``Bad Manners''
has its moments, and the characters get off a few wicked zingers,
but it seems secondhand. Besides the watered-down Albee, there are
distant (and I stress ``distant'') echoes of Pinter, especially
``The Homecoming.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a particularly challenging kind of drama, with its
emphasis on verbal power struggles and strategic withholding of key
information. It surely doesn't help that the director felt
constrained to lighten things up.

HARPS OF MANY VOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swiss harpist Andreas Vollenweider is starting his first solo
tour, but he's bringing enough instruments to supply a large
orchestra. He'll move around to play gothic harp, Celtic harp, kora
(African harp), cheng (Chinese harp), wind chimes, gongs, piano,
accordion, flute, soprano saxophone, and, yes, tuned salad bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more stuff on the road than ever before, because of all
these custom-made instruments,'' says Vollenweider, the New Age
pioneer who headlines Jordan Hall in Boston Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's calling it his ``naked tour.'' He explains: ``I just
finished an extensive tour with a 90-piece orchestra and a lot of
guest musicians. So this is a kind of naked tour.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also his attempt to be a musical troubadour who can still
connect with the ancient art of storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to do is not just play a solo concert but have
people create stories in their mind,'' he says. ``I'm following the
ancient history of storytelling, because by listening to
storytellers is how people had their imaginations trained. The
listener is still the key element.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider, who has been a New Age icon since his 1989 album
``Dancing with the Lion,'' has so far only brought his solo tour to
a few opera houses in Europe and to a theater inside a volcanic
cave on the Canary Islands. If you get the impression this man is
an adventurer who eschews boundaries, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   The new tour ``is more of a theatrical project, actually, so I
also need some theatrical lights to make it work,'' he says. ``And
I have sound effects to tie the pieces together. I have pedals and
triggers all over the stage for that. And sometimes I could be
triggering something very subtle, like you might hear people
walking or hear a door closing.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider also has a MIDI (computerized) setup on his harp to
color the sound and add more sonic shadings. And the instruments
will range from a classical harp to an African kora, which is a
gourd covered with goatskin that has 24 strings. ``It sounds very
raw,'' he says. ``And I also play a Chinese harp, which is
horizontally played. You can even play blues on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The night's repertoire will come from past Vollenweider albums,
as well as his new one, ``Kryptos,'' which is designed to be a
musical journey into mythological lands, exemplified by the song
titles ``Morgana's Place,'' ``Herme's Wedding,'' and ``Trigon.''
The album includes guest appearances from South African vocal group
Ladysmith Black Mambazo and from singer/violinist Mindy Jostyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories are there in the music, but it's not my job to
make things clear,'' says Vollenweider, sounding more mystical as
the interview goes along. ``I want to confuse people. It's like
Surrealism, to make people see things from another angle. To me,
nothing is clear and it gets less clear every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look at the undefinable,'' he adds. ``We destroy so
many things by trying to describe them. I want to step out of the
restrictions of reality, and start with the imagination to expand
our vision and our culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all sounds very intellectual, but it's not meant to be,''
he says with a laugh. ``It's meant to be one flowing experience.
... It's like a movie without a picture. I want it to be a 3-D
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Vollenweider has been known to American audiences for the
past decade (Carly Simon became one of his biggest boosters and
helped gain him national attention), he's been touring in Europe
for more than 20 years. He has often played up to 250 concerts a
year with his regular band, so stepping out on his own marks quite
a departure. He'll rejoin his band in the future, but for now, he's
relishing the solo tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying it immensely,'' he says. ``I feel totally free.''

URBAN SINGLES ALONE IN THE BIG CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
UNMADE BEDS 
Directed and written by: Nicholas Barker 
Starring: Brenda Monte, Aimee Copp, Michael De Stefano, Mikey
Russo 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Unrated 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It won't do to denounce the voyeurism that drives Nicholas
Barker's ``Unmade Beds'' because the truth is that it hooks us from
the start. It's not quite fact, not quite fiction. British
documentarian and anthropologist Barker found four veterans of the
New York City singles scene, taped hours of interviews with them,
then fashioned for each a script of their lives and had them play
themselves on camera. You keep hoping they won't meet one another
and ruin with contrived interaction the isolation they have in
common. Mercifully, they don't. Not for nothing does the film take
its visual cue from an Edward Hopper reproduction on a wall. It's
attuned to a similar world of urban loneliness, never losing a
chance to portray the solitary confinement the city's grids impose
upon us.
</P>
<P>
   What the four have in common is the conviction that it's the
world that's failing them, never the reverse, that if they just
hang in there and keep doing the same things, sooner or later life
will click for them. Two, a former lapdancer named Brenda Monte and
a recently fired security expert and unproduced screenplay writer
named Mikey Russo, proclaim themselves highly desirable. Voluptuous
Brenda, who needs money to catch up with the mortgage payments on
her condo, wants an old man to dish out the cash she needs and
excpect nothing in return. In the film's comic high point, she
examines her scantily-clad body in a full-length mirror and doesn't
like the changes beginning to arrive, but is bluntly honest about
confronting them.
</P>
<P>
   She perhaps protests too much. Her world consists of men
inflamed with sexual longings for her, to which she remains
scornfully aloof. She loves her pet dog, announces that it's going
to have to wait for an operation it needs until she raises the $400
to pay for it, but blithely rationalizes that it's OK to steal dog
food from the supermarket because God imposed her dog's appetite on
her. As she tools around the city in her car, being photographed
from the passenger seat, she's a bawdy mix of candor and
unapologetic self-interest. Utterly without self-pity and bristling
with survival skills, she steals more than Alpo. She also steals
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Russo, who at 54 refuses to bring up to the conscious level the
fact that his cool swinger routine is looking more than a little
sad and desperate, is very much into role-playing and
self-dramatization. The rejected screenplays he writes all involve
the romantic capers of thinly disguised versions of himself. He's
no Redford or Newman type, he says, telling us nothing we haven't
already grasped. He sees himself more as a Nicholson or Harvey
Keitel kind of guy. For him the world is divided into babes and
mutts. And he prides himself on never suffering mutts for long.
When a blind date doesn't meet his standard, he has himself beeped,
and skips out.
</P>
<P>
   Aimee Copp and Michael De Sefano harbor no illusions about their
attractiveness. Aimee, 28, is under pressure to marry before she's
30. She's funny, self-deprecating, and bright. She also weighs 225
pounds, a fact that brings her to tears when her thinner girlfriend
accuses her of being in denial about the need to lose weight. All
she can find are men who want to fetishize her because of her size.
Michael, pushing 40, is increasingly unable to keep the lid on his
bitterness over being rejected because he's five-feet-four. Tired
of deflecting queries about whether he's gay, he lapses into
homophobic remarks about women hanging around gay choreographers
and make-up artists instead of throwing themselves to heterosexual
companions. Yet he comes across as an essentially decent guy who's
just been turned down too many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unmade Beds'' leaves unanswered the question of when clarity
becomes cruelty and whether Barker's exploitation of the four
singles becomes acceptable in view of their complicity in inviting
several kinds of exposure, or unacceptable in view of the film's
highlighting tendency to present them as freaks. At times their
yearnings seem pathetic and self-deluding; at other times, they
seem spunky and vigorously resilient. We never see the presumably
disastrous dates they go on. We see only the selves they present to
the camera. In the end, the knowledge that Barker has manipulated
the four is likely to prove more unsettling than anything any of
them say or do. Either way, ``Unmade Beds'' is a brash, vigorous,
sometimes surprisingly moody study of four strikeout artists
ensnared by their hangups, more alone than they want to be in the
big city.

PETER WOLF REDISCOVERS HIS SOUL IN R&AMP;B 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At long last comes a Peter Wolf album that does justice to his
J. Geils Band legacy and to his disciple's love of classic soul.
Wolf's new album, ``Fool's Parade,'' is without a doubt the best
and most personal of his solo records since Geils broke up 14 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is just a beginning for me,'' says Wolf. ``I
worked into something that was always in front of me, but I never
realized it until I started `Fool's Parade.' It comes out of a
great love for the R&AMP;B tradition, but is an attempt to make it
relevant to the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   The album comes out Oct. 20, while the first single, ``Turnin'
Pages,'' has just been released. Sings Wolf: ``My life's going on,
turnin' pages.'' Welcome to the future _ and it's an uncanny
updating of the past. Just as Keith Richards did on his solo album,
``Talk is Cheap,'' Wolf brings fresh energy to the tight-knit
ensemble sound born in Memphis and Muscle Shoals. It's also a sound
perfected from his days in the Geils Band and from such past highs
as singing with Aretha Franklin and serving as MC on this summer's
``Royal Soul Revue'' tour, featuring Percy Sledge, Carla Thomas,
and Lloyd Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from the masters,'' Wolf says of that tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I started to make the record, I also went back to listen to
a lot of Stax records (from Memphis) and Muscle Shoals (Alabama)
records. I listened to Arthur Alexander, who did `You Better Move
On,' which the Stones did, and `Anna,' which the Beatles first did.
And I listened to a lot of Al Green and Aretha and Don Covay. And
then I came across this Dan Penn record _ he wrote `I'm Your
Puppet,' `Dark End of the Street,' and `The Letter.' I started
re-reading Peter Guralnick's book, `Sweet Soul Music.' It was all a
revelation _ and I wanted to create that vibe for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf succeeds admirably. His new album opens confessionally with
the disarming ``Long Way Back Again,'' in which he sings, ``I spent
my whole life chasing rainbows/I just hope there's something
left.'' There's at least plenty of funk left, witness ``The Cold
Heart of the Stone,'' a reminiscence of Cambridge in the '60s when
buddy Van Morrison lived on Green Street and the two men shared
inspiration and craziness.
</P>
<P>
   As the song goes: ``Green Street full of memories/wild hearts
doing what they please ... every night was a fool's parade/we'd get
so lost in the plans we made/we were cracking up, we were breaking
down/ we were filled with fire, burning up the town/we lived it
all, right down to the bone/to the cold heart of the stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar themes are espoused in the songs ``All Torn Up''
(``nobody wants to be alone at closing time''), the rocking ``Ride
Lonesome, Ride Hard'' (``you got to go where the road is taking
you''), and the mid-tempo funk of ``Roomful of Angels'' (``I need a
roomful of angels to see me through tonight'').
</P>
<P>
   To make the record, Wolf gathered a close ensemble that includes
musician friends Kenny White (who co-produced the record with him),
Boston guitarist Duke Levine (who tours with Mary Chapin
Carpenter), keyboardist Leon Pendarvis (who has played with Stevie
Wonder), background vocalist Ada Dyer (who also does a great duet
on ``Pleasing to Me''), and the Uptown Horns, who had toured with
the Geils Band and Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   An eerie irony came when Wolf realized the studio he used _ Sear
Sound in Manhattan _ was formerly the Hit Factory, where the Geils
Band recorded ``Give It to Me'' in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had changed the studio around and I didn't realize it,''
says Wolf. ``But there was something very rewarding that, after all
these years, I was still in the race, fulfilling my passion. And I
felt exactly the same as when the Geils Band was in that studio
doing `Give It to Me.' We were trying to take some roots music _
Titus Turner songs and reggae songs and blues songs and R&AMP;B songs _
and make it work in a way that made sense to us. And that's exactly
what I was trying to do now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take a vibe and a mood and use the knowledge that I
had to create a new sensibility,'' adds Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through trials and tribulations like many people,
and through numerous loves and heartbreaks, and many a sleepless
night. And I've gotten to travel and see the world and meet some of
the greatest artists from Tennessee Williams to Harold Pinter to
Muddy Waters to Howlin' Wolf to Don Covay. I've spent hours and
hours drinking with Sam Phillips or sitting in a hotel room with
Van Morrison and Freddie Hubbard. All those people and those
midnight drives sort of ended up on `Fool's Parade.' For me, it's
just the beginning.''

`HOLY MAN' DOESN'T HAVE A PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Jeff Goldblum, two actors one doesn't usually
associate with low energy, star in a living retread, ``Holy Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Part ``Network,'' part ``Truman Show'' and fully boring, ``Holy
Man'' asks us to believe that a spiritual man can help sell
products on a home-shopping channel by telling the viewers not to
buy products, and this works so well that in a matter of weeks he
is on the cover of Time, Newsweek, USA Today and featured on
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy plays the enigmatically named G, a man on an unspecified
religious pilgrimage who is sidetracked by the two top executives
of the shopping channel, Ricky (Goldblum) and Kate (Kelly Preston).
They have a flat tire; G strolls across the highway, magically
avoiding the crowded, on-rushing traffic. He's so loving and
positive, he thanks a group of rednecks who pelt him with a paper
cup full of soda for not using a can.
</P>
<P>
   G decides to stick around because he senses Ricky, a
self-absorbed egotist, needs spiritual assistance. In order to save
Ricky's soul, G decides to sell his soul _ hawking products to keep
Ricky's boss (Robert Loggia) from firing him.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Tom Schulman, who won an Oscar for writing ``Dead Poets
Society,'' and director Stephen Herek (with a resume as diverse as
``Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure'' and ``Mr. Holland's Opus'')
obviously see G as the cure for an ailing, materialistic society.
He becomes the anti-Howard Beale: He's happy as hell, and he's not
going to take it anymore. Yet if he's truly making a connection,
how can the network's sales skyrocket?
</P>
<P>
   It's also troublesome that Murphy, a generally charismatic
actor, is downright dull here. He and Goldblum are curiously flat
in their line readings; they don't seem convinced by the story
they're asked to act out, and with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The problems stem from an overall softness of the picture.
Because the filmmakers want to appeal to a broad section of the
audience, they never explore the spirituality or religious
philosophy of G. In fact, never does he mention God or any other
type of deity. During a montage examining the G phenomenon,
priests, rabbis, imams and other religious leaders try to claim him
as their own, as if he were an enigma like Chance in ``Being
There.''
</P>
<P>
   He looks like a Buddhist, with his shaved head and flowing white
robe, but all he ever says to his viewing public are variations on
the ``Look around you, take time out to enjoy life'' spiel.
Occasionally, he bends down to smell the grass.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure we get it, Herek gives us villains _ Loggia as the
greedy, cutthroat network owner and Erik McCormack as a conniver
after Ricky's job _ as one-note as Snidely Whiplash, and a damsel
in distress in Preston, who's one more woman in a Hollywood film
waiting for her man (Ricky) to come around.
</P>
<P>
   And when that man does come around, he gives the most
self-serving, ridiculous speech that's hardly the embodiment of
selflessness _ one more example of a film that tries to have it
both ways.

DON'T BE DOOMED BY A BAGUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every country has its superstitions. So if you don't want your
vacation to be cursed (or have the locals curse you), avoid these
practices, reported by Travel Holiday:
</P>
<P>
   _In France, putting a baguette on a restaurant table with the
flat side up is a sign of doom.
</P>
<P>
   _In Japan, the numbers 4 and 9 are unlucky. Buildings often
don't have floors labeled fourth or ninth, and residents may even
avoid the numbers in conversation. Why? Because the Japanese words
for them sound a lot like their words for ``death'' and ``pain.''
</P>
<P>
   _In Sweden, putting keys on a table is considered bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   _In Russia, shaking hands in a doorway is a no-no. So is
whistling inside a building _ that means you're about to lose
money.
</P>
<P>
   _Ah, but there are good luck practices, too. In Thailand,
sighting the occasional elephant in Bangkok traffic is a positive
sign. Even better, for a small fee you can walk under its belly.
And, the magazine says, if you're a pregnant woman who does so,
that's bonus luck!

that's hardly all: 1 million pennies will be given in the

frankfurters, Eric Rudd of Falmouth, Mass. adds the wiener, which
is short for wienerwurst, which means Vienna sausage. The
dictionary defines a wiener as a frankfurter, so why names that
honor Frankfurt and Vienna? Here's the answer, according to the
Associated Press: Johann Lahner, the German butcher who concocted
the delicacy, learned his trade in Frankfurt before moving to
Vienna and opening a butcher shop in 1804. A year later, both
cities lent their names to his invention. The name ``hot dog'' and
the bun were American creations, though.

   TORONTO _ There has been considerable discussion over just who
invented the minivan. Some would credit the Germans _ remember the
Volkswagen Microbus? It was not exactly a mini, about the size of
some standard American vans of the time, and with seats for seven
or so, but its underpowered rear-mounted engine was mini easy on
gas.

   Others favor the Japanese who shortly after the end of World War
II had mini delivery vans, rear-drive little boxes suitable for
narrow Japanese streets, later exported to the United States as
pasenger vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But the front-drive, carlike mini was a Chrysler idea and a
Honda executive cheerfully credited Chrysler Corp. with the
invention of the minivan _ on the occasion of Honda's introduction
of its reinvention of the mini, the 1999 Odyssey, a ``no
compromise, take-no-prisoners vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Odyssey is very different from the old Odyssey _ which
isn't exactly old in the grand scheme of things. In some ways the
new Odyssey is different from anything else on wheels. It is the
largest vehicle ever produced by Honda and, unlike the old Odyssey,
it is built on this side of the world, in a new plant in Alliston,
Ont., an hour's drive from downtown Toronto. Honda marked the
occasion of the birth of the new van by showing off the birthplace
and the vehicular infant. The plant is impressive and Toronto is a
beautiful city, but for this columnist the real lure was the chance
to drive the new Odyssey across Canada and back to the Globe. The
resulting 1,000 or so miles behind the wheel of an Odyssey lends
support to the Honda claim that it is the ``new standard'' in vans.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Odyssey is a 3.5-liter ``variable'' horsepower
V-6 mated with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Variable? With
premium-grade fuel, the new engine puts out 210 horsepower; with
regular grades, the horsepower drops to 205 _ believe me, you can
live with that.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Odyssey isn't a van body with sedan doors like the
old model, which, by the way, Honda will continue to build and sell
in Japan. On the basic $23,200 LX, sliding doors on each side offer
passenger access; on the $25,800 EX (same price as the '98, but
with ``more stuff,'' Honda says), both doors are powered, operated
by a pair of switches on the left side of the dash or by pulling
the handle. But wait, there's more _ the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Up front is a pair of buckets with a folding tray table between
_ when folded it allows access to the rear. Behind that is a pair
of seats separated by aisle, with another folding tray table
between. You prefer a bench? Unlatch one seat and push it over; you
now have a two-passenger bench with aisle space on the side. Either
seat is easily removable by an average person (or a slightly
arthritic auto columnist). In the rear is what Honda calls the
``magic seat,'' a three-passenger bench that folds and disappears
into the floor leaving a flat cargo area suitable for hauling
4(MUL)8 sheets of plywood inside the van. Folding eliminates the
need for removal to convert to cargo, a three-passenger seat is a
handful for two.
</P>
<P>
   When it's in use, there is a well behind the rear seat _ what it
folds into _ that increases cargo area available for luggage. So
where's the spare? Inside the van under the floor between the front
and second rows.
</P>
<P>
   Moving the seats requires no fussing with seatbelt anchors;
there are shoulder belts for seven and head rests for all. Storage?
The glove box isn't much but there are drawers, bins and plenty of
places to fit stuff. And enough cupholders for a convention.
</P>
<P>
   So, after a day of tooling around Toronto in each of the two
models, visiting the factory, and listening to the spiel, it is
finally time to venture forth for home in an Odyssey EX _ north on
Route 11A to Highway 401, the longest stretch of freeway in a
single political enclave stretching 510 miles from the shadow of
Detroit across Ontario to the Quebec border. It is excellent
roadway, divided, with a 100 kilometer (62 miles) per hour speed
limit. The Canadians make me feel right at home by totally ignoring
that despite frequent signs announcing horrendous fines.
</P>
<P>
   The routine is: Drive 100 miles, then stop and get out of the
car to walk around, eat, etc. In the middle of nowhere in
particular, with traffic highballing at around 80 _ that's miles _
I spot this guy in a suit on a bridge. Why does a man in a suit
hang around bridges in the boondocks? Answer: Speed trap. I
instinctively let off the gas approaching the bridge; a quarter
mile beyond are police cruisers and officers pulling people over.
</P>
<P>
   A good part of the way runs along the north shore of Lake
Ontario, close enough to see that inland fresh-water sea. At the
Quebec border, the good road gives way to the Canadian version of
Route 1 and the Big Dig _ and it is rush hour in Montreal. Creep,
crawl and discover that Quebecois in cars are a lot like Boston
area folk _ that is to say, nutballs at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching Sherbrooke, I miss the road best taken, find myself
in a strange city as night falls, somewhat uncertain of my route
... I violate the adult male driving handbook and enter an auto
parts store seeking navigational aid. They speak French here; I do
not. But they are friendly, helpful and a gentleman in a white coat
gives me precise directions through town to Route 212. From there
it is a plasant romp through little villages to the customs post at
Coburn Gore in northwest Maine, 498.2 miles from downtown Toronto.
The customs agent climbs in, pretends not to be looking around in
search of smuggled five-gallon toilets, checks my passport, asks my
business and bids me good night.
</P>
<P>
   From here it is south along Route 27 with lakes shimmering in
the moonlight on my right, tall spooky pines on my left; 52 miles
later I pull into Kingfield, Maine _ enough driving for one day, I
think.
</P>
<P>
   It is another 143 miles home, then 86 miles to the Globe, and
... the driving continues. For 850 miles checked, the van, EPA
rated 18 miles per gallon city, 26 highway, is delivering 22.47
m.p.g.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Odyssey is a lot of classy van, nice handling, quick
enough and easy on gas; Chrysler and Ford have real competition
here.
</P>
<P>
   I like this van _ I like it a lot. What took these guys so long
to do this?

NAVY'S BLUE ANGELS RELY ON `BETTY' AND STRICT TRAINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JACOB H. FRIES  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When you are flying upside down at 500 mph and a
problem comes up, it's nice to have a soothing presence nearby.
</P>
<P>
   For the Blue Angels pilots who are flying the Navy's F-18
Hornets over the San Francisco Bay this weekend, ``Betty'' _ or
rather her voice _ provides such a presence.
</P>
<P>
   Betty is a computer-generated female voice that soothingly
informs pilots of any major problems, such as low altitude or an
engine fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a grumpy old man talking, but no one liked
that,'' said Petty Officer 2nd Class Rick Boswell, a Blue Angels
crew chief. ``The designers felt that men would rather listen to a
woman tell them what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty is just part of the on-board computer system that runs the
Navy's premier jet, the first to fill both the fighter and attacker
roles equally well.
</P>
<P>
   The $18 million Hornet redefined what pilots are able to do in
the air and how they do it, Boswell said. Compared with past Blue
Angels planes _ the Hellcat in 1946 and, later, the Skyhawk _ there
really is no comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night and day,'' Boswell said. ``If you go back 30 or 40
years, people would have thought this plane wizardry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hornet reaches speeds of more than 1,200 mph and can roll
over in a second, Boswell said. Every part of the plane was
constructed to create more lift, enabling the plane to fly for
extended periods with its wings vertical to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco's Fleet Week shows this weekend, the aerobatic
planes will approach the sound barrier, about 700 mph at sea level,
but will not break it.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these planes so special is what they have inside,
said Master Chief Petty Officer Scott Carmean. In the past, a
pilot's controls relied on cables to activate hydraulics in the
wings and tail. Now, a computer runs interference between the pilot
and rudders, making adjustments almost simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   When a pilot wants to fly up and to the right, it is the
computer that decides which rudder adjustments would best do that,
said Capt. George Dom, lead pilot for the squad.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Betty, who shows up during serious in-flight
problems, a diagnostic computer tells mechanics what is wrong on
the ground and monitors how hard a landing is, Boswell said.
Mechanics then just have to refer to the manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually more like fixing a Volkswagen than you might
think,'' Boswell said. ``This plane was designed to be
maintenance-friendly. It's really quite self-sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Hornet, if mechanics replaced, say, a rudder, they
had to rely on trial and error to align it, Boswell said. Now, like
so many other components, the computer takes care of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny thing is that this is '70s technology,'' Boswell said.
``This plane, one of the best in the world, is actually slower than
a 286 computer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Angels have been flying Hornets since 1986 and will
continue using some version of the supersonic plane for at least 30
more years, Carmean said. The Navy uses a newer version of the
Hornet and is testing two others.
</P>
<P>
   But do not get the idea that these planes fly themselves, Dom
said. Technology changes, but demands on pilots do not.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots often bring their planes closer than 2 feet to one
another, Dom said, and that takes extraordinary eye-hand
coordination, as well as a great knowledge of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Also, all Blue Angels pilots must be physically fit, because
they are exposed to extreme G-forces with each twist and turn, Dom
said. The flights are so demanding that a G-suit, which prevents
blood from leaving the pilot's head, is not completely effective.
</P>
<P>
   `We fly six days a week and nothing we do becomes routine or
normal,'' Dom said. ``One single moment of inattention could be
disastrous. Flying like this is very unforgiving of complacency. We
respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The six Blue Angels pilots use a stationary reference point to
precisely coordinate their maneuvers, Carmean said. Commands given
by Dom are the only communication with pilots while they are in the
air, Carmean said. It takes weeks of flying together for the pilots
to become familiar with the rhythm of each syllable in Dom's
orders.
</P>
<P>
   But while in formation, all the planes have an escape plan,
Carmean said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something goes wrong, the pilots have to resist their
natural instinct, which would be to bank up and away,'' Carmean
said. ``Here, that's dangerous. They're so close that the pilot
would run the wing of his plane into the tail of the lead plane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Angels' last fatal crash was in 1985 during a
performance at Niagara Falls. The cause of the crash was not
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two pilots have died in the 52-year history of the Blue
Angels. No spectators have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to our safety is that we never forget what we're
doing,'' said Dom, who has been flying for 20 years. ``There's no
such thing as an average day at work. We don't fear it, though. You
couldn't fly like that. But still, we can't forget the
possibilities.''

   HOMELESS-IMAGE (Undated) _ Stuck in the streets of high rent
downtowns and depressed inner cities like abandoned wreckage at the
rim of the highway, today's homeless seem to be the least mobile of
Americans. Yet nothing could be further from the image of
homelessness that prevailed a hundred years ago, when footloose
armies of vagabonds created a network of rowdy ``hobohemias''
across the country, made the first protest march on Washington and
captured the public imagination as a rugged vanguard of radical
unionism. To scholars investigating this almost-forgotten history,
it suggests how much the very idea of homelessness _ and our
response to it _ is linked to the large economic and social changes
that underlie dislocations of the poor. By Nina Bernstein.

with substance abuse or gender identity, or firing off zippy

differences in the Middle East, something you can read about in
almost any newspaper any day of the year. Why bother to go the to
theater? Yet Londoners are flocking to see David Hare, where the
author of of such successful dramas as ``Skylight'' and ``Amy's

CHEAP-TRICK TV TEASERS RILE VIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notes and quotes, this and that:
</P>
<P>
   TV news folk call it ``teasing.'' E-mailer Annie Blanco labels
it ``pure laziness.'' I call it simply a clever tool of
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a grim-faced anchor delivering a nugget from the
usual bag of 10 o'clock tragedy: murders, drug busts, fires,
suicides, the vegetable oil that kills, you know the drill. This
instance: An anchor on Dallas-Fort Worth's NBC station, KXAS, pops
up between commercials to tell us about ``a missing boy in
Denton,'' and say we'll be provided with ``the latest at 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no. You stay tuned only to see that KXAS doesn't even lead
with the missing kid story. (They go with Troy Aikman instead.) The
missing boy? Turns out to be no story at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy came home,'' Annie writes. He'd been there since 7
that evening, in fact. KXAS airs footage of the ``reunion,''
telling us that, well, the kid was just next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the bottom line is ratings, but what about respect?''
writes Annie, who says she felt embarrassingly duped. ``All Channel
5 did was pat themselves on the back (in their report) for covering
their frivolous story earlier and prompting a neighbor to phone the
family saying the kid was over at her house. This is no more a
story than someone missing a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't so troubling, if we didn't rely so heavily on
local news for our information, it would be comical. According to a
media survey conducted by Dallas-based Audience Research &AMP;
Development, viewers tune in to local TV an average of 3.8 times
per week. Radio and newspapers tied for second at 3.2 times,
followed by network news programs at 3, cable at 2.2, TV
newsmagazines at 1.4, print news mags at 0.6, and the Internet,
0.6.
</P>
<P>
   TV news teasers are merely the way to keep us from flipping
channels, even if it means stretching the truth and playing on our
worst fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad but true, parents are constantly worried about their
children and often act quickly when they feel their child is
missing,'' Annie says. ``But this is just pure laziness. We deserve
more.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   $565,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it costs for a 30-second commercial on NBC's ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Caller Cathy Riner ``hates ``Martial Law.'' ``Just hate it. I
can't think of anyone who would want to watch that trash.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS can. Admittedly, the desperate network is going after more
males and a more ``urban'' audience this season. Which means more
shows like ``Martial Law,'' a campy drama with lots of kung-fu
fighting, and fewer like ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quinn'' simply didn't fit into CBS' long-term plans. In
ratings, ``Quinn'' matched ``Early Edition,'' which now occupies
its time slot. But ``Early Edition'' is set in Chicago and recently
added sex appeal (Kristy Swanson) to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   CBS makes it clear that older adults or female viewers are
passe. But give them time. TV programming decisions are based on
fear. Change comes with that fear. In January, CBS chief Les
Moonves told critics how happy the network was to ``embrace its
baby boomers.'' And if the other networks didn't want 49-year-olds,
``we'll happily take you.''

CHEAP-TRICK TV TEASERS RILE VIEWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notes and quotes, this and that:
</P>
<P>
   TV news folk call it ``teasing.'' E-mailer Annie Blanco labels
it ``pure laziness.'' I call it simply a clever tool of
manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with a grim-faced anchor delivering a nugget from the
usual bag of 10 o'clock tragedy: murders, drug busts, fires,
suicides, the vegetable oil that kills, you know the drill. This
instance: An anchor on Dallas-Fort Worth's NBC station, KXAS, pops
up between commercials to tell us about ``a missing boy in
Denton,'' and say we'll be provided with ``the latest at 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, no. You stay tuned only to see that KXAS doesn't even lead
with the missing kid story. (They go with Troy Aikman instead.) The
missing boy? Turns out to be no story at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy came home,'' Annie writes. He'd been there since 7
that evening, in fact. KXAS airs footage of the ``reunion,''
telling us that, well, the kid was just next door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the bottom line is ratings, but what about respect?''
writes Annie, who says she felt embarrassingly duped. ``All Channel
5 did was pat themselves on the back (in their report) for covering
their frivolous story earlier and prompting a neighbor to phone the
family saying the kid was over at her house. This is no more a
story than someone missing a cat.''
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't so troubling, if we didn't rely so heavily on
local news for our information, it would be comical. According to a
media survey conducted by Dallas-based Audience Research &AMP;
Development, viewers tune in to local TV an average of 3.8 times
per week. Radio and newspapers tied for second at 3.2 times,
followed by network news programs at 3, cable at 2.2, TV
newsmagazines at 1.4, print news mags at 0.6, and the Internet,
0.6.
</P>
<P>
   TV news teasers are merely the way to keep us from flipping
channels, even if it means stretching the truth and playing on our
worst fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad but true, parents are constantly worried about their
children and often act quickly when they feel their child is
missing,'' Annie says. ``But this is just pure laziness. We deserve
more.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   $565,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it costs for a 30-second commercial on NBC's ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Caller Cathy Riner ``hates ``Martial Law.'' ``Just hate it. I
can't think of anyone who would want to watch that trash.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS can. Admittedly, the desperate network is going after more
males and a more ``urban'' audience this season. Which means more
shows like ``Martial Law,'' a campy drama with lots of kung-fu
fighting, and fewer like ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quinn'' simply didn't fit into CBS' long-term plans. In
ratings, ``Quinn'' matched ``Early Edition,'' which now occupies
its time slot. But ``Early Edition'' is set in Chicago and recently
added sex appeal (Kristy Swanson) to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   CBS makes it clear that older adults or female viewers are
passe. But give them time. TV programming decisions are based on
fear. Change comes with that fear. In January, CBS chief Les
Moonves told critics how happy the network was to ``embrace its
baby boomers.'' And if the other networks didn't want 49-year-olds,
``we'll happily take you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves six months later: ``We need to get younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Get your Jane Seymour fix from ``Quinn'' reruns at 8 p.m. CDT
weekdays on Pax TV/Channel 68.

SPARKED BY NEW AUTO PLANT, MEXICO FARM TOWN LEADS BOOM IN
GUANAJUATO STATE 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILAO, Mexico _ With scores of new factories planned in the next
few years, this once-quiet farm town prepares to rocket into the
global industrial future.
</P>
<P>
   New sheet-metal buildings that will hold some of those
manufacturing plants sprout amid the corn and bean fields on the
southeast edge of town. Construction crews pave roads, lay sewer
and water lines and build houses for middle-class managers. Several
business hotels are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost our tranquility, perhaps,'' says Nicolas
Villagomez, a burly 36-year-old builder who has been Silao's public
works director since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we see a great future here,'' he says as he pores over
diagrams of a city arising.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its location deep within Mexico, 600 miles from the
Texas border, Silao has joined the mostly northern Mexican
communities being pulled to prosperity by the North American Free
Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which within another decade will tightly
bind the economies of Mexico, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Five years into the onset of the trade pact, few regions of
Mexico have been transformed as quickly as Silao and the
surrounding industrial corridor in the central state of Guanajuato.
Blessed with good highways, rail lines and a new international
airport, the region's prospects contrast with those of impoverished
states of Mexico's South.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next four years, Villagomez says, the population of
this run-down farm city will double to about 300,000. Some 150 new
factories will set up shop to serve the General Motors plant here
and a Nissan assembly plant in the nearby city of Aguascalientes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect there to be a new Silao existing right next to the
old one,'' says Villagomez as he outlines the planned route of a
beltway around the city.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people already work at the GM plant, which
exports about 80 percent of the light trucks and sport utility
vehicles it produces to the United States. Another 8,000 jobs will
be created in the new factories expected to open, Villagomez says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never was much opportunity in Silao before,'' says
Alfredo Gomez, 24, as he trudges home from his $10-a-day shift at
the GM plant. ``Now there are a lot of jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Silao itself only recently began to industrialize, the
community anchors a burgeoning 75-mile industrial corridor that
cuts across the flat plains of Guanajuato. The shoe manufacturing
center of Leon holds the northwest corner, with the
textile-producing city of Irapuato at the center, and the
agricultural-industrial hub of Celaya in the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by many measures, Guanajuato (Gwahn-nah-HWAHT-o) remains
as backward as anywhere in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The state's average education levels rank below the national
average of six years and more than half of its adult population
never finished primary school, according to the Mexican
government's census bureau. Per capita income of $2,600 in 1996,
the latest year for which statistics are available, stood at just
70 percent of Mexico's national average, about equal to that of
Guerrero state in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Guanajuato has long been a major source of illegal immigration
to the United States, with as much as 10 percent of its work force
living north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   To the state's advantage, more than half of Mexico's 95 million
people live within 250 miles of its major cities, giving its
industries access to domestic consumers. Irrigation on huge
stretches of flat land make agriculture more productive than in
more mountainous states in the South and the deserts farther north.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials have decided that the global economy holds
Guanajuato's future and are scrambling to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Vicente Fox, who hopes to run for president of Mexico on
the center-right National Action Party ticket in 2000, has made the
global economy a key theme of his 4-year-old administration. Fox
has led business delegations to the United States, Europe and Asia
seven times so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to take good advantage of NAFTA,'' says Arturo
Sanchez Castellanos, 32, an accountant and business leader from a
politically powerful family who heads the Leon chapter of Coparmex,
Mexico's premier business council. ``There are many companies that
had never exported before and now are.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the case in Leon, which has been Mexico's footwear
capital for more than 60 years, producing half the country's 200
million pairs of shoes annually.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the shoes made in Leon are sold in Mexico. But exports,
primarily to the United States, have increased from 5 million pairs
a year before NAFTA took effect in 1994 to an estimated 30 million
pairs this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade agreement has brought a lot of opportunities but we
haven't yet taken full advantage of it,'' says David Gonzalez, the
president of the footwear manufacturers association, whose own
company makes and sells women's dress shoes. ``We could be
exporting twice as much as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) I think there is a dawning realization among businesses
that they should look for markets elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As Guanajuato pushes into foreign markets, analysts and local
business owners say, the state relies on a tradition of
self-reliance and resourcefulness often lacking in other parts of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For example, almost all of Leon's shoe manufacturers, which sell
under their own names or produce for international brands such as
Rockport and Dexter, are small family businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here say that there is an entrepreneur inside every
worker,'' says Sanchez, the Leon business council president.
</P>
<P>
   Before General Motors came to Silao, the town was a shabby
market center serving the surrounding farm communities. Now, with
two shifts working in its off-yellow plant sprawled on a grassy
rise a few miles east of town, the community has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   A constant stream of cars washes through Silao's main street; GM
workers walking to and from the plant jam its sidewalks. New
factory buildings and residential neighborhoods are going up
everywhere on the edges of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silao Now'' gushes a billboard in English on the lawn of the
new Century 21 real estate office on the highway outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   Still working off production bottlenecks caused by last summer's
strike in the United States _ &UR; t &LR; he unionized U.S. workers were
protesting the loss of jobs to places like Silao _ the GM plant is
surrounded by thousands of trucks, both lined in neat rows and
parked haphazardly in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of large automobile transport trucks queue along the road
running past the plant, waiting for loads to carry to the border.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the industrial boom brought by GM has been a limited
financial blessing for Silao. Boosts to town coffers have been
offset so far by the tax breaks and other incentives given to the
new factories.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the factory workers commute from Irapuato, Leon and
other nearby cities because Silao's poorly educated and unskilled
workers have been unwilling or unable to fill the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here aren't used to this kind of work,'' Gomez, the GM
worker, says. He notes that working on the truck line is cleaner
but also more monotonous than his old job in a Leon shoe factory.
``It takes some getting used to.'' &QL;

   CLINTON-CAMPAIGN (Washington) _ President Clinton is sitting out
much of the most important election of his life, largely foregoing
the barnstorming that presidents usually undertake in midterm
elections. With the threat of impeachment hanging over his head, he
plans stops in only seven or eight states in this campaign. By
STEWART M. POWELL.

   INDIAN-GAMING (Temecula, Calif.) _ It's expected to be the most
expensive ballot proposition in California history. At stake is the
future of Indian casino gaming, which operates illegally in a state
where Las Vegas has traditionally drawn 35 percent of its business.
Nevada gaming interests will spend millions to try to defeat the
proposition, but ironically, the once impoverished Indian tribes
will probably spend the most to defend it. By KIM COBB. (Already

Texas A&AMP;M University campus almost buzzes with chaos and excitement
as more than 43,000 Aggies fly to classes and meetings, pursuing

   MEXICO-POLICIES (Tierra Colorada, Mexico) _ The billion-dollar
highway here was praised when it opened in 1993 as an engineering
and cultural marvel. But its $80 tolls proved too steep for most
and its lack of exits excluded the local farmers and business
people. Now, bankrupt, the toll road embodies all that is wrong
with Mexico's economic policies. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-GROWTH (Silao, Mexico) _ With scores of new factories
going up here to supply a GM truck plant, Silao, a northern Mexico
city of 100,000, is undergoing a rapid transformation due to the
global economy. ``We've lost our tranquility, perhaps,'' says the
public works director. ``But we see a great future here.'' By

   SHELL-TECH (Undated) _ Shell is waking up and realizing it had
been giving away some of the most valuable technology in the world.
The challenge for the huge company, however, has and will continue
to be that it thinks like a bureaucracy. And while it has done a
great job at developing technology, it has been lousy at making
money with it. By HILLARY DURGIN.

   EDs: The following stories on the growing political power of
Hispanics were sent Wednesday for release starting Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   For Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-CLOUT (Washington) _ Republicans and Democrats are
making an unprecedented effort to win Hispanic support, not only
for next month's election but for 2000 and beyond. Strategists for
both parties are amazed at Hispanics' zooming population growth and
believe that Latino voters are willing to switch party allegiance,
depending on candidates and issues. By STEWART M. POWELL.
</P>
<P>
   With graphics on the Wieck database slugged HISP-LOGO,
HISP-GROWTH, HISP-REGISTERED, HISP-VOTERS and
HISP-PRESIDENTIAL-ELECTIONS.
</P>
<P>
   With HISP photos available on Wieck.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-HISTORY (Washington) _ 1stLd-Writethru _ For Hispanics,
the long march to political power began shortly after World War II.
We trace the effort, looking at such leaders as Cesar Chavez, who
won national attention with his efforts to organize migrant farm
workers in California, and Dr. Hector Garcia, who stirred outrage
across the country at the refusal of a Texas town to bury an Army
private killed in World War II in the local cemetery because he was
Mexican American. By MARK HELM.
</P>
<P>
   With HISP photo of the Arlington National Cemetery grave of the
Hispanic soldier available on Wieck.
</P>
<P>
   For Monday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-GOVERNORS (Del Rio, Texas) _ Texas Gov. George Bush
gets a warm welcome in Hispanic communities. Some Latinos say he is
more sympathetic to their concerns than other Republicans,
especially Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who has taken harsh
stances on immigration and affirmative action. The men's
differences illustrate the mixed messages the party sends to
Hispanics. By LAURA TOLLEY. With HISP-LOGO graphic.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-TEXAS (San Antonio) _ A look at the rising power of
Hispanics in various cities including San Antonio and Corpus
Christi, where Hispanics have city council majorities, and El Paso
and McAllen, which have Hispanic mayors. We also look at the
campaigns of Mexican Americans running for statewide offices. By
LAURA TOLLEY.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic on the Wieck database slugged HISP-TEXAS.
</P>
<P>
   For Tuesday, Oct. 13:
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-CONTESTS (Washington) _ From the streets of Salt Lake
City to the lake lands of Minnesota, Hispanic candidates are
running for office in state and congressional races that would have
seemed almost impossible for them to enter only a few years ago.
The development comes at a time when more Hispanics are running for
national and statewide posts generally. By MARK HELM and STEWART M.
POWELL.
</P>
<P>
   With HISP-LOGO graphic.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-DIFFERENCES (Washington) _ Republican and Democratic
politicians are learning that they cannot regard Hispanics as a
monolith. We look at the cross-currents between certain groups and
within the groups themselves. Republicans believe they have a
chance to take many Hispanic votes away from the Democrats. By MARK
HELM.

HACKERS HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: You really blew it with that reader hearing
door noises, Bombay! Hackers have a program called Back Orifice
that lets them control anybody's computer, including making weird
noises.
</P>
<P>
   _ Know It All
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ALL: Dial the paranoia down a notch, OK? Back Orifice is a
remote administration tool released by the self-aggrandizing hacker
group Cult of the Dead Cow. For BO to work, you have to install a
host program on the computer under ``attack.'' True, hackers can
disguise the host or tack it onto a real program, but anybody
stupid enough to run unknown software from an untrusted source
pretty much deserves what they get.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the host is installed, the hacker still has to find
where, precisely, the computer is attached to the Internet, and a
bunch of other stuff has to be in sync before anything can happen.
Do you really think a true hacker is going to waste time just
playing a stupid sound file after all that?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I had to laugh when I read the letter from
Haunted II. I thought anybody with half a peanut for a brain knew
that America Online plays sounds when anybody on your Buddy List
signs on or off. A creaky door opens when they sign on, then slams
when they sign off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hearing Things
</P>
<P>
   DEAR THINGS: That certainly makes more sense than a rampaging
band of wild-eyed hackers terrorizing complete strangers. I'd
really like to thank the hundreds of AOLers who wrote in to point
out what a pinhead I am for not knowing the answer immediately. You
folks can now go back to hanging around chat rooms posing as
teen-age nymphomaniacs.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Following your description of how to launch the
Excel 97 ``flight simulator,'' I am unable to achieve the results
described in your article. Will you please send me the routine to
follow in case there was a misprint in my paper?
</P>
<P>
   _ No Luck Yet
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NO: Don't start blaming copy editors. Sure, their jobs seem
duller than anyone could possibly describe, but I don't think even
they would stoop to snipping out random bits of information or
arbitrarily changing the odd word here or there solely for their
own amusement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these tricks are for specific versions of software.
Maybe you don't have the right one, or you got a step wrong. It
happens. Don't make yourself crazy if they don't work. Go on to the
next one. Speaking of which ...
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: A tip o' the sombrero to Dorothy for this
Word 97 time-waster.
</P>
<P>
   Open a new document, type in ``Blue'' (without the quotes) and
highlight it. Click on the Format menu, then Font. Choose bold for
the font style and blue for the color, then click OK. Put a space
after the word, then click on the Help menu and pick About
Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   In the splash screen that appears, there's a vertical graphic on
the left. Hold down Control and Shift while you left-click on it.
Yes, that really is a pinball game next to the scrolling list of
Word developers. Use Z and M to control the flippers.
</P>
<P>
   I hear that Word 95 contains the same surprise, minus the
pinball. Aren't you glad you spent all that money to upgrade?

   BACHRACH-MUSIC (New York) _ A year ago, when Burt Bacharach
played that Long Island institution _ an in-the-round theater that
looked as if it hadn't been redecorated since ``Don't Make Me
Over'' was a hit _ the composer was joined by his longtime muse and
psychic friend, Dionne Warwick. Though at the time Bacharach's
comeback was already under way, there were only a handful of people
in the place who couldn't qualify for a senior's discount at any
multiplex. But on Oct. 3 at the new Virgin Megastore on Union
Square, the 70-year-old composer had a new partner, the former punk
Elvis Costello, 44, and a younger audience. Together, this twosome
has written a new CD, called ``Painted From Memory.'' By Frank
DeCaro.

   SCI-SHUTTLE-GLENN (Cape Canaveral, Fla.) _ Space shuttle
Discovery's engines shut down seconds before liftoff Thursday,
prompting 77-year-old space pioneer John Glenn to scramble out of
the cockpit and run for his life _ knowing all the while that it
was just a drill. Glenn, who made history Feb. 20, 1962 as the
first American to orbit Earth, was aboard the shuttle with six
crewmates at least 31 years his junior for a full dress rehearsal
of the scheduled Oct. 29 liftoff that will mark his return to
space. There was no fuel in the shuttle's rocket engines. (700

   HOMELESS-IMAGE (Undated) _ Stuck in the streets of high rent
downtowns and depressed inner cities like abandoned wreckage at the
rim of the highway, today's homeless seem to be the least mobile of
Americans. Yet nothing could be further from the image of
homelessness that prevailed a hundred years ago, when footloose
armies of vagabonds created a network of rowdy ``hobohemias''
across the country, made the first protest march on Washington and
captured the public imagination as a rugged vanguard of radical
unionism. To scholars investigating this almost-forgotten history,
it suggests how much the very idea of homelessness _ and our
response to it _ is linked to the large economic and social changes
that underlie dislocations of the poor. By Nina Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYWRIGHT-SHOW (London) _ Why is that man on the stage? He's
not even an actor, for heaven's sake, only a playwright, and
everyone knows how exciting they are these days. And it's not as if
he's talking about anything really juicy, like personal problems
with substance abuse or gender identity, or firing off zippy
one-liners. His subject, if you please, is the irreconcilable
differences in the Middle East, something you can read about in
almost any newspaper any day of the year. Why bother to go the to
theater? Yet Londoners are flocking to see David Hare, where the
author of of such successful dramas as ``Skylight'' and ``Amy's
View'' is performing his one-man show, the Royal Court Theater
production of ``Via Dolorosa.'' What's more, his audiences clearly
aren't bored. By Ben Brantley.

POWELL FAVORS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, SAYS CLINTON SHOULD NOT RESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With his hands formed in a cat's cradle, giving direct
and lucid answers to questions, retired Gen. Colin Powell comes
across as the kind of guy with whom you'd want to share a foxhole
or as a White House office mate in the politely savage political
battleground of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is a man at ease, whether meeting with school kids in
Seattle or soliciting support for volunteerism from corporate
pooh-bahs.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he was the perfect
cool counterpart to hot-tempered, headstrong Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf in directing the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Powell is at ease with himself. Perhaps that is why
he has no compulsion to become a full-time candidate for president
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't choose that course and I don't choose that course,''
Powell said during an interview Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party's most famous recruit _ and the party's
most outspoken moderate _ was about to inaugurate the 1998-99
season of the Seattle Celebrity Forum. He was also talking
excitedly about the achieving youngsters he met earlier in the day
when he saluted Seafirst Bank's Youth Job Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``One kid said something that struck me: `What we try to do is
not just get the super-volunteers, but all kids involved, so what
we are doing becomes important to each of them,''' Powell
recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Powell is a believer in bootstraps. But while he is, for many, a
symbol of the American dream _ the first African American to chair
the Joint Chiefs, a college ROTC man rather than an academy
graduate _ Powell has refused to put a soft, gauzy focus on his
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will he tailor the cloth of his conscience to conform with
the increasingly conservative fashions of his political party.
</P>
<P>
   He is a believer in affirmative action. In his best-selling
autobiography ``An American Journey,'' Powell freely acknowledged
that race played a role as he was tapped for coveted assignments,
but that in each case he was up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The experience has turned Powell him into a passionate critic of
measures _ such as Initiative 200 on Washington's November ballot _
that would ban any preferences based on gender or race.
</P>
<P>
   Powell called the measure ``diabolical'' and challenged its
intellectual underpinnings, saying: ``Nothing in affirmative action
says to admit people who can't do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   In language reflective of his three decades in the military,
Powell said he believes the United States has made tangible,
step-by-step progress toward the objective of what he calls ``a
second emancipation'' _ when minorities and women will participate
fully, not only in American citizenship but in the economic
opportunities of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (progress) didn't happen by market forces, it didn't come
about from a spontaneous change of attitude, it happened because
people took risks _ yes _ and put their lives on the line to break
down barriers in our society,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell thinks that, if anything, it is time to accelerate
movement toward a more inclusive American economy because of
changes in the complexion of American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are becoming a more diverse people,'' he argued. ``We have
to speed up the process of finding qualified people, giving them
training and putting them into the workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1995, the great America publicity and promotion
machine put Powell under the spotlight. He was urged to run for
president by people ranging from historian Stephen Ambrose _
biographer of Dwight Eisenhower as well as Lewis and Clark _ to
Mississippi's good-old-boy Democratic Rep. Gene Taylor. The
``Conventional Wisdom'' column in Newsweek put a seemingly
permanent upward arrow beside Powell's name.
</P>
<P>
   The attention served Powell's economic interests. ``An American
Journey'' became an instant best seller.
</P>
<P>
   But the glare seemed to re-enforce the desire of Powell's wife,
Alma, for privacy and _ after years of moving from one base posting
to another _ a house she didn't have to share with the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   The political right also reared its head. Just before Powell
decided not to run, leaders of the Christian conservative movement
as well as fund-raisers from the Republican right held a press
conference, declaring they would do everything in their power to
block him.
</P>
<P>
   Their reasons: Powell's moderate pro-choice stand on abortion,
and his support for government programs designed to enhance equal
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Powell is still visibly irritated at the
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to escape the ideological pinnings of both
right and left,'' he said. ``If you are an economic conservative,
as I am, rather than a social conservative, having your candidacy
validated by the powers that be is more and more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, a moderate Dwight Eisenhower was pushed to the GOP
presidential nomination over furious opposition from
isolationist-minded Republican conservatives. The argument that
Eisenhower could win the election was barely enough to win the
tolerance of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be far more difficult to do that now than in
Eisenhower's days, particularly in the Republican Party,'' Powell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell worries that the base of the Republican Party has moved
so far right that even the most superbly qualified moderate _ he
lists New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and former
Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld _ would find it prohibitively
difficult to get the party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The hostility of the hard right is hard to comprehend, because
``An American Journey'' revealed Powell to be in many ways a very
conservative man.
</P>
<P>
   He is a devout, traditional Episcopalian who recoiled at the
``genderless and ordinary'' God that liturgical reformers are
foisting on the faith. He is a man of order and purpose who was put
off by the college bull-session atmosphere of the White House early
in Bill Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed feelings are apparent when Powell is asked about Clinton.
He obviously admires the president's brains and determination, but
not his personal conduct and the Monica Lewinsky mess.
</P>
<P>
   Among retired military officers, Powell said _ indicating it is
a view he shares _ ``there is unease and disappointment that the
person at the top of the military structure would find himself in
this position, and lying about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We live by a different code,'' Powell added, referring to the
Uniform Code of Military Justice. He gracefully sidestepped a
question about what would have happened to Clinton had his affair
with Lewinsky been subject to that code.
</P>
<P>
   Powell sees no way out of a prolonged impeachment process.
Having survived previous firestorms, Clinton will not leave office
voluntarily, the general believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't going to, nor do I think he should,'' Powell added.
``I am not going to comment on the psychology of Bill Clinton, but
he is a man who believes in what he is doing and is extraordinarily
strong-willed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which means we are in for a long ride. Now that the process
has begun, the country is simply going to have to ride it out.''

   TIERRA COLORADA, Mexico _ What his government calls progress has
all but ruined Eligio Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Santiago and other business owners in Tierra Colorada, a market
town that once thrived on a steady stream of tourists and truckers
winding down a two-lane road toward the resort city of Acapulco,
were whipsawed five years ago by the opening of a toll highway that
Mexican officials said was a path to the future.
</P>
<P>
   The billion-dollar road, the ``Autopista del Sol,'' or Highway
of the Sun, now whisks motorists to their beach holidays right past
Tierra Colorada. Although the town, a 40-minute drive north of the
Pacific coast resort city in Guerrero state, possesses one of the
toll road's scarce exits, few stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no traffic here, no nothing,'' says Santiago, whose
30-table restaurant less than two miles from the exit often goes
days without a customer. ``We are sometimes here until two or three
o'clock in the morning, hoping for a customer so we have enough
money to eat on the next day. That's the sad truth of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Built mostly with private money, the 250-mile ``autopista'' was
praised when it opened in 1993 as an engineering and cultural
marvel. The road, officials crowed, marked a new free-enterprise
vision for Mexico's economy and signaled the country's sure-footed
climb to the global winners' circle.
</P>
<P>
   But the road's tolls _ at first about $80 each way for cars, up
to $225 for trucks _ proved too steep for all but the most
affluent. A lack of exits excluded local drivers. Except for Mexico
City's weekend rush to and from the beach, there has never been
much traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, bankrupt and under government management, the toll road
embodies all that is wrong with Mexico's economic policies, critics
say, and all that those programs have wreaked upon the country's
impoverished and violent South.
</P>
<P>
   In a region stymied by a lack of public investment, one of
Mexico's best and most costly highways stands idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did the `autopista' wrong,'' Santiago says with the
resigned shrug that is the reflex of southern Mexico's poor. ``We
have had no improvement because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five years after the onset of the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which will merge the economies of this country
with those of the United States and Canada over the next decade,
Mexico has become an ever more fractured and fractious land.
</P>
<P>
   As trade pulls production and power toward the U.S. border, this
nation of 95 million people finds itself ever more divided between
promise and penury, between North and South.
</P>
<P>
   Many in northern Mexico, long contemptuous of the economic and
political clout surrounding Mexico City, have added the South to
their list of resentments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North works, the Center thinks and the South rests,'' said
Felipe Gonzalez Gonzalez of the conservative National Action Party
after winning the governorship of north-central Aguascalientes
state in August.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone in southern Mexico is poor, nor is
everyone in the North rich. Oceans of poverty and pools of almost
unimaginable wealth plague the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the breach between the developing North and the moribund
South offers a stark reflection of the widening disparities in a
society that has been transformed by 15 years of free-market
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Those differences already are dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Nuevo Leon state, which borders Texas and includes the
industrial city of Monterrey, posted per capita income of about
$6,000 in 1993, the latest year for which figures are available.
That was almost twice the national average of $3,600, according to
researchers at Banamex, Mexico's largest private bank.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, per capita earnings that same year in the three
states that generally define the South were much lower: about
$1,700 in Chiapas, $1,800 in Oaxaca and $2,100 in Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   In Monterrey, where 1993 per capita income stood at $7,000,
about 15 percent of the workers earned more than $13 a day,
Banamex's cutoff between the working class and middle class. In
Acapulco, just 5 percent of employees earned or exceeded that
level.
</P>
<P>
   The changes now sweeping Mexico because of the trade agreement,
known as NAFTA, and other economic policies promise to widen the
divide, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many northern and central states will become more prosperous as
international trade and investment bring new and better jobs, these
experts say. The South, heavily weighted with Indians and peasant
farmers widely seen as anachronisms, will fall behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does NAFTA offer one of these peasants who lives where
there are no roads, no development?'' asks Alberto Diaz, an expert
on Mexico's regional economies. ``It offers them nothing. NAFTA is
going to create more regional differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Mexico's dependence upon trade and foreign investment
comes at a time of extreme uncertainty in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans have yet to recover from the December 1994 peso
devaluation, which set off the country's worst recession in memory.
Despite the risks, international trade remains the best hope for
the North, many say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things only now are getting better and we have another crisis
approaching,'' says Jose Luis Cabrera, the city treasurer of Silao,
a farm town in central Guanajuato state that is quickly
industrializing for the export market.
</P>
<P>
   ``But agriculture is being wiped out,'' Cabrera says. ``We had
to find some other way to live.''
</P>
<P>
   In the South, where as many as half the people live on the land,
the trade-based prosperity promised by a succession of Mexican
presidents for the past 15 years remains a mirage.
</P>
<P>
   Imports from the United States have ravaged grain prices, and
the land no longer supports the millions of families who live on
it. Jobs are scare, and most of them pay less than $5 a day.
Hundreds of thousands of villagers continue to leave for Mexico's
cities or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Guerrero needs is work,'' says 21-year-old Ruben
Terrazas, who recently returned from a five-year stint laboring
illegally in the United States, He used his savings to open two
small pharmacies in villages along the toll road.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are jobs, but not enough for everyone. And they pay
miserably. That's why people leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite southern Mexico's immense natural resources _ Chiapas
alone provides half the country's hydroelectric power and a large
percentage of its natural gas _ federal economic policies that
favor the more populated and politically powerful North keep the
South at a disadvantage, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it possible that Chiapas is one of the principal grain
producers (of Mexico) and has the highest levels of malnutrition?''
asks Enoch Araujo, the outgoing mayor of Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas'
capital. ``More than 50 percent of the electricity from
hydroelectric plants is produced in Chiapas and we are the most
backward state in terms of electrification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of families lack drinking water, (yet they) live in
a state with important quantities of the liquid.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, armed rebellion in the rural South has rocked
Mexico since the January 1994 uprising of Maya farmers in Chiapas.

 &HT;    NETANYAHU NAMES CONTROVERSIAL HARDLINER SHARON AS FOREIGN
MINISTER
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 400 words.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As he prepares for high-level summit talks next
week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Friday appointed
Ariel Sharon, warrior, hard-liner and frequent Netanyahu critic, to
be the country's new foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old former general is known as a brilliant military
tactician but is reviled by many Israelis and Palestinians alike,
for his actions in 1982 that led to the massacre of 700
Palestinians by pro-Israel Lebanese troops.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment to the third highest post in the Israeli
government, behind prime minister and defense minister, is the
culmination of Sharon's long effort to rehabilitate his standing
since Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu may see Sharon as insulation from right-wing members
of his administration, who have repeatedly threatened to topple his
government if he goes along with an American-backed plan to give 13
percent more of the occupied West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, currently in Netanyahu's cabinet as infrastructure
minister, has in the past been among those threatening to revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and Sharon are headed to Washington next Thursday
(Oct. 15) for summit talks with President Bill Clinton and
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. The meetings are meant to nail
down the 13 percent deal and get commitments by Palestinians to
crack down on anti-Israel terrorists within their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's appointment came a couple of days after visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke of a new cooperative
spirit between Netanyahu and Arafat. But, Israeli troops killed a
Palestinian man Thursday during riots in Hebron, and a Palestinian
man stabbed and killed a 19-year-old, unarmed Israeli female
soldier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The elevation of Sharon added a new element to the tense mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``His experience is wide ranging,'' Netanyahu spokesman David
Bar-Illan(CQ) said. ``He's been through the horrors of war and seen
the fruits of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians decried the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has shed more Palestinian blood than any other Israeli,''
chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said a deal could still be made in Washington, but
Sharon's appointment will make impossible to settle the more
important issues that remain in the Oslo peace process.
Palestinians want those final issues to leave them enough land to
form a nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Netanyahu has to choose between the right wing and peace,
and with the choice of Mr. Sharon he has chosen the right wing at
the expense of peace,'' Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story c an end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sharon has been on the front lines of many of Israel's most
heroic and shameful moments.
</P>
<P>
   He received accolades when commanding troops in the wars in 1967
and 1973. Also, he has the respect of Jordan's King Hussein, who
insisted on meeting only with Sharon when diffusing a crisis last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharon is most well known as the defense minister who
launched the unpopular 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's scope stretched far beyond what Sharon had
pledged to Israelis in the beginning -- presented as a quick sweep
to clear out PLO terrorists. The Lebanese count more than 17,000 of
their people killed in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon was forced to resign after an Israeli commission found
that he had approved the entrance of pro-Israel Lebanese militia
into two Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut, named Sabra and
Shatila.
</P>
<P>
   Over about two days, while Israeli soldiers viewed from lookout
positions, the militias massacred about 700 Palestinian civilians,
including children.
</P>
<P>
   Efraim Inbar, political scientist at Bar-Ilan(CQ) University,
said that despite his hawkish stands, Sharon is a ``pragmatist.''
He noted that although they were from opposing parties, former
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin used to secretly consult with Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a bulldozer. If he takes on a job, he can complete it.
He just really moves people,'' Inbar said.

 &HT;    DOWN AND OUT, RUSSIA PLAYS ITS DIPLOMATIC HAND AT THE KOSOVO
TABLE
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the debate over Kosovo, Russia already may have
scored a success simply by being in the diplomatic game.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Russia's vigorous diplomatic efforts will have
little bearing on the decision of the United States and its allies
over whether to punish Yugoslavia with air strikes to halt the
ethnic conflict in Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts in Moscow believe the Kremlin has achieved its
primary goal of re-establishing a measure of credibility on the
world stage at a time of deep economic and political distress at
home.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin said on Friday that Russia remained
firmly opposed to strikes against Serbian targets by the 16-nation
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Other Russian officials have implied that a new Cold War could
result from military action by the West, severing the post-Soviet
security partnership between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must defend a political, peaceful road of negotiations
without the use of military force,'' Yeltsin told reporters Friday
before meeting with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
   Russia objects to the violent methods Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has used against the separatist Kosovo province,
but says the conflict should be settled through talks.
</P>
<P>
   If the diplomatic tone sounds familiar, it is.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Russia has increasingly asserted its diplomatic
role to forestall U.S. strikes against Iraq over Saddam Hussein's
failure to yield to U.N. weapons inspections and other sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's economy a wreck and its military severely
weakened, the Kremlin has little real clout with its former Cold
War adversaries in NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Its limitations as a faded superpower were illustrated plainly
on Friday when the government in Moscow formally asked the European
Union for humanitarian food aid to get Russia through the long
winter ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Its stand against NATO comes amid growing anti-Western hostility
in Russia. Many poor Russians blame the country's economic problems
on Western-style reforms since the demise of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic bearing on Kosovo, however weak Russia's hand may
be, plays well at home, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our national and strategic interests do not lie in the
Balkans,'' said Lilia Shevtsova, an analyst with the Carnegie
Moscow Center, a think tank. ``This is a diplomacy motivated by the
feeling of lost vanity of a former superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev visited Belgrade on Sunday with Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov for talks with Milosevic. Sergeyev warned on Friday that
NATO strikes could lead to ``full-scale warfare. Yugoslavia is
fully resolved to fight to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a traditional ally of the Serbs -- both are Slavic
people, sharing a common Orthodox Christianity and a kinship of
communist rule before the breakup of the Soviet Union and the
Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Russia's threat to use its veto power in the
U.N. Security Council effectively precluded a vote there on
sanctioning military action against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But if Moscow's diplomatic efforts have encumbered the
deliberations over the use of military force, there are also signs
that Russia has played the role of dispassionate arbiter in trying
to convince its ally in Belgrade to back down.
</P>
<P>
   When the Russian officials visited Milosevic last Sunday to try
to convince him to make concessions, they reportedly were supplied
by NATO with some details the pain the U.S. and its allies are
prepared to inflict.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Russian politicians and analysts are increasingly
concerned over a perception that the United States is prepared to
act militarily without regard for the kind of international
consensus building that took place before the 1991 Gulf War against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, air strikes could cause more domestic political problems
for Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov as he struggles to deal with
the Russian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Yeltsin chairman of the Duma's defense committee, Roman
Popkovich, said Friday he would not rule out providing Russian
military aid to Serbia in the event of a war.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the lower house of parliament, the Duma, unanimously
passed a non-binding resolution calling on Russia to sever all
relations with NATO if it strikes the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Felgenhauer, defense and security editor for the newspaper
Sevodnya, predicts that NATO strikes could have a long-lasting
negative impact on Russia's relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia will be engulfed by a genuine wave of mass
anti-Western, anti-NATO hatred,'' he commented, fueled in part by
``a suppressed mass hysteria'' of frustration over the collapse of
the economy in mid-August.

CROWS: GIFTED BUT CRANKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The phrase ``stupid birds!'' may spring to mind when you first
hear those loud, scolding caws at sunup.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Crows, surprisingly classified as songbirds, are among the most
intelligent birds.
</P>
<P>
   And we are approaching the best time of year to appreciate them,
as they gather by the thousands in fall and winter nighttime
roosting areas across the state (the largest such area being high
on the Jordan's Furniture hill overlooking Route 9 in Framingham).
</P>
<P>
   The crow family is found in most of the world and its numbers
are on the rise. Yet crows remain poorly understood and little
studied.
</P>
<P>
   Still, anyone who has been reprimanded by an enraged
neighborhood crow for putting a lid on a trash can knows that they
have plenty of personality. And those who have had close encounters
with canny crows have remarkable stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Craighead George, the Newbery Medal-winning author of such
children's books as ``My Side of the Mountain'' and ``Julie of the
Wolves,'' has lived with crows as pets. (That is illegal now.)
</P>
<P>
   Take Crowbar, one of George's favorites. Her children found him
on the ground, a naked, orphaned nestling. He was soon a member of
the family, gobbling down scrambled eggs at the breakfast table and
dropping to the ground to walk the kids to the school bus stop. He
could mimic George's voice and shout ``Hello!'' from treetops. He
even figured out a way to join the kids on the slide, using a
coffee can lid like a surfboard.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Mertz, director of the New England Wildlife Center in
Hingham, Mass., treats about 60 crows a year _ mostly nestlings
tossed out of trees being trimmed or adult birds hit by cars. What
impresses Mertz is how determined these birds are to escape. ``You
can wrap up a red-tailed hawk with its face covered, and it will
just lie there,'' Mertz says. But a crow similarly bound ``will
take about 17 seconds before it's figured out how to get out of the
wrapper.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McGowan, curator of the ornithology and mammalogy
collections at Cornell University, has studied American crows
around Ithaca, N.Y., for a decade, tagging about 750 birds out of a
population of about 125,000. McGowan is skeptical about the way we
define intelligence in animals but nonetheless finds his study
species astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   In laboratory tests of ``reversing habit'' behaviors _ the
pellets suddenly stop coming from the green lever and will come
only from the red, for example _ crows score as high as monkeys in
figuring out the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Crows are omnivores and opportunists. They live in large
extended families in which, often, several generations of crow kids
help out around the nest of the breeding parents (a rare behavior
for birds and, come to think of it, for humans, too).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes offspring will leave for weeks or months or even a
year and be recognized and welcomed on their return. (Many of us
have been recognized upon returning to the nest but not necessarily
welcomed.) Unlike most other birds, a 7-year-old crow might still
be hanging around the nest. As with many intelligent species, crows
have a fairly long lifespan and a long time in childhood to learn.
The oldest wild crow known was 30 (a crow crone?); the average crow
usually lives to age 13.
</P>
<P>
   Like us, it appears crows began moving to the suburbs and cities
in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   They mate for life, or as scientists prefer to say, they form
``long-term pair bonds,'' with cases of crow divorce recently being
reported from a researcher in _ where else? _ California.
</P>
<P>
   Crows have a huge vocabulary and varied vocalizations. They seem
to enjoy play, and young crows have been observed chasing each
other with feathers.
</P>
<P>
   So, if crows are so much like us, why have we hated them? They
have been known to be agricultural pests (though their impact is
now believed minimal, while we are just discovering some of the
positive things they do for farmers, ecologically). They are loud.
On the ground, a crow has the menacing gait of _ as author Thomas
McNamee described another bird _ a ``bar bully.'' They scatter our
trash. They eat the nestlings of cuter birds. They appear dressed
for a funeral. And they have been known to feed on corpses.
</P>
<P>
   But as we are finally getting to know them, their image is
changing. What does researcher McGowan see when he looks at a crow?
``I see a big, beautiful, intelligent, and fascinating bird,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   We have mostly American crows around here, with a few of the
smaller fish crows. Ravens, about four times the size of crows, are
making a comeback, with some in Western Mass. and very few east of
Worcester. McGowan says crows and ravens are as different as lions
and leopards.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's amazing to see thousands of the black birds filling
the sky as they gather to roost evenings from October to February,
there is good crow viewing in your own back yard too.
</P>
<P>
   Crow families have territories, so your neighborhood crows
really are your crows. If you want to befriend these birds, you
can. Though they all look alike to us, crows can distinguish
individual humans, even out of context.
</P>
<P>
   McGowan says you can toss some peanuts to the ground when you
see the crows _ don't look directly at them or throw the nuts at
them. In time, the crows will know you and greet you.
</P>
<P>
   And then you may have stories such as the one Jean George tells
about Crowbar. The bird was stealing milk money from school kids
and hiding it. She happened to discover one day that he was
depositing the coins in the drainpipe of the building next door.
Which just happened to be a bank. Coincidence?

<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   Although the political violence in Chiapas has largely subsided,
the Zapatista rebels there continue to resist, calling for greater
rights for Mexico's indigenous farmers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a less publicized but far more violent
rebellion seethes in Guerrero, Oaxaca and adjoining states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic and social backwardness (in the South) lies at the
root of this problem,'' says Mauricio de Maria y Campos, a Mexican
official who recently completed a five-year stint in Geneva,
Switzerland, as the director-general of the United Nations agency
that promotes industrialization.
</P>
<P>
   De Maria y Campos and other economists cite studies that show
the economic gulf that narrowed in the 1960s and 1970s has expanded
since the early 1980s when the Mexican government began opening the
country to trade and international investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within Mexico we need to think more in terms of regional
development,'' he says. ``If not, we are going to have problems,
not only the social and economic ones, but with the whole
integration process (of the North American trade zone).''
</P>
<P>
   The clash between bureaucratic vision and the South's unrequited
needs is nowhere as jarring as along the ``Autopista del Sol.''
</P>
<P>
   A sleek black ribbon, the four-lane divided highway climbs the
high pass south of Mexico City, winds into the breathtaking valley
that holds the city of Cuernavaca, then rips into the jumbled
mountains of Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Rains have painted the normally parched brush a brilliant
emerald. Rivers pregnant with topsoil roil brown and angry through
gorges beneath the highway's suspension bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical downpours, frequent earthquakes, occasional rockslides
and stretches of shoddy construction require workers to patch the
roadway constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cars can, and do, zoom along at 80 mph or better, their
drivers unhindered by the heavy traffic, predatory patrolmen or
yawning potholes common to Mexico's public roads.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the ``autopista'' is a source of pride in a
country that 10 years ago had less than 600 miles of expressways.
Yet, with its few exits and prohibitive tolls, the road is of
little benefit to the impoverished communities that it skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't use it,'' says Mario Castillo, the top elected
official in Dos Arroyos, a cluster of tile-roofed adobe that
huddles along the side of the highway 25 miles north of Acapulco.
``We just watch the traffic go by.''
</P>
<P>
   From its beginnings, the highway was never meant to be more than
a means of carrying Mexican tourists to the beach hotels,
restaurants and discotheques of Acapulco. Foreign tourists have
been scared off, first by Acapulco's polluted bay and its crowded,
noisy streets and later by news of hurricanes and guerrillas.
Business leaders and government officials hoped to fill the void
with regular visitors from Mexico's capital and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acapulco basically is the beach resort of Mexico City,''
explains Amin Zarur, Guerrero's secretary of economic development
who served as mayor of Acapulco in the early 1980s. ``(It) needed a
faster and safer roadway.''
</P>
<P>
   It took seven hours of hot, hectic, hazardous driving to travel
the old two-lane highway from the Mexican capital. With the
``Autopista del Sol,'' people in Mexico City can set out after
breakfast and be swimming in the ocean by lunch.
</P>
<P>
   While Mexico's public and private planners focused on pumping
life into the resort, economic development schemes for the rest of
Guerrero stagnated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make choices,'' Zarur says. He recites a litany of
failed or postponed projects elsewhere across the state. Not enough
water, he says of a small industrial zone. No good roads, he says
about another area where farmers' produce rots on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Neighboring states are far ahead of Guerrero, he says. ``It's
difficult to compete with them,'' he explains. ``They are closer to
Mexico City and have better services.''
</P>
<P>
   Zarur acknowledges that access to the toll road could enhance
the economic fortunes of Guerrero's poor villages. But he says the
highway does not figure in the immediate future of the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a plan for economic development, they can build
exits,'' he says. ``It doesn't make any sense to do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even access doesn't count for much along the toll road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think I am just sitting here?'' asks Estelina
Morales Vela, the 60-ish owner of a once-bustling restaurant and
motel in Tierra Colorada. ``There is no one to buy anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the buses passed through here, all the cars,'' Morales
says as she gazes from her shady lobby out to the now-empty old
highway that cuts through town. ``There was a lot going on, a lot
of life. Now, it's dead. Just dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work to eat,'' she says. ``and I am just sitting
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales waves over a friend, Gloria Muiz, who is carrying a
stack of homemade pizzas draped with a clean cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Muiz owned a highway restaurant for 30 years in Tierra Colorada.
More than 25 people worked for her, she says, but it all ended with
the toll road. With her restaurant shuttered, Muniz makes ends meet
selling pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought of selling out,'' Muniz says with a weary smile
and a shrug. ``But no one is buying. We never thought that it was
all going to completely die. We were foolish''
</P>
<P>
   ``They killed us with the `autopista,' '' she says. ``They made
us into the living dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty miles closer to Acapulco, the toll road dominates Dos
Arroyos, running along a high embankment and across one of the
streams that gave the village its name.
</P>
<P>
   The growl of passenger buses and the whine of cars mix with the
braying of donkeys and snorting of pigs rooting through the
village's garbage. Women wash clothes in the river, laying them to
dry on the concrete skirt of the highway's bridge. Children splash
naked in the swift, shallow current.
</P>
<P>
   Denied use of the toll road, the many people in Dos Arroyos who
work in Acapulco have to take a bus to the resort along the old
highway, a two-hour journey that costs about $2 each way. Many of
those people earn only about $100 a month at their construction or
hotel jobs, so most of them live in Acapulco, returning home on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   And because the toll road cleaves Dos Arroyo's fields and
pastures, villagers are forced to make circuitous detours across
bridges or through tunnels to tend their corn or herd their
livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't pay attention to us,'' says Juan Zapata, who joins
a half-dozen other Dos Arroyos farmers on a shady porch for early
afternoon beers and complaints about the government. ``They always
treat peasants with disregard.''
</P>
<P>
   Such resentments have helped nurture the People's Revolutionary
Army, or EPR, which surged two years ago in the mountains near the
highway following the state police's massacre of 17 unarmed farmers
on the way to an anti-government protest.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the Mexican army killed 11 alleged guerrillas, many
of them also apparently unarmed, in a village not 50 miles from Dos
Arroyos. In August, suspected rebels ambushed a state police patrol
in another nearby village, killing two officers. And last month,
army troops hastily mobilized near Dos Arroyos itself after a
passing motorist reported seeing a dawn patrol of uniformed men,
presumably guerrillas, walking along the ``autopista.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the political violence, armed robberies have
multiplied, with bandits sometimes setting up roadblocks on the
toll road or attacking drivers who have stopped to rest.
</P>
<P>
   State police squads, armed with automatic rifles and riding in
the back of pickup trucks, have become a common sight along the
``autopista.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of thieves in this town,'' admits Eligio
Santiago, the restaurant owner in Tierra Colorada. ``It's for the
same reason. There is nothing else to do, no other way to make
money to eat on.''
</P>
<P>
   With the state mired in guerrilla violence, highway banditry and
feuds between marijuana- and heroin-producing families, attracting
investment money for anywhere outside of Acapulco is nearly
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Zarur, the state's economic development czar, says it's all
about cycles. And the cycles in Guerrero are particularly vicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as there is no development, there is no security,''
Zarur says, almost wistfully. ``As long as there is no security,
there is no development.''
</P>
<P>
   Government and business have bet Guerrero's future on Acapulco's
fortunes. From the look of things, the bet grows riskier all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The toll road splits just north of Acapulco into a branch
leading to the flashy development of ``Punta Diamante'' south of
the main bay and another that trudges into the maddening urban
quagmire known as ``Renacimiento,'' or Rebirth, on the backside of
the resort's coastal mountains.
</P>
<P>
   With few opportunities elsewhere, people from across Guerrero
keep pouring into Acapulco. They scrounge for work, build their own
houses in sprawling slums, hustle to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many who come from the countryside can't read or write. There
is little good work for them,'' says Rodolfo Benardis, the owner of
a small company that sells bottled water in Acapulco. ``(But) they
keep coming from the villages, because it's even worse there.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials say more than 1.25 million people, most of them
poor, now pack into the once-tranquil port. Local businessmen,
concerned about the city's threatened tropical-paradise image,
insist that the population is closer to 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   The road bogs down into the chaotic traffic of ``Renacimiento.''
A dearth of stoplights means bottlenecks, even in sparse traffic.
Pedestrians skitter among the speeding, swerving cars, buses and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The trip over the mountains to the beach from ``Renacimiento''
used to take at least a half-hour on these city streets. But a new
toll tunnel blasted through the rock saves, to those who can afford
it, the time and the bother of seeing how most of Acapulco lives.
</P>
<P>
   Acapulco exudes the sultry charm of an aging madame. Wealthy
enclaves on the south rim of the bay still offer the stunning
views, warm breezes and radiant sun that made the city popular. But
downtown is decaying. Teen-age prostitutes ply their trade on some
of the beaches and hang out in the plazas. Vendors clog the
sidewalks. Traffic noise drowns the sounds of the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is seasonal. And this isn't the season.
</P>
<P>
   Occasional groups of foreigners on package tours fly in from the
United States, Canada or South America. People still drive down
from Mexico City on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But business has melted with the hard rains. The beach hotels
and restaurants that anchor Acapulco's economy echo emptily. The
few tourists who meander from the beach are assaulted by hordes of
hawkers, taxi drivers and time-share salespeople scrambling for a
few pesos or dollars.
</P>
<P>
   With Christmas' tourist boom approaching, crews are busy
repairing the wide bay-front avenue where the better hotels are
located. They are still cleaning up the damage from last October's
murderous hurricane, Pauline.
</P>
<P>
   That storm turned the streets on the slopes above the hotel
strip into torrents, sluicing away houses, churches and businesses.
Hundreds died. But residents say little repair has been made in the
working-class neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never come to see how the neighborhoods above are
doing,'' says Crystal Armenta, who lives with her husband, children
and four other families in a small two-story house on the back
slope of the coastal mountains. ``They just take care of the
tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   But Armenta's family lives off the tourist trade. The incomes of
her taxi-driving husband and brothers-in-law drop sharply in the
off-season.
</P>
<P>
   With few manufacturing jobs or other sources of income, business
and government leaders insist, taking care of tourists is the only
way to ensure Acapulco's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts to spruce up the city and improve its image,
tourism has been dropping for years. Foreign visitors, preferred by
business owners because they spend more than Mexicans, now make up
just 20 percent of the tourism, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign tourism this past winter dropped by 7 percent, draining
$100 million from Acapulco's economy, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales, an indicator of economic health, have declined 27
percent in the past four years, twice the rate for Mexico overall,
according to Banamex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acapulco is very beautiful. We just don't know how to sell
it,'' says Cesar Bajos, the son of a prominent merchant family in
the resort who now heads the local chapter of Coparmex, a national
business council. ``But I'm an optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was born, all the streets here were dirt,'' the
42-year-old says. ``Now look at it. We are much better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bajos and other business leaders have teamed with local, state
and federal officials to produce Acapulco's first detailed
development plan.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal calls for adding and improving streets and sewers
and building industrial parks near where the toll road enters the
city. The projects would provide jobs for the thousands of
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a problem, the first step is recognizing it,''
Bajos says. ``We have a great future if we know how to plan it.
People may want to do a lot of things, but no one knows where to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the new plans prove effective remains an open question,
Bajos concedes. But rescuing the resort cannot be more urgent, he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Acapulco declines,'' Bajos says with a shrug, ``the whole
state declines.'' &QL;

PETER DE JAGER: THE PAUL REVERE FOR THE YEAR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct . 11)  
 (bl)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAMPTON, Ontario _ Peter de Jager enjoys kidding about his
unlikely emergence as the Paul Revere for the year-2000 computer
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very good on dates,'' de Jager says with a laugh,
explaining how he cannot recall when he bought his aging Ford
Explorer or how long he has lived in his modest split-level home in
this Toronto suburb. ``Antoinette,'' he calls to his wife. ``When
did we move here?''
</P>
<P>
   But it has been a long time, since de Jager, a former computer
programmer, has joked about how computers handle dates. His voice
was not the first to warn that the world was sitting on a computer
time bomb that could explode at the dawn of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But it was an essay he wrote five years ago titled ``Doomsday
2000'' for the trade magazine Computerworld that is widely regarded
as the information-age equivalent of the midnight ride of Paul
Revere, as the alarm that stirred the industry into taking the
year-2000 menace seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We and our computers were supposed to make life easier; this
was our promise,'' de Jager wrote. ``What we have delivered is a
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that many computers and software
programs recognize years by only their last two digits _ and, with
the shift of centuries, they may identify ``00'' as 1900 or not
recognize it at all. The resulting miscalculations and malfunctions
could disrupt banking, telephones and virtually any other service
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, de Jager has become something of a folk hero in his
crusade to publicize the problem. He figures that he averages more
than five interviews a day, and his goal this year was to cut back
his commitments so he could at least be home on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's lonely on the road,'' said de Jager, the father of two
teen-age sons. He said he could not shake his regret at missing the
funerals of his brother in 1996 and his father this year. ``I'm as
close to burnout as you can get without seeing charred edges,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are benefits, of course. De Jager, 43, earned a six-figure
income last year for the first time. Having bumped his standard
speaking fee to $7,000 from $4,000, he stands to do even better
this year.
</P>
<P>
   De Jager, who had moved up from his programming duties to jobs
in systems management and giving speeches on managing technology
before encountering year-2000 fame, acknowledges that his new
status also has its rewards. He has lectured the world's central
bankers in Basel, Switzerland, on the perils of inaction, rubbed
shoulders with powerful chief executives at the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and gained access to leading
politicians in Washington and other capitals. His name is on the
stock index of software companies that make much of their money
from year-2000 business, and his three-year-old Web site
(year2000.com) is a focal point of news and discussion about the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an adventure I'll be able to talk to my grandchildren
about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in an age when getting rich _ the faster the better _
seems to be the operating principle in most businesses, de Jager is
leading the modest life style of someone who expects celebrity to
be fleeting. His nondescript three-bedroom ranch home, chosen for
its proximity to the Toronto airport, sits deep in a crowded
subdivision. He bought a similar house across the street to use as
an office.
</P>
<P>
   The de Jagers recently bought a vacation getaway _ not a
beachfront mansion in Miami but rather a 77-acre farm that is a
45-minute drive from home.
</P>
<P>
   De Jager is no longer surprised by insinuations that he is
trying to cash in on his fame _ but he continues to be upset by
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't own a single share of any year-2000 stock,'' he said,
referring to software and consulting companies that deal with the
problem. ``In seven years of speaking, I've never mentioned a
vendor from the stage, and I could easily have made a million
dollars by endorsing something.''
</P>
<P>
   A large, bearded man who seems to draw energy from a podium, de
Jager made public speaking a full-time job in 1993 after
discovering a talent for boiling things down to simple metaphors
and pithy pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a contrarian by nature, and he's garrulous,'' said Dennis
Eskow, a journalist in 1989 when he first met de Jager, then the
head of information technology at a Canadian clothing company.
``With a slightly different sensibility, he could be a stand-up
comic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, de Jager has been annoying many former allies by
chastising audiences for moving ``straight from denial to
defeatism.'' He has been predicting that the year-2000 bug will
turn out to be disruptive but not necessarily disastrous.
Businesses and governments can avert an electronic Armageddon, he
preaches, if they will press ahead with efforts to upgrade
computers and figure out contingency plans. Sometimes you can get
by with ``steppingstones instead of a bridge,'' he has been saying.
</P>
<P>
   De Jager was born in South Africa, but his family moved among
that country, his mother's native Ireland and Canada before
settling in Canada in 1971. All that ``made me someone very
cognizant of change and what goes into problem-solving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how does de Jager plan to spend New Year's Eve 1999?
</P>
<P>
   He has received a stream of invitations to events large and
small that would either celebrate the industry's victory over the
year-2000 threat or wallow in its defeat. But he says he intends to
be sitting with his family at O'Connor's, a popular pub for Irish
musicians in Doolin, County Clare, where his mother lives, slaking
his thirst and playing the bodhran, a goatskin drum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not very musical, but I can keep time,'' he said.

A TRIBUTE TO THE GREATEST VOICE OF THE CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
ENRICO CARUSO: VOICE OF THE CENTURY 
On: A&AMP;E 
Director: Peter Rosen 
Time: Sunday at 8 p.m. 
Rated: TVG 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Enrico Caruso: The Voice of the Century' is an hour-long video
documentary about the first singer who became an international
celebrity because of the phonograph. There is no sound-film
material of Caruso, although there are more than a dozen hours of
recordings, thousands of photographs, newsreel material, home
movies, and a film of Caruso miming his celebrated performance of
``Vesti la giubba'' from ``Pagliacci.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of this material Peter Rosen has fashioned an entertaining
hour-long video biography that premieres tomorrow night at 8 on
A&AMP;E. Luciano Pavarotti _ not looking well _ Placido Domingo, and
Beverly Sills provide enthusiastic commentary, and solid
information comes from biographer Andrew Farkas and Rubbert Tuggle,
the archivist of the Metropolitan Opera. Two people are able to
contribute personal memories, one of them the tenor's son, Enrico
Caruso, Jr. The camera roams through the church where Caruso was
baptized, through the apartment of his parents, through the Caruso
museum, where his shoes are displayed.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary concentrates on some of the more lurid episodes
of Caruso's biography, his long romantic entanglement with two
soprano sisters, Ada and Rena Giachetti, his marriage to the
American Dorothy Park Benjamin, his arrest on a ``morals charge''
after a woman accused him of improper conduct in the Monkey House
in Central Park. There is a bit of cultural context connecting
Caruso to the Italian immigrant experience to tie in with
``Italians in America,'' the program that follows the premiere.
There are irresistible glimpses of Caruso at play as he mugs for
the camera. But only occasionally, and in the background, do we
hear ``the voice of the century,'' which is why we are still
interested in this man with the endearingly goofy grin; 75 years
after his death, Caruso's records still sell steadily, and his
singing still touches people because, as Pavarotti remarks, it
comes from the heart.

POWERFUL, LYRICAL, INTIMATE `LEAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
KING LEAR 
Produced by: Chestermead Production for BBC-TV and WGBH-TV. 
Directed by: Richard Eyre 
On: Masterpiece Theatre 
Date: Sunday, 9 p.m. 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The common assumption in adapting a play for movies or
television is that you either record it as is, putting the viewer
in the proverbial front row, or you open it up, treating the action
more like a movie than a play.
</P>
<P>
   Director Richard Eyre finds a third, extremely satisfying way of
adapting his Royal National Theatre production of ``King Lear,''
featuring Ian Holm, for the BBC and ``Masterpiece Theatre.'' Rather
than opening the production up, Eyre closes it in. Except for the
scenes in the storm, the action is bordered in a plain room and
corridor tinted red in the first act and green in the second.
</P>
<P>
   This might sound as visually inviting as ``The Nightly Business
Report,'' but don't be fooled. Eyre gives us just enough to keep
the production from getting visually boring through smart cutting
and tight editing. Meanwhile, the starkness of the visuals keeps
the focus on the intensity of the action and the beauty of the
poetry. Almost every line bounds off the screen with such clarity
that ``Lear'' seems no more distant linguistically or thematically
than the average ``NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that has a lot to do with the superlative acting as
well as Eyre's aesthetic choices. The underrated Laurence Olivier
version of a decade ago for Granada Television featured an actor at
the end of the line. This one features an actor at the top of his
game. Now in his 60s, Holm has suddenly emerged as one of the
finest English-speaking actors, but even his amazingly
multidimensional performance in ``The Sweet Hereafter'' didn't
prepare us for the accolades he received as the National's Lear
last year.
</P>
<P>
   They're deserved. In interviews Holm has downplayed his
portrayal, saying that he just went with the text. If so, he's a
better reader than most anyone else as he stalks the stage with a
ferocity more closely associated with Richard III and an energy
level more closely associated with men half his age. From drumming
on the desk to staring down people twice his size, Holm is every
inch a tornado. One might wonder how his ungrateful daughters would
ever have the nerve to stand up to such a person, but one is too
busy marveling to care.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, like Olivier, Holm isn't surrounded by shrinking
violets. Almost every performance is a gem, chief among them Finbar
Lynch's slashing Edmund, David Burke's heroic Kent, and Michael
Bryant's witty Fool. The cast takes full advantage of the freedom
of not needing to reach the back row with modulated performances
that go from whispers to shouts and from profound pity to
heaven-shaking rage. Holm doesn't literally strip Lear naked as he
did onstage, but there is such raw emotion in the performance that
he could be doing ``Lear'' in Russian and you'd know almost all you
have to know about the play.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, though, that Shakespeare's English has rarely
sounded so accessible. It's as if an old friend revealed secrets
that made his character seem fully coherent. Just as we never know
the whole truth about another person, we never know the whole truth
about a Shakespeare tragedy. But in this ``Lear'' the falls from
grace, the inabilities to look truth in the face and their tragic
consequences, the micro and macro family issues, the spirals of
evil, stand in splendid relief from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Eyre was after the same intimacy he reportedly achieved at the
National. He gets that and a lot more.

ECONOMIC VIEW: A PESSIMISM AS IRRATIONAL AS THAT OLD EXUBERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So what ever happened to the new economy?
</P>
<P>
   It was only months ago that economists had difficulty seeing any
credible threats to an expansion that began in 1991 and begat a
stock market that recognized no ceiling. So heady was the ride that
economists and fiscal policy-makers from Alan Greenspan down were
pondering whether the United States had entered a golden era _ one
in which business investments in technology were driving a
resurgence in productivity and gains in productivity were making
strong growth and low unemployment possible without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, inflation is still dormant, and the unemployment rate,
while inching up, is still near a quarter-century low. But growth
is suddenly looking fragile, so much so that economists began
talking seriously last week about whether a recession was in the
cards for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the outlook has changed abruptly for the worse,
there is undeniably still something new and uncharted in this
economy. After all, most periods of economic expansion end when the
Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates to squelch
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But this expansion is at risk because of an altogether more
elusive phenomenon: rapidly changing investor psychology.
</P>
<P>
   What Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, labeled
``irrational exuberance'' less than two years ago has given way to
fear and pessimism of equally dubious rationality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had argued, in fact quite extensively over the last two or
three years, that the markets were becoming too complacent about
risk,'' Greenspan said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that has changed,'' he said to a wave of laughter from
his audience of economists. ``If there was a dime to turn on, it
did. And it has been a fairly dramatic, broad and as yet seemingly
incomplete adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects have been well documented. Since Russia in effect
defaulted on its debt in mid-August, investors have been diving for
the foxholes. Money has been pouring into U.S. Treasury securities,
and credit has become more expensive and difficult to get, not just
for developing nations but for corporate borrowers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze has hardly stopped the economy dead in its tracks.
The United States also continues to benefit from what Brian
Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens &AMP; Thompson in
Chicago, called a ``tremendous productivity performance'' that is
providing ``a good foundation'' for an eventual rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a true credit crunch would quickly spill over into the
real economy, which is why Greenspan is clearly so concerned.
Should investors and lenders become even more nervous, the problem
could force businesses to cut back their plans for expansion and
modernization, undercutting a primary force behind the economy's
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Greenspan is worried that the downturn in the stock
market could scare consumers into cutting back on spending. And if
both consumers and businesses feel compelled to retrench, the
economy could lose steam quickly.
</P>
<P>
   What the economy faces is, as much as anything, a crisis of
confidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Psychology _ in the markets, among consumers, in politics _ is a
perilous subject for economists and policy-makers. It lacks any
certain predictability, and there is no model or playbook for
dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, says the
most obvious tool available to policy-makers _ cuts in interest
rates _ may not be of much help at this point. The sectors of the
economy that are sensitive to interest rates, particularly housing,
are already robust. And the rates that are set by the markets
already reflect expectations of further rate cuts by the Fed, and
so are unlikely to fall much more from their already low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most bizarre business cycle we've ever had,''
Dudley said. ``The Fed doesn't have a good template for this.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton administration has, in effect, taken fiscal
policy off the table as a means of stimulating the economy.
President Clinton's demand that the federal budget surplus be left
untouched until Social Security's financing problems are addressed
succeeded in thwarting Republican plans for a big tax cut this
year. But it also forced fiscal policy to remain contractionary at
a time when the economy appears to be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have been heaped
with praise over the last few years for their steady economic
stewardship. Their credibility with the financial markets is
unmatched, and they have proved deft at balancing political and
policy pressures from at home and abroad to keep the U.S. economy
on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   But both are probably approaching the final chapters in their
careers in public service. Their legacies are likely to rest not
only on how they handled the good times the country enjoyed for
most of this decade, but also on their success in using their clout
and credibility to keep the current expansion going. And given the
nature of the threat, that may prove a daunting task even for the
likes of them.

LAWN-MOWING AS A SYMBOL OF VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
(lb) 
 By MARTY ROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The more or less continuous weekend roar usually begins on
Thursday afternoon in my neighborhood, when the man across the
street starts his handsome red Toro lawn mower with a brisk tug and
begins laying great diagonal stripes across the lawn, maneuvering
with accustomed ease around the sweeping branches of his gigantic
spruce tree.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday evening, the whole city is rumbling, as powerful
machines of every description are set to trimming some of the most
mollycoddled grass plants on the planet. In the Midwest, where I
live, we are good neighbors and good citizens, and rather clean
cut, and our lawns are potent symbols of our values.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been using one bizarre mechanical contraption
after another to mow their lawns for more than 100 years now. In
the 1860s, lawns were kept down by scythes or by sheep, according
to Virginia Scott Jenkins, a cultural historian, in ``The Lawn: A
History of an American Obsession'' (Smithsonian Institution Press,
1994).
</P>
<P>
   By the late 19th century, the first lawn mowers had been
patented; in 1880, one manufacturer described its mower, the $13
Charter Oak, as ``truly wonderful,'' saying, ``no one who wishes
for a fine smooth lawn can afford to dispense with it.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, advertisements for John Deere's new $3,000 riding
mower, the Sabre, describe the experience of using this machine in
these stirring words: ``It's not just mowing a lawn, it's doing a
victory lap.''
</P>
<P>
   My neighbor's richly striped lawn across the street compares
favorably with some of the finest mowing patterns at stadiums
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Kansas City, Mo., the Royals replaced their artificial
turf with the real thing a couple of years ago, and this seems to
have inspired a lot of new local mowing fashions: ball-field
stripes, plaids and fancy chevrons are now fairly common. If the
team ever makes it to the World Series again, the stadium
groundskeeper will be a very influential man about town.
</P>
<P>
   Our 15-year-old &UR;  &LR;  neighbor, Max, loves everything about internal
combustion, and his father bought him a sturdy green Craftsman
mower for his 13th birthday, so he could start saving for college,
or maybe a car.
</P>
<P>
   Max has been about 8 feet tall since he was in grade school, and
when he started mowing with that big machine he looked like a foal
trying to keep his legs under him. This summer he advanced to
cutting a nice pattern of cross-hatches, and picked up a little
more business in the neighborhood on the strength of it.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Bob, a landscape architect, amuses himself by mowing
along the contours of his one-acre plot, making wide, slow,
graceful green ripples around his house.
</P>
<P>
   His is a firmly established John Deere neighborhood, he
explained one Saturday morning while brushing the clippings off his
shiny mower. He pointed out the retired gentleman down the street,
who mows nearly every day, riding his little Deere tractor around
and around under the trees, obsessive in his cultivation of
neatness, keeping the prairie at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Bob and his neighbor are iconoclasts: Straight lines dominate
and define their well-clipped landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawn-care experts recommend varying the mowing pattern to
encourage lushly uniform grass, but people here like to hew to the
line. The Midwest sets square with the world, like a big
checkerboard. Our streets and property lines run in cardinal
directions, and people tend to do everything, including mowing, at
right angles to the grid, regardless of the natural lie of the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Front-yard fences are generally frowned on in my neighborhood,
but the property lines between yards can be discerned by a subtle
difference in mowing heights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   My own front yard is very shady, but it still has a lawn of
sorts (I tolerate wild strawberries and clover, to contribute to
the illusion of turf). I mow it every couple of weeks, rolling out
my sleek, quiet little reel mower and attacking each clump of grass
from whatever angle seems best. Wearing garden hat and gloves and
wrap-around plastic safety glasses, I'm the picture of a
responsible citizen gone slightly off her rocker.
</P>
<P>
   An older neighbor has wondered aloud why my husband does not
assume this manly chore, but I'm proud to do it myself. My sister
in Wisconsin notes that women are also the principal mowers in her
little corner of the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I are actually slowly eliminating our lawn and
replacing it with a nice woodland garden, but turf grass is a tough
and cheerful ground cover where it will grow, so I patch the bare
spots in the front yard every fall with ``shady mix'' grass seed.
</P>
<P>
   The grass seedlings are up now, but as usual I have just
remembered to order a load of firewood. It is our supplier's
practice to dump at least part of the load on the lawn, burying the
breathtakingly delicate green down of new shoots under a ton of
excellent oak and pecan. Sometimes it's a week before we can get
the wood stacked up on the porch, and by then the leaves have begun
to fall.
</P>
<P>
   I'll rake a lot of those leaves off the lawn and onto the
compost heap, but around the first of November I bring out my
secret weapon, an old gas lawn mower capable of chopping leaves
into a fine mulch. The weather is very fine here in the fall, and
the work is invigorating.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm finished, I like to sit for a few minutes on my rusty
little glider on the front porch and enjoy a cool Bob's '47, a
local microbrewery's popular fall lager. I'm not really the
microbrew type, but a Bob's always does wonders for the lawn.

ECONOMIC VIEW: A PESSIMISM AS IRRATIONAL AS THAT OLD EXUBERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So what ever happened to the new economy?
</P>
<P>
   It was only months ago that economists had difficulty seeing any
credible threats to an expansion that began in 1991 and begat a
stock market that recognized no ceiling. So heady was the ride that
economists and fiscal policy-makers from Alan Greenspan down were
pondering whether the United States had entered a golden era _ one
in which business investments in technology were driving a
resurgence in productivity and gains in productivity were making
strong growth and low unemployment possible without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, inflation is still dormant, and the unemployment rate,
while inching up, is still near a quarter-century low. But growth
is suddenly looking fragile, so much so that economists began
talking seriously last week about whether a recession was in the
cards for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the outlook has changed abruptly for the worse,
there is undeniably still something new and uncharted in this
economy. After all, most periods of economic expansion end when the
Federal Reserve is forced to raise interest rates to squelch
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But this expansion is at risk because of an altogether more
elusive phenomenon: rapidly changing investor psychology.
</P>
<P>
   What Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, labeled
``irrational exuberance'' less than two years ago has given way to
fear and pessimism of equally dubious rationality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had argued, in fact quite extensively over the last two or
three years, that the markets were becoming too complacent about
risk,'' Greenspan said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that has changed,'' he said to a wave of laughter from
his audience of economists. ``If there was a dime to turn on, it
did. And it has been a fairly dramatic, broad and as yet seemingly
incomplete adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects have been well documented. Since Russia in effect
defaulted on its debt in mid-August, investors have been diving for
the foxholes. Money has been pouring into U.S. Treasury securities,
and credit has become more expensive and difficult to get, not just
for developing nations but for corporate borrowers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The squeeze has hardly stopped the economy dead in its tracks.
The United States also continues to benefit from what Brian
Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens &AMP; Thompson in
Chicago, called a ``tremendous productivity performance'' that is
providing ``a good foundation'' for an eventual rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a true credit crunch would quickly spill over into the
real economy, which is why Greenspan is clearly so concerned.
Should investors and lenders become even more nervous, the problem
could force businesses to cut back their plans for expansion and
modernization, undercutting a primary force behind the economy's
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Greenspan is worried that the downturn in the stock
market could scare consumers into cutting back on spending. And if
both consumers and businesses feel compelled to retrench, the
economy could lose steam quickly.
</P>
<P>
   What the economy faces is, as much as anything, a crisis of
confidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Psychology _ in the markets, among consumers, in politics _ is a
perilous subject for economists and policy-makers. It lacks any
certain predictability, and there is no model or playbook for
dealing with it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, William Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs, says the
most obvious tool available to policy-makers _ cuts in interest
rates _ may not be of much help at this point. The sectors of the
economy that are sensitive to interest rates, particularly housing,
are already robust. And the rates that are set by the markets
already reflect expectations of further rate cuts by the Fed, and
so are unlikely to fall much more from their already low levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most bizarre business cycle we've ever had,''
Dudley said. ``The Fed doesn't have a good template for this.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Clinton administration has, in effect, taken fiscal
policy off the table as a means of stimulating the economy.
President Clinton's demand that the federal budget surplus be left
untouched until Social Security's financing problems are addressed
succeeded in thwarting Republican plans for a big tax cut this
year. But it also forced fiscal policy to remain contractionary at
a time when the economy appears to be slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have been heaped
with praise over the last few years for their steady economic
stewardship. Their credibility with the financial markets is
unmatched, and they have proved deft at balancing political and
policy pressures from at home and abroad to keep the U.S. economy
on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
   But both are probably approaching the final chapters in their
careers in public service. Their legacies are likely to rest not
only on how they handled the good times the country enjoyed for
most of this decade, but also on their success in using their clout
and credibility to keep the current expansion going. And given the
nature of the threat, that may prove a daunting task even for the
likes of them.

EMPLOYEES NEED CONSIDERATE HAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Working for a company for a long time is a lot like being
married. If you're not on your toes, a certain lack of
consideration &UR;  &LR; can creep in.
</P>
<P>
   Like spouses who take each other for granted, assuming the
laundry will be washed and dinner will be cooked every night,
bosses often assume that their employees will hang around forever
doing the same old thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when a spouse gets fed up and says she's got a more
attractive offer _ even if it means living alone _ then he suddenly
gets worried and comes bearing gifts of roses, champagne and
chocolate to woo her back. It's the same at work, except the tokens
of affection are typically better job titles, more responsibility
and more money.
</P>
<P>
   One Houston marketing manager pushed for a director-level job
for more than a year. It was promised when she was hired and she
kept getting hints that it would come soon.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, another company came courting with a director-level job
that offered a sizable increase in pay, a sign-on bonus and more
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Her current employer went crazy, offering to match everything on
the table including the sought-after director's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been very nice, including calling frequently to
ask how I'm doing,'' said the marketing manager, asking not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   All that courting is intoxicating, which is blurring her ability
to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   She said she likes her current job but it does linger in her
mind why she didn't get that director's title earlier.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors often neglectful &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's a sad situation that's not uncommon, said Greg Nakanishi,
president of GN Resources, a human resource consulting company.
Often out of neglect, supervisors don't let their employees know
how valuable they are to the organization and don't take the steps
to get them a promotion, a raise or a pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing employees for their good work isn't that difficult,
he said. A nice note, a nice comment or a nice bulletin board
notice goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We focus on the negative _ this went wrong, we made this
mistake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And not recognizing the contributions of those already at work
sometimes makes bosses look right past them when it comes time to
fill a new job.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate communications manager at a Houston company found
out accidentally about several new openings in her department at
the director level, then discovered she wasn't being considered for
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that since I was with the company that they didn't have
to court me or do anything for me,'' she said, asking not to be
identified. She said she pushed and pushed her own candidacy and
was finally elevated to the director level.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes she would never have been promoted if she
hadn't pushed. You watch people with fewer qualifications get hired
in at a higher level but you're left behind, she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, there's not a `fit' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when a boss doesn't promote a subordinate, it's
because the employee may not be seen as the ``right'' person for
the job, Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees may not be good team players, or have the right
``fit'' with the organization, or not be results-oriented enough to
move to the next level, but they're doing a perfectly good job in
the job they've got, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to avoid the issue, he said, than rock the boat.
Bosses figure: ``I've got a lot of things to do. Why spend time on
tweaking?''
</P>
<P>
   But the tragedy is that the employee doesn't get any feedback on
what she needs to do to move to the next level, yet she's doing a
good job so she isn't counseled on how to improve, Nakanishi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just sit there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Clifford isn't in the business of giving out promotions,
but she does help companies show appreciation for their employees.
She finds that many times the effort backfires.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, president of Celebration Productions, which plans
special events for corporations, said she gets calls from companies
that say they want to celebrate a big milestone at the company, yet
instruct her to serve employees a lunch of barbecue and potato
salad in the company lunchroom.
</P>
<P>
   They don't understand that they're saying they really don't care
about their employees, said Clifford. And yet those same companies
put on huge spreads for their clients, complete with fancy
restaurant dinners, complimentary valet parking and lavish goodie
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Employees see that disparity and they get the message of where
they fit into the organization, she said. Even if the bosses don't
see it, employees pick right up on that insincerity.

BUSINESS ETHICS: YOU'RE ASKED TO CHEAT. WHAT TO DO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By PATRICK J. LYONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cynical cliche has it that ``business ethics'' is an
oxymoron and that getting ahead requires locking one's conscience
in a desk drawer. But three-quarters of working American adults say
they have never been asked or told to do something they thought was
unethical on the job, according to a survey by Yankelovich Partners
released last week.
</P>
<P>
   And of those who were, 4 in 10 said they actually did the dirty
deed.
</P>
<P>
   When the survey asked what they would do if they found out an
employer was up to no good, only a handful said they would choose
one of the popularly imagined horns of the dilemma _ looking the
other way (9 percent) or quitting (5 percent). The vast majority,
78 percent, said they would talk to the boss or otherwise try to
resolve the situation without losing their jobs, a finding that
suggests most people feel they have some scope to affect ethical
behavior in their workplaces. (The remaining 8 percent were unsure
what they would do or gave other answers.)
</P>
<P>
   Who is most often put on the spot? The survey found that
slightly more men than women, and more people with some college
education than those without, have been asked to do something they
thought was unethical, a finding that may simply mirror differences
in the kinds of jobs most often held by people in each group.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to interpret is a finding that more people who live in
the South and West or in rural areas in general report having been
asked to transgress than people who live in the Northeast or
Midwest or in towns, suburbs and cities generally. Greater rates of
churchgoing in the South and in rural areas don't seem to be the
reason: Responses nationwide from people who said they regularly
attend religious services were no different from others' responses.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 1,002 American adults was conducted in June,
before President Clinton's public acknowledgment of an
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky or Independent
Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yankelovich Partners conducted the survey for the Lutheran
Brotherhood, an organization owned by its 1.1 million Lutheran
members. The group provides insurance and other financial services
and operates charitable programs, and it often sponsors surveys on
ethical and other issues. &QL;

FUNDS WATCH: JUST HOW LOW CAN FEES GO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With equity markets on the skids, investors may soon notice the
bite that fees take from their mutual-fund returns. But a new fund
family with big-name outside advisers hopes to attract investors by
reining in these costs.
</P>
<P>
   In rolling out four funds earlier this month, Forward Funds, a
San Francisco firm, pledged only that expenses would never be more
than the average of all funds in its peer group. In a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, expenses for the Forward
Equity fund, for example, are estimated at 1.4 percent for the
initial fiscal year, just below the 1.41 percent average expense
ratio of domestic equity funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald Pelosi, the group's president, said he expected to
``be able to deliver lower expenses'' _ and still make a profit _
by applying institutional-style pricing to retail funds.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Lallos, a senior analyst at Morningstar Inc., the
financial publishing firm in Chicago, said the group's success
would depend on how big it becomes. As assets grow, fund companies
can realize economies of scale on fees. Unlike most fund companies,
Forward plans to pass on those savings, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Bobroff, a fund industry consultant in East Greenwich,
R.I., was cautious in assessing the group's prospects. ``Cost isn't
the only factor,'' he said. ``If it were, Vanguard would have all
the assets,'' he added, referring to the low-cost fund giant.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, if Forward Funds succeeds, it could face a flood of
competition, even from its own subadvisers, which could match its
pricing very quickly, Bobroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Equity is managed by Barclays Global Fund Advisors. The
other funds are International Equity, managed by Templeton
Investment Counsel; Global Bond, managed by Pacific Investment
Management, and Small Capitalization, managed by Hoover Capital
Management. A fifth fund, Global Asset Allocation, is managed by
Webster Investment Management, the fund family's investment
adviser, by distributing assets among the four other funds.
</P>
<P>
   The group will get a head start with a $100 million cash
infusion from Sutton Place Associates, a group of private investors
also in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Rogers, a principal at Barclays, which manages $563
billion, said its agreement with Forward Funds was an ``Intel
inside'' strategy that allowed Barclays to have someone else sell
its product.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Funds investors pay an upfront purchase fee of 0.25
percent, which is not a load because it goes directly into the
fund's net asset value _ and not to the management company _ to
cover the costs of buying securities. Vanguard employs similar
``transaction'' fees ranging from 0.25 percent to 1 percent on some
of its index funds to defray the costs of buying and selling, a
Vanguard spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutiny in the Markets
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, when investors lose money they become restive,
even mutinous. But would shareholders make even the vaunted Dr. J.
Mark Mobius, captain of seven Templeton funds with a total value of
more than $13 billion, walk the plank?
</P>
<P>
   No. Dissidents at the $448 million Templeton Dragon fund, which
is intended for investors seeking long-term capital appreciation by
investing in companies in China, proposed that the board consider
converting from a closed-end fund traded on the New York Stock
Exchange to an open-end fund. But Franklin Resources, Templeton's
parent company, reported that shareholders had rejected the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Templeton Dragon, which reached a 52-week high of $15.75 a share
a year earlier, closed Thursday at $6.25, up from a low of $5.25 on
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that drubbing, Mobius, perhaps the leading apostle of
emerging-markets investing, voices optimism. In an article from
Hong Kong, Dow Jones recently reported that Mobius was advising
investors ``to be patient.'' He added, ``We have seen a tremendous
over-correction in the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every manager has Mobius' sway with shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   At Clemente Global Growth, an $80.4 million fund that has seen
its share price shrink from a 52-week high of $13.125 on July 22 to
a close of $8.5625 on Thursday, a group of dissidents gained
control of the board. The dissidents, led by Phillip Goldstein of
Opportunity Partners and Ronald Olin of Deep Discount Advisors,
triumphed over Lilia Clemente, the fund's manager, who was not
re-elected to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Fly, Fly Away  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase an ad for a rival marketing combination, , was it
the fund or was it the miles?
</P>
<P>
   Warburg Pincus Asset Management Inc. and Northwest Airlines
announced that they had agreed to create and market mutual funds _
initially, two money market funds _ through which Warburg Pincus
investors can earn Northwest World Perks frequent-flyer bonus
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can earn one bonus mile for each $4 invested on an
annual basis, plus up to 1,200 bonus miles; accounts opened during
the first six months of the program, which began Oct. 1., can earn
200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   And just think, if the market really turns south, you can too.
Just take a nice holiday and get away from it all.
</P>
<P>
   Two New Acorns
</P>
<P>
   Acorn Investment Trust, managed by Wanger Asset Management LP,
announced two new no-load mutual funds. Acorn 20 will invest in 20
to 25 American companies; Acorn Foreign 40 will invest in 40 to 60
foreign companies. Both will seek long-term capital growth. John
Park and Mark Yost manage Acorn 20, while Marcel Houtzager and Leah
Zell manage Acorn Foreign Forty. Each fund has a minimum investment
of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gabelli Sticks to Its Guns  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With storm clouds over the world's financial markets, both
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and Neuberger &AMP; Berman have decided this is no
time to go public. But the intrepid Mario Gabelli is pushing ahead
with an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   In an amended Securities and Exchange Commission filing this
week, Gabelli Funds said a group including Merrill Lynch and
Salomon Smith Barney would manage the offering, but gave no hint of
when the sale might occur, or how many shares would be sold,
Bloomberg News reported.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, based in Rye, N.Y., managed about $15.8 billion of
assets as of June 30.

   NEW YORK _ Can anyone save Save Venice?
</P>
<P>
   A schism among the leadership of the glittery international
charity of that name has become the talk of the black-tie party
circuit, from Park Avenue to the Grand Canal. At a heated meeting
last month at the Hotel Monaco in Venice, the board of Save Venice,
which includes some of the most prominent people in New York
society, split into warring camps. Though the members have partied,
traveled and raised money together for years, one side ultimately
stalked out.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as though there will be no more fabulous visits to
the home of Countess Cristiana Brandolini d'Abba, a sister of
Gianni Agnelli, nor to other private Italian palazzi, which had
been thrown open to American supporters of Save Venice for fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big schism, a full-blown sail that has been torn in
half,'' said Nan Kempner, the socialite, who spends three weeks a
year in Venice and has attended many Save Venice galas.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 36 years ago, Save Venice restores buildings and
artworks damaged by floods in the Italian city, which is sinking.
Most recently it raised $4 million for the Renaissance church of
Santa Maria dei Miracoli, which reopened this year.
</P>
<P>
   But like many charities that rely on big-city galas for the bulk
of their fund raising, Save Venice is known as well for its social
opportunities as for its good works. At an annual masked ball in
New York, with tickets costing $1,000 for people 35 and older,
revelers dress elaborately as 17th-century Italian courtesans and
human gondolas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think it's very cool because it's European,'' said one
New Yorker in his 40s who attends many charity soirees. ``Europe
always has an allure of being more sophisticated.''
</P>
<P>
   The most fabulous festivities have been in palazzi in and around
Venice every other year during the city's Regatta Week. Americans
rubbed elbows with titled Italians in spectacular homes the public
never sees.
</P>
<P>
   Last year these included the Cantina di Vistorta, owned by the
Brandolini d'Abba family; Castello Roncade, owned by a baron and a
baroness, and the Palazzo Pisani Moretta, where there was dancing
to the the Peter Duchin Orchestra and entertainment by Bobby Short.
</P>
<P>
   If, back in the States, some guests dropped a line like ``Last
week, when I was at Countess Brandolini's ...,'' it would not have
been the first time an American had suggested a connection to
European aristocracy to burnish social status.
</P>
<P>
   The access to titled Italians was thanks to Laurence Lovett, an
American philanthropist who lives on the Grand Canal in Venice in a
magnificent palace a stone's throw from the Rialto Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett, an heir to the Piggly Wiggly supermarket fortune, who
was the international chairman of Save Venice, is socially
connected to European aristocracy as well as to old-line New York.
He was primarily responsible for opening the gates of the Italian
city to Americans deemed socially worthy.
</P>
<P>
   But those gates could be closing.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who were at the board meeting, on Sept. 14, said
Lovett was incensed by a vote removing his sister-in-law, Betsy
Lovett, from the board. Lovett announced his resignation, walking
out with his supporters, including Marchesa Barbara Berlingieri;
Alexis Gregory, the publisher of Vendome Books in New York; and Lee
Thaw, a prominent New York hostess. Eventually, a majority of the
Italians followed Lovett.
</P>
<P>
   ``The social set has left,'' said Dr. Randolph Guthrie, who
remains the chairman of Save Venice. ``There are two groups. One
group thinks we're in the restoration business in order to have
parties and have royals around, and the other group _ that's ours _
is throwing parties to have restorations.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie, a plastic surgeon whose medical office is in an Upper
East Side town house that also houses Save Venice's offices, said
that in recent years the social dimension of the group _ and
particularly the presence of titled Europeans who, he said,
contributed little financially _ had overshadowed the
art-restoration goals. He blamed Lovett and his aristocratic
friends for that transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie recalled an incident in which an American donor was at a
party with Princess Michael of Kent. ``This nice lady, a big donor
to Save Venice, asked the princess what she should call her,''
Guthrie said. The princess replied, he said, ``Call me ma'am.'' The
American retorted that her country had fought a revolution to avoid
genuflecting before aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was annoyed,'' Guthrie said. ``Everyone's there to raise
money for Save Venice, and the royals; they weren't doing that.
They were swanning. Swan, swan, swan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lovett replied that the titled Europeans served to draw
American donors, thus helping to raise money. ``Yes, we're
social,'' she said. ``Yes. Life is social. There was great joy in
having wonderful events that would open Venice to people
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Many involved with Save Venice say the schism between Guthrie
and the Lovetts had long been simmering, and that it involved
personality conflicts as well as disagreements over the group's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Lovett and his supporters praise Guthrie's successful fund
raising. The group had never raised more than $30,000 a year until
Guthrie's wife, Beatrice Guthrie, was hired as executive director
about 12 years ago, along with a professional staff. Now the
charity raises about $1 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, Lovett's faction maintains that Guthrie let the
New York parties grow too big and too public, with splashy press
coverage, and that in the hands of him and his wife, the biannual
Venice trips _ for which 300 tickets were sold _ were opened to too
broad a group.
</P>
<P>
   Save Venice lost its aura of exclusivity, the Lovett faction
says. Before the September board meeting, Lovett and his supporters
had sought to move the group's headquarters to Venice,
significantly reducing Dr. and Mrs. Guthrie's control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went power-crazy,'' said a former board member, a
partisan of Lovett who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``They
wanted all the credit. It was all about their social progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Lovett said he now plans to start a new charity with a similar
mission. He has not settled on a name. ``It was a question of
ethics and human dignity,'' he said, explaining his resignation.
``I did not want to serve any longer as an officer or board member
with some of the present officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Save Venice is proceeding with its plans for its
winter gala, called the Crystal Carnival, which is scheduled for
Feb. 23 at the Plaza. Far from scaling back the festivities, the
organizers are expecting hundreds dressed in Venetian carnival
costumes _ some of whom may be lured more by the prospects of a
glamorous night of dress-up than a worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' said one habitual gala-goer in New York.
``Some people don't care whether the party is for Save Venice or
for Save Chicago. The parties are fun. Do people care about Venice?
It could be save Fort Lauderdale From Spring Break and they'd go.''

JURY INDICTS SUSPECT IN SHOOTING OF 2 OFFICERS AT CAPITOL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury Friday indicted Russell E.
Weston Jr. on two counts of murder in the shooting of two U.S.
Capitol Police officers in the building they swore to protect.
</P>
<P>
   The six-count indictment also accuses Weston, 41, of attempted
murder on a third officer and using a firearm in the three violent
attacks July 24. He could be sentenced to death if convicted of
killing a federal officer.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, scheduled to be arraigned Wednesday, remains in custody
without bond at D.C. General Hospital as he recovers from gunshot
wounds he sustained outside the office of House Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, R-Texas. During the attack, Weston killed Officers Jacob J.
Chestnut, 58, and John M. Gibson, 42, who was assigned to guard
DeLay, federal prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Douglas B. McMillan was injured along with 24-year-old
Angela Dickerson of Virginia, who was visiting the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's deadly march began about 3:30 p.m. when he stormed
through a metal detector at the East Front entrance to the Capitol
and fired a .38 caliber revolver point blank at the back of
Chestnut's head as the officer was giving directions to a tourist,
prosecutors allege.
</P>
<P>
   Weston then ran down the first floor hallway toward DeLay's
office, firing on McMillan before engaging Gibson in a short-range
gun battle that left the officer dead and the assailant seriously
wounded, accord to law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, bandaged and in a wheelchair, made his first appearance
before a federal judge Sept. 23. He said he understood that he was
being held on charges of killing two federal officers but declined
to enter a plea.
</P>
<P>
   The accused, who has been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic,
wrote several letters to federal agencies before the Capitol
attack, complaining that government officials had planted land
mines on the grounds of his Montana cabin, prosecutors stated in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he once drove up to a guard station at the Central
Intelligence Agency's headquarters in Langley, Va., and rambled on
about President Clinton, Marilyn Monroe and cloning, prosecutors
added.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's lawyers have received permission from the U.S. District
Court in Washington, D.C., to have their client evaluated by
psychiatrists. The evaluations might form the basis for an insanity
defense, but the attorneys have not publicly discussed their
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have also asked the court for permission to evaluate
Weston's mental health but have not yet received judicial
clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, a native of Valmeyer, Ill., could present an insanity
defense at his arraignment Wednesday. A judge then would likely
permit government psychiatrists to evaluate him.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also would decide whether Weston is competent to stand
trial. If an insanity defense is presented, the court would have to
determine if Weston was sane enough to understand the difference
between right and wrong at the time of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's parents, who testified before the grand jury in August,
have spoken publicly about their son's 20-year history of mental
illness and his fear of the federal government. &QL;

SONGS YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's music may sound a lot different than what I listened to
25 years ago, but I take comfort in the fact that the lyrics are
just as indecipherable now as they were then.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, indecipherable lyrics discourage people from
``singing along'' to their favorite song, thus saving the nerves
and ears of the rest of us from irreparable damage. Flailing away
at an air guitar or flapping about the room like a loon in heat is
one thing; attempting to sing, out loud, the chorus of ``Blinded by
the Light'' is another thing entirely.
</P>
<P>
   I mention ``Blinded by the Light'' specifically because few song
lyrics have generated as much confusion in the minds of listeners
as these, written by one of the most incomprehensible composers of
our time, Bruce Springsteen. If you are into computers (and there
is certainly no good reason why you should be), you will find an
entire web page (http://www.kissthisguy.com/) devoted to possible
translations of the chorus, as suggested by hundreds of earnest, if
somewhat underoccupied, fans. Some of the more plausible guesses
include:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Held up like a loofah by the foreman of the night.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Shot loose like a goose, another runner in the night.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Revved up my big Dodge and did a runner with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Rabbit in a lot of juice, like a doughnut in the night.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Racked up like a moose, that's been run over in the
night.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Caught up at the juice bar in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Wake up like a dachshund in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   And my personal favorite:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Throw up blah blah blah in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   (The actual lyrics, for what they're worth, are: ``Blinded by
the light/Revved up like a deuce/Another runner in the night.''
Just further proof that truth is not always stranger than fiction.)
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, by the way, is named after one of the more famous
misheard lyrics from the song ``Purple Haze'' by Jimi Hendrix. The
actual lyrics were ``Scuse me while I kiss the sky'' but many fans
(this one included) thought Hendrix said ``Scuse me while I kiss
this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Older (or younger) readers who find this error to be rather lame
should keep in mind that this all took place in the '60s and
Hendrix concerts were very loud and the concert halls were
invariably filled with a lot of fog, or something, that distorted
the lyrics. So lighten up.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can mishear a lyric, of course, but to qualify as a
classic, a misheard lyric must meet two criteria: 1) You must
believe your misheard version is better than the original, and 2)
You must have convinced at least one other person that your version
is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, I, and millions of other rock fans who suffered
greater or lesser degrees of hearing loss during the '60s, firmly
believed that the Creedence Clearwater Revival song ``Bad Moon
Rising'' contained the lyric ``There's a bathroom on the right,''
when the actual words were, obviously, ``There's a bad moon on the
rise.''
</P>
<P>
   We assumed, I guess, that lead singer John Fogarty was simply
giving us concert-goers some useful information, though, in
hindsight, it did seem like an odd thing to put in a song. In my
defense, I can only say that I didn't take it as far as Creedence
fan Rick Marks did. Marks not only got the ``Bad moon on the rise''
part wrong, he also misheard the line, ``I think we're in for nasty
weather'' to read, ``I think we're in for mashed potatoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another song that has been misheard is ``Witchy Woman'' by The
Eagles. Benjamin Dover, somehow, misheard the title line as,
``OoohhOoo, windshield woman/See how high she flies/OoohhOoo,
windshield woman/She got the moon in her eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought,'' said Dover, ``that the song was about some
zoned-out freak riding around in his car while having ghostly
hallucinations through his windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing moment of revelation came, predictably enough,
when Dover read the song title on the album jacket. To his credit,
Dover believes that his version of the lyrics is better than the
original and claims to have convinced at least one friend that his
version is the correct one.
</P>
<P>
   TV theme songs are frequently misheard, which is a double
tragedy as some of these tunes are like steel plates, so
permanently embedded are they in our skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have misheard the line in the theme song to ``All in
the Family'' that goes, ``Gee, our old LaSalle ran great.''
Versions that are either better or worse than the original,
depending on your point of view, include, ``Gee, those were the
salad days,'' ``Gee, I love old sour grapes'' and the truly
bizarre, ``G.R.O. LaSalle Redgrave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones'' theme song has given me trouble ever since
the show debuted in 1960. I speaking specifically of the line
``Let's ride/With the family down the street/Through the/Blah blah
blah blah blah blah blah.'' I thought, possibly, that the missing
line was ``Making friends with all they meet,'' but that didn't
seem likely as Fred's grumpy nature didn't win him a lot of
friends.
</P>
<P>
   A more plausible possibility might be, ``And see how much old
Fred can eat'' as Fred had quite the appetite, though it was
unclear why anyone would want to ride around with this family just
to watch Fred gorge himself.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after all these years, thanks to The Archive of
Misheard Lyrics, I know that the actual line is ``Courtesy of
Fred's two feet.'' Personally, I think my lyrics are better than
the real ones. And my dog agrees with me.

CLINTON FIGHTS MID-TERM ELECTIONS FROM THE SIDELINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is sitting out the most important
election of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new Congress that convenes in January is expected
to decide whether to impeach him, Clinton is planning campaign
visits to only seven or eight states in the weeks before the Nov. 3
mid-term congressional election.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he campaigned in 14 states in the final 25 days of
the 1994 mid-term congressional elections, appearing with dozens of
candidates at open air rallies, closed-door fund raisers and
policy-oriented events staged to highlight Democrats' political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Clinton plans to use a White House-based ``Rose
Garden'' strategy that will give him greater control over his
public agenda. He is planning White House events to spotlight
efforts to protect the Social Security system, boost federal
investment in public education and efforts to protect the rights of
medical patients in the era of managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope the tactic will overshadow any Republican efforts
to make the mid-term congressional election a referendum on
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Staying at home also will shield him from hecklers and
protesters carrying signs urging his impeachment or resignation in
connection with the White House sex and coverup scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the strategy is to gain Democratic seats in the
House, where the 206 Democrats are outnumbered by 228 Republicans.
A House vote to impeach a president requires a simple majority. All
435 House seats are up on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans outnumber Democrats, 55 to 45. A
two-thirds vote _ or 67 senators _ would be needed to convict a
president and remove him or her from office. There are 34 Senate
seats up on election day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing the president can do _ especially given the
common agenda we have with Democrats _ is to do his job,'' says
White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart. ``It's a case of where
good policy is good politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton may be bucking history if he hopes to boost
Democrats' strength.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Romer, chairman of the Democratic National Committee and
governor of Colorado, says the party of an incumbent president has
never boosted its total of House seats in the sixth year of a
presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   The party in power in the White House typically loses 35 seats
in the House in the sixth year of a presidency, Romer says.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are hoping to hold losses below that level in order to
claim that voters are standing by Clinton in the face of GOP-led
impeachment efforts.
</P>
<P>
   When he does travel, Clinton is opting for carefully staged
political events featuring invited guests and closed-door fund
raisers in private homes rather than the boisterous open air
campaign rallies designed to ignite voter turnout and spark local
media coverage,
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will continue to raise money for Democrats, flying to
Chicago on Friday to help Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., and to
St. Louis later Friday to raise money with House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not scheduled any open air campaign rallies
for the president before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that going from town to town and from rally to
rally is what helps most Democrats around the country,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last major overnight campaign swing is a scheduled
two-day trip to California on Oct. 20-21 to help raise campaign
funds for Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The latest polls in the
state show Boxer and Republican challenger Matt Fong locked in a
close race.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials deny that Democratic candidates are shying
away from appearances with the embattled president.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, who shunned Clinton at a
campaign appearance in his state in late September, has now
appealed for a joint appearance with the president in hopes of
forestalling a formidable challenge by Republican Ellen Sauerbrey.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will campaign in Maryland on behalf of Glendening and in
New York on behalf of the Senate campaign of Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., locked in a tough fight with three-term Sen. Alfonse
D`Amato, R-N.Y.

AN E! FOR EFFORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She's 25, an Encino native and engaged. And no,
she didn't really get a master's degree in Must-See TV from the
University of California at Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   But Wanda, the campy TV maven at E! Online who hosts a weekly
chat attended by hundreds, has proven a huge hit in the year since
her oh-so-modest debut.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda in fact is the !ital!nom de net!off! of one of E! Online's
editors, a true TV junkie who really does follow the ins and outs
of Bailey and Claudia on ``Party of Five,'' Amanda and Billy on
``Melrose Place'' and numerous other characters on numerous hits
and cult faves.
</P>
<P>
   What she doesn't like to do, however, is give out her real name.
Being an Internet star can be an uncomfortable experience in some
ways for an attractive young personality who still has pretensions
to a private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanda has stalkers, one or two,'' the editor said of her alter
ego. ``Sometimes you get strange e-mails that freak you out. One of
the strange things on the Internet is you can have such intimate
relationships with people and not know who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The editor originally wanted to create an online character who
took television much less seriously than do many critics, she said.
Wanda was the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea I had is that I love fan sites where they're dishy,''
Wanda said. ``I love TV so much. All my friends would always call
me because I know what's going on on all the shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, her bosses agreed to let her create an online
persona dishing the latest dirt to far more extended group of
``friends'' on the Internet. In September 1997, the weekly chat
debuted with just 10 participants. But her bosses were patient with
the new feature, and it blossomed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wanda talks with hundreds of followers in the 3 p.m. Monday
chats, with thousands more people reading the transcripts that are
posted afterward at the site. Oh, and she kept her day job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still an editor, but this has obviously become much more
of a prominent role,'' Wanda said. ``I spend more time on it then
my bosses will ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes personally answering an eye-straining 200 or so
e-mails a day from fans. She even got some hundred e-mails from
people concerned about her whereabouts when she recently took a
week off for vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people write three times a day,'' Wanda said. ``A lot
think I'm their personal entree to Hollywood. The reality is, I
guess I am for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In between working her regular job, handling the Wanda load and
carrying on a regular life, the editor still manages to watch a
remarkable amount of television.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda attributes her TV fixation to ``growing up in the 1980s in
the Valley,'' where she loved watching ``thirtysomething,'' her
all-time fave, which she still catches regularly on the Lifetime
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like angst, I like drama, I like human emotion and family,''
Wanda said. ``And dysfunction, obviously. It's dysfunction that got
me where I am today. My mom will be happy to read that.''
</P>
<P>
   GAMES WE LIKE: A decade and a half after Flight Simulator
debuted, Microsoft added the one thing critics always clamored for:
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator is fully compatible with
Flight Simulator 98 planes and will convert the thousands of other
plane models created by third-party companies and enthusiasts since
Flight Simulator 5.0 came out.
</P>
<P>
   You can even add guns and bombs to the civilian models, so that
747 isn't defenseless when it drops into a dogfight between U.S.
P-51 Mustangs and German Me-109s.
</P>
<P>
   Clever graphic tricks make the backgrounds look smashing.
Incredibly detailed physics models take into account such details
as the declining weight of ammo and fuel during a mission and the
resulting effects on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Run the game with a force-feedback joystick and accelerator card
and you'll be in ready-room heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The game is confined _ in this iteration _ to U.S., English and
German fighters in the European theater of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But the great thing about the Flight Simulator has been its
expandability, allowing that game's millions of rabid fans to add
their own planes, scenarios, landscape, even such complements as
air traffic control packs. Expect way more of that when this hits
the shelves Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   FIGURES AND NUMBERS: So, just how big IS the Intenet these days?
Depends on who you're asking. The Industry Standard, a fine
technology-oriented news weekly, recently asked nine different
prominent consulting firms, and got, well, nine different answers.
</P>
<P>
   The highest estimate came from a Nielsen Media
Research/CommerceNet study conducted in June that estimated 70.5
million U.S. Internet users aged 16 and up. Intelliquest was right
behind, at around 67 million users in a somewhat earlier study.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the scale, Simmons and MRI respectively
estimated 48.2 million and 49.1 million users over the age of 18.
Three other studies, with massive sample sizes ranging from 35,000
to 50,000 people, pegged the total somewhere between 56 million and
60 million users each.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, at least one in six Americans probably is an
Internet user _ and perhaps as many as one in four.

CD WITH ELVIS COSTELLO INTRODUCES BACHARACH TO YET ANOTHER
GENERATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Painted From Memory,'' the new album by Elvis Costello and
Burt Bacharach, is dedicated to children in the two artists'
families. This is fitting. Not only is Costello, despite his long
and largely mythical connection to punk-rock, a musical child of
Bacharach, but Bacharach's music has a timelessness about it, which
should be passed on from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   Should be. It was surprisingly difficult to find this
much-anticipated CD in stores, but it was even more astonishing to
encounter blank stares from salesclerks after asking about it.
</P>
<P>
   You kids these days. Don't you know that Bacharach has left a
legacy that's stretched from pre-''Casino Royale'' to post-''Austin
Powers,'' from Marty Robbins singing ``The Story of My Life'' to
Rupert Everett leading a sing-along of ``I Say a Little Prayer'' in
``My Best Friend's Wedding''? That alt-rockers such as Stereolab
and R.E.M. have sung the praises of his songwriting?
</P>
<P>
   Bacharach's music has been part of the pop culture for 40 years,
but although modern rockers such as Oasis and soul singers such as
Tevin Campbell have covered his songs, we only found one Web site
dedicated to him. He deserves better _ let's hope that when Rhino
Records releases the three-CD ``The Look of Love: The Burt
Bacharach Box'' on Nov. 3, it'll be a lot easier to find.
</P>
<P>
   My affection for Bacharach comes from my own father-son
connection. My dad owned a copy of ``Make It Easy on Yourself,''
which included many of Bacharach's '60s hits with lyricist Hal
David. Its soft, melancholy music was the perfect mood-setter for
those quiet times between Sunday Mass and Sunday lunch, back in the
late '60s and early '70s, when the family actually ate lunch at the
table. You didn't want to turn up the volume on this record; it
would spoil the almost subliminal melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about the Costello collaboration is how it evokes
that mood. Bacharach is known primarily as a songwriter, but his
true strength lies in his arranging skills. Bacharach rarely went
over the top _ his songs were more often matters of subtle
punctuation rather than loud exclamation points. The softly
bleating flugelhorns on ``Toledo,'' one of the best songs of the
new CD, echo Herb Alpert's guy-with-a-hopeless-crush trumpet on
1968's heart-tugging ``This Guy's in Love With You''; the female
choruses sprinkled throughout ``Painted From Memory'' recall the
``whoa-whoa-whoa'' chorus that introduces Dionne Warwick's ``Do You
Know the Way to San Jose?,'' also from '68. There's no denying how
affecting these songs are. Bacharach's subtle arrangements put you
in a lonely place, but in a good lonely place _ one that,
oxymoronically, makes you not feel so alone. Misery loves company,
and for all the gentle swing of Bacharach's music, lyricist David
sure could reach for the sorrow: In ``Walk on By,'' Warwick told a
lost love to ignore her if he saw her on the street, because the
pain would just be too much if they met again. In the Fifth
Dimension hit ``One Less Bell to Answer,'' a dumped woman tries to
look on the bright side of a breakup, only to be reduced to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Bacharach's music always responded elegantly to these words, as
it did to David's more upbeat, swingin' '60s side (''The Look of
Love''; ``What's New, Pussycat?''). A poor singer, Bacharach always
attracted the right muses to sing his and David's songs. His
favorite was Warwick, but he had big hits with Jackie DeShannon
(''What the World Needs Now''), the Carpenters (''Close to You''),
B.J. Thomas (''Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'') and a host of
others.
</P>
<P>
   Like many prolific songwriters, however, Bacharach hit a slow
period; he was quiet for much of the late '70s, and the early '80s
found him mostly writing for movies, usually with then-wife Carole
Bayer Sager. Although he produced a few hits (''Arthur's Theme,''
``That's What Friends Are For''), the pop landscape had subdivided.
The guy who once shared the airwaves with the Beatles and the
Stones couldn't be found on the same stations with disco dollies
and hair-metal bands. Those who preferred harder-edged rock stopped
paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   But during the '90s, we've been rediscovering our parents' (and
grandparents') music. Frank Sinatra performed with U2's Bono, Tony
Bennett appeared on MTV, and swing is hot again. Yet Bacharach,
till the Costello collaboration, has seemed relatively quiet. Until
you remember that Mike Myers used him as an epitome of '60s cool in
``Austin Powers.'' Or you discover that Bacharach worked with
Warwick again in this decade, as well as with James Ingram and
Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire. He has even performed with Oasis' Noel
Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   And now he's working with Costello, who at 43 roughly belongs to
my generation the same way the 69-year-old Bacharach roughly
belongs to my father's. The songwriters are kindred spirits:
musically eclectic, seeking new challenges, obsessed in many ways
with the misfires of love. At its best, this music tugs at your
heart even before you realize that you're humming along with it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the sort of stuff that will get easy radio exposure;
you'll have to seek the album out. It's worth the hunt, not just
because it's a good CD, but because it provides a gateway to
Bacharach's REALLY good older stuff. And with that Rhino set due
out next month, it's the perfect time to reopen the door to
Bacharach's world.

ADVICE TO THE NEW PARENTS: ENJOY HER WHILE YOU CAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of my colleagues became parents for the first time Sunday
night. Husband and wife both work at the newspaper, and it was a
hoot watching the progress of the pregnancy and the excitement in
the daddy-to-be's eyes when he would speak of the impending arrival
of his child, and hearing the elation in his voice several days
after his daughter's birth as he recounted the details of her
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever close friends have a new baby, there's a desire to pass
along some truly significant piece of advice that will stick with
them forever. All I could think of was, ``Enjoy the early years,
'cause once she hits puberty she won't be worth killing _ although
you'll give it serious thought from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly words to warm the cockles of a new parent's heart,
but true nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Nature's cruel joke on the parents of girls is called puberty.
That delightful bundle of love who used to crawl up in your lap at
every opportunity, who would run as fast as her little legs would
carry her to greet you when you arrived home, turns into a
venom-spewing, hormone-spawned creature from some dark, evil place.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, she looks like your child, and at times can still display
hints of her former sweet self _ usually when she wants something
that only you can provide. But the mood swings are instantaneous,
and the degree of anger and frustration almost inexplicable in its
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   What in a teen-ager's life can evoke that kind of rage?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is just about anything. Life is a tremendously
desperate experience for a 12-year-old girl. And 13-, and 14-, and
15- ...
</P>
<P>
   But fear not, new parents. The ultimate revenge cometh. It's
called grandchildren. If you're lucky, it will be several decades
in the making, but eventually you'll get to sit back and enjoy the
show.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Bob and Lisa, revel in the joy and fascination
that your new baby girl will bring. As Elizabeth Leland Davis
learns the ways of her new world from you, so too will you learn
from her. Cherish each moment of discovery that she makes _ from
the first time she really notices her perfect little fingers to her
growing affection for that favorite plush-toy companion _ or an
imaginary friend.
</P>
<P>
   My mother loves to tell the story of my sister's make-believe
friend, a turkey she named Murder. I kid you not. That might
forebode a twisted adulthood, but Kristi grew up to be a highly
intelligent, extremely talented teacher. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   As for Baby Libby, save every art project, every letter home
from camp, every photograph that documents the milestones of her
life _ birthdays, holidays, her first mud pie. You'll want to share
them with her when she is grown.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to capture the obligatory
naked-child-getting-into-the-bathtub photograph. It will be great
leverage for when she starts to date.
</P>
<P>
   You're probably spending a good deal of your time scrutinizing
every fold of skin, every fuzzy strand of hair on her head, the
length of her eyelashes, the way her mouth looks like a tiny,
upside-down butterfly, how she smells so ``new.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether she's 2 weeks or 20 years old, you will never tire of
tiptoeing to the door of her room to stand silently by, just to
watch her sleep. Enjoy it while you can.

CELEBRATING 20 YEARS OF SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They had to plead for donated postage stamps to
get out their message, but the dozen people who banded together in
crowded living rooms 20 years ago were determined to save the Los
Angeles Central Public Library from the wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   Their fight took two years, and they won.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with a $900,000 annual budget and a paid staff of seven,
the 6,000-member Los Angeles Conservancy is the largest historic
preservation group on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The group's track record speaks for itself: nearly three dozen
preservation successes, a more-than-90 percent win record.
</P>
<P>
   Even developers who do battle with the conservancy on a regular
basis can't deny it: That struggling group of a dozen has become a
power in the fabric of Los Angeles politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we never anticipated the evolution this far down the
line,'' said Margaret Bach, the group's founding president. ``We
never could have seen what we'd be in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the conservancy is simple: to preserve valuable
old buildings and neighborhoods, tangible storehouses of our city's
history and guides to Los Angeles' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a sentimental, knee-jerk reaction: `It's old,
it's worth protection','' Bach assured. ``We continue to applaud
the sensible growth and development of the city. But we need to
have a sense of the past, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to save a building only to let it stand empty,
conservancy officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really want to keep the buildings in use as a vibrant part
of an urban landscape,'' Bach said.
</P>
<P>
   In fighting to preserve the library, for example, the
conservancy didn't object to demolition of a part of the building
so a new addition could be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because we want to have the best buildings saved, that
doesn't mean we want to put them all under glass,'' said Linda
Dishman, the conservancy's executive director. ``Sometimes change
is part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In its campaign to save the remnants of Los Angeles history, the
conservancy hasn't always made friends. Some developers have
complained that the group's demands would interfere with the use of
their property, or that preservation would be too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   And some city officials, wanting to shepherd projects to
fruition, have griped that the conservancy is too demanding, too
willing to drive up the cost of development to preserve features of
doubtful historic value.
</P>
<P>
   But John Molloy, head of the city's Redevelopment Agency, said
that while the agency and the conservancy have faced off many
times, they do not see themselves as enemies or even as permanent
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time we are partners,'' Molloy said.
``Occasionally, a development opportunity will come along with
which we'll not see eye to eye on some aspect of historical
development, and we have to respectfully disagree. But that goes
with the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Differences of opinion prevail over one of the conservancy's
latest causes, St. Vibiana's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   The church at Second and Main streets was built in 1876 as the
Archdiocese of Monterey and Los Angeles' first cathedral. But when
the 1994 Northridge Earthquake took its toll on St. Vibiana's, the
archdiocese started laying the groundwork for demolition.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until the conservancy stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Redevelopment Agency and Mayor Richard Riordan's
support for Cardinal Roger Mahony's decision to tear down the
cathedral and build anew on the same grounds, the conservancy's
four-year campaign to preserve the church has made headway.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles agreed
to build a new cathedral elsewhere and to let the conservancy try
to find a buyer who will preserve the old structure _ perhaps as a
hotel or an office building. But Molloy doubts the group will be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the cost involved, I don't know if we'll ever be
able to see anything there that's economical (to develop),'' Molloy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Archdiocese spokesman Father Gregory Coiro _ who characterized
the archdiocese's relationship with the conservancy as alternately
``adversarial'' and ``amicable'' _ is equally doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They very much want that building to be preserved _ and in the
meantime, it's standing there red-tagged,'' Coiro said. ``It's not
a healthy thing to remain there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dishman acknowledges that the Conservancy has sometimes raised
hackles but said the group simply wants the city and developers to
adhere to preservation guidelines set down for communities
nationwide by the U.S. Department of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   And, she said, while one issue may provoke a spirited fight,
another issue may find the conservancy on the same side as an
earlier foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have good relationships with the city, with a number of
developers, and I think much of being able to accomplish things in
this city is relationships,'' said Dishman. ``We don't want to
alienate anybody. We just want to save buildings, and I think we
have a good history of compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Some former adversaries even become fans.
</P>
<P>
   Philip MacDonald of Irvine, owner of the Bob's Big Boy
restaurant on Riverside Drive in Burbank, was one of the
conservancy's biggest enemies in 1992, when the group forced
historic-site status on the 1949 eatery. The restaurant was failing
economically, and MacDonald was considering tearing it down and
selling the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt they were telling us what to do with our property, and
nobody likes being told what to do,'' MacDonald said. ``But in
retrospect, (the decision) forced us to deal with the property in a
more aggressive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald terminated a 20-year lease with Marriott, hired a
Marriott defector to run the hamburger joint and remodeled inside
and out, adding weekend car hops and enticing local car clubs to
use the restaurant as headquarters for Friday cruise nights. Last
year, more than 600,000 customers chowed down on burgers and fries
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I owe it all to the L.A. Conservancy,'' MacDonald said
with a laugh. ``They got me in the restaurant business. Right now,
there's nothing I could do that would even compare to the
restaurant. Business is off the charts. It's been a real success
story.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of victory the conservancy relishes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the group can't win compliance any other way, it's
prepared to go to court, as it has three times in its 20-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   A 1988 courtroom challenge to a Redevelopment Agency policy on
transfer of development rights was settled short of a trial,
resulting in rules that encourage developers to preserve old
buildings rather than tear them down.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1989 fight to save the Ambassador Hotel, site of the 1968
assassination of presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, the
conservancy forced the Los Angeles Unified School District to
prepare a new environmental impact report that has so far halted
plans to build a new high school on the site.
</P>
<P>
   And its most recent court battle over the fate of St. Vibiana's
Cathedral, has, for the time being, succeeded in preventing
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   For a group that started as a dozen conservationists in a city
notoriously _ but erroneously _ known for having little history,
the Conservancy has been a busy bunch. And they say their work's
not nearly done yet.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the city's earliest buildings _ adobe structures,
made of mud bricks _ ``just sort of melted away'' with age and
disuse, many buildings erected from the mid-1860s to the 1930s
still stand, Dishman said.
</P>
<P>
   And often, they stand on a spot where a developer wants to put a
parking garage or strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   So the conservancy keeps watch over the old buildings _
including more than 400 city-designated landmarks _ determined to
hang on to these structures that document Los Angeles' growth from
desert town to worldwide icon.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen of the old landmarks were felled by the
wrecker's ball before the conservancy took root in 1978. Among the
lost ones are the 1929 downtown Richfield Building, considered the
greatest example of art deco architecture in the city, demolished
in 1968, and the Dodge House, a 1916 private West Hollywood home
considered a design masterpiece, demolished in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But once the 1926 Central Library building had been saved from
demolition, the handful of historic-minded people decided to stick
together to tackle other preservation issues.
</P>
<P>
   The group, whose members pay from $20 (for students) to $2,500
(for corporations) to belong, is now ranked as one of the top
preservation organizations in the nation, said Elizabeth Goldstein,
director of the Western Office of the National Trust for Historic
Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservancy isn't resting on its laurels.
</P>
<P>
   It's joined South Pasadena and El Sereno residents in fighting
the extension of the Long Beach Freeway (710) through their quiet
neighborhoods. And it's working to convince the developer of a
strip of Sunset Boulevard to preserve historic features of the
Cinerama Dome theater.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, the conservancy will be at City Hall promoting
a City Council resolution that would prohibit property owners from
tearing down old buildings until a plan for a replacement is
approved.
</P>
<P>
   And in late November, the conservancy plans to release a
detailed proposal for the revitalization of a three-mile strip of
the Broadway Theater District, urging development of loft
apartments above the theaters and, in between theaters, more retail
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's always St. Vibiana's to try to sell to a compliant
developer.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy is also looking outside downtown for future
preservation projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the Valley is going to be an important part of our
future,'' Dishman said. ``So much has happened in the Valley since
World War II. And you need some distance to provide a context for
evaluation. We're just beginning to see what's worth preserving
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among structures ripe for saving are the Valley Municipal
Building on Sylvan Street in Van Nuys, an early Cadillac
dealership, some historic homes, some strip malls along Ventura
Boulevard reminiscent of early streamlined design, and some old
businesses with early neon signs.
</P>
<P>
   So, as the conservancy plans to mark its 20th anniversary Sunday
at the Memorial Coliseum in Exposition Park, its members are
reflecting on the past but looking toward a busy future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big agenda,'' said Dishman. ``We're not done yet. In
a perfect world, we would never have to fight to save a building,
but I don't see that happening in the near future.''

GLENN, DISCOVERY ASTRONAUTS REHEARSE LAUNCH COUNTDOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Mercury astronaut John Glenn, flanked by
a half-dozen younger space travelers, scrambled aboard the shuttle
Discovery on Friday to rehearse the launch countdown scheduled for
late this month.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old U.S. senator was alert and eager despite the
early hour. Glenn and his colleagues awoke before sunrise to don
bulky pressure suits for the 10-mile ride to the launch pad aboard
NASA's gleaming Astrovan, just as they are slated to do Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who became the first American to orbit the Earth on Feb.
20, 1962, as part of a Cold War-era moon race with the former
Soviet Union, is preparing for a mission aboard Discovery. The
three hours spent strapped aboard their spacecraft closed out a
week of launch drills for the shuttle crew and marked one of the
final milestones in an eight-month training regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really looking forward to this,'' Glenn assured the dozens
of news reporters who gathered at Kennedy to follow the seldom
covered exercises required of all shuttle crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I was scared to death I might catch a cold or
something and might be replaced,'' Glenn said of the
suspense-filled weeks leading up to his Mercury mission. ``I feel
that same way right now.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, NASA shuttle managers will gather in Florida for a
thorough review of Discovery's launch and mission preparations.
They are likely to formally approve the Oct. 29 launch date
established when Glenn was named to the flight crew in January,
said agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was the sixth of Curt Brown's crew to board Discovery
following the commander, pilot Steve Lindsey, mission specialist
Steve Robinson, European Space Agency astronaut Pedro Duque and
Japanese astronaut Chiaki Mukai. Flight engineer Scott Parazynski
was the last.
</P>
<P>
   Though a national hero, Glenn ranks low in the shuttle's chain
of command, a point he attempts to stress each time he is
questioned about his flight.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was seated on the shuttle's lower deck, below and out of
the view of the flight deck. He has no window. Other than to
confirm to ground controllers that his communications systems are
working, Glenn has been instructed to say little during the
countdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payload specialist 2, loud and clear,'' Glenn barked on the
occasions he was asked for a voice check of his communications
gear.
</P>
<P>
   Payload specialists are considered as non-professional
astronauts, experts who fly on the shuttle to participate in
research efforts that NASA would rather not ask its own shuttle
corps to undertake.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will serve primarily as a subject in a range of medical
experiments designed to investigate similarities between the
stresses of space flight and aging.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will furnish medical specimens and data that may furnish
new insights into bone and muscle deterioration that occurs in
astronauts. Other experiments will look into balance, sleep and
immune system disorders that bother the elderly and that astronauts
experience temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   As Friday's mock countdown lapsed into its final moments,
Brown's crew rehearsed the escape procedures they would follow if
the shuttle's explosive fuel system ruptures or a fire starts.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers scrambled from Discovery's hatch when informed by
launch controllers their unfueled rocket engines had ignited then
shut down abruptly with three seconds until lift off.
</P>
<P>
   Once outside the shuttle, the astronauts marched 100 feet across
the metal gantry of their launch pad to seven metal baskets 200
feet above the ground. Though not required to do so Friday, in a
real emergency the astronauts would dive into the baskets for a 21
second slide down a 1,200 foot long cable to the base of the launch
pad.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the nature of an actual emergency, escaping
astronauts would either sprint into a concrete reinforced
underground bunker or hop into an armored personnel carrier to
drive to one of the surrounding helicopter pads for final
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   The cage-slide portion of the escape has not been used in 91
previous shuttle launches.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is deemed by NASA to be physically qualified for such an
escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are physical requirements that every one has to pass,
regardless of age. John has passed all of those with flying
colors,'' said Rick Linnehan, a veteran astronaut who serves on
NASA's shuttle crew support team at Kennedy. &QL;

TOURS TAKE IN ORNATE, HISTORIC BUILDINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Downtown Los Angeles isn't all modern
glass-and-steel buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Look up and you'll see terra cotta angels, art deco entryways,
Greek columns and rococo cornices carefully decorating a downtown
that was built largely between the 1880s and the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, the Los Angeles Conservancy organized its first tour to
spread awareness of the architectural features that abound
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Saturday walkabouts draw as many as 100 people.
Tourists are among them, but surprisingly, more than half the
tour-takers are Southern California residents who marvel at the
ornate structures so close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their reaction is surprise,'' said docent Joe Spencer of West
Los Angeles, who has been leading tours for 15 years. ``We have a
lot of people who were afraid even to go downtown. They go (on
tours), and they come out alive and they see that it's beautiful.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a late autumn afternoon, the sun was pouring
through the broad windows in Dr. Pat Wexler's office, the decor of
which can best be described as French provincial meets the Museum
of Modern Art's design store.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wexler, the dermatologist, was sitting behind an antique
desk, wearing a brown dress, jacket, and sling-backs from Bergdorf
Goodman. ``They're so Blahnik, aren't they?'' she said, holding one
of her pale feet aloft. She is a well-tended 47-year-old woman with
skin like creme fraiche and a personality as soothing as
buttermilk.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her last client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my, she was demanding,'' Dr. Wexler said, describing her
last patient on this afternoon as a high-maintenance Russian
beauty. ``She wants everything done to her, and I told her there
was just nothing more to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wexler has earned a reputation for being a skin genie as
well as a comfy, if sometimes stern, Jewish mother. She does
everyone: Hollywood starlets, Manhattan judges, corporate
chieftains and Upper East Side matrons. They turn to her for her
skill wielding a Botox needle and because she is willing to stare
into a patient's eyes, grasp her hand, and say, ``Honey, you just
don't need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress Ellen Barkin, who gets facial peels at Dr. Wexler's
office as often as she can, even though she lives in Los Angeles,
said: ``I talk to her at least once a week. I consult with her on
everything and consider her not only one of my closest friends, but
also my primary doctor.'' Ms. Barkin said she does not go to Dr.
Wexler for one of her better-known specialties, liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   On a side table in Dr. Wexler's office sits a stack of
coffee-table books: Judith Leiber's ``The Art of the Handbag,''
Gary Goldschneider's ``The Secret Language of Relationships: Your
Complete Personology Guide to Any Relationship With Anyone'' and
Faith Popcorn's ``Clicking.''
</P>
<P>
   In the corner of her office, dangling from the handlebars of a
sparkling Schwinn stationary bicycle is a black patent-leather
purse. On the walls are photographs by Sally Gall, Amy Arbus and
Cindy Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a girl, she's a girlfriend, she's reassuring and she's
calming,'' Ms. Barkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wexler began her career as an internist, specializing in
infectious diseases. But after deciding that it was too emotionally
wearing to treat seriously ill patients, she went back for a
residency in dermatology. She opened an office in Greenwich Village
in the early 1980s, and began her practice treating models. Now she
has two children, a urologist husband and a client list that
includes 10,000 patients _ and lots of theories about aging and the
onset of midlife crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-three is really when you start to look in the mirror and
think, `Oh my, that's my mother,''' Dr. Wexler said, examining her
own outstretched hands. ``Most of my patients come in miserable at
43.'' These days, Dr. Wexler also treats many men and has theories
on them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For men, the big turning points are 40 and 60,'' she said.
``For women, they're 30 and 50. For some reasons, marriages break
up on even decades like 20 and 30 years, not 25 years. I don't know
why. But then the men get out and they're 60 and they really think
that the 30-year-old woman wants them! What a laugh.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like many dermatologists, in recent years Dr. Wexler has picked
up some practices from the field of plastic surgery, like
liposuction. On men, she'll liposuction their love handles and
Botox their brows. On women, she does everything, from liposuction
to glycolic facial peels to administering Botox and plumping lips
with collagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Botox is like grooming now. It's socially acceptable, even
expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Poring over her before-and-after book, she was frank about the
beautification process. ``This is a 50-year-old woman,'' she said,
pointing at a picture of a nude woman with a paunchy belly. On the
next page was a photo of the same woman, with a flat stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman can wear a suit,'' she said, pointing to the flat
tummy. ``And this woman can wear a muumuu. See the difference?''
</P>
<P>
   She won't disclose her patient list, although it includes famous
actresses, politicians, judges and models. Dr. Wexler did admit to
treating ``Donna'' (meaning Donna Karan) and ``Streisand.'' ``But
that came from them, not me,'' she said, pointing to a framed
article from W magazine hanging on an examination-room wall that
mentioned the two women. Beside it, mounted like diplomas, are
articles from Allure and Tatler.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment, or even a conversation, with Dr. Wexler does not come
cheap. Just to sit down and talk to Dr. Wexler costs $350. Botox
treatments start at $500; maintenance injections are required every
few months. Liposuction starts at $2,500 and can cost as much as
$11,000. Collagen and laser treatments run from $4,000 to $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wexler said her waiting list is three months long. If a
patient calls, the receptionist will kindly explain that the doctor
is mostly concentrating on cosmetic surgery these days. If it's
urgent, she'll try and sneak you in in late November. Last year,
after realizing that her pool of patients was enough to keep her
busy for quite a while, she stopped seeing new patients at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People got mad, that's for sure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barkin said: ``I can understand why. I'm utterly dependent
on her.''

EGAN TACKELS `TRUE WEST' WITH SKILL, ENTHUSIASM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The task would daunt a less energetic, ambitious or cocksure
reporter: To somehow sum up the state of the American West today,
in all its frustrating and contradictory complexity, and accomplish
this formidable task in a serious, thoughtful book of less than 250
pages.
</P>
<P>
   But Timothy Egan of Seattle is not daunted by the size of a
story or what it takes to capture it. As readers of his 1990
Northwest classic, ``The Good Rain,'' and his prominent journalism
in The New York Times have come to learn, Egan is a reporter from
the REI School of Journalism, an intrepid and relentless news-hound
in hiking boots and Gore-Tex who is eager to ford any stream, climb
any peak, hike any trail, track down any interview subject, no
matter how reclusive, to get what he needs onto the page.
</P>
<P>
   Egan again demonstrates his considerable skills in getting the
story and telling it, too, in his new book, ``Lasso the Wind: Away
to the New West.'' This is an immensely entertaining and
informative tour through the 11 contiguous states west of the 100th
meridian, a fast-paced mix of ground-pounding reporting today and
often-overlooked Western history.
</P>
<P>
   It is also vintage Egan, or at least vintage book-version Egan,
filled with engaging first-person narrative that displays
unrestrained enthusiasm for what he sees as the delights of nature
(backpacking, fly-fishing, climbing) and of humankind (zinfandel,
baseball, cigars, Eric Clapton, Walla Walla sweets).
</P>
<P>
   As touched upon in his brief introduction, Egan's goal is to
uncover the ``true West'' (a phrase borrowed from playwright Sam
Shepard). His method is to devote each chapter to a Western place,
to sample its nature, highlight its history, to meet its people, to
examine its present conflicts and to offer a few conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Egan's training in objective news reporting (at the
Post-Intelligencer before The New York Times), however, seems
somewhat of a handicap when it comes to book-writing. He has a
dazzling ability to capture a place or a person in telling words
and details. But Egan, 43, seems less comfortable at interpreting
his material in much depth or spinning continuing narrative threads
throughout the book.
</P>
<P>
   So the chapters in ``Lasso the Wind'' read more like stand-alone
essays than connected sections of a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Some common themes do emerge, as Egan immerses himself in such
varied locales as Las Vegas; the Grand Canyon; Butte, Mont.;
Sunnyside, Wash.; Joseph, Ore.; and Escalante, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic struggle,'' Egan writes, ``is between the West of
possibility and the West of possession.''
</P>
<P>
   For too long, the West and its abundant wonders have been abused
as if there is no tomorrow (which too often came true). Forests
were wasted, resources squandered, animals slaughtered, rivers
dammed, unsuitable animals (cattle) introduced. And groups of human
beings, when they have encountered each other in the West over the
past four centuries, often have exhibited their absolute worst
behavior _ lying, stealing, pillaging, hating, murdering.
</P>
<P>
   No example of this may be more blood-chilling than Egan's
account of a long-covered-up 1857 massacre of California-bound
wagon train families by Mormons in Mountain Meadows, Utah. All
told, 157 men, women and children were tricked into believing they
were being saved from Indians but soon were set upon and executed
at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Egan is an optimist by nature, shunning gloom and doom in a time
when many others see the West as astride the direst of straits,
with the remaining unspoiled land imperiled by runaway growth.
</P>
<P>
   Among Egan's most surprising observations is that the West is
now ``the most urban area in the country'' since ``86 percent of
all Westerners live in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Egan remains encouraged about the West and its future,
seizing on such developments as the rebound of the American River
in California, the reintroduction of wolves and bison into open
spaces, the return of the Nez Perce Indians to their homeland in
Oregon, the growth of a multicultural society in central
Washington's agricultural country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corrective is under way,'' Egan concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lasso the Wind'' is an impressive response to a daunting
assignment, perhaps not quite the book it might have been, but a
solid and welcome addition to Western writing nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, it is sad to note that Egan's accomplishment is
undermined by the carefree editing and fact-checking too prevalent
in publishing today. These shortcomings include nagging matters of
style and voice, but also more serious errors of fact (Terry
Tempest Williams writes non-fiction not poetry).
</P>
<P>
   Most inexcusable of all is Egan's assertion that Ernest
Hemingway shot himself with a pistol. It was a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Lasso the Wind. By Timothy Egan. Alfred A. Knopf. 247 pages. $25

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TOKYO _ By 5 a.m., the world's biggest fish market is going
full throttle, alive with the noisy off-loading of 450 kinds of
seafood and the banter of thousands of wholesalers, middlemen and
restaurant owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn pallor, men in rubber galoshes creep through the
mist rising from endless rows of frozen tuna. It would be hard to
mistake these buyers, inspecting the three-foot carcasses with
metal prods and flashlights, for the high-flying bidders at an art
auction. But Japanese take their fish very seriously, and when the
beefy, tank-topped auctioneers call out bids at Tokyo Central
Wholesale Market, the stakes can be just as high as at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan muddles through its recession, even sushi, the ultimate
Japanese gastronomical obsession, is taking a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Next to rice, fish is perhaps Japan's most basic foodstuff, and
the decline in fish sales has paralleled the nation's economic
slump. Five years ago, the market sold $20.6 million of seafood
each day; this year sales dropped to $14.7 million. A single,
top-quality tuna to be served raw once commanded $20,000; on a
recent visit, the big earner was a 385-pound tuna for $8,346.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy has now contracted for three straight quarters,
and in this climate of anxiety, all but the wealthiest Japanese are
now saving instead of spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst I've seen in 40 years in this business,''
said Makoto Ishida, managing director of Tohto Suisan Co. Ltd., an
auction house at the market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, compared with the height of the bubble economy 10 years
ago, ``price and volume is about 30 to 40 percent down,'' he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan's halcyon days of the 1980s, many people splurged on
the finest delicacies; the most conspicuous consumers sprinkled
gold leaf on their sushi before eating it. Today, while Japanese
staunchly resist cutting sushi out of their diets, many are looking
for ways to adjust their appetites.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this recession, many people are downsizing their
eating, cutting back or eating cheaper sushi,'' said Hirotoshi
Kosode, a senior auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper fish is selling more, more expensive fish is selling
less, and some shops are selling cheaper fish, but charging the
same,'' he said darkly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cut-rate sushi bars are booming, stealing business
from moderate establishments by catering to gourmands adapting to
leaner times. Chefs at the priciest ``sushiyas,'' meanwhile, are
guarding clientele by maintaining top quality, and confide
gratefully that not everyone has run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, lower-quality sushi at ``rotation''
restaurants, where customers serve themselves from a conveyor belt
and pay by the number of plates, has a new appeal. Many snubbed
those restaurants in the profligate 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is the all-you-can-eat philosophy, promoted by
the Edokko Zushi chain of restaurants, which offers enormous
portions of high-quality fish at low prices. In a no-frills
environment, Edokko profits from high volume by moving customers
through fast and limiting drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Japanese people, sushi is very traditional and very
important compared to any other food. So even if normal people
can't get expensive stuff, we can still afford to buy cheap
sushi,'' Ishida said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirako Haruko, the owner of the medium-priced Kitahama sushi
bar, arrived early at the wholesale market so she could get the
best fish from middlemen. She said that the number of her customers
has dropped 30 percent since last year, and that each one eats less
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't buy lower quality,'' she sniffed indignantly at the
suggestion that she economize, saying its more important to
preserve the reputation of her 47-year-old family-run restaurant.
``I prefer that my salary is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Reputation and quality are the mainstays of high-end
restaurants, like Sushi Kyubey, whose outlet at the Hotel Okura has
served the rich and famous for years. Here, the cheapest fare is a
12-gram piece of octopus sashimi for $2.30, while the dearest is a
tiny, mouth-melting morsel of fatty tuna belly &UR;  &LR; for $11.50. Dinner
for one costs about $150 without drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Head chef Makoto Shigihara says the price reflects not only the
highest-quality fish _ a slab of the best tuna breast costs the
restaurant $300 to $600 _ but also stringent quality control, with
two shifts of workers cutting, feeling and tasting the fish, and
sending it back if it's not the finest.
</P>
<P>
   Shigihara admits his is a ``high-society'' restaurant that has
catered to prime ministers and visiting dignitaries, including
President Clinton, who the chef recalls favored maguro tuna and
steamed abalone. But he said that instead of ``expecting customers
to just shut up and eat it ... we make sure the customer is
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shigihara says he buys the best fish in town. He says some
regulars stayed away for a few months to try cheaper locales, but
many are back, because ``once you get used to sushi that suits your
tongue, it's very difficult to adjust your tastebuds just because
of price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushi is practical and there's no waste,'' Shigihara said.
``You order what you want to eat, you eat everything you order, and
you pay for what you eat. It suits the Japanese lifestyle. That's
why maybe not every sushi restaurant is doing well, but ours still
is.''

<P>
   After years of lagging behind pure equity funds, balanced mutual
funds are suddenly looking a lot more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced funds, which hold a mixture of stocks and bonds, tend
to underperform during bull markets, but their bond holdings can
salvage some returns when equities head south. Think of them as a
good hedge against an overheated stock market or a global
recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time risk is that high in equities, it's always a good
idea to look at less risky alternatives, and balanced funds fall
into that category,'' said Norman G. Fosback, editor of the Mutual
Fund Forecaster, a newsletter in Deerfield Beach, Fla. ``Balanced
funds, as a class, are extremely attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the class includes a lot of individual differences. Some
balanced funds are split between two managers _ one for the stock
assets, one for the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The funds can also have a fixed or variable asset split and
enormously different objectives. The first trick in picking a
balanced fund is to understand its exposure to the stock market as
well as its interest-rate risk from bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The average balanced fund lost 6.7 percent in the third quarter
_ a return not so good as the 1.8 percent gain for the average bond
fund but far better than the 13.4 percent slide of the average
stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced funds are about half as volatile as stock mutual funds
_ but for unwary investors, certain balanced funds may be riskier
than a conservative stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some balanced funds are not very balanced. Portfolio
managers may make big bets on the stock market, or even on certain
types of stocks. Avondale Total Return, for example, has almost 86
percent of its assets in stocks and just 9 percent in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Berger Balanced fund, by contrast, has 50 percent of its
assets in stocks, 18 percent in bonds and the rest in cash. In a
down market, such differences between funds can produce a vast gulf
in results. For the year through Sept. 30, Avondale's 1.7 percent
return was far below Berger's 13.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The types of stocks in a balanced fund can also throw
performance out of kilter. Consider the Smith Barney Security and
Growth fund, which has a nearly 50-50 split between stocks and
bonds. The fund may look evenly balanced, but the majority of its
stock holdings are in small companies, which are getting hammered
in this market _ as is the fund, down 9.4 percent through the third
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   While balanced funds as a group are known for their stability,
certain funds still change the weightings in their portfolios
radically and quickly. Provident Investment Counsel Pinnacle
Balanced, for example, has cut its stock holdings to about 62
percent, from 74 percent in July, according to Jeffrey Miller,
managing director of the fund. It has returned 12.7 percent this
year through Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance Growth Investors is another balanced fund that has
unloaded stocks. Nicholas D. Carn, the portfolio manager, recently
cut his equity holdings to 55 percent, from 68 percent in July and
82 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the high stock exposure is one of the things that
has helped our performance'' in the bull market, he said. The fund
returned 5 percent in the first three quarters. Investors looking
for a less risky balanced fund, he said, can put their money in
Alliance Conservative Investors, which has only about 23 percent of
its holdings in stocks and returned 6.8 percent in the period.
</P>
<P>
   While bonds give these funds more stability, they have their own
risks. The longer the bonds' maturities, the higher the
interest-rate risk. Long-term bonds usually pay higher interest
rates than short-term bonds, but if rates rise, a fund dominated by
long-term bonds is locked in at a lower rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have fallen recently because investors, fearing
that the economic collapses of Asia and Russia might spread, have
retreated to the safety of the United States Treasury bond market.
That has driven up prices, pushing down yields, which move in the
opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced funds can hold many different types of bonds _
corporate and municipal, as well as Treasury _ with varying
maturities. The Mainstay Total Return B fund, for example, is
holding bonds with an average maturity of 13.2 years, while
Avondale Total Return is holding short-term debt with an average
maturity of two years.
</P>
<P>
   For the first three quarters, Mainstay's 7.8 percent gain beat
Avondale's return by more than 6 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balanced funds are usually sold as conservative investments,
but if you've got a fund that is concentrated in small stocks and
long-term bonds, you don't have a conservative product,'' said
Steve M. Lipper, senior vice president at Lipper Analytical
Services, the research firm in Summit, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund experts caution investors to read the current and
past semiannual reports to see what kind of securities a fund is
holding and the changes the portfolio has made.
</P>
<P>
   An investor's tax bracket will also influence her choice of
balanced mutual funds. One option for investors in the top brackets
is USAA Growth and Tax Strategy, a fund with about 51 percent of
its assets in tax-free bonds and 49 percent in growth stocks. It
returned 2.8 percent in the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is always another option. Sheldon Jacobs,
editor of the No Load Fund Investor, a newsletter in Irvington,
N.Y., recommends that investors do their own portfolio balancing by
buying separate stock and bond funds. That, he said, gives them
more control over the amount and types of stocks they are holding
and enables them to plan their tax gains and losses more
effectively.

ISRAEL'S NETANYAHU TO APPOINT SECURITY HAWK SHARON AS FOREIGN
MINISTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a move that sent conflicting signals about
prospects for peace with the Palestinians, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Friday said he would appoint security hawk Ariel
Sharon as his new foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, now minister of national infrastructure, would start his
new job after the Cabinet votes on the appointment next week,
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized Sharon as ``the most appropriate man'' for
foreign minister. Netanyahu himself has held the post since
January, when David Levy resigned in protest over the slow pace of
peace negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a wealth of experience, creativity and a proven
track record,'' Netanyahu said. ``And I think he knows well the
damage of war and the fruits of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the West Bank town of Hebron, violence continued
for a second day between Palestinian stone throwers and Israeli
soldiers as hundreds of Arab mourners gathered for the funeral of a
21-year-old protester killed in clashes on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Jordan Valley, a 19-year-old female Israeli soldier
was stabbed to death while standing outside a Jewish settlement.
The assailant, a Palestinian, was shot by setters and taken to a
hospital in Jerusalem. His motives were not known, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's appointment to the foreign ministry was lambasted by
Israel's left-wing opposition and by some Palestinians as a sign
that Netanyahu doesn't want to make strides in peace talks with
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Others were more positive.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's move comes only days before Israelis and Palestinians
are expected to make their first progress toward peace in months.
The negotiations have stumbled for 19 months, but now appear to be
on the brink of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Netanyahu is set to meet Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat at the Wye Plantation outside Washington to
discuss a land-for-security deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps it means Netanyahu has made up his mind to go along
with this withdrawal,'' said Aryeh Naor, who was Israeli cabinet
secretary under former Prime Minister Menachem Begin twenty years
ago. He was referring to the Israeli troop pullback from 13 percent
of West Bank territory that will be on the table at next week's
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A self-styled warrior-politician who raises sheep on a ranch in
the Negev desert, Sharon has wielded considerable behind-the-scenes
power in Netanyahu's right-wing government since it came to power
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign minister, Sharon would move out of the shadows of
power and into direct negotiations with the Palestinians on a final
peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A leading critic of the peace accords signed with the
Palestinians and a vocal opponent of the proposal for a pullback of
Israeli troops from 13 percent of the West Bank, analysts suggest
Sharon may be a bigger threat to Netanyahu if he is left out of the
decision-making process than if he is let in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Sharon is the most dangerous politician for Netanyahu in
the coming elections,'' Naor said.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment caps a remarkable comeback for a man who was
disgraced and ousted from politics 15 years ago after an internal
government probe found him indirectly responsible for a Christian
Lebanese massacre of Palestinians during his tenure as defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has slowly moved back into politics with the
support of security hawks and religious Jews, particularly those
living in settlements in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime champion of the settlements, Sharon maneuvered to
create a new ministry of national infrastructure under Netanyahu
that would allow him to help the controversial communities grow.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, some Parliament members praised his appointment as a
step that would strengthen settlements. But skeptical settlers said
the move was meant to appease them just before Israel made
territorial concessions that would endanger their existence.
</P>
<P>
   When rumors of his appointment began, Sharon said that he would
not shake Arafat's hand during negotiations because he considered
the Arab leader a ``terrorist'' and a ``war criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, he said through a spokesman that he would work to
further Israel's platform of peace with security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that in my role as foreign minister, I can assist in
advancing Israel's policy which is striving towards peace while
maintaining and protecting Israel's national and security
interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinians say privately that Sharon may be the only one
capable of delivering Israel's vociferous right-wing, which is
vehemently opposed to any further territorial compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one characterization of Sharon suggests they may
not relish the thought of working so closely with a man they
consider to have more blood on his hands than any other Israeli
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud Abbas wrote that the former army
general was the ``cruelest and most hostile of Israelis'' in his
book ``Through Secret Channels,'' a chronicle of the peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon is a personality in search of a leadership role,''
Abbas wrote. ``His ambitions greatly outweigh his personal and
political abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Sharon will help or hinder agreements with the
Palestinians, events in Hebron on Friday underscored the fact that
peace is still elusive here five years after initial peace accords
were signed.
</P>
<P>
   In the midday heat, hundreds of Palestinians marched through
this divided city on their way to bury Amjad Natshe, a Jordanian
citizen shot by soldiers during violent demonstrations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hooded youths, some with machine guns, protested for a a second
day, chanting slogans opposing Jewish settlements and the peace
accords their leaders signed with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's pro-peace Fatah party had called the march to protest a
curfew clamped on Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled
part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fatah is fed up with the situation in Hebron,'' said Abdallah
Hishami, a 20-year-old Fatah supporter. The march, the first one of
its kind called by Fatah, was seen as a sign that peace agreements
were being questioned even by Arafat's most ardent followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fed up with an agreement that puts thousands of us under
curfew for days,'' Hishami said. ``How can we have peace when there
are settlers in the city and the army continues to kill our
people?''
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1997, Palestinians have ruled 80 percent of
Hebron, where most of the city's 120,000 Arabs live. Israeli rules
the other 20 percent, where some 400 militant settlers are lodged
in five tiny enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Palestinian youths gathered at the border dividing
the Jewish and Arab sides of the city, where they pelted Israeli
soldiers with stones. The soldiers sat outside a security fence
that leads to the Jewish enclaves and shot back with rubber bullets
and tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Israel-controlled sector, some 20,000
Palestinians seethed under a curfew for the tenth day. &QL;

 A LAID-BACK BUDDHIST-SEMIOTIC LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
(lb) 
 By DANY LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a rainy Thursday evening two days after the
release of Duncan Sheik's second album, he was padding barefoot
around his guitar-strewn loft, muttering, ``This is insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik, 28, a singer-songwriter known as much for his boyish
looks and social calendar as for his contemplative pop music, meant
his phone, which kept ringing. An executive at Atlantic Records
called to discuss Sheik's appearance the day before on ``Late Night
With Conan O'Brien.'' Then there were calls to coordinate plans
with friends to meet later at Surya, an Indian bistro in Greenwich
Village.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik is a sleepy-eyed native of South Carolina with mod
sideburns and an unlikely British lilt to his voice, who studied
semiotics at Brown University. There he fell in with what would one
day be a junior jet set, including Alexander Von Furstenberg and
his future wife, Alexandra Miller. These days, with the success of
the new album, ``Humming,'' he doesn't get out much.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, however, he was making a point of seeing ``Maria
de Buenos Aires,'' a tango opera at the Brooklyn Academy of Music,
with Gidon Kremer, a violinist he admires. But Sheik was in no
hurry. Dressed in low-slung jeans and a navy sweater, he ducked
between calls into the recording studio he has built in his
2,000-square-foot loft.
</P>
<P>
   There, Jihae, 23, a willowy aspiring singer and model, was
waiting to finish recording a song. When Jihae, who uses only a
single name, headed home to change, Sheik went to a liquor store
for a bottle of pinot grigio to drink while getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   After more phone calls and a change of clothes, he knelt at a
bedside Buddhist shrine between potted trees and chanted. ``It's an
abbreviated version of what I normally do,'' explained Sheik, who
said he had been practicing Buddhism for nine years. ``Call it a
speed chant.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally made his way to a waiting limousine and picked up
Jihae en route, unconcerned that they would miss half the
performance. Sheik and Jihae discussed Marilyn Manson (``He's like
a superhero of the '90s,'' Sheik said) and stardom. ``It's that
constant struggle _ art vs. commerce,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He left the performance in time to beat the crowds and meet his
friends. He arrived at Surya first for the 10 p.m. reservation and
was told the kitchen was closing. Sheik hurriedly ordered for the
whole party, all of whom straggled in by 11:30 for sea bass and
conversation about golf, the novel ``Silk'' and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   In Sheik's crowd, Thursday is not a party night. The consensus
was not to go on to the Bowery Bar. By midnight, everyone was
heading home. ``Ah, the vicissitudes of life,'' Sheik sighed,
looking heavy-lidded. The next morning he had a magazine photo
shoot. ``Ah, the deepness of Duncan,'' Jihae said.

THE TOYOTA TACOMA PRERUNNER IS ONLY HALF A TRUCK
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a
duck, the old saying goes, then it must be a duck.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the Toyota Tacoma PreRunner.
</P>
<P>
   This compact pickup looks like a serious four-wheel-drive, with
knobby tires, high ground clearance, a bold grille, large front
bumper and other off-road styling cues.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath, it's just half a truck. Yep, two-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you can get away with that in Texas and some other Sun
Belt states that have no really lousy weather and no really cool
places to go four-wheeling. This truck wouldn't sell well in
Denver, but it probably will do OK in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   My impression, though, is that it's more for show that action,
designed for the urban cowboy-wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at me in my cool new truck with the off-road tires and
suspension,'' it screams out to other motorists on the freeway
during the rush-hour commute. Just don't force me into a showdown
on the dusty trail, pardner. I won't make it as far as your real
four-wheeler will go.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this little truck has a lot going for it, especially if
you have no real need for four-wheel drive. I found the high ground
clearance a plus during last week's storms as I negotiated some
deep puddles.
</P>
<P>
   The price is certainly right: $17,238 plus $447 transportation
buys the basic extended-cab truck, complete with four-speed
automatic transmission (I told you it was citified), 2.7-liter
four-cylinder engine, air-conditioning, power steering and brakes,
styled steel wheels, deluxe AM/FM/cassette stereo, front bench
seat, front-facing rear jump seats and dual air bags.
</P>
<P>
   In press material provided with the PreRunner, Toyota explains
that the vehicle is designed to look like its four-wheel-drive
counterpart, the Tacoma SR5.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1998 PreRunner combines the rugged styling and off-road
performance of Toyota's four-wheel-drive pickups with the
affordability of a two-wheel-drive,'' the Toyota literature says.
That's a bit of a stretch, since the PreRunner doesn't really offer
all the performance of a four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   A pre-runner is a ``class of vehicle used to pre-run an off-road
race course and preserve the race vehicles from damage,'' Toyota
says, and the Tacoma PreRunner, introduced as a 1998 model, was
developed in conjunction with Toyota's desert racing-truck program.
</P>
<P>
   I've driven four-wheel-drive vehicles all over Baja, and I'd be
hard-pressed to take a two-wheel-drive over most of the routes I've
covered.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not making fun of this truck. I actually liked it, and I
know that most people who buy four-wheel drive never really use
that option. If you're among that group and you want a truck that
looks really cool but doesn't cost a bundle, then the PreRunner
might be just the thing.
</P>
<P>
   The four-cylinder engine cranks out a respectable 150 horsepower
and 177 foot-pounds of torque. It's slightly more powerful than the
142-horsepower, 2.4-liter four-banger that comes in the base
two-wheel-drive Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   This truck is so light that the four-cylinder offers plenty of
power for urban freeway driving as well as most light off-road
situations.
</P>
<P>
   I think, however, that if I were to buy a PreRunner, I would opt
for the 3.4-liter, 24- valve, twin-cam V-6, which brings 190
horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque. It's not really the extra
power I would be seeking with the V-6, however; you have to buy the
six-cylinder option to get a driver-controlled locking rear
differential, which could help you get through the muck in the
absence of four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   The off-road suspension of the PreRunner includes Bilstein shock
absorbers, progressive-rate front coil springs, rear leaf springs
and a large front stabilizer bar. Included are 15-inch Goodyear
off-road tires. The ride wasn't as rough as you would expect from a
pure off-road design; this is a comfortable and smooth-riding
commuter vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Our test model came with some extras that I could live without,
such as the aluminum-alloy wheels ($995), a convenience package
($710) that added tilt steering wheel, cruise control and
tachometer (who needs a tach with automatic transmission?), and
custom pinstripes ($66).
</P>
<P>
   Other options were welcome, including the power windows and door
locks for $470 (well, it is a city vehicle), bucket seats to
replace the three-across front bench ($70), and a $299 hard-plastic
bedliner, a real necessity to protect the finish of the bed if you
do much hauling.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker was $20,414.95, including transportation.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, the PreRunner was offered only in the extended-cab
version, but for '99, a regular-cab model is available. Most pickup
buyers prefer the extended models, though.
</P>
<P>
   Like most pickups these days, the PreRunner has a cut-off switch
for the passenger air bag, which allowed me to put a tiny tyke up
front in a rear-facing child seat. I did have the child seat in the
rear for a while, too, but that limits how far back you can slide
the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel economy was a respectable 20 miles per gallon in the
city and 24 on the highway. The tank holds 18 gallons of gas,
plenty for a week of urban commuting.
</P>
<P>
   The PreRunner is built at Toyota's plant in Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   JAG TO OFFER SMART CRUISE: Jaguar's new S-type sedan, which goes
on sale next spring, will be the first car in the United States to
offer a ``smart'' cruise control, which uses doppler radar to
measure the speed and distance of vehicles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   This system judges the relative position of the vehicle ahead
and adjusts your acceleration and braking to maintain a safe
distance between you and it. If there is no one ahead of you, the
car will cruise at the speed you set.
</P>
<P>
   The system will be built by General Motors' Delphi Automotive
Systems, and will initially be available only in a few markets,
Jaguar officials said. No price tag has been announced.

   ``You cannot imagine what I have done!'' Rodion Raskolnikov
shouts angrily at his best friend, Dmitri.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri (Eddie Marsan) pauses, looks his friend directly in the
eye and says, slowly, almost in a whisper, ``Yes, Rodya, I think I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were a few more quiet, subtle moments like that in the
new, two-hour version of Dostoyevsky's ``Crime and Punishment,''
NBC might have been able to hold its head up proudly. As it is,
viewers who tune in Sunday night may think they have the wrong
channel.
</P>
<P>
   The movie opens with an attempt to assassinate the czar (a scene
that is not in the book) and Raskolnikov's arrest as a dissident
(also not in the book, but it happened to Dostoyevsky).

<P>
   As Raskolnikov, Patrick Dempsey (whose previous roles include
the young Meyer Lansky and the young JFK) rants, raves, breathes
heavily, writhes with nightmares and frantically talks to himself
whenever he takes a walk. Ben Kingsley plays Porfiri, the
magistrate, as Lt. Columbo. Or maybe he just establishes that Peter
Falk was playing Columbo as Porfiri all these years.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of the 1866 novel certainly isn't too complicated for
prime time. A young student with money problems and ego issues
murders his neighborhood pawnbroker. Afterward he is racked with
guilt and pursued by a suspicious policeman. Meanwhile he frets
about his unmarried sister (who, it turns out, doesn't need his
financial help after all) and falls in love with a good-hearted
prostitute (whose love sees him through).
</P>
<P>
   Internal novels, those written largely in the voice inside a
character's head, have always been a challenge for filmmakers.
Sometimes the voice-over device works (Jeremy Irons in Evelyn
Waugh's ``Brideshead Revisited''). Sometimes it doesn't (too many
to count). This production doesn't take the chance. Having
Raskolnikov wander the streets of St. Petersburg muttering instead
isn't the problem; it would just be nice if he muttered something
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, his thoughts include revelations: ``It suddenly
became quite clear and self-evident to him that he had just told a
horrible lie, that not only now would there not be time for him to
have a good talk _ it was now out of the question for him to SPEAK
to anyone about anything ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NBC version, Dempsey mumbles nothing more profound than,
``They cannot know it was me,'' or, ``No, no, no, no, no.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's another thing. The screenwriter, David Stevens (whose
work ranges from the film ``Breaker Morant'' to the dreadful
mini-sequel ``The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years''), never lets a
character say something once when he or she can say it three or
four times. ``My sister will marry him because I cannot provide for
her,'' Raskolnikov grumbles at one point. ``I will not let it
happen, Dmitri. I will not let my sister sell herself for money.
No. I will stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   When his sister, Dunya (Lili Horvath), loses her job as a
governess, she pleads with her employer: ``Please. I beg you. I
need the job. We have no money.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way to condense a 600-page book?
</P>
<P>
   NBC should be applauded for the effort involved in bringing
19th-century Russian fiction to broadcast television. And for using
Dostoyevsky's name, which the powers that be had originally decided
against, for fear of scaring off bibliophobic viewers. But ``Crime
and Punishment'' is not only real literature; it's also far too
readable and accessible to need dumbing down.
</P>
<P>
   The sad part is that viewers may not be inspired to pick up the
book but will dismiss it, judging it by this anguished,
monosyllabic interpretation. For them, a crucial piece of
information: Dostoyevsky is in the details.

DICKINSON THEATRES CONSIDERING BUYOUT OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISSION, Kan. _ The owners of Dickinson Theatres will decide
soon whether to accept any of several offers to buy the movie
exhibitor or whether they even want to sell, a company spokesman
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Downs, spokesman for the family-owned company based in
Mission, wouldn't identify the bidders. He did say at least one is
a competing exhibitor and at least one is an investment group.
</P>
<P>
   Two investment firms that have been buying movie chains are
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Hicks Muse Tate &AMP; Furst. Those two
earlier this year bought Regal Cinemas, based in Knoxville, Tenn.,
and combined it with another chain, Act III. A similar deal to buy
Denver-based United Artists fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Other parties rumored to be interested are CineMark USA and
Carmike Cinemas.
</P>
<P>
   Downs wouldn't say why the Dickinson family was considering
selling the chain of 30-plus theaters with more than 200 screens.
But industry observers say that it might have stretched its
finances too tight in a competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, Dickinson has experienced brutal
competition, particularly from AMC Entertainment Inc., which is
based in Kansas City. On one day alone last December, AMC opened
three megaplexes with a total of 74 screens. That increased the
number of first-run screens in Kansas City by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Act III opened an 18-screen megaplex last year at Station
Casino Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Buchbinder, an analyst with George K. Baum &AMP; Co. who
follows the movie exhibition industry, said anyone considering
buying Dickinson might be trying to get it at a fire-sale price.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good time to try to sell anything, but if
(Dickinson) is hurting financially, they might take what they can
get,'' Buchbinder said. ``It just makes some sense that someone
might try to steal this thing away.''

MAN CHARGED WITH RAPE AFTER INCIDENT WITH 13-YEAR-OLD

   OLATHE, Kan. _ A Belton, Mo., man was charged Thursday with
having sexual contact with a 13-year-old Overland Park, Kan., girl
he allegedly met on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   John Michael Wells, 29, was charged in Johnson County District
Court with one felony count of rape.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Pro-tem Earle Jones followed the recommendations
of prosecutors and set a $50,000 bond. Wells posted the bond and
was released from the Johnson County Jail late Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kansas law, an adult who has sexual contact with a child
younger than 14 can be charged with rape even if there is no
allegation that force was used.
</P>
<P>
   Wells and the girl began communicating with each other in an
Internet chat room and agreed to meet this week in Johnson County,
Overland Park police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells allegedly drove to Overland Park on Tuesday afternoon and
picked the girl up after class at a Blue Valley School District
middle school. He is accused of having sexual contact with her in a
grocery store parking lot. He dropped her off near her home.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the girl told friends and the friends reported it to
a school resource officer. Police learned that Wells and the girl
were supposed to meet again Wednesday, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers arrested Wells about 4:15 p.m. Wednesday while he was
driving, allegedly looking for the girl for their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that Wells had no criminal record. He faces a
sentence of about 16 years in prison if convicted.

SPENDING IS LOPSIDED ON MISSOURI GAMBLING AMENDMENT CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When it comes to lopsided political
campaigns, look no further than the Nov. 3 boats-in-moats contest
between gambling proponents and opponents in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   According to Missouri Ethics Commission reports, spending
through Sept. 30 by the casino industry's election committee,
Missourians for Fairness &AMP; Jobs, already had topped $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The tally for the anti-gambling group, Show Me The River Inc.,
is $34,505.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, in the statewide election to legalize slot
machines, the industry spent more than $12 million. The
anti-gambling group spent $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a top-down effort that has all the money it needs,''
said Mark Andrews II, Show Me's chairman who also led the 1994
opposition campaign. ``We are a grass-roots effort that is an
effort of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Show Me's grass roots don't appear to grow much
deeper than Andrews' own pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the retired manufacturing company executive has
personally donated to or lent the committee $32,000 of its $34,000
bankroll, according to Ethics Commission financial disclosure
reports made public this week. Ten other persons have contributed
amounts ranging from $30 to $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbers, Andrews insists his organization isn't a
one-man show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew early on that in order to finance a little bit of
activity, somebody had to loan some money to the campaign,''
Andrews said. ``We had to get a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about people, not about money. This is not a documented,
big-time campaign like they're running. This is hundreds of
beehives of activity all around the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The Show Me group has aligned with several church organizations
opposed to gambling on mostly religious grounds that are working
against Amendment 9.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed constitutional amendment would retroactively
legalize riverboat casinos moored in man-made lagoons. The Missouri
Supreme Court last year outlawed games of chance, including slot
machines, aboard those boats in moats.
</P>
<P>
   Unless voters approve Amendment 9, effectively nullifying the
court's ruling, nine of the state's 15 casinos could be forced to
close or operate without the slot machines, which typically
generate about two-thirds of casinos' revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Show Me's largest expenditure to date is $11,300 to its campaign
management company, Topline Corp. of Ballwin, Mo. It has also paid
about $5,800 to the Spangler Group of Camdenton, Mo., for campaign
work.
</P>
<P>
   Huge campaign spending by gambling companies _ which have 10,000
employees and more than $1 billion invested in the jeopardized
casinos _ should surprise no one, said Don Poston, spokesman for
the industry-financed committee.
</P>
<P>
   Harrah's Entertainment Inc. and Station Casinos Inc. have each
contributed $2.3 million to date. Harrah's has four threatened
casinos in North Kansas City and Maryland Heights. Station has four
casinos in the state, but only two _ in Kansas City _ that are
classified as boats in moats.
</P>
<P>
   The Flamingo Hilton Casino, with one riverboat in Kansas City,
has contributed $506,600. Players Services Inc. in Atlantic City,
N.J., which operates the Players Island casinos in Maryland
Heights, has contributed $282,800 to date.
</P>
<P>
   Poston said Thursday that he wouldn't characterize the campaign
as David vs. Goliath.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got built-in (church) organizations all across the
state,'' said Poston of the opponents. ``We've got to get to people
nobody has touched. It's a costly process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 3.5 million voters in Missouri in more than 2
million households. We have to buy mailings, phone banks,
television advertising or whatever we have to get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee clearly is doing just that.
</P>
<P>
   Its reports show 10 paid staff members and a raft of
consultants, pollsters, advertising firms and others.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the campaign's chain of command is Winner//Wagner
&AMP; Mandabach, a national campaign consulting group.
</P>
<P>
   Counting significant television advertising costs that are paid
through the company, Winner//Wagner to date has received $2.57
million from the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous Kansas City consulting firms are also working for the
riverboat committee, including SGB Communications, where partner
Scott Burnett is unopposed in November for a seat on the Jackson
County Legislature.

WHEN PLAYGOERS TAKE UP THE GAUNTLET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Why is that man on the stage? He's not even an actor,
for heaven's sake, only a playwright, and everyone knows how
exciting they are these days. And it's not as if he's talking about
anything really juicy, like personal problems with substance abuse
or gender identity, or firing off zippy one-liners. His subject, if
you please, is the irreconcilable differences in the Middle East,
something you can read about in almost any newspaper any day of the
year. Why bother to go the to theater?
</P>
<P>
   Yet Londoners are flocking to see David Hare, and at the Duke of
York in the West End, no less, where the author of such successful
dramas as ``Skylight'' and ``Amy's View'' is performing his one-man
show, the Royal Court Theater production of ``Via Dolorosa.''
What's more, his audiences clearly aren't bored.
</P>
<P>
   They shouldn't be. As directed by the gifted Stephen Daldry
(``An Inspector Calls''), Hare shapes a genuinely dramatic event
out of his first-person account of a journey through Tel Aviv,
Jerusalem and the West Bank and of his encounters with people
representing a jangle of viewpoints. If it is not a proper play, it
is undoubtedly a piece of theater, meticulously staged in a way
that doesn't even aspire to spontaneity and yet still somehow glows
with more passion and provocation than Hare's other current hit,
``The Blue Room,'' the bleak sex comedy starring a naked Nicole
Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can you imagine, for a second, anything comparable
originating on Broadway? What if, say, Tony Kushner decided to
present his take on race relations in Boston from the stage of a
Schubert house? Would anybody come after the first few nights, no
matter how good it was?
</P>
<P>
   What continues to make London theater electric is its
willingness to challenge audiences, to keep extending its notions
of what theater can and should consider, and the willingness of
audiences to accept that challenge. And not just in the so-called
fringe houses; in the commercial mainstream of the West End as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of George Bernard Shaw lingers in the salutary notion
that a play of ideas and a compelling entertainment are not
incompatible. At its worst, this sensibility gives birth to
self-conscious, diagramed debate plays like Ronald Harwood's
``Taking Sides,'' seen briefly on Broadway two years ago, and
Nicholas Wright's ``Mrs. Klein,'' which was a succes de scandale
off-Broadway as a vehicle for Uta Hagen.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also thrilling works, by authors from Hare to Tom
Stoppard, that ask audiences to climb out of their daily mental
torpor and enter into a reflective dialogue with what's happening
onstage, not to be lectured to but to become engaged. It is telling
that one of the hardest tickets to come by at the moment is Michael
Frayn's ``Copenhagen,'' which devotes long passages to labyrinthine
discussions of post-Einstein physics.
</P>
<P>
   The great English actor Ian McKellen recently ignited furious
debates within the London theater and its audiences when, in an
interview in The Independent newspaper, he explained his reasons
for leaving his country's capital city for a seven-month residency
at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. His complaint, he said,
was with the composition of audiences, specifically at the Royal
National Theater, the site of much of his best work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they speak the language?'' he asked, referring to the many
foreign tourists here. He also pointed out that he saw no black
faces at a recent performance of ``Oklahoma!,'' an ``odd thing in
this city in this time.'' McKellen, with the grandstanding
eloquence that has characterized his real-life role as a figurehead
for gay rights, announced, ``I've made a vow never to work in a
theater which forces me to betray the soul of acting.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen doesn't seem to know how good he has had it, at least
from a New Yorker's point of view. Yes, London is the city that
gave us ``Cats'' and its many mindless progeny. But it is also the
city where American playwright Edward Albee has chosen to open his
latest work, ``The Play About the Baby,'' which is directed by
Howard Davies and stars Alan Howard and Frances de la Tour.
</P>
<P>
   It is, by most standards, a difficult piece, with a quartet of
nameless, archetypal characters; echoing, mutating symbolism, and
full-fledged discussions of ontology. A series of dialogues among
an older couple (Howard and Ms. de la Tour, in impeccable,
audience-seducing form) and a younger one (the appealingly and
appropriately fresh Rupert Penry-Jones and Zoe Waites), the play
harks back to Albee's early days of experimentalism, though the
authorial tone has shifted from angry young man to rueful older
one. Imagine a blueprint for the conflicts given fully fleshed life
in ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,'' and you'll get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby'' is also, once you give it the chance, extremely
entertaining, turning the eternally baffling questions of life and
death, illusion and reality, into a brisk, jaunty vaudeville, as
funny as it is despairing. (It has full-frontal nudity, too, but
that seems to be a sine qua non here these days.) While the local
reviews were decidedly mixed, there is talk of moving ``Baby'' from
the Almeida Theater in Islington to the West End.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Now consider Frayn's ``Copenhagen,'' at the Cottesloe Theater at
the National. This three-character drama, seen in a limited
engagement at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven earlier this
year, is about the moral implications of atomic fission and how the
principles of modern physics parallel human behavior. It is
centered on a meeting that took place between the Danish physicist
Niels Bohr and his onetime protege, the German scientist Werner
Heisenberg, during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The theories of complementarity (Bohr's) and uncertainty
(Heisenberg's) are painstakingly characterized and clarified
through discussion and metaphor. If that's not enough, Frayn has
chosen to present these knotty subjects ``Rashomon'' style, through
the varied and differing perspectives of the ghosts of Heisenberg
(Matthew Marsh), Bohr (David Burke) and Bohr's wife, Margarethe
(Sara Kestelman).
</P>
<P>
   The play is, admittedly, talkier than even George Bernard Shaw,
and before the evening's end, the actors appear openly exhausted
from spewing all those words. The exposition can seem
embarrassingly labored. (Sample line: ``It's like the worst of 1927
all over again, when Niels came back from Norway and first read
Heisenberg's uncertainty paper.'')
</P>
<P>
   But the director, Michael Blakemore, and his excellent cast
sustain a crackling, ominous tension and, more surprisingly, a line
of argument that even I, who barely got through a college course
called Physics for Poets, could follow. It was remarkable to find
the audience at intermission buzzing excitedly while throwing out
terms like ``Schroedinger's cat.'' Like Hare and Albee, Frayn asks
his audience to sit up, stay awake and pay attention, to exercise
and stretch the mind a bit. If you are willing to do that, you
won't get lost in any of these productions.
</P>
<P>
   Albee has often spoken disgustedly of the passivity of American
audiences. It's true that the dictum of many Broadway theatergoers
seems to be, ``All right, I'm going to sit back and relax now, and
you're going to make me feel good and forget the world outside,''
as though a play were some sort of super geisha. How else to
explain the failure of such top-notch challenging works as David
Mamet's ``Old Neighborhood'' or the Broadway revival of Sam
Shepard's ``Buried Child''?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their Broadway equivalents, London audiences have never
fully fallen out of the habit of playgoing. A night at the theater
doesn't have to be a special, occasional event, despite increased
ticket prices. (A seat for ``Oklahoma!'' can run the equivalent of
60-some dollars.) As a consequence, the dialogue between plays and
audiences remains more fluid, more reciprocal and consequently more
in touch with the culture at large. It says something that
playwrights like Harold Pinter and Hare are celebrities in London,
the way a philosopher like Bernard-Henri Levy is a pop star in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the only shows I attended here at which much of
the audience didn't seem to speak English, at least as a first
language, were two Broadway-style musicals, the clunky ``Saturday
Night Fever'' and the flaccid ``Whistle Down the Wind.'' The
latter, which opened and closed in Washington before reopening in a
revised form here, is the work of Andrew Lloyd Webber, godfather of
the spectacle-driven megamusical.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Webber's commercial star is, tellingly, on the wane, but
his name obviously still has international marquee value. In the
case of ``Wind,'' a bizarrely misbegotten fable of spiritual and
sexual awakening in rural Louisiana, the audience members who
didn't speak English were the luckiest people in attendance.

   The article already has prompted several inquiries as to
whether, as one curious reader put it, the explanation is valid or
``more smoke and mirrors'' to finesse government spending of
surplus Social Security revenues.
</P>
<P>
   It's worse than smoke and mirrors. It's not only misleading to a
fault, but talks down to members of the American Association of
Retired Persons as if they're morons.
</P>
<P>
   The feature is called ``Readers Ask the Experts,'' and the
author is responding to a Minnesotan who apparently has complained
that ``greedy, self-serving, big-spending politicians have been
obscenely raiding Social Security.'' The response to this charge is
from an ``expert'' employed as the director of income security for
the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research
group.
</P>
<P>
   The view from Minnesota is a good deal more on point than the
view from Washington. The think-tank expert assures Bulletin
readers the trust fund resources are there to finance future needs
when Social Security tax receipts start lagging benefit payouts.
The article apparently was considered necessary because of growing
concern about government's spending of Social Security revenue
surpluses and giving the trust fund IOUs for future redemption.
</P>
<P>
   AARP's ``expert'' says not to worry, because the trust fund
operates ``somewhat like a checking account.'' He then goes on to
explain that when you deposit money in your bank, the bank uses
your money to make loans. The bank can do this, he explains,
knowing it's unlikely all its checking account holders will be
withdrawing their money all at once.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with Social Security's trust fund, he says, and
the money will be there when needed because the Treasury will
redeem its securities as needed.
</P>
<P>
   The checking account analogy is not only conceptually flawed,
but an insult to the intelligence of many readers.
</P>
<P>
   First, it must be remembered, a bank and its customers are
engaged in voluntary association. No coercive force of government
is involved.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when a bank takes part of your checking account money
and uses it to make a loan, the loan becomes an asset for the bank.
As such, it acts as an offset to your checking account balance,
which is a liability for the bank.
</P>
<P>
   When Uncle Sam spends surplus Social Security revenues and gives
the trust fund a Treasury security, it creates a liability for the
U.S. government. Unlike the bank, though, no corresponding asset is
created except through the accounting fiction of an IOU in the form
of a Treasury security.
</P>
<P>
   Since the credit given the trust fund is in the form of a
nonmarketable security, though, it has no value other than as a
claim against the Treasury. When the trust fund must be tapped to
supplement a revenue shortfall, these IOUs must be redeemed with
the money on hand to do so. If the available money is inadequate,
adjustments must be made. These could include higher taxes, reduced
benefits, increased borrowing or rearranging budget priorities _ or
a combination thereof.
</P>
<P>
   It's irresponsible to pretend that real money exists to honor
Social Security promises and that the future is secure. AARP's
members deserve a more honest analysis of this issue.

THE LONG HISTORY OF HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuck in the streets of high rent downtowns and depressed inner
cities like abandoned wreckage at the rim of the highway, today's
homeless seem to be the least mobile of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing could be further from the image of homelessness that
prevailed a hundred years ago, when footloose armies of homeless
created a network of rowdy ``hobohemias'' across the country, made
the first protest march on Washington and captured the public
imagination as a rugged vanguard of radical unionism.
</P>
<P>
   To scholars investigating this almost-forgotten history, it
suggests how much the very idea of homelessness _ and our response
to it _ is linked to the large economic and social changes that
underlie dislocations of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Kusmer, a historian at Temple University whose book on
homelessness, ``Down and Out, On the Road: Tramps and Vagrants in
American Society 1865-1940,'' will be published by Oxford
University Press in the fall of 1999, contends that for all their
differences, the homeless of our own era and those of the past are
fundamentally similar. Just as homelessness in the 19th and early
20th centuries was a product of the wrenching transition from an
agricultural to an industrial society, he says, today's homeless
are the result of an incomplete transition to a post-industrial
society.
</P>
<P>
   Many people assume this country's first real experience with
homelessness dates from the Great Depression; in fact, homelessness
began to surge in the last half of the 19th century. But public
attitudes toward the homeless shifted dramatically between the
Civil War and the 1930s, from fear and condemnation to a kind of
romanticism that turned the hobo into an American folk hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homelessness is at best an odd-job word, pressed into service
to impose order on a hodgepodge of social dislocation, extreme
poverty, seasonal or itinerant work, and unconventional ways of
life,'' Kim Hopper and Jim Baumohl, two veteran researchers on
homelessness, cautioned in a 1996 essay, ``Redefining the Cursed
Word: A Historical Interpretation of American Homelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the colonial period, runaway slaves and servants were among
those who joined the itinerant indigents known as ``the strolling
poor.'' In the mid-19th century, a mix of the inebriated and the
unlucky slept stacked in lodging rooms at the police station that
quickly went from one-night holding places for transients to a
network of de facto homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1789, the New York Common Council was worried that
its almshouse had become ``too much a common receptacle for idle,
intemperate vagrants, many of whom have no lawful residence,'' and
who displaced more worthy objects of charity. Such complaints
recurred across the country for more than 150 years, observed
Hopper, who is a researcher at the Nathan S. Kline Institute for
Psychiatric Research in Orangeburg, N.Y., and Baumohl, an associate
professor of social welfare at Bryn Mawr.
</P>
<P>
   Tramps became more prominent in the early 1870s, when the end of
the Civil War, the rise of wage labor and the boom-and-bust cycles
of industrialization-in-the-raw sent thousands if not millions of
the unemployed roaming in search of work or a handout.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several decades, these mainly white, native-born,
rootless young men _ and some women _ created an increasingly
politicized subculture of hobo encampments near railroad arteries
and hard-drinking lodging house neighborhoods in western gateway
cities like Chicago, Seattle and Minneapolis. Successive
generations of reformers and policy-makers saw their existence as
evidence of social and moral crisis in America, says Todd
Depastino, a young social and cultural historian who has been
researching the history of homelessness on a grant from the
National Endowment for the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1890s, in the depths of a Gilded Age depression, the
``Industrial Armies of the Unemployed'' began recruiting homeless
men from western skid row neighborhoods for a cross-country
``petition in boots'' to demand a program of public works from
lawmakers in Washington. Dozens of copycat marches were organized
from Chicago, San Francisco, and the Pacific Northwest during this
period of widening inequality and brutal strike-breaking. Hobo
armies hijacked freight trains, often with the help of railroad
workers sympathetic to their cause. By 1908, the Industrial Workers
of the World, known as the Wobblies, had cast hobos as a muscular
advance guard of American class struggle.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect it seems obvious to historians that the nation's
expansion and modernization inevitably uprooted workers. But mid-
to late-19th-century Americans conditioned by a more settled
artisan and agrarian society saw the resulting ``homelessness'' as
a threat to social cohesion, the work ethic and family values. Even
without the specter of anarchism or class warfare, sprawling male
communities of native-born whites were considered dangerous to the
nation's health, DePastino adds, especially in the eyes of
eugenics-inspired reformers worried that ``inferior'' immigrant
races were out-reproducing ``better'' Anglo-Saxon stock.
</P>
<P>
   Kusmer traces the rise of a more sympathetic image of
homelessness in the early 20th century to the growing acceptance of
rootless underemployment as a feature of a capitalist industrial
economy rather than as a sign of bad character or social decay.
Most jobs were temporary or seasonal, and with European immigrants
flooding the labor market, even full-time, year-round work was
usually too low-paid to cushion families against illness,
industrial accidents and the business cycles of that pre-welfare
era. By the same token, Ford Motor Co.'s factories, which paid the
best industrial wages, experienced 100 percent turnover on the
assembly line in 1905 as workers quit to drift on to something
else. In this context, DePastino argues, the hobo came to represent
a kind of manly embrace of insecurity and a last-ditch rebellion
against the discipline of the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   World War I and the mechanization of pivotal Western
agricultural, railroad and mining operations substantially reduced
the size and viability of hobohemias tied to seasonal labor. The
1920s saw the beginnings of a corporate welfare that used benefits
to stabilize their work force. Still, until World War II, the
``homeless'' were considered a permanent feature of American life.
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, a new generation of
jobless young people rode the rails, but the era's migrant poverty
was increasingly shaped by the automobile, which could carry whole
families in search of work, like the Joads in the ``Grapes of
Wrath,'' their worldly goods lashed to a Model T. Migrant families,
too, were increasingly preferred by farm employers as a more docile
work force than their unattached male counterparts, DePastino adds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in 1932, he says, when as many as 60,000 unemployed World
War I veterans converged on Washington by rail and road to demand
their ``bonuses,'' they were clearly the heirs of the first hobo
armies, and Herbert Hoover had them routed from their tent cities
by real Army troops, led by Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   Only World War II, with an unlimited demand for labor, routed
homelessness itself from America. In late 1942, for example, The
San Francisco Chronicle reported that even a busload of 74 ``skid
road sherry winos'' from the Los Angeles County Jail had been
accepted by the Kaiser shipyards to be trained as welders in lieu
of their 90-day sentences.
</P>
<P>
   DePastino argues that postwar policies like the G.I. Bill, and
``the mass hypersubsidization of suburbia'' (through highway
construction, for example), were part of an explicit federal effort
to prevent the return of the volatile hobo armies. But
African-Americans were largely left out of the benefits, he says.
And by the 1960s, when the Northern cities of black migration were
de-industrializing and the last of the skid-row housing faced the
wrecking ball, the stage was set for the rise of the new
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Jencks, in his unsentimental book ``The Homeless,''
about modern-day homelessness, says that as in the nation's period
of nascent industrialization, the economy of the last 25 years has
increasingly demanded a flexible labor market, ``one in which labor
unions are weak, employers can hire and fire at will, and new
workers are easy to find.'' Such flexibility is often cited by
economists as the main reason the United States has created more
jobs and adapted better to globalization than Europe. But the dark
side, Jencks points out, is that it guarantees some workers will
never find steady employment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, residence in skid-row housing was precisely what
defined such people as homeless. Yet Dennis Culhane, who does data
analysis for the homeless shelters of New York City and
Philadelphia, notes that today, when ``homeless'' means either to
be without shelter or to live in a shelter, the leading remedies
for homelessness are, in effect, modern versions of the old
flophouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the historic view of this,'' he said, ``what we're
calling solutions to homelessness today are really what we called
homelessness in the past.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dull, damp and rather dismal weather will prevail across the
Northeast on Saturday as low pressure drifts east along the
southern New England coast. A large disturbance at 20,000 feet over
eastern Pennsylvania will circulate cool, moist air from the
Atlantic into Maine, resulting in periods of heavy rain. Thick
clouds and lighter showers will linger as far west as the central
Appalachians where daytime readings will average ten degrees below
seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly sunny, pleasant conditions will dominate the region from
the central Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. The morning will be cool
in the interior South, but afternoon temperatures will return to
normal readings. A cold front crossing southern Florida will be
preceded by considerable clouds and scattered showers, but it will
turn drier across the northern third of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer air will stream northward into the Plains as low pressure
approaches the eastern Rockies. Increasing humidity will cause
clouds to form in the Missouri Valley. A cold front will press
southward into Minnesota and the Dakotas while clouds, chilly winds
and a little rain will be found behind the front.
</P>
<P>
   Inclement weather with mountain snow and valley rain will occur
from central Montana to northern Idaho as cool air from the North
Pacific pushes inland to the central Rockies. Meanwhile, the
Northwest will stay dull along the Coast with brighter skies across
the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Winds from the east will descend the Sierra, bringing dry and
milder weather to California. Elsewhere, the desert Southwest will
stay seasonably hot with abundant sunshine.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Last Minute Upgrade
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, Tropical Storm Lisa was located near 43 degrees
north latitude over the Atlantic Ocean about 650 miles west of the
Azore Islands Q a position far removed from its breeding grounds
over tropical seas. Just as the storm started to lose its uniform
tropical characteristics and undergo a metamorphosis into an
extratropical low pressure system, the National Hurricane Center
upgraded Lisa to a hurricane. The energy needed for Tropical Storm
Lisa to achieve the higher grade of hurricane came from an
upper-level low pressure system and its associated temperature
contrasts. &QL;

WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT? SIMPLY BURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
(lb) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 10 o'clock on a Saturday night, and several
hundred people were standing around in a record store having a
religious experience: Burt Bacharach was giving a miniconcert in a
megastore. They were mostly hip 30-somethings, not candidates for
hip replacement. This wasn't the Westbury Music Fair; the stage was
not revolving.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when Bacharach played that Long Island institution _
an in-the-round theater that looked as if it hadn't been
redecorated since ``Don't Make Me Over'' was a hit _ the composer
was joined by his longtime muse and psychic friend, Dionne Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   Though at the time Bacharach's comeback was already under way,
there was only a handful of people in the place who couldn't
qualify for a senior's discount at any multiplex. But on Oct. 3 at
the new Virgin Megastore on Union Square, the 70-year-old composer
had a new partner, the former punk Elvis Costello, 44, and a
younger audience. Together, this twosome has written a new CD,
called ``Painted From Memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD's success among a new generation of fans begs the
question: How did the king of schmaltz become the latest word in
cool?
</P>
<P>
   Bacharach, who with the lyricist Hal David once posed the
musical question ``Do You Know the Way to San Jose?'' and Costello,
who in punk's heyday wondered ``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love
and Understanding?'' have earned glowing reviews for their new
release.
</P>
<P>
   Press for ``Painted From Memory'' has been tremendous, thanks in
part to the duo's salesmanship. If you missed them on ``Late Night
With David Letterman,'' you could have caught them plugging it on
the morning chat shows. They have made it the album of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   On a makeshift stage that night at Virgin, Costello, with
Bacharach's piano accompaniment, soared through a half-dozen songs,
including their first collaboration, the aching gospel-inspired
``God Give Me Strength,'' from the 1996 film ``Grace of My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance was not the extravagant affair that their Radio
City Music Hall concert promises to be on Tuesday night. Bacharach
was not wearing a tuxedo but a Polo golf shirt with a sweater tied
nonchalantly around his shoulders. Still, in its impromptu,
low-tech, cheeseless fashion, this little performance was more
spectacular in some ways than the more elaborate concerts could
hope to be.
</P>
<P>
   The evening fed, as do the CD's dozen new songs, an audience
starved for unabashed sentimentality but too sophisticated to
gobble up the ``Titanic'' treacle of Celine Dion. It is the same
audience that applauds a line at the end of John Waters' latest
film, ``Pecker.'' The characters in that art-world satire raise
their glasses and toast the end of irony.
</P>
<P>
   It is wishful thinking on the part of those who've wearied of
unfunny comedy, horror films about other horror films, expensive
clothes that look like tatters, and advertising that makes fun of
the product being sold. Audiences are longing for things that
simply are what they are _ simply funny, simply moving, simply
beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Such straightforward emotion has always been Bacharach's forte,
whether it was Dusty Springfield's ditching her spouse for another
man ``24 Hours From Tulsa,'' the Carpenters' longing to be ``Close
to You'' or Roberta Flack's reminding us that there's more to love
than ``Making Love.'' That's what makes him so refreshing right
now.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Costello has called ``Painted From Memory'' a CD about
heartbreak. But it is the kind of misery that makes you want to hum
along.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at a time when Bacharach is enjoying an enormous
resurgence of popularity. In recent years, a new generation of fans
has discovered his work through such vehicles as last year's hit
comedy film ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' the soundtrack of which
included a reggae refashioning of ``I Say a Little Prayer,'' and
through other offbeat cover versions of his songs.
</P>
<P>
   Even the electronic pop band Erasure did a chirpy version of the
Perry Como hit ``Magic Moments,'' on their CD ``Cowboy.'' The TNT
cable chanel televised a tribute concert last April, featuring
contemporary performers like the Ben Folds Five and Sheryl Crow,
amid enormous hoopla.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, concert-style productions of ``Promises, Promises''
in New York and Los Angeles acquainted theatergoers with the joys
of Bacharach. Then there was his cameo in ``Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery.'' A three-CD box set of his greatest
hits _ ``The Look of Love: The Burt Bacharach Collection,'' to be
released on Nov. 3 _ won't hurt his reputation, either.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Painted From Memory'' sells well, it just might be a
bellwether, signaling a return not only of Bacharach but also of
honest emotion. If it doesn't, to paraphrase one of his hits, I
just don't know what I'll do with myself.

SOUTHERN BAPTIST LEADER RICHARD LAND CHALLENGES CONSCIENCES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Land challenges consciences _ whether his audience is
fellow Southern Baptists or national radio listeners.
</P>
<P>
   He has called on the Southern Baptist Convention to repent for
past racism. He calls for President Bill Clinton, a Southern
Baptist, to resign because he has lost the ``moral authority'' he
needs to be president. He calls for husbands to love their wives
and for wives to obey husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Land, a former Houstonian, is the high-profile president of the
convention's Nashville-based Ethics and Religious Liberty
Commission. It is the convention's watchdog on national religious
liberty issues such as school prayer, as well as social and moral
issues such as abortion and gambling. The Princeton- and
Oxford-educated Land voices the convention's biblically
conservative stance.
</P>
<P>
   He is an example of the media-savvy evangelicals who have
sparked the growing conservatism in the 16 million-member
convention. His flexibility has earned him some begrudging respect
from opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are out to confront the culture,'' Land said. And confront
he does.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the national convention amended its doctrinal
statement, the Baptist Faith and Message, to define family
relationships. ``A husband is to love his wife as Christ loved the
church,'' the amendment stated. ``A wife is to submit graciously to
the servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly
submits to the headship of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   It was written by a seven-member committee that included Land.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment drew applause from the floor but incredulity from
the media, as well as many Baptists and mainstream believers. In
response, the First Baptist Church of Raleigh, N.C., voted Sept. 25
to leave the national convention.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest convention action to draw national attention. In
1997, the convention launched a boycott of the Walt Disney Co.,
arguing that Disney promoted immoral attitudes in some of its
movies and company policies. Disney denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The convention has taken staunch anti-gay rights stands and
anti-gambling stands. The leadership has opposed the ordination of
women. These are stands that Land has no problem defending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What fascinates the press,'' Land said in a recent Houston
visit, ``is that it is not used to people willing be so politically
incorrect. They are fascinated by this largest of Protestant
denominations in the country that really doesn't seem to be overly
concerned about acquiescing to the late-20th-century prejudices of
secular America.''
</P>
<P>
   First Baptist of Raleigh voted 264-23 to leave the convention
after a membership of 153 years. The church elected its first
female deacons in 1874, and half of the 48-member deacon board is
female.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sad we were in a position that we had to make a
decision,'' the Rev. Daniel Day, senior pastor, said. ``The mood of
regret and sadness was heavy within the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Land, never at a loss for words, argues that the American family
is in crisis. ``In 1963, 83 percent of American children were
reared in intact homes,'' Land said. ``Today less than half of
children are reared in intact homes and that is a severe crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Land, like the Southern Baptists now in national convention
leadership, says that social problems, from family breakdown to
abortion, can be remedied by adhering to traditional scriptural
interpretations such as maintaining chastity prior to marriage. He
shares such views on his daily, half-hour national radio talk
program, ``For Faith and Family.'' It airs on 180 stations,
including Houston's KTEK (1110 AM), at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   His conservatism resonates with Southern Baptists, said Bill J.
Leonard, dean of Wake Forest University's new divinity school.
Land's views reflect the views of the convention's current leaders,
and ``Baptists either agree with those views or seem willing to
accept them in order to stay Southern Baptist,'' Leonard said,
adding that his own ideas differ. He sees the convention's outlook
as close to the views of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Parham of the independent Baptist Center for Ethics in
Nashville was a former staff member of the convention's Ethics &AMP;
Religious Liberty Commission. He left in 1991, but respects Land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard and I disagree significantly on theological, cultural
and strategic issues,'' Parham said. ``But I find him to be an
opponent and not an enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard sees the options for Christian faith as either
capitulation to the current culture or retrenchment of the culture
of the 1950s,'' Parham said. He charges fundamentalists who want to
use the Republican Party to bring national political change have
lost sight of the church's call to transform the culture through
spiritual means.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Land says he thinks he should voice the convention's views to
secularized press and a similar society.
</P>
<P>
   But he admits that Southern Baptists are not a monolith. While
opposed to abortion in principle, he said, some conservative
Southern Baptists will accept abortion to save the life of the
mother, while others will oppose it except in cases of incest or
rape.
</P>
<P>
   Land rejects the criticism that he is following a ``right-wing
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend as much time taking about environmental stewardship
as we do talking about a lot of issues dear to right-wing groups,''
Land said. ``When right-wing groups agree with our positions, I
applaud their good tastes.''
</P>
<P>
   Land also spearheaded the convention's 1995 resolution
apologizing to African-Americans for the convention's racist past.
The Southern convention split with their Northern Baptist
counterparts over slavery before the Civil War.  &UR;  &LR; ``When we went to
Atlanta (for the 1995 meeting) and celebrated our sesquicentennial,
we couldn't do it without apologizing for racism, for slavery, for
segregation,'' Land said.
</P>
<P>
   It is Land's willingness to listen to opposing views that earns
the respect of critics at the opposite end of the theological and
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   It is a flexibility that was formed during his childhood in
Houston. The son of Leggette and Mary Lee Land, he grew up in South
Park, attending South Park Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion was always very important, and the church was very
important in my family's way of life,'' he said. Land was intent on
becoming a career military officer but felt a call to the ministry
at age 14. ``I resisted for a couple of years because I wanted to
go to West Point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for seminary, Land decided to attend Princeton
University, where he graduated magna cum laude in 1969. He said
that school was hostile to religion, and he often found himself the
lone evangelical in a class.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I found it exciting and challenging,'' he said. ``I
learned a whole lot more about why I believed what I believed.''
</P>
<P>
   To help maintain his faith during the summers of his college
years, Land attended a Bible study at the home of Paul Pressler, a
Baptist who would later become a leader in the convention's
conservative movement. After Princeton, Land attended New Orleans
Baptist Theological Seminary, where he met Paige Patterson, then a
graduate student. Patterson, now convention president, and Land
shared a concern for what they considered ``liberal'' biblical
teachings at the seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of my professors had real questions about whether Adam
and Eve were real people,'' he said. ``I had a professor in
religious education who basically was no longer certain of the
supernatural.''
</P>
<P>
   He met his wife, Rebekah, a psychotherapist, at the seminary.
The couple has three children.
</P>
<P>
   Land, who wanted to become an educator, went to Oxford
University and graduated in 1975. He was reunited with Patterson
when Land taught at Criswell College. Patterson was president of
that Bible school in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Land was in the leadership of the conservative movement when it
began controlling the convention in 1979. In 1981, he joined the
Christian Life Commission, the forerunner of the Religious Liberty
Commission, which he now leads.
</P>
<P>
   Land said Baptists' national battle over biblical views was
costly. Several Baptist colleges and universities, such has Baylor
University in Waco, have become autonomous to avoid conservative
control.
</P>
<P>
   Several churches have loosened ties to the convention by
redirecting moneys to other groups such as the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship. A few, such as the Raleigh church, have left. Parham
points out that state conventions like Texas, Virginia, North
Carolina and a few others are distancing themselves from the
national convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Land is satisfied with the results. ``We have turned our
seminaries back to where they once were,'' he said. ``We have
turned our agencies back to where they should have been.'' &QL;

START OF MICROSOFT TRIAL DELAYED 4 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Friday pushed back the starting
date of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp. by four days,
to Oct. 19, while also ordering the company to comply with the
Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's financial
records.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that allowing ``an army of government attorneys
to come in and make demands will make it very difficult for us to
remain in business.'' But after winning assurances from government
lawyers that they would make only narrow, targeted searches of the
records, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of the U.S. District Court
for the District of Columbia ordered Microsoft to open the database
for perusal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had asked that the trial be delayed several more
months to prepare a defense against what it said was a last minute
broadening of the case by the Justice Department, which had added
new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government said that in the process of preparing
for the trial it had discovered that Microsoft tried to persuade
Apple Computer not to market its Quicktime multimedia software to
Windows customers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Justice Department and 20 states added two new
people to their witness list to testify about Microsoft dealings
with Apple and with Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Avi Tevanian, a former Apple executive, was added to the witness
list in part to describe Microsoft's proposal, which Microsoft
denies ever having made.
</P>
<P>
   The other new witness was James Gosling, a Sun executive who led
the development of Java, an Internet programming language that
Microsoft sees as a potential threat to the company's dominance of
the software market. The government is charging that Microsoft took
illegal steps to prevent Java from gaining wide acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   To counter that, Microsoft named two new witnesses Friday,
Robert Muglia, a senior Microsoft executive who has worked with
Sun, and Chris Engstrom, an executive who handled some of
Microsoft's dealings with Apple.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, John Warden, Microsoft's lawyer, argued that
the new allegations had no place in the case. The Justice
Department, Warden told the judge, was ``trying to turn this into
something approximating a plenary monopoly case like the IBM
case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes clearer and clearer and clearer with each new
filing that they are trying to turn this into a broader case,'' he
said. ``You can't have this bait-and-switch in which they file a
complaint alleging A, B, C, and then talk about the whole alphabet
three times over.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Warden said, Microsoft wanted, at a minimum,
another two-week delay, even though ``a more normal schedule''
would have the trial start next year.
</P>
<P>
   The judge did not respond. Instead he entered an order setting
the Oct. 19 trial date. Late Friday, Microsoft entered a formal
motion asking for another two-week delay. A response is expected
next week.

`WORK IN PROGRESS': EISNER'S TELL-LITTLE TALE OF HIS MAGIC

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've always found that experiences from everyday life made the
best drama,'' writes Michael Eisner in ``Work in Progress'' (Random
House, $27.95), a first-person account of his years at ABC,
Paramount Pictures and, of course, Walt Disney Co., where he has
run things since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, much of this real-life narrative has the drama of, say, an
annual report. Here is the chief executive's message on everything
from Disney's management feuds to its millennium plans. And, yes,
there he is on the cover, posing with the Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it may be futile to expect much more from a sitting
corporate chief, especially when the corporation is an American
icon. Eisner says he wrote his book _ with Tony Schwartz, a
journalist _ as a kind of mission statement. And he discloses that
his wife, Jane Breckenridge Eisner, opposed the project, viewing
such midcareer memoirs as vain and invasive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would have been interesting to glimpse more of the
private man who has been behind so much popular culture. Or some
juicy, inner-circle accounts of past Disney deals or decisions. Or
a few Big Thoughts, as Disney becomes more global, about the
company's power over the world's collective imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Eisner _ whose business talents have long been well
regarded _ tells an already familiar tale about Disney, with an
emphasis on his creative contributions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he stays away from anything deeper than a
surface look at his personal life: childhood on Mahhattan's
prosperous Park Avenue, summers at a beloved Vermont wilderness
camp that taught him ``core values,'' wholesome mischievousness at
boarding school. ``I found a way to balance basic respect for
authority with youthful rebelliousness,'' he writes. (How
Mickey-like.)
</P>
<P>
   Even his grief, years later, over the death of Frank Wells,
Disney's No. 2, seems glossed over, as does his ordeal with
quadruple-bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work in Progress,'' in fact, seems to let down its guard only
when discussing work experiences now safely in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner started at ABC at 24, developing soap operas and game
shows and, later, prime-time comedies like ``Welcome Back,
Kotter,'' ``Barney Miller'' and ``Happy Days.'' There he met and
worked _ sometimes quirkily _ with Barry Diller, who recruited
Eisner into the No. 2 job at Paramount Pictures in 1977 after a
decade at ABC. (We learn that Diller once clapped a hand over
Eisner's mouth to stop him from talking in front of a group.)
</P>
<P>
   At Paramount, the two were tight-fisted, producing movies as
cheaply as possible by relying on new, relatively unknown talent.
The studio made the hit spoof ``Airplane!'' for $6 million, using a
novice director, and netted $83 million; ``48 Hours,'' made before
Eddie Murphy was expensive, cost $10 million and earned $76
million. And another Murphy film, ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' was based
on an idea that Eisner says he got after being ticketed for
speeding in California.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in 1984, Eisner was dismissed _ for personal
reasons, as he tells it _ by Martin Davis, who ran Gulf &AMP; Western,
then the studio parent.
</P>
<P>
   The author's Disney years take up the bulk of the book,
beginning with the takeover battle that was raging when Roy Disney
approached Eisner (then at Paramount) about taking the top post.
</P>
<P>
   As he describes his tenure at Disney _ the remade
this-is-not-your-father's Disney _ we get a sense of Eisner's
popular-culture instincts and his much-lauded business acumen: the
sharp attention to movie costs, the cross-promotions between theme
parks and retail shops, the push for a greater presence in
television.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little discussion of the controversies at the
company. Eisner doesn't discuss the conservative backlash against
the company's gay-friendly employee policies. (He does, however,
grapple with the ``authenticity'' issues surrounding Disney's
failed plans for an American-history theme park near Manassas, Va.)
</P>
<P>
   What we get, for the most part, is a bland presentation _ a look
at the new, grown-up films from Miramax and Touchstone, the Capital
Cities/ABC acquisition, ``The Lion King'' on Broadway, the
turnaround at Euro Disney (now Disney Paris), the cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there is a glimpse of how deals are done in the
rarefied realms of really big business: Eisner exchanges ideas on
the chairlifts at Aspen and engages in buyout banter at a top-level
executive retreat in Sun Valley. But over all, the reader gets
little in the way of an inside look at the Magic Kingdom.

MY MONEY, MY LIFE: SNARING THAT HOME SWEET HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (bl)  
 Pamela Kruger is a contributing editor at Fast Company magazine and
a freelance writer. 
By PAMELA KRUGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The real-estate broker glanced nervously at her watch.
``Remember, you've only got until 5,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In just 45 minutes, the 73-year-old house we were seeing for the
first time would be on the Multiple Listing Service, an electronic
bulletin board for realty agents. That meant it would soon be
swarming with house hunters; to avoid a bidding war, we'd have to
make an offer on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier in the same town, Millburn, N.J., we had signed a
contract to buy another colonial _ a small, turn-of-the-century
house we had seen for maybe 15 minutes before bidding the full
asking price.
</P>
<P>
   So after 10 months of intensive house-hunting, David and I faced
another split-second decision: Should we scuttle one deal, which we
could still legally do, on the chance we could make another?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an irresponsible way to make the biggest purchase
of our lives. But in our defense, we were in one of the hottest
real estate markets in memory _ a market without logic.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a year, we had lost bidding wars and seen homes
snatched up before they were even on the market. I no longer
thought of a house as just a place to live or as an investment. For
me _ and, I suspect, for many other goal-oriented types _ buying a
house had become a test of my abilities. And I was failing. I grew
determined to outsmart, outrun and outbid everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Our day of decision came in March _ a month when home resales
would hit an annual rate of 4.89 million, the highest since the
National Association of Realtors began compiling the data in 1968.
(The pace has slackened slightly, to a rate of 4.73 million rate in
August.)
</P>
<P>
   When we began our hunt, we used the conventional methods,
answering ads and relying on a local broker to screen the Multiple
Listing Service. So for months, all we saw were houses that no one
else wanted or that already had offers.
</P>
<P>
   Big mistake. The listing service, which in this case serves 10
counties in New Jersey, requires that agents enter most new
listings into the system within 48 hours of receiving them. But
with inventory at an all-time low, agencies find that two days are
often enough to sell their own listings to their own clients, thus
doubling their commissions.
</P>
<P>
   While our broker was hard-working, relatively few sellers in
town listed directly with her agency, so we rarely saw houses
before they were on the service. After five months of getting
nowhere, we decided to tap the underground housing market.
</P>
<P>
   We started by calling two brokers whose names appeared most
often on Millburn listings. They didn't show us a single house.
</P>
<P>
   So we took out a house-wanted ad in the local paper. A longtime
resident called, and although her house was out of our price range
(up to $400,000), she recommended a broker at one of the biggest
agencies in town. This broker agreed to represent us only if we
agreed not to use any other agency. I gave the bad news to our old
broker.
</P>
<P>
   By the next month, though, we still hadn't see a worthwhile
house. Desperate to gain some advantage, I called my brother, who
had recently bought a house in Los Angeles after looking for only a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although he and his companion had found their house through a
broker, he was convinced they had sealed the deal by writing a
letter to the owners telling them how much they loved the house.
</P>
<P>
   So on Feb. 14, David and I went to our favorite Millburn street
and dropped ``we-love-your-house'' Valentines in every mailbox. The
phone soon rang, but not with leads. One woman wouldn't let me in
her house unless I peeked in the windows when she wasn't home and
was sure I'd offer at least $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   After nine months, we had managed to bid on nine houses. But
either a bidding war would erupt or the owners wouldn't negotiate;
though desperate, we weren't yet willing to grossly overpay or be
walked upon.That changed in March, after Millburn's high school was
ranked best in the nation in one book. Sellers seemed to become
even cockier.
</P>
<P>
   Panicked, we jumped at those two houses at once _ and ended up
with the 73-year-old colonial at $14,000 less than the asking
price. My husband was ecstatic; I felt defeated.
</P>
<P>
   But we weren't done. The owners made a host of demands. When
they suddenly terminated our contract because, we heard, they
thought our lawyer was taking too long to return calls, we begged
them to reconsider. Then they insisted that we deliver a deposit
check to our broker's office the next day _ a Saturday _ for their
``viewing.'' Never mind that the original check would be in our
lawyer's office in Monday's mail.
</P>
<P>
   We hadn't found our dream house; we were simply too tired to
hunt anymore. But one night, soon after we moved in, I realized I
had spent so much time trying to ``win'' that I had forgotten what
I was seeking: a home. Now, sitting on our porch, listening to the
cicadas and feeling the breeze of the ceiling fan, I knew we had
found it.

 &HT;    SHELL UNIT WILL LAY OFF 20% OF WORKERS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HILLARY DURGIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Shell Oil Co. has notified employees at its exploration and
production unit that the company plans to lay off 740 workers, or
20 percent of its staff, as part of a larger cost-cutting effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston-based oil company employs 3,700 workers at its Shell
Exploration &AMP; Production Co. unit.
</P>
<P>
   Shell also said it is reviewing its portfolio of oil and gas
properties to determine which are not essential.
</P>
<P>
   The action comes on the heels of a warning by the chairman of
its parent company, Royal Dutch/ Shell Group, that earnings in the
current and next quarters would be depressed. Royal Dutch/Shell
also said it would shutter four large European offices.
</P>
<P>
   As oil prices remain depressed at levels 35 percent below
year-ago highs, other major oil companies said they are either
studying layoffs or already have announced them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know many executives today who are very positive,''
said Carol Freedenthal, a principal with Jofree Corp., a Houston
energy consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way through the industry we're detecting a very
pessimistic view (from executives) that the low prices are not
going away, that they really have to compete to sell their goods,
and that we don't have much control of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texaco spokeswoman said Thursday that the company was
reviewing ``all operations, which may lead to some changes.'' The
company has approximately 3,000 employees in Houston, most of whom
are affiliated with its exploration and production business.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco said earlier this year that it plans to defer up to 10
percent of its 1998 capital spending budget of about $4.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Amoco Corp. is expected to lose jobs as part of the company's
pending acquisition by British Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, Atlantic Richfield Co. said the company plans to
cut employment to avoid being taken over by another oil company
during this period of low prices.
</P>
<P>
   At Exxon Company U.S.A., a spokesman said no layoffs had been
announced. He noted that the company's capital spending budget for
the first six months of 1998 had increased 7 percent to $771
million.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs at Shell are not a surprise. A month ago, the
company said it was considering layoffs as part of an effort to cut
its 1999 budget for worldwide deepwater exploration. At the time it
said layoffs in the Gulf of Mexico were not likely as part of that
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are also reviewing our assets to determine those that are
not strategic to our portfolio,'' a Shell spokeswoman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman said that the company's exploration and
production business had been holding meetings with employees at its
different divisions for some time regarding the possible work force
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Employees received a memo via e-mail Tuesday detailing the
specifics of the cuts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it will undertake an employee severance
program soon and expects to have completed the layoffs by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   No details were available on what sort of positions or which
divisions would be most affected by the cuts. Shell's joint
ventures are not going to be affected, the spokeswoman said. &QL;

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Oct. 11, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL-REVIEW (Washington) _ At the crisis-wracked annual
meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank _
the institutions built 53 years ago to create global stability out
of the wreckage of World War II _ the 21st century village was
termed the ``new international financial architecture.'' President
Clinton insisted said it would be designed ``to tame the pattern of
boom-bust on an international scale.'' Unfortunately, the
groundbreaking ceremony is years away. By David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REVIEW (Washington) _ If the House votes to impeach
Clinton, the matter goes to the Senate, which must decide, by a
two-thirds majority, whether to convict him and, thus remove him
from office. So the Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new
order of disruptive force into the Senate contests. Voters, even
those who support Clinton, expect their political leaders,
Republican or Democratic, to renounce Clinton's behavior and
morals, and candidates have been doing that. By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   MERGER-REVIEW (Undated) _ As banks, brokerage firms and
insurance companies combine into huge new conglomerates, and with
legislation wending through Congress to make such mergers even
easier, there is increasing concern about the amount of personal
financial and medical data that can be collected under one roof. By
Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-REVIEW (Moscow) _ The world watched tens of thousands of
Communists and their allies march on the Kremlin last week,
demanding the removal of Boris Yeltsin and his lackeys, and a
telegenic protest it was. What it wasn't was a good gauge of
Russian discontent. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLTALK-REVIEW (Undated) _ When Monica Lewinsky poured her
heart out to Linda Tripp, she was clearly looking for girl talk.
Girl talk runs deep. By Jenny Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   HALLOWEEN-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's not easy being Monica _ even
for one night. Th nation's major mask makers have taken a pass on
Monica Lewinsky masks this Halloween, worried about possible
lawsuits over the use of her likeness. So revelers will have to
improvise with wigs and berets, and many plan to do so. Party
stores and costume makers report that this season's best-selling
spooking gear is all about Ms. Lewinsky, President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Linda Tripp and even Kenneth Starr. By Mike
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REVIEW (Shanghai) _ So many of China's neighbors in Asia
are mired in financial wreckage that economists and international
traders fear that China may be the last and heftiest domino getting
ready to fall. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   BIZTALK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Wall Street loves jargon, which makes
its business sound mysterious and important and serves as a sort of
secret handshake. By Leslie Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   GEOPOLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ If there is a worldwide canard
about political correctness, it is that it's an American disease.
Geopolitically  &QL; 
speaking, though, that is wildly incorrect. Every country has its
own strain. &QL; 
By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   BABE-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ In South Africa a woman is a babe
first, last and foremost. The better-looking she is, the easier
life is. By Suzanne Daley. &QL;

NFL COULD USE MORE FANTASY, LESS OF REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   into a fantasy world, this would be a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The No Fun League was especially so Sunday. In Phoenix, where
our TV games are chosen by sadistic network weasels, we were
treated to the Dolphins-Jets punt-a-thon and the ultimate atomic
stink bomb: Philadelphia at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying the Eagles gave up in the second half. They gave
up in the first half. At one point, the Philadelphia secondary was
actually playing hacky sack.
</P>
<P>
   But in all fairness, I noted that the Eagles were careful never
to actually touch the hem of Terrell Davis' garment.
</P>
<P>
   Other rotten match-ups: Giants-Bucs, Chargers-Colts and, of
course, Seahawks-Chiefs, which was halted for 54 minutes because of
heavy rain and lightning _ the only fireworks during a dismal NFL
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the average fan, this turn of events might lead to dire
consequences _ yardwork, baby-sitting or, horror of horrors, a
Sunday afternoon cooking show.
</P>
<P>
   While braising pork chops might seem more appealing than
watching Danny Kanell impersonate an NFL quarterback, this isn't a
problem for fantasy leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some might argue that fantasy leagues are saving the
NFL from itself.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the league. Five weeks into the season, there are three
winless teams (Washington, Carolina and Philadelphia) and seven
teams with one victory. Other teams with slightly better records
(Arizona, New Orleans and Atlanta) just don't have the legs to
last.
</P>
<P>
   Quick quiz. The Dallas Cowboys' next three opponents have how
many wins among them? Answer: one.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, two of them are actually tied with Bye Week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the bad football, fantasy owners always have a
reason to watch the games.
</P>
<P>
   Without fantasy football, the Eagles-Broncos might have seemed a
little, ah, dull. Don't tell that to the guy who started John Elway
at quarterback, only to watch Bubby Brister get the privilege of
whacking out the Eagles. (By the way, it's really hard to pry a
shoe out of a big-screen TV.)
</P>
<P>
   This game featured a slew of fantasy favorites besides Elway.
With Denver, you had Davis, wide receivers Rod Smith and Ed
McCaffrey and tight end Shannon Sharpe. As for the Eagles, some
poor souls were rooting for receiver Irving Fryar and running backs
Duce Staley and Charlie Garner.
</P>
<P>
   News that the Falcons were blowing out the Panthers was fine
with fantasy owners who started Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler,
running back Jamal Anderson or receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Purists argue that fantasy leaguers don't watch the games for
the right reasons, that we should be more interested in wins and
losses than statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this weekend, the winless Eagles play the winless
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The purists can have my ticket. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the performance of Panthers quarterback Kerry
Collins against Atlanta. He ran up his numbers after Carolina was
behind, 38-3, and this week he benched himself in favor of backup
Steve Beuerlein. I think Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart
will have a bounce-back game against Cincinnati. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for Miami rookie John Avery to find his way into the
lineup. Coach Jimmy Johnson never has been enamored with starter
Karim Abdul-Jabbar. In Kansas City, Rashaan Shehee looked good in
relief of Donnell Bennett on Sunday, but Bennett should be back
this week despite a bruised hand. Don't expect Cowboys running back
Chris Warren to score two touchdowns every week, but he will get
significant time spelling Emmitt Smith. Running back Gary Brown
appears to have the starting job for the Giants, such as it is. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week it's Detroit receiver Johnnie Morton, who had two
catches for 138 yards and one touchdowns. Morton is good, but he's
not going to catch too many more 98-yard bombs. &QL;

 &HT;    SOME SAY SAT FAILS THE TEST OF FAIRNESS
 &HT;    310&AMP;add.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As thousands of high school students sweat over SAT
exams Saturday, a debate is raging over whether colleges and
universities should continue making the test such an important
factor in the admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   While one advocacy group says standardized tests are biased
against minority students and should be downplayed, the College
Board contends the SAT is fair and greatly helps gauge a student's
readiness for college.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the National Center for Fair and Open Testing
(FairTest) released a study claiming that some U.S. colleges and
universities have moved away from using the SAT to evaluate
students, partly because high school grades are better at
forecasting success in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colleges that have de-emphasized standardized admissions tests
have found that these reforms promote equity and excellence,'' said
Charles Rooney, assistant director of FairTest. ``Applicant pools
have become more diverse without any loss in academic quality
because a focus on test scores deters many otherwise qualified
minority, low-income and female students.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, College Board spokesman Jeffrey Penn said that if
certain groups do poorly, it doesn't mean the test is biased. Some
students may have difficulty because their schools just didn't
prepare them as well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contend that it is not unfair to minorities and women,''
Penn said. ``I think part of what FairTest and other test critics
in general assume is that everyone would get the same score.
They're disappointed that some groups fare worse than others on the
test. This is not an IQ test to measure aptitude, it measures
learned reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn said college admissions directors already place more weight
on grades, class rank and course work, although 82 percent of all
four-year colleges still require SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour SAT, which measures a student's verbal and math
skills, is a rite of passage the average American high school
student endures at least once. Nearly 2 million students take the
test each year.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on standardized tests have gained increased attention as
affirmative action programs are being dismantled across the
country. One college system highlighted in FairTest's survey was
the University of Texas, which now admits all applicants who are in
the top 10 percent of their class regardless of test scores.
</P>
<P>
   That policy was instituted after the landmark Hopwood federal
court ruling banned colleges in some states from considering race
as a factor in admission. It was ordered not by the University of
Texas system but by the state Legislature, where its backers hoped
it would lead to a rebound in the number of minority applicants at
the schools, which has dropped since the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy itself has proved controversial. Some say that
students whose schools grade more leniently gain an unfair
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., was also examined in the
FairTest study. After two years of research, faculty and board
members of the private four-year college voted in 1996 to make
standardized tests an optional part of the admissions process for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   In place of test scores, students must submit a graded academic
paper and be interviewed. Counselors say they have seen an increase
in minority, female and low-income applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the SAT say Muhlenberg's practice is good because
it gives students an option for how they will be evaluated and
increases their comfort with the college. Although Muhlenberg has
not seen an increase in minority enrollment, officials believe the
policy works as a hedge against student assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wake of all the anti-affirmative action stuff that's
been going on, one might be able to argue that this SAT-optional
policy has allowed Muhlenberg to maintain a consistent African
American and Latino population,'' said Christopher Hooker-Haring,
the school's dean of admissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some evidence that these students are assuming
an inhospitable climate at all predominantly white universities and
these schools have seen their numbers drop,'' he said.

CONSERVATIVES WARN VOTERS AGAINST APPROVING POT FOR MEDICAL USE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four Republican senators and former national drug
policy director William Bennett urged voters Friday not to approve
state ballot initiatives that would legalize marijuana for
medicinal uses.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, Jon Kyl of Arizona, Wayne
Allard of Colorado and Frank Murkowski of Alaska joined Bennett at
a Capitol Hill news conference to warn that such ballot measures in
their states would, in the words of Allard, ``send the wrong
message to youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives to legalize the drug for debilitating diseases such
as cancer, glaucoma or AIDS are also on the November ballot in
Nevada and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who was drug policy director under President George
Bush, said that ``marijuana is not medicine. It is a serious drug
that leads to a lot of problems. A doctor who tells you to smoke
marijuana is a lousy doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   But R. Keith Stroup, executive director of the National
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, a Washington
advocacy group, said later that opponents of the initiatives ``are
confusing a medical issue with the war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Stroup insisted that ``there is no connection between a doctor's
being able to prescribe a medication to relieve pain and suffering
and what kids use on the street. Our opponents are holding sick and
dying patients hostage to the war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Smith predicted that Oregon voters will
``overwhelmingly'' approve a measure that would allow people
suffering from ``debilitating medical conditions,'' to use
marijuana, but said he wanted ``to make a plea'' for state
residents to ``think twice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will unreasonably complicate the efforts of law enforcement
to do their jobs if we allow people to grow marijuana in their
homes even if it is held up as (being for) medicinal use,'' Smith
said. He added that any vote to legalize the drug ``should be made
based on science, not on popularity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl warned that an initiative on the Arizona ballot that would
legalize drugs such as marijuana and heroin for medical use ``is a
first step toward the total legalization of (illicit) drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, voters in California and Arizona approved measures to
legalize marijuana for certain medical uses. Since then, the
Arizona legislature passed a law nullifying the state's Proposition
200 initiative. In California, the Justice Department has sued in
federal court to invalidate the state's Proposition 215, arguing
that federal law, which bans marijuana, supersedes any local law.
</P>
<P>
   Some cannabis clubs in the state, set up to dispense marijuana
to people who are ill, have been shut down, and the federal
government is seeking to shut down the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Allard warned that a proposed amendment to Colorado's
constitution that would legalize medicinal marijuana could have
``grave'' consequences because it would grant a drug panel power to
add other illegal drugs to the list. However, the amendment is in
limbo because a recount has been ordered of signatures on petitions
backing the proposal to determine whether there are enough to place
the issue on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Murkowski said a ballot initiative to legalize so-called medical
marijuana in Alaska contains major loopholes that ``would
effectively weaken laws against marijuana.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the measure ``very dangerous,'' charging that it would
shield medical marijuana users from criminal penalties if they
cause an accident under the influence of the drug.

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TOKYO _ By 5 a.m., the world's biggest fish market is going
full throttle, alive with the noisy off-loading of 450 kinds of
seafood and the banter of thousands of wholesalers, middlemen and
restaurant owners.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-dawn pallor, men in rubber galoshes creep through the
mist rising from endless rows of frozen tuna. It would be hard to
mistake these buyers, inspecting the three-foot carcasses with
metal prods and flashlights, for the high-flying bidders at an art
auction. But Japanese take their fish very seriously, and when the
beefy, tank-topped auctioneers call out bids at Tokyo Central
Wholesale Market, the stakes can be just as high as at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Or, at least, they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan muddles through its recession, even sushi, the ultimate
Japanese gastronomical obsession, is taking a bite.
</P>
<P>
   Next to rice, fish is perhaps Japan's most basic foodstuff, and
the decline in fish sales has paralleled the nation's economic
slump. Five years ago, the market sold $20.6 million of seafood
each day; this year sales dropped to $14.7 million. A single,
top-quality tuna to be served raw once commanded $20,000; on a
recent visit, the big earner was a 385-pound tuna for $8,346.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy has now contracted for three straight quarters,
and in this climate of anxiety, all but the wealthiest Japanese are
now saving instead of spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst I've seen in 40 years in this business,''
said Makoto Ishida, managing director of Tohto Suisan Co. Ltd., an
auction house at the market.
</P>
<P>
   Today, compared with the height of the bubble economy 10 years
ago, ``price and volume is about 30 to 40 percent down,'' he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan's halcyon days of the 1980s, many people splurged on
the finest delicacies; the most conspicuous consumers sprinkled
gold leaf on their sushi before eating it. Today, while Japanese
staunchly resist cutting sushi out of their diets, many are looking
for ways to adjust their appetites.
</P>
<P>
   ``During this recession, many people are downsizing their
eating, cutting back or eating cheaper sushi,'' said Hirotoshi
Kosode, a senior auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheaper fish is selling more, more expensive fish is selling
less, and some shops are selling cheaper fish, but charging the
same,'' he said darkly.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, cut-rate sushi bars are booming, stealing business
from moderate establishments by catering to gourmands adapting to
leaner times. Chefs at the priciest ``sushiyas,'' meanwhile, are
guarding clientele by maintaining top quality, and confide
gratefully that not everyone has run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people, lower-quality sushi at ``rotation''
restaurants, where customers serve themselves from a conveyor belt
and pay by the number of plates, has a new appeal. Many snubbed
those restaurants in the profligate 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is the all-you-can-eat philosophy, promoted by
the Edokko Zushi chain of restaurants, which offers enormous
portions of high-quality fish at low prices. In a no-frills
environment, Edokko profits from high volume by moving customers
through fast and limiting drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Japanese people, sushi is very traditional and very
important compared to any other food. So even if normal people
can't get expensive stuff, we can still afford to buy cheap
sushi,'' Ishida said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirako Haruko, the owner of the medium-priced Kitahama sushi
bar, arrived early at the wholesale market so she could get the
best fish from middlemen. She said that the number of her customers
has dropped 30 percent since last year, and that each one eats less
than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't buy lower quality,'' she sniffed indignantly at the
suggestion that she economize, saying its more important to
preserve the reputation of her 47-year-old family-run restaurant.
``I prefer that my salary is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Reputation and quality are the mainstays of high-end
restaurants, like Sushi Kyubey, whose outlet at the Hotel Okura has
served the rich and famous for years. Here, the cheapest fare is a
12-gram piece of octopus sashimi for $2.30, while the dearest is a
tiny, mouth-melting morsel of fatty tuna belly &UR;  &LR; for $11.50. Dinner
for one costs about $150 without drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Head chef Makoto Shigihara says the price reflects not only the
highest-quality fish _ a slab of the best tuna breast costs the
restaurant $300 to $600 _ but also stringent quality control, with
two shifts of workers cutting, feeling and tasting the fish, and
sending it back if it's not the finest.
</P>
<P>
   Shigihara admits his is a ``high-society'' restaurant that has
catered to prime ministers and visiting dignitaries, including
President Clinton, who the chef recalls favored maguro tuna and
steamed abalone. But he said that instead of ``expecting customers
to just shut up and eat it ... we make sure the customer is
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   So Shigihara says he buys the best fish in town. He says some
regulars stayed away for a few months to try cheaper locales, but
many are back, because ``once you get used to sushi that suits your
tongue, it's very difficult to adjust your tastebuds just because
of price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sushi is practical and there's no waste,'' Shigihara said.
``You order what you want to eat, you eat everything you order, and
you pay for what you eat. It suits the Japanese lifestyle. That's
why maybe not every sushi restaurant is doing well, but ours still
is.''

SKIP AWAY COULD REACH $10 MILLION PLATEAU AT BREEDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Horses don't race for the practice. This is a money
game, and Skip Away can become the first horse to win $10 million
in purses if he captures the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at
Belmont Park Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cigar holds the record, which includes Europe and Japan, with
$9,999,815. Skip Away stands at $9,506,360 and will soar past the
mark if he takes his third Gold Cup in a row. But Skip Away, who
has won nine graded stakes in a row, seven this year, must win
because the $200,000 place purse won't get the job done. The big
gray, certain to be Horse of the Year, is scheduled to race once
more after Saturday, in the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at
Churchill Downs Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that this is a generous horse who has done
so much for a lot of people,'' said Sonny Hine, who trains Skip
Away (career record 36-18-10-5) for his wife, Carolyn. ``If I can
get him the money title and do it in a race that only Kelso has won
more than twice (five consecutive times, 1960-64), well, I think
that would give Skippy his place as one of the greatest horses of
all time. He doesn't have to convince me that he's one of the
greatest, but this would be a nice thing to get for him. We've been
trying to get these little milestones all along, so people will
take notice of what he's accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelso was great. He was Horse of the Year five times, and
nobody's going to beat that. But I want to see the money record
broken for the horse and my wife. It's also nice to say that I
trained the money-winningest horse in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away will face five foes in the Gold Cup, but it would
appear that only Gentlemen really stands in his way as the other
four seem hopelessly overmatched. Gentlemen, winner of an
impressive $3,408,598, beat Skip Away in last year's Pimlico
Special and ran a strong second to him in the Woodward Stakes at
Belmont Sept. 19. The Gold Cup, at 1 1/4 miles, is an eighth of a
mile longer than the Woodward, which will be to Skip Away's
advantage, but Gentlemen will wear blinkers for the first time in
his career (22-13-2).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting blinkers on him trying to find a way to win,''
said Richard Mandella, who trains Gentlemen for R.D. Hubbard,
chairman of the board of Hollywood Park. ``It is an attempt to get
him to focus more. Not to say that he isn't focused, but I'm
desperate to find a way to get 110 percent out of him. And
sometimes blinkers help do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen signaled that he enjoys the blinkers, going 5 furlongs
in :58 3/5 at Belmont Monday, the first time he had worked with the
help of the rogue's badge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still pumped up from his work the other day,'' said
Mandella. ``I'm happy with the way he's training, but I also know
what I'm up against. Skip Away is a great horse; you don't need to
tell me that. But the thing is, Gentlemen is a great horse, too.
It's true that he's older now (6), and I feel that I haven't had
the same horse at any time this year that I had in the past. When
he was the best, I wouldn't have traded him for any other horse. I
haven't had that this year, so now I'm grasping at straws trying to
find that one thing that will get him over the hump.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   It poured Friday, and the Belmont surface was turned into a sea
of slop. The forecast for Saturday calls for showers, but it should
be of little concern to Skip Away and Gentlemen if the track is off
for the Gold Cup. Skip Away is 3 for 3 on a wet track in his
career, while Gentlemen is 2 for 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track won't bother us if it comes up wet,'' said Hine.
``The last Jockey Club Gold Cup win and his Blue Grass win were
both over wet-fast tracks. Skippy won by more than 6 lengths in
both.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen can run on anything,'' said Mandella. ``Being able
to run on fast tracks, off tracks, and on turf are admirable
traits. Those are things breeders will be attracted to.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   There are four other Grade I races on Saturday's Breeders' Cup
preview card. The $400,000 Frizette Stakes, for 2-year-old fillies
at 1 1/16 miles, is headed by Things Change, listed at 6-5. Sharp
Cat is even money to take the $400,000 Beldame Stakes, for filles
and mares 3 years old and up at 1 1/8 miles. Buck's Boy, at 2-1, is
the horse to beat in the $500,000 Turf Classic, for 3-year-olds and
up at 1 1/2 miles. And the $400,000 Champagne Stakes, for
2-year-old colts at 1 1/16 miles, is wide open, with Tactical Cat
the lukewarm choice at 5-2.

JONES-JOHNSON MATCHUP MAY BE IN THE CARDS  
 TIME NEARING FOR TEBUCKY JONES TO SHOW WHAT HE CAN DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ It's not easy for a rookie to start in the
NFL, but sometimes it's necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Edwards has been forced into the fire, and each week the
running back from Georgia seems to douse the flames that once
seemed to be burning around him.
</P>
<P>
   That time has not quite come for Tebucky Jones, but one must now
wonder, is it around the corner? After all, when the Patriots
drafted the 6-foot-2-inch, 216-pound Syracues defensive back as
their second pick in the first round (22d overall) and decided he
could be a bump-and-run cornerback, the idea was to have him go
against big receivers _ like Keyshawn Johnson, who will be in town
with the Jets Oct. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Will that be Jones's baptism?
</P>
<P>
   ``All along, I've thought about that as a key matchup,'' said
Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``We'll see how it goes this week and
next. We don't have to throw him into the fire. Ty Law is having a
great year and Chris Canty has done a nice job. The urgency to do
it isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans are eager to see more of Jones, a high-profile pick. The
Patriots passed up a chance to take defensive lineman Vonnie
Holliday, who is now starting for the Packers. New England paid
Jones $5.375 million over five years, including a signing bonus of
more than $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Such an investment has to be put to use sometime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm anxious, sure,'' said Jones. ``But patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones says he understands that all of Patriots Nation is
awaiting his arrival at right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go home (to New Britain, Conn.) and stuff ... and
everybody's wondering,'' he said. ``My wife's wondering. She leaves
the games early every week.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Jones is aware of the timetable that has been
established for him, though neither he nor Carroll will say what it
is.
</P>
<P>
   Right now he's limited to special teams. He still hasn't broken
into the substitute packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a big week in practice,'' said Carroll. ``Ty missed
Wednesday's practice, so he had a chance to play that spot. He's
also played on our scout teams and he did a fine job. He's
progressing.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether he played the role of the Chiefs' James Hasty
or Dale Carter against Terry Glenn in practice, Jones said, ``I was
Tebucky Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who will face Carter Sunday when Kansas City visits
Foxboro Stadium, thinks there are a lot of similarities between
Carter and Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not exactly Dale Carter because he doesn't have that type
of experience yet, but he can be in that mode,'' said Glenn.
``Tebucky is strong and he's fast. He has to work on getting
himself in and out of his sets a little more and he'll develop into
a nice player.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jones's situation, Glenn _ a former top draft choice _
said, ``Usually when you're a No. 1 pick, they throw you into the
fire, but they've done a good job not throwing him in. I think in
the long run that's going to help his confidence a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be a good week for Jones to get his baptism, and
don't bet against him seeing some playing time. Jones's case is
slightly different than Edwards's because Edwards is playing the
position he's accustomed to while Jones has had to shift from
strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Ditka told me last week that he would have loved the
chance not to throw some of his young kids into the fire so quickly
but he had no choice,'' said Carroll. ``In this case, we haven't
had to do that to Tebucky. He's been learning his game and position
slowly. When he does get out there, he's going to have had the time
to really study the position he's about to play. We know he's going
to be a superb athlete and a guy we can grow with in the future. We
have to be careful on when we decide the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll likes to reward good play with more playing time. He has
praised the work of Steve Lofton all season. He's been trying to
get Steve Israel back on the field. When Jones assumes a bigger
role, the roles of both veterans will be reduced or eliminated.
When Jones is ready, last year's No. 1 pick, Canty, will likely
have to spend more time on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   There are many personnel decisions Carroll must deal with, but
the bottom line is that Jones needs to be on the field if he's as
good as the Patriots think he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting better and better every day,'' said secondary
coach Ron Lynn. ``He's a joy to be around because he wants to play
so badly and he's receptive to everything we tell him. He has so
much enthusiasm that we can't wait until he gets out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said the staff has often been tempted to just throw Jones
into action, especially against the bigger receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tempted from day one,'' said Lynn. ``Here's a big guy who can
run fast. Hopefully, we're getting close to that day. At some
point, he's going to line up against Keyshawn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who haven't allowed a deep ball this year, don't
want to ruin Jones's confidence by exposing him to getting burned.
But they'll have to pull the trigger soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when I'm standing there on the sidelines, I think
back to when I was a running back and picture myself running with
the ball up and down the field,'' said Jones. ``I'm playing
(special teams) but I'm not playing corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are people who want to see me, but I want to see
me, too. They'll probably break me in in the nickel at first and
then increase it gradually. I go up against Terry Glenn and the
rest of our receivers every day. When I see some other receivers
and compare them to Terry, I say to myself, `I can cover them,'
because there aren't many that compare to Terry. I think I'm as
anxious as anyone to see how I'd do out there.''

HEVENLY ROMANCES GET KISS OF APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Few things make a more attractive movie couple
than romance and magic. They complement each other like popcorn and
real butter. After all, we go to the movies to see and feel;
supernatural love stories guarantee powerful emotions and visions
of things we'll never have in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a lot of other marriages you can name, this match works
on more than just a theoretical basis. Consider how many movies
from Hollywood's golden age involving love with (or at least
facilitated by) the proper ghost, spellcaster, angel or mythic
being still enchant audiences generations after they were made.
</P>
<P>
   Whether comic or dramatic or both, ``Death Takes a Holiday''
(1934), ``Wuthering Heights'' (1939), ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan''
(1941), ``I Married a Witch'' (1942), ``A Guy Named Joe'' (1943),
``Heaven Can Wait'' (1943), ``Blithe Spirit'' (1945), ``Stairway to
Heaven'' (1946), ``The Bishop's Wife'' (1947), ``The Ghost and Mrs.
Muir'' (1947), ``Portrait of Jennie'' (1948) and ``Bell, Book and
Candle'' (1958) have all cast decades-long spells on movie lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Movie makers, too. Rene Clair's antic trick comedy ``I Married a
Witch'' provided the template for the popular '60s TV sitcom
``Bewitched.'' Warren Beatty's 1978 dead-jock-returns-to-Earth hit
``Heaven Can Wait'' was a remake of ``Mr. Jordan'' (not,
interestingly, of Ernst Lubitsch's 1943 ``Heaven Can Wait,'' a
charmer about a ladies' man whose indiscretions don't necessarily
doom him to eternal damnation _ a theme you'd expect Beatty to
appreciate).
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg remade ``Guy Named Joe'' as ``Always'' in 1989;
``Bishop's Wife'' was reborn as the Denzel Washington-Whitney
Houston ``The Preacher's Wife'' two years ago; and ``Death Takes a
Holiday,'' in which the Grim Reaper assumes human form to find out
what makes people tick and discovers that it's love, will be
resurrected next month as a Brad Pitt vehicle, ``Meet Joe Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, fantastic romance bewitches imaginations as well as
hearts. But, oddly, this obviously viable subgenre hasn't engaged
that most reliable measure of movie love _ producers' copycat
instinct _ since the 1940s. Think of it: One good slasher film
instigates a dozen dreadful knockoffs within two years. How many
``Star Wars'' clones assailed us in the '80s? Fifty? One hundred?
</P>
<P>
   Yet every time a supernatural love story does well _ and they
have a remarkably good track record, with such
moderate-to-blockbuster hits as ``Splash,'' ``The Witches of
Eastwick,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Forever Young'' and ``Michael'' in the
last two decades _ it's years before Hollywood attempts to repeat
the commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   This year being the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``This genre has the best track record of commerciality that
there is,'' says Stephen Simon, a producer of ``What Dreams May
Come,'' the Robin Williams afterlife love story that opened to a
sturdy $15.8 million last weekend. ``They just don't make enough of
them. The industry has a rich tradition of making these films;
however, only one or two a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, some of the genre's success has to do with its
relatively few entries. If more fantasy romances were made, we'd
inevitably have more bad dates like ``My Stepmother Is an Alien''
and last year's hardly heavenly ``A Life Less Ordinary,'' a
pistol-packin' angel amour that even Cameron Diaz's magical
charisma couldn't save.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's batch, at least so far, glows with the flush of
connection. The angel-meets-surgeon weeper ``City of Angels,''
itself based on the more cerebral German masterpiece ``Wings of
Desire,'' was the most popular movie of the spring and has been
perched celestially atop the video rental charts for the better
part of a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Black,'' meanwhile, is reportedly wowing preview
audiences. And on Friday, ``Practical Magic'' materializes,
starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman as two witch sisters who
bond around an ancient curse that dooms any men they fall in love
with.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Hoffman, on whose novel ``Practical Magic'' is based, sees
a very sound psychological basis for the magical romance's ongoing
appeal. ``I think that's the reality of the situation,'' she says,
only half joking. ``I think that love and the supernatural are
intertwined. Everybody's always looking for an explanation, from
why do you fall in love with one person instead of another to why
does your best friend fall in love with someone who you think is an
idiot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies like this are trying to make sense out of a situation
that makes no sense, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   As migt be expected, Hollywood types have a rather more
elevated view of these films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the aspect of keeping an open mind to things you can't
explain, in terms of love,'' says ``Practical'' star Bullock.
``It's such a hard thing for us to connect because we're so
vulnerable, but everyone strives for it. Life is so ... hard, if we
don't have something that goes beyond our realm of thinking and
logical deduction, you just say, `Why be on this Earth?'''
</P>
<P>
   This quasi-religious take on a situation as old as human
consciousness indicates why a concentration of these films is
coming together just before the millennium, a date many people
associate with mystical significance and the hope of a new, more
loving era. Even TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' (based on a
movie), initially an action-packed satire of high school horrors,
has recently evolved into a Romeo-Juliet-relationship-with-
a-bloodsucker thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pendulum has swung away from cynicism,'' says
``Practical'' producer Denise Di Novi. ``I don't know where it
comes from exactly, but it's part of human nature to want to
believe that love is the most powerful force in the world. There
are times when we're too beat up to possibly believe it as a
culture, and there are times when we're hanging onto it for dear
life. I think that we're in the latter period right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, arguably, more of a consciousness-raising strain
running through this year's crop of magical romances than has been
the rule in previous incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``Death Takes a Holiday'' and ``Stairway to Heaven,'' in
which a downed airman argued before a celestial court that his time
on Earth was ended too soon, dealt with metaphysical issues. And
Lubitsch's ``Heaven Can Wait,'' though primarily a droll and
sophisticated comedy, makes a rare and profound pitch for cosmic
forgiveness unlike just about anything filmed before or since.
</P>
<P>
   But those films were still primarily about couples connecting
across emotional as well as supernatural gulfs, every bit as much
as ``Ghost'' and ``Splash'' and ``Mrs. Muir'' and all the rest
were.
</P>
<P>
   This year's movies, however, devote a good deal of time to other
issues. ``City of Angels'' and ``What Dreams'' are almost spiritual
mirror images of one another. One is about a heavenly creature's
discovery of earthly joys and pains, while the other focuses on
deceased mortals' efforts to make their ways through a fantastic
afterlife.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Practical Magic'' is as much about sisterhood empowering
than it is about finding Mr. Right.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons why I wrote the book was because I didn't
have a sister, and I wanted to experience what that was like,''
Hoffman reveals. ``That kind of kinship, which is almost mystical,
when you just know someone needs you or is going to call you on the
phone, that's something very rarely seen in films.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their other concerns, though, the new batch of magical
romances doesn't stray far from the tried-and-true fantasy that
love makes the world _ and any other worlds you'd care to imagine _
go 'round.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you tell a love story that transcends death, whether or
not an individual in the audience believes that love could really,
physically expand beyond death, what you're saying as a metaphor is
that love is more important than death,'' explains Ron Bass, who
scripted ``What Dreams May Come'' from a novel by Richard Matheson
_ author of the time-travel romance ``Somewhere in Time'' that
inspired a passionately adored cult movie. ``It is a more important
fact about us that we are capable of love than that we die.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on Earth, Aidan Quinn boils the genre's appeal down to the
basics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starved for a little magic in their lives,'' says
the actor, who plays Bullock's love interest in ``Practical
Magic.'' ``When I met my wife, corny as it sounds, I think we were
meant to meet. I think a lot of people believe that, and it's nice
to see that played out in a dramatic context.''

A GIANT STEP FOR THE BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Their experience is broad and deep, from the
Atlanta Hawks, the Portland Trail Blazers, the San Jose Sharks, the
Carolina Panthers, and the Kansas City Chiefs. The sales staff
comes from basketball, hockey, and football, but at the China Basin
Ballpark Company, they're selling baseball.
</P>
<P>
   For baseball, the most reluctant of big league sports to market
itself, the future of the grand old game may be as bright as its
present. The home run odyssey of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, the
continuing work-ethic elegance of Cal Ripken Jr., and close playoff
contests have rescued baseball from the sour aroma lingering from
1994, a season with no World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's upsurge of renewed fan interest coincides with a
construction boom. Nearly every team has built or is building a new
ballpark, that doubles as destination entertainment center and
family-fun emporium.
</P>
<P>
   Its foundation is built, the girders are up and Pacific Bell
Park will likely be ready for Opening Day for the 2000 season of
the San Francisco Giants. It hasn't been easy, financially or
politically, which is why it may be a model for other cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first privately financed ballpark since Dodger
Stadium in 1962,'' says the team's executive vice president, Larry
Baer. ``An all-private plan is not for everyone. We're not martyrs
here. We had to take a creative approach to raise money and we're
not suggesting that for every city, but the days of 100 percent
public funding seem to be numbered. Every deal now is a hybrid,
with every team contributing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city where most issues are decided by referendum, the
nation's foremost left-wing constituency supports many social
services, but subsidizing baseball is not one of them. Four times
the Giants asked for taxpayer help in referendums; four times, they
struck out. Finally, in 1996, 67 percent of the voters allowed the
Giants to build a privately financed ballpark closer to downtown
than chilly, windswept Candlestick Park, where they have played
since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsorship, even $50 million in naming rights, pours
only so much concrete. The team asked fans to pony up $4,500 for
each charter seat. ``You have legal title in perpetuity to that
seat, and it is fully transferable,'' says R. Michael Patterson,
director of sales, meaning it can be willed or sold. So far, 14,000
charter seats have been sold. Last week, 15,000 regular season
tickets went on sale and sales are brisk, reinforcing the law of
supply and demand for the rest of the 41,000 new seats.
</P>
<P>
   At cavernous Candlestick (now known as 3Com Park), only 8,500
full season tickets were sold this year. When Patterson escorts
potential buyers through his exposed-brick offices here, he points
to pictures of Camden Yards in Baltimore, Jacobs Field in
Cleveland, and Coors Field in Denver, saying, in cadence,
``All-sold-out!'' In luxury suites, 50 of the new park's 65
skyboxes have been rented.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is not a great baseball town. The success of
football's 49ers has created a fandom of front-runners. The Giants,
who have not won a World Series since moving here from New York in
1958, share northern California with the Oakland A's, who have won
four.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing, therefore, is a must. The team is thinking of
occasional 4 p.m. starts, ``since so many people work on an East
Coast schedule,'' according to Baer. This plan would draw
money-managers on Montgomery Street and flex-time telecommuters
from Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Front-runners feed on pennants. ``There clearly is a correlation
between a team in a new ballpark and success on the field,'' says
Baer. ``But the Baltimore Orioles, who had the biggest payroll, did
not fare well on the field this year. There's no guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball is torn by labor strife while pro football is
saddled with sagging dynasties and so-what games. Baseball's moment
is here, but the game on the field is still more important than
luxury suites.

BALANGER'S FIELDING SHOULD EARN HIM HONORED STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Mark Belanger, a .228 lifetime hitter, belongs in
the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Do we not agree that Mark McGwire will someday be inducted into
the Hall because he is classically representative of the impact
sheer power has on the game of baseball? Fine. Then consider this:
The late Mark Belanger was the Mark McGwire of fielding. It's true.
I looked in the dictionary the other day, and under the word
``fielding,'' it said, ``What Mark Belanger did better than anybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years after I left the Orioles,'' says San Diego
Padres coach Merv Rettenmund, ``I was playing against him. I was
thrown a breaking ball that I should have been able to pull and I
hit it up the middle. Mark Belanger was there to throw me out. What
was he doing there? Next time up, I was thrown a fastball that I
shouldn't have been able to pull and I hit it deep into the hole.
Mark Belanger was there to throw me out. What was he doing there?
But that was Mark Belanger. He was the greatest shortstop I ever
saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Martinez discovered the joy of being Mark Belanger's
teammate very early in his career. ``In my very first game,''
recalls the venerable Nicaraguan righthander, ``I had the bases
loaded with nobody out in Detroit. Both Brooks Robinson and Mark
came over to me. They said, `Calm down. Just throw the way you did
in Triple A to get yourself here. Make them hit it and we'll catch
it.' As it turned out, I struck out the side. But in the next
inning, someone hit the ball into the hole and Belanger made the
same kind of play (Derek) Jeter made the other night against
Cleveland (i.e., plant hard on the left leg and make the jump-pass
throw to first). I thought, `Hey, life's gonna be pretty easy up
here.'''
</P>
<P>
   We are living in the Golden Age of shortstops, 'tis true. Never
before in baseball history have we been blessed with such a
collection of two-way threats at this key position. Alex Rodriguez,
Jeter, and Nomar Garciaparra are all sensational hitters who make
all the plays at short. But I have little doubt that if any of the
above trio were to come up with Baltimore while Earl Weaver was
managing, he'd have been advised to learn a new position. Earl
would have wanted the bat, but Belanger was going to be his
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   In his fine tribute in these pages after Belanger's death from
lung cancer at the age of 54 Tuesday, Dan Shaughnessy spoke of the
teeny-tiny glove Belanger used and how he would just about go
postal if anyone else tried to stick his hand in it. Mention of
that glove brings a smile to Rettenmund's face. ``Absolutely,''
Rettenmund says, ``he didn't want anyone to touch it. That glove
was amazing. Just having a catch with him was fascinating. It would
seem as if the ball never even went into his glove at all, that he
could transfer it to his throwing hand before you even realized it.
He would say, `I don't catch the ball; I just redirect it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The tiny glove wasn't his only quirk. He was renowned far and
wide in baseball for his refusal to wear a protective cup inside
his athletic supporter (jock, to you macho guys). ``I've never
known another infielder who wouldn't wear a cup,'' says Rettenmund.
``He always said, `If I have to wear a cup, I can't trust my
hands.'''
</P>
<P>
   What level of offense would it have taken for Belanger to have
gotten more attention from the so-called experts with the notebooks
and computers when Hall of Fame balloting time rolled around? .240?
.270? .290? Ozzie Smith turned himself into a pesky .290/.300 type
of slap hitter. Belanger never did that. He stuck in one weird .287
season, but the .228 lifetime summed up his hitting prowess, though
not necessarily his offensive prowess. ``He was a very good
bunter,'' Rettenmund points out. ``He was a good baserunner, too,
and there were guys he could hit.'' One of them, interestingly
enough, was Nolan Ryan, whom he owned (just as Doug Griffin had a
lease on Jim Palmer).
</P>
<P>
   But why should it be necessary to state, or perhaps even
overstate, his offensive credentials when his calling card was
defense? Shortstop is a defensive position. Year after year,
baseball insiders preach the value of pitching and defense to
winning teams, and year after year, writers print their stories
extolling said values. Don't they believe it? Is it just lip
service? Don't the eight Gold Gloves count for something at the
most demanding defensive position save, perhaps, catching?
</P>
<P>
   Mark Belanger wasn't just a little bit better than his
contemporaries. He was The Man. He completely mastered the
position. But his heyday was before ``SportsCenter'' and even
before ``This Week In Baseball.'' And even if it hadn't been, he
wasn't a highlight kind of guy like, say, Ozzie Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talk about Ozzie, and he was great with the flips and
acrobatics and dives,'' points out Rettenmund. ``But in seven years
as his teammate, I never saw Mark dive for a ball because he never
had to. He was always in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger had expertise in areas where most shortstops don't even
enter into the discussion. ``I played both left and center with
him,'' says Rettenmund. ``When the situation calls for you to hit a
cutoff man, most shortstops just run where they're supposed to, and
what happens happens. But Mark Belanger was able to go out and take
every relay throw chest-high while he was turning to make the throw
to the plate. I never saw him take a throw at his ankles or
anywhere else. I don't know how he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle infielders are woefully underrepresented in the Hall,
anyway, and middle infielders such as Belanger and Bill Mazeroski,
men whose defensive dominance was just as pronounced, and
important, as the numbers put up by slugging types, are shamelessly
ignored. Their continuing absence from Cooperstown is an
embarrassment to the voting body.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps someday the Veterans Committee will rectify the wrong
and get Mark Belanger in. Until then, how about one more story from
Merv Rettenmund?
</P>
<P>
   ``After I had played with Mark in 1968 and 1969, I went to
winter ball,'' he says. ``I was playing center one day and I was in
my defensive position when someone hit a ball up the middle. I
guess I was slow to react, and the ball got by me. I couldn't
understand what the ball was doing there. I thought if a ball was
hit up the middle, the shortstop would catch it. But I had
forgotten. I was used to playing with Mark Belanger.''

<P>
   PROZAC (Undated) _ With Prozac coming off patent, the world's
drug companies are in a dog-eat-dog battle to win its place as the
leading brand-name antidepressant. Not only is the competition
nasty, but there's some question whether the process will produce

David J. Morrow

<P>
   LONG-TERM-CAPITAL (Undated) _ Bond traders had nicknamed
Long-Term Capital Management ``Salomon North,'' a reference to the
many partners in the Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund who were veterans
of Salomon Brothers. But a more apt choice might have been ``M.I.T.
South.'' The people _ and the mathematical ``rocket science'' _ at
the core of the elite hedge fund had strong ties to the

was far closer to the studied tranquillity of academia than to a
frenetic trading floor. By Douglas Frantz and Peter Truell.

ALL THE FIXIN'S FOR AN OLD-FASHIONED SOUTHERN FEUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Back in the days when Georgia football was a Top
10 fixture, big games used to come through Sanford Stadium with the
regularity of a midsummer thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big deal, of course, when teams came to play Between
the Hedges, and the Dawgs would show folks what Georgia football
was all about. The likes of Alabama, Auburn, and LSU would fill
coach Vince Dooley's dance card, making this place one of the
meccas of college football.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in the late '80s and '90s. Oh, the Dawgs still won
their share of games, but Dooley, ending a 25-year reign as Top
Dawg, moved up to the athletic director's chair and the really big
games gradually disappeared as his successor, Ray Goff, won more
than six games only twice in seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the passion for Georgia football remained, which is why
there is an old-time feeling around here surrounding this
afternoon's Southeastern Conference matchup with Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Big? Why, it's so big that the folks from ESPN's ``College
Football Game Day'' will set up shop here Saturday, making their
first appearance ever.
</P>
<P>
   You have to go back to the early post-Herschel Walker days to
find a more intriguing battle than the meeting between the
unbeaten, seventh-ranked Bulldogs and the unbeaten, fourth-ranked
Volunteers; in fact, you have to go all the way back to 1983 to
find the last game played here between two Top 10 teams.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, you also have the fixin's for an
old-fashioned Southern feud.
</P>
<P>
   Now if you listen to Georgia coach Jim Donnan and Tennessee
coach Phil Fulmer, it's not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   That's flat out wrong. It is still big stuff and it will add an
even bigger edge to a game that will establish the front-runner not
only in the SEC East race but also in the quest for the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity stems from last year's game in Knoxville, a 38-13
spanking by the Vols that the Georgia folks felt was unduly harsh
because Fulmer chose to keep starting quarterback Peyton Manning in
the game long after the outcome had been decided.
</P>
<P>
   The situation became even more tense when Manning wrapped up the
Volunteers' scoring for the day by throwing a touchdown pass with
1:44 left.
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, who was brought in two years ago to replace Goff,
thought that was a bit much and told Fulmer so privately in their
postgame midfield meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer responded by making Donnan's remarks public, which
incensed the Georgia coach even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret what I said,'' said Donnan, who has steadily
rebuilt the Georgia program into a national power _ the Dawgs have
lost only once in 10 games since falling to Tennessee. ``What I
regret is the fact that he made it public after I whispered it in
his ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan, who has more weapons than ever before in his three years
at Georgia _ most notably freshman quarterback Quincy Carter and
all-around talent Champ Bailey, who plays offense and defense and
is making a Charles Woodson-type run at the Heisman Trophy _ says
it is time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any disagreements with him,'' Donnan said. ``He's
got to coach his team. I've got to coach mine. That happened and
it's over with and we're playing this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer is also saying it's best to let sleeping Dawgs lie. When
asked about Manning's pass, Fulmer said, ``I don't think that has
any place in this ballgame. He's not going to pay a down and
neither am I.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Fulmer, neither is his best player, tailback
Jamal Lewis, who is out for the year with a knee injury. That could
end not only the Vols' national championship hopes but also their
domination of Georgia, a winning streak that dates back to 1988.

   KAPELL-MUSIC (Undated) _ By the time William Kapell died in a
plane crash in October 1953, at 31, he had already come to be
recognized as the finest pianist America had produced. The popular
pianists at the time were foreign-born: Horowitz, Rubinstein,
Brailowsky, Hofmann. As an artist he was stupefyingly gifted, and
everyone knew it. By his mid-20s he had a major career, a contract
with RCA Victor, dates with Ormandy, Stokowski, Reiner, Monteux and
Steinberg. His recording of Khachaturian's Concerto with
Koussevitzky became a jukebox hit. Then he died, and as often
happens, the fame faded. His recordings went out of print by 1960,
and after that only a few were available occasionally. Pianists
still talked of him as an icon who had paved the way for the first
generation of Americans to make a mark on the international scene.

   AGA-KHAN-ARCHITECTURE (Undated) _ Aga Khan: the name shimmers
with glamour. Fabulous wealth. Palatial houses. Racehorses. Yachts.
Jewels. Royal prerogative. As if that weren't enough, the Aga Khan
is also the most important figure in the world of architecture
today. In a ceremony at the Alhambra in Spain last Friday, Prince
Karim Aga Khan honored seven buildings and urban plans, winners of
the 1998 Aga Khan Awards for Architecture. By Herbert Muschamp.

   ZONCA-FILMS (Paris) _ Erick Zonca, 42, the French movie
director, first film ``The Dreamlife of Angels,'' closes the New
York Film Festival on Sunday. It is, so to speak,
post-autobiographical. Nonetheless, it is a first film in that it
came out of nowhere: even in the French movie business, few people
had heard of Erick Zonca. Until, that is, ``The Dreamlife of
Angels'' was given a 12-minute ovation at this year's Cannes
International Film Festival and Elodie Bouchez and Natacha Regnier,
who play the lead roles, went on to share the festival's best
actress award. By Alan Riding. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JANE-ADAMS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ A profile of Jane Adams, 32,
the star of Todd Solondz's ``Happiness.'' Comic and unsettling,
``Happiness'' (which opens on Friday) takes three sisters (Ms.
Adams, Lara Flynn Boyle, Cynthia Stevenson) in suburban New Jersey
and peels the lid off their apparently ordinary lives to reveal a
microcosm of modern-day isolation. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SO-CALLED-LIFE-VIDEO (Undated) _ As they say, the good die
young. But in television the good can sometimes enjoy an afterlife,
and so it is with ``My So-Called Life'': six hourlong episodes
(including the pilot) will be released on video on Tuesday by BMG.
Critics weren't universally in love with the series, but most
acknowledged its realism and strong individual voice. By Peter M.
Nichols. (Moved).

   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIAN-SPRING-DANCE (Denver) _ As he waited for curtain
calls at the gala closing of the old Metropolitan Opera House in
1966, Martin Fredmann, 23, then a dancer with the Metropolitan
Opera Ballet, felt a pinch on his bottom. He turned to discover
Martha Graham. She gave him a big wink. It was the only time
Fredmann met Graham. Now artistic director of Colorado Ballet in
Denver, he could probably use another pinch and wink. The
improbable irony of the intervening years is that Fredmann, whose
background is in classical ballet, is a lynch pin in an experiment
that might give Graham's modern-dance repertory a more secure lease
on life. Next weekend Colorado Ballet presents the first major
production by an American ballet company of a Graham work when it
performs ``Appalachian Spring.'' By Jan Ellen Spiegel. (Moved).

<P>
   RIDGE-THEATER (New York) _ The Ridge Theater is an avant-garde
company with the unbuttoned charm of ex-hippies who have made a
name in experimental theater for staging multimedia spectacles with
tidy, Swiss-watch precision. ``Looking at us, you'd think we're
aging slackers,'' says Bob McGrath, 43, the group's artistic
director. Finding order in ``Chaos,'' a new opera the Ridge is
staging at the Kitchen, through Oct. 24, seems a suitable task for
the company, which for 11 years has favored stories that accent the
sinister side of popular culture. By Steven Drukman. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   DAVIS-THEATER-ARTIST (Undated) _ In Paul Davis's theater
posters, one can see the essence of the original performance: the
arrogant charm of Raul Julia's Mack the Knife in ``Threepenny
Opera,'' Sam Waterston crying out his rage in ``Hamlet,'' the
Orientalized elegance of Irene Worth in ``The Cherry Orchard'' and
the full range of Kevin Kline's virtuosity as Hamlet, Richard III
and the Pirate King in ``The Pirates of Penzance. As an artist,
Davis made his reputation with these posters and others he drew for
Joseph Papp during the heyday of the New York Shakespeare Festival
in the 1970s and 1980s. By Mel Gussow. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HUNTER-HENLEY-THEATER (Undated) _ If Holly Hunter and Beth
Henley had not been stuck in an elevator together 16 years ago on
their way to an audition for Ms. Henley's play ``The Wake of Jamey
Foster,'' the two would have found each other eventually. Ms.
Hunter has appeared in six Henley plays and on Thursday she will
open in the seventh, ``Impossible Marriage,'' a production by the
Roundabout Theater Company at the Laura Pels Theater. By Robin
Pogrebin. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-PUBLISH (Undated) _ Historically, getting a musical
composition published was more than a practical way of putting a
new score into circulation. It was a tangible sign that a composer
had arrived on the scene and was to be taken seriously. That
situation has changed. The music publishing business was already in
crisis some 15 years ago, when personal computer programs enabled
composers to create manuscripts as attractive and legible as
engraved published scores. Now that such programs have become less
complicated and more flexible, the computer-generated score is the
standard. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BEETHOVEN-MUSIC (Undated) _ Playing Beethoven is one of the two
most important things a symphony orchestra has to do, along with
performing new works. We need to keep going back to Beethoven. And
we need to keep thinking about why we need to keep going back.
Opportunities to go back, but not so much to think about why, were
recently offered by the New York Philharmonic and its music
director, Kurt Masur. Their season-opening Beethoven cycle was,
remarkably, the Philharmonic's first compact presentation of the
Beethoven symphonies since Toscanini conducted the works in the
orchestra's centenary year, 1942. A lot has happened since 1942.
Increased knowledge of Beethoven's contemporaries has enhanced our
awareness both of how far he stood apart and of how close he was to
other composers of his age in his Romantic urgings and his
revolutionary hopes. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   DYLAN-1966-MUSIC (Undated) _ Things got ugly when Bob Dylan
performed on May 17, 1966, at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester,
England. A good part of the audience was actively hostile to
Dylan's non-protest songs and his bluesy electric band: catcalling,
shouting insults, clapping in an attempt to drown out the music. It
was all duly recorded by Columbia Records, which finally releases
Dylan's ``Live 1966'' (two CDs) this week. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BETTY-CARTER-APPRAISAL (Undated) _ Jazz singer, composer,
arranger nonpareil _ Betty Carter, who died on Sept. 26 at the age
of 69, was all these things. But along with her own music, she
leaves another significant legacy with the musicians she nurtured,
the careers she helped shape. Over the last two decades, her band
was an incubator for jazz talent, and many young musicians who
honed their skills with Ms. Carter are now making their mark as
leaders. Eight almuni recall the lessons they learned from a
beloved teacher and inspiring taskmaster. By Fletcher Roberts.

   APPLE-BERLIN-ARTS (Berlin) _ Reunification has reshuffled the
artistic deck in Berlin. The scaffolding surrounding the great
Pergamon Altar, a masterpiece of Hellenistic art from the 2nd
century B.C., has come down. One of the main attractions on the
Museum Island, where other museums are also under repair, it
reopened to the public in August, cleaned and restored, though work
remains to be done. The big event of the summer was the opening in
June of the new Gemaldegalerie, or picture gallery, where the
Prussian state collection of Old Masters _ divided by the Cold War,
like Berlin, between East and West _ has been reassembled. By R.W.
Apple Jr. (Moved).

   CALLOWAY-BEARSLEY-ART (London) _ In the grand tradition of
English eccentrics, Stephen Calloway, 47, has made his passion for
the past into a way of life so convincingly anachronistic that an
afternoon spent with him discussing his most recent project seems
like a step back into the vanished world he has been obsessed with
since he was a child. An associate curator of drawings and prints
at the Victoria and Albert Museum, he organized the Aubrey
Beardsley retrospective that opened there Thursday, to mark the
centenary of the artist's death. The exhibition of more than 200
works, most drawn from the museum's extensive Beardsley holdings,
remains on view through Jan. 10. By Martin Filler. (Moved). Photo.

   TV-PROGRAMMING (Undated) _ One of the few traditions left in the
television programming business is the premiere of new shows each
fall. Since the advent of cable and satellite distribution, the
addition of quasi-networks like UPN and the WB, and the dispersal
of the old network audience across a wide range of other interests
and technologies, there is no longer a fixed schedule for the debut
of new product. Shows pop up on the prime-time schedule year round
now, each one vying to find an audience, fast, in a world of
hairtrigger remotes and short attention spans. By Jeff MacGregor.

HIGH COURT TO HEAR ANOTHER SUIT ON CENSUS SAMPLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Conn., Mass., Minn., Mo., Pa., Wis.)   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Friday added a second census
case to its calendar for argument next month, an action that could
substantially increase the odds of producing a definitive and
relatively quick ruling on whether the Clinton administration can
proceed with its plan to use statistical sampling to correct an
expected undercount in the next census.
</P>
<P>
   The latest case is an appeal by the administration from a ruling
two weeks ago by a special three-judge U.S District Court in
Richmond, Va. That court ruled, in a suit brought by 16 individuals
and by Cobb County, Ga., that federal law bars the use of sampling
for the purpose of apportioning congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   A separate three-judge panel here issued a nearly identical
ruling in August, in a suit brought by the House of
Representatives. But while the Supreme Court agreed last month to
hear the administration's appeal of that decision, doubts about
whether the House was the proper party to bring the suit remain an
obstacle to the justices' ability to decide the merits of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is vigorously disputing the House's legal
standing, arguing that it will continue to have 435 members and to
exercise the same constitutional authority no matter how the census
is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration also plans to dispute the standing of
the plaintiffs in the new case, Clinton vs. Glavin, No. 98-564, the
court's precedents put this case on firmer procedural ground. The
16 plaintiffs live in six states that the lower court found are
``substantially likely'' to lose a seat in the House if the census
is adjusted through the use of sampling, because population would
be shifted through the statistical adjustment to other states.
Consequently, the lower court found, these individuals' claim to
standing is based on an allegation of prospective ``vote dilution''
of the sort the Supreme Court has recognized in the past as a basis
for challenging an apportionment plan.
</P>
<P>
   The six states are Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to claiming vote dilution at the federal level, the
plaintiffs maintain that with sampling they will suffer in the
state redistricting that follows the 2000 census and that their
states will get less than their rightful share of money under
various federal grants and programs that are based on population.
The traditional census head count misses millions of people, and
misses them differentially, with urban residents, the poor and
members of minority groups uncounted more frequently than others.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing Friday to hear the case, the justices granted a
request filed jointly by the administration and the plaintiffs to
handle the appeal on a highly expedited basis. The argument will
take place Nov. 30 in a time slot already reserved for the earlier
case, Department of Commerce vs. U.S. House of Representatives, No.
98-404. The court set aside 90 minutes instead of the usual hour to
hear the arguments, which will cover both cases.

 &HT;    Panel may decide method of HIV reporting
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The contentious debate over how best to track people
infected with the AIDS virus will likely be revived at Friday's
meeting of the Georgia AIDS Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether the state should use people's names or
special number codes to record HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
   Because of recent advances in AIDS drugs, the numbers of
AIDS-related deaths and cases of full-blown AIDS are down, and the
numbers of people living with HIV are up. Consequently, deaths and
AIDS cases are no longer useful in measuring the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Previous task force discussions on HIV surveillance have
deteriorated into vehement arguments.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are community advocates who fear that using names in
HIV reporting would create opportunities for breaches of
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has spoken out very strongly against names
reporting,'' said Jeff Graham, executive director of the
Atlanta-based AIDS Survival Project.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are health officials who say names reporting
provides the highest level of accuracy, vital to compiling
statistics on the epidemic. Such statistics are used in directing
efforts and acquiring funding for programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on years of surveillance experience and scientific
evaluation, names-based systems are currently the most likely to
provide the quality of information needed to guide HIV prevention
and treatment efforts,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for
HIV, STD and TB Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we also recognize the need for states to have flexibility
in designing surveillance systems that meet their overall needs,''
Gayle added.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, which has no regulatory authority, has not yet issued
its recommendations about HIV surveillance methods.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, however, the state task force may decide to endorse a
particular reporting method. The task force, comprised of nearly 40
doctors, community advocates and others, advises the state
Department of Human Resources.

INVESTMENT INTERESTS PRESS FOR U.S.-IRAN THAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE LEVINE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Richard Morningstar, the White House
special adviser on Caspian Sea affairs, had just fulfilled one of
his principal missions _ defending the U.S. law restraining
investment in Iran. Then he got an earful.
</P>
<P>
   It was Carl Burnett, president of Mobil Oil's Kazakhstan
subsidiary, who made it clear that the company would honor U.S.
law, but under protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobil is against the sanctions on Iran,'' Burnett said at an
oil conference in a downtown hotel this week. ``We think it does
more harm than good.''
</P>
<P>
   The charged dispute in this sedate, tree-lined city was another
sign of the pressure on Washington and Tehran to reconcile swiftly
so that, among other things, two-way trade _ severed for almost two
decades _ can resume.
</P>
<P>
   But it told a broader story as well _ a story of the enviable
position in which, at least for now, energy-rich Kazakhstan has
found itself during the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment has drained from most emerging markets,
global crude prices have plummeted, and doubts have even begun to
be raised as to how much oil actually lies under the Caspian. Yet
hundreds of millions of dollars have continued to pour into the
region, which has maintained its stature as the most prized oil
property in the world.
</P>
<P>
   By urging an examination of investment prospects in Iran _ which
abuts the Caspian's southern shore _ rather than discussing how to
get out, Burnett has underscored how interest in this former Soviet
region seems to persist almost unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there is concern,'' Morningstar said at a news
conference on Thursday, ``but generally there is a belief among the
companies that the demand for oil and gas, while affected to some
extent, will still be substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every global oil company has bought oil or natural gas
fields in this Central Asian republic of 17 million people since it
won independence in the 1991 Soviet breakup. The oil grab has been
part of a regionwide frenzy that has encompassed Azerbaijan and, to
a lesser degree, Turkmenistan. In all, foreign companies have
already pledged some $50 billion in energy investment in the area
around the Caspian, the world's largest inland sea.
</P>
<P>
   To some experts, the level of interest _ motivated by estimates
ranging up to a staggering 200 billion barrels of oil in the region
as a whole _ has been premature and perhaps even unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention, for example, has been attracted by an unproven
offshore Kazakhstan oilfield called Kashagan. Judging by seismic
studies, geologists say the salt domes that make up Kashagan may
hold a giant oilfield surpassing anything discovered on the
Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   Test drilling will begin only in the first half of next year.
Yet just last month, Phillips Petroleum and Japan's Inpex paid
Kazakhstan an up-front bonus of $500 million for a one-seventh
share of Kashagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a lot of money for an unproven field,'' said a senior
U.S. oil executive at the conference, who insisted on not being
identified. ``But it shows how much these companies want to be part
of it in case it hits.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, neither the industry slump nor Russia's economic
chaos kept more than 400 oil executives from gathering in Almaty
for a two-day conference. And the dominant topic involved their
greatest test of tenacity _ their long wait for a solution to the
Caspian's main problem, its lack of a reliable way to transport oil
to market.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Middle East, this area is landlocked, and it has no
independent export pipeline. As a Soviet-era legacy, all the
region's pipelines instead traverse Russia, which has routinely
obstructed the export of oil and natural gas from its former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar, who coordinates White House efforts to
counterbalance Russia and Iran on the Caspian, said he expected the
first sign of a resolution this month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chiefly, by the end of October a U.S.-dominated foreign
consortium in Azerbaijan is to announce whether it supports a key
element of a White House-sponsored East-West Transportation
Corridor, bypassing both Russia and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The administration envisions the construction of pipelines from
Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan across the Caspian to a hub in the
Azerbaijan capital of Baku. From Baku, the line would continue on
through Georgia to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, hence
averting either a Russian or Iranian chokehold on Caspian energy.
</P>
<P>
   The Azerbaijan consortium is deciding whether to endorse that
plan, or a Moscow-backed proposal to build the pipeline instead to
the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baku-Ceyhan offers the best option to address our mutual
strategic interests,'' Morningstar asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Morningstar said he expected final Moscow approval
this month on a separate, $2.3 billion, 960-mile pipeline from a
giant Kazakhstan oilfield called Tengiz, which is being developed
by a consortium led by Chevron and Mobil. The pipeline would also
end at Novorossisk.
</P>
<P>
   The recent thaw in relations between Washington and Tehran has
undermined some of the rationale for the administration's refusal
to consider what some view as the most economical idea _ a pipeline
crossing Iran, which abuts the Caspian's southern shore.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, American law has threatened sanctions against any
company, from the United States or abroad, investing more than $20
million in Iran. But suddenly investor interest in Iran has
appeared far more credible, particularly in recent months as Iran
has opened up some of its fields. Among U.S. companies, Mobil has
led efforts to repeal the law.
</P>
<P>
   Mobil has asked the administration to allow it to ``swap'' oil
with Iran _ that is, to ship some of its Tengiz crude across the
Caspian to northern Iran. In exchange, Iran would deliver an
equivalent volume to Mobil ships at the Gulf port of Kharg.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett, of Mobil's Kazakhstan subsidiary, said the company also
favored the construction of a trans-Iranian pipeline from the
Caspian.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're younger than 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel
to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Antz G
</P>
<P>
   A visual picnic, a so-so script. This computer-animated feature
tells of worker ant Z (voice of Woody Allen) whose love of Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone) lands both of them in the scary world outside
the ant colony. It's fun, but the story is as predictable as the
spectacular visuals are not. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   While ``Deep Impact'' treated a similar let's-save-Earth story
with sobriety, ``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global
annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with
Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a
summer popcorn movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard
flick ``Godzilla.'' And you'll see the reported $165 million budget
onscreen in the impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the
movie good for you? Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster
action, implied sex and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Visually, this update of the '60s TV series pays witty homage to
the original's vein of Carnaby Street surrealism. In between sips
of champagne and civilized quips, agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) foil criminals plotting against
the British government. But there are two problems: a half-baked
script and Thurman, who's trumped by the cool, feline memory of
Diana Rigg, who originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Clay Pigeons R
</P>
<P>
   A good indy cast, including Joaquin Phoenix as a framed,
small-town everyman, Janeane Garofalo as a dry FBI agent, and
especially Vince Vaughn as a giggling, psycho good ol' boy can't
save this arch, overplotted ``Fargo'' wannabe. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a comet hurtling toward Earth. Showing at
area discount theaters, director Mimi Leder's thriller shows that
catastrophes can be measured one life at a time. The strong cast
includes Tea Leoni as an ambitious reporter and Robert Duvall as an
aging astronaut sent to blow the comet to bits. 2 hours, 3 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a small-town high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. 44 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fakin' da Funk R
</P>
<P>
   A message movie that's weakened a bit by heavy reliance on
stereotypes and a predictable plot. An adoption agency mistakenly
gives Ernie Hudson and Pam Grier a Chinese baby. (Their last name
is Lee). They keep it. And he, in turn, adopts the notion that he
is black. But when the Lees move from Atlanta to South Central Los
Angeles the boys in the hood are quick to tell Dante Basco he's
``Fakin Da Funk.'' 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Sonia Murray) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Firelight R
</P>
<P>
   This Gothic romantic drama set in the 1830s could use a little
more fire and a lot lighter touch. Still, it burns with
intelligence, craft and psychological resonance. A Swiss governess
(Sophie Marceau) agrees to bear a child for an aloof English
aristocrat (Stephen Dillane), then disappear from his life. But
their ``business'' arrangement is complicated by feelings both
romantic and maternal. A quiet, emotionally assured film that
respects its characters and its audience. 1 hour, 44 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way this
extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its yearlong
hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short of being even
solid summer escapism. Bikini atoll resident Godzilla comes to nest
in Manhattan when it's time to think of family matters. Matthew
Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail. 2 hours, 19
minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Man PG
</P>
<P>
   A mild comedy-drama that wastes Eddie Murphy's talents as a New
Age drifter who brings big sales and enlightenment to home shopping
producer Jeff Goldblum and media analyst Kelly Preston. It's
Hollywood's latest reduction of spiritual values to ``give somebody
a hug.''1 hour, 53 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This movie never flies, but never sinks, either. Sandra Bullock
teams up with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for
this affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town
home to lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. 1 hour, 54
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Impostors R
</P>
<P>
   Flawed as it is, this slight, silly film is impossible to
dislike. It's too full of talented funny people such as Lili
Taylor, Campbell Scott, Dana Ivey and Steve Buscemi. Stanley Tucci
and Oliver Platt star as two out-of-work actors who stow away on a
luxury liner. The '30s setting reflects the movie's screwball
aspirations, which it never quite achieves. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Knock Off R
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Van Damme returns in _ surprise! _ an action movie
about an American salesman working in Hong Kong who becomes aware
of a terrorist conspiracy. Directed by Hong Kong action auteur Tsui
Hark. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-'em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lolita R
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lyne's version of Vladimir Nabokov's acclaimed novel
about a grown man (Jeremy Irons) sexually obsessed with a
pre-pubescent girl (Dominique Swain) is neither a triumph nor a
travesty. It's just okay, which, given the source, suggests that
the director had little affinity for the material besides its name
value. The result is an overlong, sometimes sluggish film that opts
for Victoria's Secret gauze over the black comedy of Stanley
Kubrick's 1962 version. 2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   This is a faithful and fun adaptation of the series of
children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even boys should take to the scooter-riding rascal Pepito)
and nostalgic enough for adults. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill
Vejnoska, c. 1998 Cox News Service) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas, who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautiful,
spirited daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones) from the evil schemes of
one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert blend of panache,
romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor. 2 hours, 16 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Night at the Roxbury PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Those head-bopping, nightclubbing brothers from ``Saturday Night
Live'' are out in a full-fledged story. Well, as full-fledged as
you can get when your central characters are a couple of clueless,
would-be coolsters whose dream is getting into, and then owning,
the hottest club in town. Lots of groaningly funny lines and a
surprisingly coherent story line make this a fun, thankfully
concise viewing experience. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska, c.
1998 Cox News Service) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Nights of Cabiria NR
</P>
<P>
   Carefully restored version of Fellini's 1957 Oscar winner,
starring his wife, Giuletta Masina, as a downtrodden yet
indomitable hooker wandering through the streets of Rome cloaked in
a ratty fur and unquenchable optimism. The current print hasn't
just been spruced up; an entire section _ ``the man in the sack,''
about a Good Samaritan who feeds the poor _ has been re-included.
Note to Fellini fans: This is early Fellini. Simple. Toned down.
Lovely. 1 hour, 57 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   One True Thing R
</P>
<P>
   Strikes too many false notes. Renee Zellweger plays a career
journalist who goes home to care for her dying homemaker mother
(Meryl Streep). Streep's performance is terrific, but the movie
suffers from generic slickness. 2 hour, 7 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   One Tough Cop R
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baldwin stars as a NYPD detective torn between duty to
his badge or to a childhood pal (Mike McGlone) who is now a member
of a crime family. This solid cop procedural is fact-based, but
plays like a dozen fictional flicks you've seen before. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth twins who
meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting their divorced
parents. Young kids may fidget at the length and several kissing
scenes. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 45 minutes. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Pecker R
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong plays a Baltimore kid whose grainy photos bring
him New York art scene fame in John Waters' new comedy. Like all
Waters' films, it's a very mixed bag of raunch and sweetness, smart
satire and dumb comedy. 1 hour, 27 minutes. (SM) Grade C+
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not Perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealhy
wife`s lover to kill her. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Ronin R
</P>
<P>
   The title suggests a close friend of Rodan or Godzilla, but it
actually refers to shamed samurai who, having lost their master,
are for hire. Robert De Niro and Jean Reno lead some modern-day
``ronin'' _ Cold Warriors without a war _ hired to snatch a
mysterious suitcase. Director John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian
Candidate'') and an unbilled David Mamet (``The Spanish Prisoner'')
bring a cool professional touch to this crackling
action-suspense-thriller that's fun and smart. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Rounders R
</P>
<P>
   Director John Dahl (``The Last Seduction'') has a couple of very
hot aces up his sleeve _ Matt Damon and Edward Norton _ in this
nifty movie about the addictive lure of high-stakes poker. Damon is
a former card sharp who's managed to kick the habit and concentrate
on his law studies. Norton is his old friend, fresh out of jail,
who lures him back. A pungent, character-rich picture that's a lot
less about where it goes than how it gets there. Rated R for nudity
and language. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Rush Hour PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Kung Fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. You'll howl as Chan and Tucker learn to work
together, in part by imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one
works. 1 hours, 37 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B

<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all around here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Simon Birch PG
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems. In the early 1960s, a
pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is
convinced he will one day be a hero while his best pal (Joseph
Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real father (Ashley
Judd is Mazzello's closemouthed mom). The movie is clearly a labor
of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through. Rated PG for
violence (a scary bus accident) and sexual innuendo. 1 hour, 50
minutes. (ER) Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' only without the romance or the
adventure in this movie. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and
Anne Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on
an island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some
pirates. The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. 1 hour,
41 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Small Soldiers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Action- and violence-packed movie is heavy on computer-generated
effects but woefully light on plot twists or interesting characters
(either flesh-and-blood or plastic). Borrowing liberally from too
many other movies, action figures come alive, start warring with
each other (and any human who gets in their way) and destroy an
idyllic small-town neighborhood. 1 hour 49 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries R
</P>
<P>
   Family matters and more are examined in this thoughtful
adaptation of Kaylie Jones' semi-autobiographical book about
growing up in the '60s and '70s (her father was writer James
Jones). The scattered, vignette-ish approach may bother some _ the
movie is like a personal memoir divided into three separate but
equal short stories _ but the film's sense of memory as an
emotional tapestry made up of many people and incidents rings true.
2 hours, 4 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious. Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high
school senior who suffers a bathroom mishap that keeps him from
attending his prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz).
Thirteen years later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down. The movie is liberating in its
scatological, slapstick way. But the easy-to-offend should find
something more polite to watch. 1 hour, 58 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Touch of Evil NR
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic about corruption and lust in a
small Mexican border town has been re-created as the filmmaker
originally envisioned it. Small changes and some technical tweaking
render the film more coherent without losing its nightmarish,
B-movie edge. Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh star as newlyweds
whose honeymoon is interrupted by murder. Welles is decadence
incarnate as Capt. Quinlan, the lawman gone wrong. 1 hour, 51
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show R
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative social satire. It's about a cheerful insurance salesman
who slowly realizes his entire life has been a TV show and all the
people he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this dazzlingly
executed concept and the strong cast includes Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. 1 hour, 44 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Urban Legend R
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Witt and Jared Leto star in the latest knockoff of
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The
college-campus, teen-kill thriller is slickly made, well played,
instantly forgettable. 1 hour, 39 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   What Dreams May Come PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ``Ghost'' directed by Terry Gilliam and you'll have some
idea of this tear-jerker phantasmagoria. Robin Williams stars as a
doctor exploring aspects of the afterlife after he's killed in a
car crash. Annabella Sciorra is his widow; Cuba Gooding Jr., his
spiritual guide. The movie is emotionally and visually stunning, a
little simplistic story-wise. But sometimes simplistic can be
startlingly close to primal. Check your cynicism at the door and
bring a box of Kleenex. 1 hour, 46 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. Rated R for language, sex scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (The Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends and Neighbors R
</P>
<P>
   Neil LaBute, who did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,''
suffers a sophomore slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex
games and power plays among six thirtysomething urbanites. Rated R
for sex and language. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're younger than 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel
to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting Golden Retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Antz G
</P>
<P>
   A visual picnic, a so-so script. This computer-animated feature
tells of worker ant Z (voice of Woody Allen) whose love of Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone) lands both of them in the scary world outside
the ant colony. It's fun, but the story is as predictable as the
spectacular visuals are not. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   While ``Deep Impact'' treated a similar let's-save-Earth story
with sobriety, ``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global
annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with
Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a
summer popcorn movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard
flick ``Godzilla.'' And you'll see the reported $165 million budget
onscreen in the impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the
movie good for you? Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster
action, implied sex and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Visually, this update of the '60s TV series pays witty homage to
the original's vein of Carnaby Street surrealism. In between sips
of champagne and civilized quips, agents John Steed (Ralph Fiennes)
and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) foil criminals plotting against
the British government. But there are two problems: a half-baked
script and Thurman, who's trumped by the cool, feline memory of
Diana Rigg, who originated the role. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Blade R
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, a really cool
leather coat and Kris Kristofferson (a kind of high-tech Gabby
Hayes), Blade is devoted to wiping out all vampires. Especially a
strutting bloodsucker played by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the
non-stop slash 'n' gnash action becomes more repetitive than
anything else. Rated R for extreme violence and strong language. 2
hours. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Clay Pigeons R
</P>
<P>
   A good indy cast, including Joaquin Phoenix as a framed,
small-town everyman, Janeane Garofalo as a dry FBI agent, and
especially Vince Vaughn as a giggling, psycho good ol' boy can't
save this arch, overplotted ``Fargo'' wannabe. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Dance With Me PG
</P>
<P>
   A guilty, quick-stepping pleasure. Vanessa L. Williams plays a
Houston dance instructor who hopes to recapture past dance
competition glory with the help of a Cuban newcomer (Latin music
star Chayanne). Original it isn't, but ``Dance'' is great fun. It's
the first film that lets Williams show off her knockout dancing,
and in his first Hollywood flick, Chayanne goes for the summer's
heartthrob title. 2 hours, 6 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Dead Man on Campus R
</P>
<P>
   Some passable laughs, but it doesn't make the honor roll. Two
college students (Tom Everett Scott and Mark-Paul Gosselaar) hope a
kamikaze frat boy (Lochlyn Munro), will share their dorm suite.
And, preferably, kill himself in one of his misadventures. That's
because an odd clause at their college gives students an automatic
4.0 average if their roommate offs himself. Rated R for drug use,
language and crude sexual humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 36
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a comet hurtling toward Earth. Showing at
area discount theaters, director Mimi Leder's thriller shows that
catastrophes can be measured one life at a time. The strong cast
includes Tea Leoni as an ambitious reporter and Robert Duvall as an
aging astronaut sent to blow the comet to bits. 2 hours, 3 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a small-town high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. 44 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fakin' da Funk R
</P>
<P>
   A message movie that's weakened a bit by heavy reliance on
stereotypes and a predictable plot. An adoption agency mistakenly
gives Ernie Hudson and Pam Grier a Chinese baby. (Their last name
is Lee). They keep it. And he, in turn, adopts the notion that he
is black. But when the Lees move from Atlanta to South Central Los
Angeles the boys in the hood are quick to tell Dante Basco he's
``Fakin Da Funk.'' 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Sonia Murray) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Firelight R
</P>
<P>
   This Gothic romantic drama set in the 1830s could use a little
more fire and a lot lighter touch. Still, it burns with
intelligence, craft and psychological resonance. A Swiss governess
(Sophie Marceau) agrees to bear a child for an aloof English
aristocrat (Stephen Dillane), then disappear from his life. But
their ``business'' arrangement is complicated by feelings both
romantic and maternal. A quiet, emotionally assured film that
respects its characters and its audience. 1 hour, 44 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way this
extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its yearlong
hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short of being even
solid summer escapism. Bikini atoll resident Godzilla comes to nest
in Manhattan when it's time to think of family matters. Matthew
Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail. 2 hours, 19
minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Holy Man PG
</P>
<P>
   A mild comedy-drama that wastes Eddie Murphy's talents as a New
Age drifter who brings big sales and enlightenment to home shopping
producer Jeff Goldblum and media analyst Kelly Preston. It's
Hollywood's latest reduction of spiritual values to ``give somebody
a hug.''1 hour, 53 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This movie never flies, but never sinks, either. Sandra Bullock
teams up with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for
this affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town
home to lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. 1 hour, 54
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Impostors R
</P>
<P>
   Flawed as it is, this slight, silly film is impossible to
dislike. It's too full of talented funny people such as Lili
Taylor, Campbell Scott, Dana Ivey and Steve Buscemi. Stanley Tucci
and Oliver Platt star as two out-of-work actors who stow away on a
luxury liner. The '30s setting reflects the movie's screwball
aspirations, which it never quite achieves. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Knock Off R
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Van Damme returns in _ surprise! _ an action movie
about an American salesman working in Hong Kong who becomes aware
of a terrorist conspiracy. Directed by Hong Kong action auteur Tsui
Hark. Not reviewed. Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-'em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lolita R
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Lyne's version of Vladimir Nabokov's acclaimed novel
about a grown man (Jeremy Irons) sexually obsessed with a
pre-pubescent girl (Dominique Swain) is neither a triumph nor a
travesty. It's just okay, which, given the source, suggests that
the director had little affinity for the material besides its name
value. The result is an overlong, sometimes sluggish film that opts
for Victoria's Secret gauze over the black comedy of Stanley
Kubrick's 1962 version. 2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   This is a faithful and fun adaptation of the series of
children's books about a precocious redheaded orphan living in a
girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even boys should take to the scooter-riding rascal Pepito)
and nostalgic enough for adults. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill
Vejnoska, c. 1998 Cox News Service) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas, who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautiful,
spirited daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones) from the evil schemes of
one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert blend of panache,
romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor. 2 hours, 16 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-

   Mulan G
</P>

   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A

   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Next Stop, Wonderland R
</P>
<P>
   A small wonder in its own modest way. This charming low-budget
romantic comedy about the relationship travails of a Boston nurse
(Hope Davis) is stronger on character nuance than on plot; in fact,
filmmaker Brad Anderson loads it with too much plot. But by
applying a naturalistic independent-film sensibility to a vintage
glossy-Hollywood predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film
where John Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Rated R
for vulgar language and sexual situations. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Night at the Roxbury PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Those head-bopping, nightclubbing brothers from ``Saturday Night
Live'' are out in a full-fledged story. Well, as full-fledged as
you can get when your central characters are a couple of clueless,
would-be coolsters whose dream is getting into, and then owning,
the hottest club in town. Lots of groaningly funny lines and a
surprisingly coherent story line make this a fun, thankfully
concise viewing experience. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska, c.

   Nights of Cabiria NR
</P>
<P>
   Carefully restored version of Fellini's 1957 Oscar winner,
starring his wife, Giuletta Masina, as a downtrodden yet
indomitable hooker wandering through the streets of Rome cloaked in
a ratty fur and unquenchable optimism. The current print hasn't
just been spruced up; an entire section _ ``the man in the sack,''
about a Good Samaritan who feeds the poor _ has been re-included.
Note to Fellini fans: This is early Fellini. Simple. Toned down.
Lovely. 1 hour, 57 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   One True Thing R
</P>
<P>
   Strikes too many false notes. Renee Zellweger plays a career
journalist who goes home to care for her dying homemaker mother
(Meryl Streep). Streep's performance is terrific, but the movie
suffers from generic slickness. 2 hour, 7 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   One Tough Cop R
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baldwin stars as a NYPD detective torn between duty to
his badge or to a childhood pal (Mike McGlone) who is now a member
of a crime family. This solid cop procedural is fact-based, but
plays like a dozen fictional flicks you've seen before. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth twins who
meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting their divorced
parents. Young kids may fidget at the length and several kissing
scenes. (Jill Vejnoska) 1 hour, 45 minutes. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Pecker R
</P>
<P>
   Edward Furlong plays a Baltimore kid whose grainy photos bring
him New York art scene fame in John Waters' new comedy. Like all
Waters' films, it's a very mixed bag of raunch and sweetness, smart
satire and dumb comedy. 1 hour, 27 minutes. (SM) Grade C+
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not Perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealhy
wife`s lover to kill her. 1 hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Ronin R
</P>
<P>
   The title suggests a close friend of Rodan or Godzilla, but it
actually refers to shamed samurai who, having lost their master,
are for hire. Robert De Niro and Jean Reno lead some modern-day
``ronin'' _ Cold Warriors without a war _ hired to snatch a
mysterious suitcase. Director John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian
Candidate'') and an unbilled David Mamet (``The Spanish Prisoner'')
bring a cool professional touch to this crackling
action-suspense-thriller that's fun and smart. 1 hour, 58 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Rounders R
</P>
<P>
   Director John Dahl (``The Last Seduction'') has a couple of very
hot aces up his sleeve _ Matt Damon and Edward Norton _ in this
nifty movie about the addictive lure of high-stakes poker. Damon is
a former card sharp who's managed to kick the habit and concentrate
on his law studies. Norton is his old friend, fresh out of jail,
who lures him back. A pungent, character-rich picture that's a lot
less about where it goes than how it gets there. Rated R for nudity
and language. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Rush Hour PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Kung Fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair drive each other
crazy, at first. You'll howl as Chan and Tucker learn to work
together, in part by imitating (sometimes badly) how the other one
works. 1 hours, 37 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all around here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Simon Birch PG
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems. In the early 1960s, a
pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is
convinced he will one day be a hero while his best pal (Joseph
Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real father (Ashley
Judd is Mazzello's closemouthed mom). The movie is clearly a labor
of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through. Rated PG for
violence (a scary bus accident) and sexual innuendo. 1 hour, 50
minutes. (ER) Grade: D-
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' only without the romance or the
adventure in this movie. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and
Anne Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on
an island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some
pirates. The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. 1 hour,
41 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Slums of Beverly Hills R
</P>
<P>
   A vivid, very funny look at coming of age on the fringes. Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) is the odd girl out in a post-divorce
family led by a father (Alan Arkin) who, every three months or so,
skips out on rent and moves his brood to another fleabag on the
edge of Beverly Hills. Director Tamara Jenkins re-creates the daily
humiliations of adolescence with wince-inducing accuracy. And
Lyonne is terrific at navigating the waters of teen angst. Rated R
for nudity, profanity, sexual situations. 1 hour, 31 minutes. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Small Soldiers PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Action- and violence-packed movie is heavy on computer-generated
effects but woefully light on plot twists or interesting characters
(either flesh-and-blood or plastic). Borrowing liberally from too
many other movies, action figures come alive, start warring with
each other (and any human who gets in their way) and destroy an
idyllic small-town neighborhood. 1 hour 49 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries R
</P>
<P>
   Family matters and more are examined in this thoughtful
adaptation of Kaylie Jones' semi-autobiographical book about
growing up in the '60s and '70s (her father was writer James
Jones). The scattered, vignette-ish approach may bother some _ the
movie is like a personal memoir divided into three separate but
equal short stories _ but the film's sense of memory as an
emotional tapestry made up of many people and incidents rings true.
2 hours, 4 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious. Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high
school senior who suffers a bathroom mishap that keeps him from
attending his prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz).
Thirteen years later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down. The movie is liberating in its
scatological, slapstick way. But the easy-to-offend should find
something more polite to watch. 1 hour, 58 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Touch of Evil NR
</P>
<P>
   Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic about corruption and lust in a
small Mexican border town has been re-created as the filmmaker
originally envisioned it. Small changes and some technical tweaking
render the film more coherent without losing its nightmarish,
B-movie edge. Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh star as newlyweds
whose honeymoon is interrupted by murder. Welles is decadence
incarnate as Capt. Quinlan, the lawman gone wrong. 1 hour, 51
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show R
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative social satire. It's about a cheerful insurance salesman
who slowly realizes his entire life has been a TV show and all the
people he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this dazzlingly
executed concept and the strong cast includes Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. 1 hour, 44 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Urban Legend R
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Witt and Jared Leto star in the latest knockoff of
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The
college-campus, teen-kill thriller is slickly made, well played,
instantly forgettable. 1 hour, 39 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   What Dreams May Come PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ``Ghost'' directed by Terry Gilliam and you'll have some
idea of this tear-jerker phantasmagoria. Robin Williams stars as a
doctor exploring aspects of the afterlife after he's killed in a
car crash. Annabella Sciorra is his widow; Cuba Gooding Jr., his
spiritual guide. The movie is emotionally and visually stunning, a
little simplistic story-wise. But sometimes simplistic can be
startlingly close to primal. Check your cynicism at the door and
bring a box of Kleenex. 1 hour, 46 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Why Do Fools Fall in Love R
</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively. Rated R for language, sex scenes and drug use. 2
hours, 3 minutes. (The Hollywood Reporter) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Your Friends and Neighbors R
</P>
<P>
   Neil LaBute, who did the lacerating ``In the Company of Men,''
suffers a sophomore slump of sorts in this black comedy about sex
games and power plays among six thirtysomething urbanites. Rated R
for sex and language. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: C+

`BOOK OF LIFE' AND `LIFE ON EARTH': TWO VIEWS OF THE MILLENNIUM

   NEW YORK _ It is the morning of Dec. 31, 1999, and who should
breeze into John F. Kennedy International Airport just in time for
the apocalypse but a bland, dapper Jesus (Martin Donovan).
Accompanying him is his assistant and gal Friday, Magdalena (P.J.
Harvey), a witchy-looking vixen wearing knee-high black boots and
toting a backpack. The pair head straight for Manhattan, where they
check into a hotel, consult with their lawyers and make final plans
for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a SoHo bar, Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan), a cynical,
loudmouthed crank, is knocking back drinks and chatting about final
things with Dave (Dave Simonds), an atheist and ne'er-do-well. At
one point, Satan proposes a deal: If Dave buys a lottery ticket for
his ``terminally good'' girlfriend, Edie (Miho Nikaido), who works
in the bar, Satan promises it will win. But in exchange the Devil
gets Edie's soul. Without realizing with whom he's dealing, Dave
goes for it.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical yet deeply serious, Hal Hartley's ``Book of Life''
loosely translates the Book of Revelation into a hip religious
fable that begins facetiously and becomes steadily more reflective.
Shot on digital video blown up to 35-mm film, pastel-hued and
filled with feathery digital afterimages, the movie has a floating,
ethereal look that oddly matches its lofty subject.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour film _ one of two millennially themed movies being
shown together Saturday evening at Alice Tully Hall as part of the
New York Film Festival _ could be taken as a companion piece to
``Henry Fool,'' the director's full-length pop fable, which opened
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who played the title character in that film, brings the
same mixture of self-deluded grandiosity and bitterness to Satan;
he's a familiar type, a chronic complainer and compulsively
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen at the stroke of midnight? Does the world
end? Or does Jesus, who begins to have second thoughts about his
father's insistence on punishment, take a more sympathetic and
relativistic view of human folly and decide to call off the
apocalypse? Let's put it this way: Hartley's mild-mannered Jesus
turns out to be a nondoctrinaire liberal humanist with the mind of
a science-fiction writer.
</P>
<P>
   Abderrahmane Sissako's film ``Life On Earth'' looks at the
millennium from a less affluent perspective. The movie follows
Sissako, a Mauritanian living in Paris, back to Sokolo, his
father's village in Mali, to film a portrait of life in this
impoverished area of western Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the film, Sissako forcefully editorializes about
Europe's destruction of Africa, blaming ``industrial leaders
without scruples'' for creating ``the highest pile of corpses in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   But from this point on, the film draws back to paint a
dispassionate, almost lyrical portrait of the village, whose meager
livelihood is threatened by swarms of birds that have been
devouring the rice crop. We visit the rudimentary local radio
station and the post office, which has the only telephone in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   It is Dec. 31, 1999, and the news emanating from the few radios
in Sokolo is all about the millennial celebrations around the world
and the crowds at the Eiffel Tower in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life on Earth'' doesn't offer the disquieting images of
poverty, disease and starving children that have become standard in
Third World documentaries. Instead, it compiles a picture of a way
of life that is so primitive and detached from the material
abundance and technological sophistication of Europe that you are
left with the sinking feeling of having visited a country that has
been forever left behind, literally in the dust.

ON CAPITOL HILL, INTRICATE MANEUVERS ON ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., R.I., Idaho)   (bl)  
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate authors of a bill to overhaul the
Endangered Species Act are trying to persuade House leaders to
attach the measure to a catch-all spending bill, a step that would
fundamentally rewrite one of the nation's most important
environmental laws without either the full Senate or House taking a
separate vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration supports the overhaul, which would
codify many of the innovative approaches to protecting imperiled
species that Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit has adopted over the
years. But the White House has said it opposes putting this or
other new environmental policy measures on the omnibus spending
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The species bill would authorize landowners like big timber
companies to develop comprehensive habitat conservation plans
protecting many species at once. In exchange, they then may receive
permits for some degree of harm to endangered species on the land.
The federal government promises that there will be no future
demands for them to spend money or set aside additional land for
the covered species.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the existing law often allows environmentalists to
block development that harms even a single endangered species or
its habitat, a power that they have used with great success for
years, and has made it difficult for Babbitt to carry out the more
flexible approach that he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican environmental proposals that the administration
opposes may also be attached to the omnibus bill as Congress leaves
town for the elections, and the administration has threatened to
veto the omnibus bill if it contains those.
</P>
<P>
   The endangered species measure has broad bipartisan support in
the Senate, but in the House it is opposed by many liberal
Democrats and conservative Republicans, for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Most major environmental organizations oppose it, saying it does
not do enough to guarantee that endangered species recover from the
destruction of their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Many other groups, who advocate the rights of property owners,
especially small landowners, over the preservation of species, also
oppose the bill.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island and Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho,
the Republicans who co-authored the bill, have been lobbying hard
to get House budget negotiators to include it on the omnibus
spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would support that,'' said Chafee, one of the Republican
Party's leading environmentalists. ``It seems to be a catch-all for
all kinds of legislation that have not been considered in great
depth by one body or another. But as far as the Senate goes, we
worked extremely hard on it, had a whole host of hearings, a
markup, and reported it out. And it has been on the calendar for a
year, so it isn't unknown to the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the House, conservatives from western states may save the
day for their arch-rivals in the environmental movement. Led by
Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., the vice-chairman of the Western
caucus in the House, they are working hard to get House leaders to
keep the proposal off the omnibus bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the House have certainly not had a look at the bill, or
had the opportunity to amend it,'' said Radanovich.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said the situation remains fluid, he said that
``right now, the leadership is opposing putting it on the spending
bill, primarily because of the opposition that has been voiced'' by
conservative Western lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Western Governors Association is supporting the
legislation's passage.
</P>
<P>
   Several interest groups, from environmental organizations to
homebuilders, were working hard to influence the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Home Builders circulated a letter in
the House saying that the revisions to the Endangered Species Act
are ``long overdue and the provisions included in the omnibus
package are important improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative
research organization, called on Republican leaders to reject the
bill, calling it ``anti-property rights and anti-landowner.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups said that they expected the legislation to
die, more because of the opposition of House conservatives than
because of opposition from their own allies, like Rep. George
Miller, D-Calif., and Rep. Jim Saxon, R-N.J., both of whom wrote
congressional leaders asking for the bill to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this bill has more enemies than friends,'' Melinda
Pierce, endangered-species lobbyist at the Sierra Club. ``We seem
to be linking our arms with the property-rights caucus. Whatever it
takes, we will link arms.''

STRIDE RITE BACKS AWAY FROM LEVI STRAUSS LICENSING PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stride Rite Corp. said Friday it will stop marketing a footwear
line made under a licensing agreement with Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. and
take a fourth-quarter charge of $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   While Levi's accounted for only 3 percent of third-quarter
sales, Stride Rite looked to licensing agreements with such fashion
companies as Levi's, Tommy Hilfiger, and Nine West to augment sales
of its core brands _ Keds, Stride Rite children's shoes, and Sperry
Top-Siders.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the relationship with Levi's ``was a difficult decision
for us,'' said Stride Rite chairman and chief executive Robert C.
Siegel, 61, a former Levi Strauss executive who plans to step down
shortly from his Stride Rite jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Launched just three months ago, the Levi's footwear line did not
meet sales expectations, Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's may be a powerful brand name, but in recent years, its
denim apparel has lost cachet with younger consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Stride Rite, sales for Keds have been booming,
and Wall Street analysts don't expect the Levi's decision to have a
major impact on the Lexington, Mass. company.
</P>
<P>
   Keds account for about 35 percent of the company's 1997 sales of
$515.7 million. The Stride Rite children's shoes accounted for
another 35 percent of 1997 sales.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Marotta, an analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities,
hailed Stride Rite's decision to end its relationship with Levi's.
Sometimes the best thing, he said, is ``to cut your losses
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insignificant,'' Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst
Josephine R. Esquivel said of the decision to pull the plug on the
Levi's line. ``The real story is the turnaround of Keds.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Stride Rite said third-quarter sales were up 17
percent and profits were up 56 percent to $12.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty over future sales for the licensed shoe lines
prompted Tucker Anthony analyst Steven A. Richter to lower some of
his estimates for Stride Rite's future performance.
</P>
<P>
   In a report dated Sept. 25, Richter shaved 5 cents off his 1999
earnings-per-share estimate, from 80 to 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, after Stride Rite's announcement about the Levi's shoe
line, Richter indicated that he may revise his 1999 estimate
slightly downward again.
</P>
<P>
   After losing money in 1995, Stride Rite has bounced back. Even
so, its stock price has languished, in part, analysts say, because
the entire shoe industry is in disfavor on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, company stock shares rose 15/16
to close at 7 13/16 after hitting a 52-week low earlier in the
week.

RELIGION LEADERS DIVIDED ON CLINTON MORAL ISSUE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as the White House scandal involving Monica Lewinsky has
left many Americans divided and angry, so it is becoming an
increasingly public matter of contention among the nation's
religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Within their broad ranks, the issue is not whether the president
did wrong. Instead, the question many clergy members have been
wrestling with is, what is the pressing moral issue at stake for
the nation in the scandal?
</P>
<P>
   For some, it is Clinton's behavior, while others say the scandal
is a sad distraction, with the president's personal failings
getting so much attention as to obscure societal problems to which
the government ought to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Granberg-Michaelson, who is one of the more prominent
religious leaders to call for Clinton's resignation, said he did so
because ``there are those kinds of roles where one's character and
how one lives one's life as a whole can't be totally segregated
from one's leadership position.''
</P>
<P>
   Granberg-Michaelson, general secretary of the Reformed Church in
America, a denomination with 180,000 members whose roots in New
York City go back to the Dutch, said that writing a recent
statement asking the President to step down was difficult,
particularly as he has been a supporter of Clinton's policies.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his own religious sense told him that a person must
be accountable in both personal life and public life. He said he
also believed that effective leaders depended increasingly on being
able to inspire a sense of community and purpose among
subordinates, rather than simply handing down decrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that one's capacity to exercise leadership around the
questions of great moral import in public policy is related to the
level of trust one can engender,'' Granberg-Michaelson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he is worried about Congress' decision to hold impeachment
hearings. ``To the extent that the impeachment process becomes
increasingly partisan, I think it is a political disaster,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that concern, he is by no means alone, although some others
come at the issue from a different perspective on the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, 32 religious leaders _ top officers in the
National Council of Churches and several Protestant, Orthodox
Christian, Jewish and Islamic organizations _ issued a statement
declaring that the nation needed to avoid impeachment hearings and
saying that Clinton's misdoings did not qualify as the ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' that the Constitution says are
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The statement offered no excuses for Clinton. The signers were
bluntly critical of his behavior, saying, ``In his personal
conduct, he has violated the fundamental moral teachings of our
religious traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But they also said, ``As he continues the difficult work of
healing himself and his family, the nation must turn to the larger
moral imperatives that urgently demand our attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Those issues, the statement said, include focusing on the need
for health care among millions of adults and children who lack it,
improving education, changing campaign finance practices and
helping bring peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One of the signers, the Rev. Ronald Paul Brugler, said he was
concerned that attention was being diverted from ``very serious
global and national'' issues. ``I also believe very much in
forgiveness,'' said Brugler, president of the Swedenborgian Church,
a small denomination whose theology reflects the work of the
18th-century philosopher and scientist Emanuel Swedenborg.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, which represents more than 800 Reform synagogues,
said he and the other signers wanted to get beyond ``the narrow way
in which the word morality is being bandied about at this
particular moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie composed a brief message of his own, in which he said
political leaders were judged not just by their personal moral
conduct but also by their ability to carry out a biblical mandate
to ``execute true justice,'' an even more important standard. He
included a quotation from the prophet Zechariah, who (in the
biblical book bearing his name) calls on people to show mercy and
compassion and not to oppress the poor, widows or orphans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prophets had this broad view, and I think we need this,''
Rabbi Yoffie said. ``There's tremendous indignation about what
Clinton did. I accept that,'' he said, but added, ``Where's the
indignation about 12 million children without health care?''

VICTIM OF CHERNOBYL BACK IN THE US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In late September, as autumn was turning to winter in
north central Europe, Alexei Anatolevich Saponchikov, a victim of
the Chernobyl nuclear fallout, returned to the orphanage for
disabled children in Belarus that had been his home for so long.
</P>
<P>
   When they heard his car approaching, the 130 children who live
at the orphanage rushed to the windows to welcome their friend back
from America. Some on crutches hobbled out to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Alexei, who is called ``Alosha'' and still
struggles with the juvenile arthritis and severely stunted growth
that plague him as a result of the radiation spread across Europe
by the Chernobyl explosion in the Ukraine in 1986, cried with
excitement to see his old friends.
</P>
<P>
   But his joy was mixed with pain over the realization that he
might, again, be back for good at the orphanage where he was taken
a dozen years ago after his mother abandoned him when he was 11
months old. After 15 months in the United States, Alosha's
immigration papers had expired.
</P>
<P>
   The boy _ who weighs about 40 pounds and stands just 38 inches
tall _ held firmly to the hand of Daniel Joyce, the man who had
become his surrogate father and accompanied him to Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce made the bittersweet journey with Alosha not only because
he loves him, but to see Belarus and US officials about remedying
insufficient documentation to allow Alosha to stay in the states
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was certain when we started out,'' Joyce said this
week about their trip to Belarus. ``Alosha knew we were trying our
best to get him to come back, ``but that it was a chance and he
accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chernobyl Children Project in Hingham, Mass. paid for their
flight to Belarus. At first, Joyce and Alosha stayed with Alosha's
doctor in Gomel, about an hour's drive from the orphanage. Alosha
visited with his girlfriend, Lena, and with Max, a Chernobyl victim
with thyroid cancer, who had stayed with the Joyces with him. Then,
the orphanage director drove them to the only home Alosha had known
until last year.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 days, Joyce, 39, the director of systems support at
Fidelity Investments in Boston, stayed at the orphanage with
Alosha, sleeping on a couch and making two 16-hour overland
journeys to Minsk, the Belarus capital, to see Belarus and US
officials about Alosha's documentation.
</P>
<P>
   He returned with a six-month medical visa for Alosha to return
to this country and said that a more permanent arrangement will
take ``anywhere from two to three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Alosha's apprehension at returning to Belarus was not that the
people at the orphanage treated him badly. On the contrary, they
cared for him well, allowing him to come to Boston in the summer of
1997 for respite and medical treatment with 83 other Chernobyl
victims under a program sponsored by the Chernobyl Children
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the orphanage and the governments of Belarus and the
United States gave permission for Alosha to extend his stay for
medical treatment for his many orthopedic ailments related to his
arthritis, unavailable in Belarus. He also had dental surgery for
seriously rotted teeth.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 months, Alosha has been living just outside
Boston, at the Milton home of Dan and Janet Joyce and their three
sons, Dan, 15, Doug, 12, and Ryan, 8. There, he has experienced a
sense of family for the first time in his tragic life.
</P>
<P>
   With an impish smile almost as broad as he is, Alosha has stolen
the hearts of all who've met him. His ailments and severe joint
deformities have prevented him from growing beyond his 38-inch
frame.
</P>
<P>
   What was to have been a summer's stay in 1997 was extended after
the Joyces and doctors at The Floating Hospital for Children at New
England Medical Center, which gives free medical treatment to the
Chernobyl children, convinced the governments of Belarus and the
United States how vital such treatment was for Alosha.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, Belarus won
independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. It is still a
very poor country with medical supplies in short supply. Joyce was
stunned at what he saw at the orphanage, ``badly burned children,
some with birth defects, broken legs, epilepsy.''
</P>
<P>
   On his recent return there, Alosha was knocked down by children
rushing to a meal and the femur of his left leg was broken. ``They
don't have any facilities there,'' Joyce recalled this week. ``So,
we made a splint with sticks and clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Alosha is back in Milton now and waiting for the next chapter of
his life to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is in a cast and on crutches, he continues to go
on a bus to the Glover School, working at a fifth-grade level.
While he needed an intrepreter when he first arrived, he now speaks
English without a trace of a Russian accent, and has forgotten some
of his native language.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny as Alosha is, he horses around with the Joyce sons as if he
were 6 feet tall. Now, the brothers vie over who is going to carry
him around the house while he wears the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, in anticipation of Halloween, Alosha donned a
magician's top hat and hammed it up for a photographer. Around his
neck he wore a cross that the Joyces had given him. He will always
love them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the time he has been here, Alosha has had his first-ever
birthday party at 13, grew to love chicken, and sang Russian folk
songs at karaoke nights. He is an extrovert.
</P>
<P>
   Though his diminutive size first attracts, it is Alosha's blue
eyes that arrest. Even while he is trying to be a flippant
teenager, they harbor a deep melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   With his major physical problems, Alosha knows his medical
future is uncertain. His medications, alone, Joyce said, cost about
$235 a month. The Joyces are planning a fund-raiser on Nov. 14 to
help meet Alosha's needs.
</P>
<P>
   But, Alosha still flashes his dimpled smile that moves so many
to tears. The Delta Air Lines crew that flew him and Joyce free
from New York to Boston last week were among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing Alosha has given us,'' Dan Joyce said, ``is
the sense of hope and love he has, in spite of the fact that he
grew up in such poverty and hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

needs may do so sending checks to The Alosha Fund: US Trust, Box
25, Milton, MA 02186).

TWO MODERATE DEMOCRATS FACE TOUGH CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One is a black Democrat representing a
majority-white district in rural southwest Georgia. The other is a
white Democrat who hails from a sprawling South Carolina district
where blacks are more than 30 percent of the voting-age population.
</P>
<P>
   Both are moderates facing tough reelection battles that may turn
largely on the strength of black voter turnout. And the question
facing them was the same: Would they vote for an open-ended
impeachment inquiry against a president who is popular among
African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   For Representatives Sanford D. Bishop Jr. of Georgia and John M.
Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the answers turned out to be
different. Spratt voted Thursday with the Republican majority to
launch only the third presidential impeachment inquiry in US
history; Bishop voted against the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   Their decisions underscored more than just the dilemma that
confronts many congressional Democrats who represent districts that
are both black and white, rural and urban. While black voters are
more united around Clinton and tend to vote Democratic, polls show,
whites are split in their attitudes about the president and in
their vote.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers try to wrap up their work this weekend and return
home to campaign for the Nov. 3 elections, they will find how their
votes on impeachment are playing among the voters. In districts
where candidates need the support of both black and whites, any
action in the impeachment process could simultaneously attract and
alienate important constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for a lot of Democrats is how many white voters do
they have in their districts for whom not only is this inquiry a
big deal for them, but who are anti-Clinton and will vote solely on
the basis of how their member of Congress votes in terms of the
impeachment proceedings,'' said David Bositis, senior political
analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a
black think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, the most conservative member of the Congressional Black
Caucus, joined his 35 black colleagues in the House in voting
Thursday against the Republicans' unrestricted probe of Clinton
that could go beyond his relationship with former White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the caucus members voted for the Democratic
alternative that would have placed more limits on the inquiry.
Those two _ Representatives John Lewis and Cynthia McKinney of
Georgia _ opposed any type of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   While Spratt may face the wrath of blacks voters who may
perceive his vote in favor of an impeachment inquiry as a vote
against Clinton, for Bishop, his vote may turn out to be the bigger
political gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his other black colleagues, who conspiciously rallied on
the House floor against an open-ended inquiry, Bishop was low key.
He had refused to reveal how he would vote in advance.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the vote, Bishop said: ``After
prayerful consideration and thoughtful deliberation in consultation
with my constituents,'' he decided against voting for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been politically expedient, and voted for the
Republicans resolution, but I could not in good conscience put my
personal and political interests ahead of the well-being of the
people'' of his district and the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on, ``The president's conduct was wrong, it is
indefensible, and he should be punished. But it is the president
who should be punished, not the country.''
</P>
<P>
   By voting against the inquiry, Bishop could face a backlash from
white and rural voters, who are in the majority in his heavily
agricultural district and who are less enamored with Clinton than
Bishop's black constituents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bishop's is the only one among the 11 congressional races in
Georgia considered up for grabs, said Bill Shipp, the publisher of
a popular political newspaper in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Bishop cast his vote, Shipp said the ``best
politics'' for Bishop was to vote for the inquiry. ``It doesn't
matter much with the black vote, but it will matter a lot with the
white vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp said Bishop's opponent, a conservative businessman from
Albany, Joe McCormick, is likely to use a ``no'' vote against
Bishop. ``He will beat him over the head with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas Lee, a political pollster and sociologist at Xavier
University in New Orleans, said that Spratt's vote also contained
risk. He ``alienated 30 percent of his electorate, or a majority of
that 30 percent,'' Lee said. ``That that is not a good position for
anyone seeking reelection.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Lester, a Democratic pollster, said that ``even among
African-American voters, it's difficult for them to make the case
that there should not be any action taken by Congress against the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Weaver, executive director of the South Carolina
Democratic Party, said Spratt's Republican challenger, Rock Hill
businessman Mike Burhold, had already begun ``trying to connect him
with the president and make them much closer than they may be.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded Spratt's vote may not sit well with black voters in
his district. ``There's a fine line to tow in regard to this issue
_ not upsetting African-Americans who are in support of the
president and those Democrats who are,'' he said. Although Spratt's
and Bishop's vote could cause problems among some constituents, the
impeachment drive may stay on the margin of issues voters care
about in their districts, said Bositis at the Joint Center.
</P>
<P>
   The key for them and similarly situated Democrats will be voter
turnout, he said. ``The Democrats main problem in regard to turnout
is there is a big proportion of people in the country, maybe a
majority, who really don't care about this scandal at all,''
Bositis said. ``The problem is that a lot of those same people
don't care about politics either, and so they don't vote.''

GORE WARNS THAT MAJOR ISSUES BEING IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Vice President Al Gore, in his first public remarks on
the House vote to launch an impeachment inquiry of President
Clinton, Friday warned that the hearings have stirred partisanship
that threatens to derail progress on key economic and policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers have been totally distracted from issues such as a
patients' bill of rights, environmental protection, and saving
Social Security, said Gore, who arrived in Boston Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, who used his visit to announce a major
environmental accord between chemical producers and the
Environmental Protection Agency, did not defend the president's
actions in the Monica S. Lewinsky matter. Instead he took a long
view at the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people place'' Clinton's actions ``in a larger
context and balance them against all the great things he has done
as president of the United States,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the overwhelming majority of people in both parties
and independents want to see this over quickly,'' Gore said, adding
that he hopes Congress handles the impeachment process ``fairly and
as speedily as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As the House proceeds with the impeachment investigation, Gore
said he hopes ``that no matter what party we're in, we're all
Americans first; let's not let partisanship get in the way of
progress of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting Gore at Logan International Airport Friday was EPA chief
Carol Browner, and Mayor Thomas M. Menino.
</P>
<P>
   The Chemical Manufacturers' Association signed an accord with
the EPA to set up a schedule of tests of chemicals the public
commonly encounters to determine their health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Browner credited Gore's attention to the issue and his belief
that better decisions result from parties who collaborate rather
than lock horns as adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Weber, head of the manufacturers' association, said the
industry was agreeing to an ambitious and expensive, voluntary
program rather than having the EPA mandate tests and enforce fines.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical industry expects to spend $700 million by 2002 to
conduct the tests on 3,000 chemicals and to then make the results
available to the public. The chemicals include common water
additives such as chlorine as well as solvents and petrochemicals.

   RUSSIA-KOSOVO _ MOSCOW _ In the United States' bid to convince
it's NATO allies of the need for military airstrikes against
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic over the fighting in Serbia's
Kosovo province, persuading Russia has been the toughest task.
Although U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other U.S.
officials have said if a decision is taken to strike the Serbs the
Russians will not be able to stop it, most point to Russia's
outspoken resistance as a key reason the strikes have not happened
-- despite repeated warnings they could happen within days. A
longtime ally of the Serbs, Russia is butting heads with the U.S.
much in the same way it did with Iraq. Why? What does Russia stand
to gain? (Holmes, Cox News Service).

hardliner is known as a great military leaders but a poor diplomat

   COLLEGE-TESTS _ WASHINGTON _ As thousands of students across the
country suffer sweaty brows and churning stomachs during the SAT
exam today, a debate is raging over whether the test should
continue to play an important role in college

<P>
   admissions. While one advocacy group says the test is unfair to
minorities and should be de-emphasized, the College Board argues
that the SAT greatly helps colleges gauge a student's ability to

POSITIVE WAYS TO MOVE ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (Not for release before Sunday, Oct. 11)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a computer consultant at a major international bank.
Recently, my boss and one member of the staff have made
anti-Semitic remarks that are at best insensitive, at worst
fighting words. The agency that hired me for the job has
acknowledged the problem but says I am overstating it. The agency,
however, has to defend its client, so its sympathies lie with her.
</P>
<P>
   I am looking for a job elsewhere, and the agency says it is
trying to help me. My problem is: How do I explain why I am
leaving? No future employer wants to hear negative comments about a
current employer, no matter how justified.
</P>
<P>
   A. Remember how you were taught as a child that honesty is the
best policy? Forget it. While you don't want to tell a lie in an
interview, committing a sin of omission may be your best course in
this instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never go negative,'' said Lee E. Miller, an employment lawyer
turned human-resources executive and author of ``Get More Money on
Your Next Job'' (McGraw-Hill, 1997). ``I don't care what the
reason. Nobody wants to be around someone like that. Think of it
this way: If you were on a first date and you spent the entire time
bashing your first wife, what do you think your date would think?''
</P>
<P>
   When talking with prospective employers, it may be better to
skip the negatives about the past and emphasize the upbeat about
the future. ``There are a million reasons one could give for
wanting to change jobs,'' said Carole A. Pinkett, a former
human-resources executive with the Metropolitan Transit Authority
of Houston and now head of human resources at the STP Nuclear
Operating Co. in Wadsworth, Texas. If necessary, you may even reach
into your bag of interview cliches, saying you're looking for an
advanced opportunity, or a new challenge, or a chance to work for a
really (fill-in-the-flattering-adjective) company.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also advises focusing on why you want the position in
question, not on why you are leaving your current job. ``What is it
about a particular company that excites you?'' he said. ``If it's
that the company is fast-growing, concentrate on that.''
</P>
<P>
   A parting note: Your decision to abandon ship appears to be the
correct one. Life is too short to linger in an office environment
that is making you miserable, Miller said. And even in
litigation-happy America, taking legal action would most likely
bring you more pain than justice. (``If you try to fight such
behavior in the courts, it can be very expensive, and you can be
branded a troublemaker,'' Ms. Pinkett said.)
</P>
<P>
   However, once you are on your way out the door, you might want
to drop a friendly, thought-you'd-want-to-know letter to the
human-resources manager at your old employer, explaining your real
reasons for leaving. (Be sure it contains no hint of nastiness or
implied threat.) It might not do any good, but if the company's
executives are unaware of your former boss' behavior, they might
appreciate the information.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the next person in your position might decide that a
lawsuit is precisely what the doctor ordered.

TRYING TO FIND ROOM ON THE RUNWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 11)  
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER ISENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I didn't always throw air kisses at other men, or
carry around photos of myself in different outfits in my backpack,
or cleanse my face with blue herbal astringent. But then, I didn't
always aspire to be a male model.
</P>
<P>
   I graduated from Stanford University and earned a master's
degree in English at Oxford University. Through the years of my
higher education, I assumed that hunting for a job would entail
submitting a resume and donning a suit and tie for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today a typical job application requires me to stand in my
underwear in front of portly, blase Italian designers and to
present them with pictures of myself dressed as a boxer, a
businessman and a sulky layabout stretched shirtless across a sofa.
A few months ago, I would have laughed uproariously at this scene.
But when the first telephone call came, beckoning me into the world
of Kate, Naomi and Tyson, I responded with little hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't know how a stylist named Jennifer got my name. All
I know is that she left a message on my answering machine last May
with the time and address for a casting call for a rum
advertisement for a magazine. I phoned back to say she had the
wrong number. But she insisted there was no mistake, and mentioned
a reference, although the name meant nothing to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, why don't you just come in tomorrow for the casting?''
she said. ``It'll only take 20 minutes and if you get the job, it
pays $1,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, I was sitting with three other rent-a-hipsters
on a sofa in the basement of the Knitting Factory in lower
Manhattan, wearing rouge and pretending to be digging the smooth
rhythms of a bongo that none of us could play. My shaved head
annoyed the English director. It gave off a glare that distorted
his light readings. ``Put a hat on that one,'' he said, pointing to
my skull.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my pleas that a hat didn't go with the rest of my outfit
_ baggy black combat pants and sport sandals over socks _ they made
me wear a red crocheted skullcap that looked like an oversize
yarmulke. Who was I to complain? They paid me $1,700 for a six-hour
day, and for that I'd even wear a beret. I took the plunge into the
world of modeling.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month I had signed on with my own New York agency and a
booker who really does say ``Ciao, babe'' at the end of our phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   I began ``to work on my book,'' as they say. A book, which is a
model's most valued possession, is a photo album filled with
plastic sleeves and branded with the agency's logo.
</P>
<P>
   A ``new face'' like me needed to fill those sleeves with photos
that showcased my range of looks. I would spend days in a TriBeCa
loft, dressed in a boxing cup and hand wraps, while a photographer
told me I looked ``fierce'' and spritzed water on me. Another day,
in a dingy room in Chinatown, an English photographer convinced me
to take off my clothes and pose in a headdress made of peacock
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   But the best exposure of all for new faces comes from walking
the catwalks in Milan. I made plans to go in late June, to land a
few jobs during the showing of the menswear collections for spring
1999. The first order of business would be finding a local modeling
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, as my New York booker explained: ``Everyone in
the world who wants to model is there. It's the worst time of the
year to try and get an agency.''
</P>
<P>
   A more established model would have sent his book to several
agencies in advance and secured representation before arriving. But
in my case there wasn't time, and my book _ with only six pictures
in it _ wasn't strong enough; I would have to take my chances on
the spot. ``We'll give it a try,'' my agent said. ``I'll make
appointments for you and we'll see what happens. OK buddy? Ciao,
babe.''
</P>
<P>
   In Milan, the first agency I visit is Future Models on Via
Voghera, where I am supposed to ask for Val. I walk into a
courtyard and can immediately tell where the agency's offices are _
the staircase leading up to it is lousy with models.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, I never see more than a couple of other models at a
time at my agency, but here there are 30 or more lined up just on
the staircase. It is incredible how similar they all look, dressed
in a uniform of combat pants, running shoes, tank top and
sunglasses on top of the head.
</P>
<P>
   From a distance, the flock of strong-lined faces is daunting.
Some are dark and chiseled, others long-haired and androgynous, but
they all seem rare and beautiful creatures. But as I wait for Val,
I overhear snatches of conversation, and the illusion is shattered.
The voices ring out in the accents of Texas, California and New
York. Conversations are straight out of a frat house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did the same thing in Miami _ take ecstasy every single
night and just drink through it,'' someone says. ``He was downing,
like, a bottle of Jack and a bottle of vodka every night and then
he wakes up the next day like: `Let's go get something to eat.
Let's go the beach.' He's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but wait till his liver gives out,'' someone else says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottle of Jack every day, that'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk about who has already arrived and who's coming. About
which agency they're with in Paris or New York. And about the
castings they've been to that day. ``Angelo was clowning with
people's books,'' someone says, referring to Angelo Versace.
``Pointing to pictures and laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also talk of the previous night _ who got lucky, who
came home drunk and tripped over the fruit bowl and passed out.
After a while, Val, who pronounces his name ``Wal,'' comes looking
for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you are Christopher, OK,'' he says. ``I didn't see you
there. OK, come into the office with me.''
</P>
<P>
   I take a seat by the window and try to act nonchalant while Val
flips through my book. He lingers over some of the pages and seems
pleased. Then he hands it to a short woman and they examine it
together. Unaware that I speak Italian, she mutters, ``But all bald
like this?'' and shakes her head.
</P>
<P>
   Val begins what sounds like a rejection speech. ``It's a bit
late,'' he says. ``There have been already many of the castings
last week. And there are other castings that you would have already
had to send your composite to.'' My heart sinks. ``But we don't
have another one like you ... without hair. This is why.''
</P>
<P>
   Why what? I'm not catching his drift. He asks me what other
agencies I plan to see, and I give him the list _ Joy, Why Not,
Model Plan, Beatrice, Major. He tells me to call after I've seen
the others.
</P>
<P>
   As I get up to leave, I say I'll call tomorrow, hardening my
face to mask the shame of rejection for the walk past the other
guys in the stairway. But Val says: ``No, call me the end of the
day today. For us it's OK, but you must decide yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I feel a rush of joy. Yes; he says yes. I won't go unrepresented
after all. I manage to squeak out the answer that my booker gave me
for this unlikely situation. ``I'm going to have a look at a few
places before I make my decision,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   I visit two other agencies, and the response is even more
enthusiastic. ``It is definitely possible,'' one agency says. ``You
have all the possibilities. All of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another says, ``The door here is always open for you.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end I choose Why Not. It has the nicest offices, it also
represents women (which makes visiting your booker more fun) and I
like its name. Marco, my new Italian booker, gives me a list of
casting calls and a map of the city and sends me to make my way.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I visit Gianfranco Ferre's headquarters on Via
della Spiga, where I am confronted by a line of shirtless men in
the outer office, holding their books protectively across their
chests like high-school girls heading for class.
</P>
<P>
   I've been to other bathing-suit and underwear castings, but they
usually let you wait until you're inside the casting room, behind
closed doors, before asking you to remove your shirt. Here the
six-packs and the ripped pecs are out early.
</P>
<P>
   I take out my camera and make a few souvenir snapshots, which
brings jeers from the crowd. ``Oooh, sexy.'' ``Can I take your
picture?''
</P>
<P>
   We stand in an orderly line, the modeling meat market at its
most unsubtle. The young receptionist does her best to ignore us
and pretend that this is business as usual. But even the
experienced models recognize the crassness of the situation. ``This
is crazy,'' one says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slabs of meat,'' someone else says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gianfranco's going to have himself a steak dinner,'' a third
says.
</P>
<P>
   I reach the front of the line and am ushered into a room with
three others. There is a large table, behind which four or five of
Ferre's assistants are sitting. And standing in front of it is the
designer himself. As in the days of medieval Europe, his portly
figure is a clear marker of status. The skinny men are here to
please, the fat man to be placated.
</P>
<P>
   Four half-naked men are lined up in front of him for his
approval. Ferre goes through their books with an air of
indifference. Occasionally, he glances from a page to the man, but
his expression never changes from a little sneer. In the group
ahead of me the lucky few are sent behind a curtain for measuring,
and the less fortunate head out the door to the next casting call.
</P>
<P>
   As our group lines up in front of the designer, I try to make
light of the situation ``Che spettacolo!'' I say. What a show!
Ferre ignores me.
</P>
<P>
   When my turn comes to approach and hand over my book, I skip my
usual line about how I just started and there aren't many pictures.
He tries to flip through the book quickly, but two pages stick
together. He makes an attempt to part them, which fails, and he
swiftly moves on, thereby skipping one-third of my life's work. He
flips disdainfully through the empty page and hands the book back
without looking at me. I have failed to please the king. It's back
to my life as a peasant.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I realize that my true job as a model is to wait in line.
Or more accurately, my job is to run frantically around Milan
searching for obscure addresses, then sweat for two hours in a dark
and suffocating hallway. At least there are the fascinating
discussions of Italian history and architecture while waiting.
``Have you been to the Palazzo Ducale?'' I ask an American from
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yo, it's hella cool there,'' he replies. ``It would have been
sweet to live there, like back in the day, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   We are waiting in line for the Gaultier casting. Unlike most
designers, Jean Paul Gaultier is not afraid to use new faces, and
the unpredictability of his taste attracts droves of upstarts. My
California friend reveals that he took a modeling course from the
Barbizon people (``Be a Model or Just Look Like One'') and was one
of the lucky few actually signed by an agency.
</P>
<P>
   His candor violates what I've observed to be one of the main
rules of male modeling: Don't admit you take it seriously. Ask a
model how he got into it, and he'll invariably say he was pursuing
his dream of being a writer/actor/artist when a casting agent or
photographer stopped him on the street. The model would really
prefer to get back to writing/acting/making art, but the money is
too good to pass up.
</P>
<P>
   For my part, the money has never been very good, so I can't use
this excuse. For me, the motives are more complicated, but also
simpler: Once an awkward teen-ager, I still crave the affirmation
of my adult attractiveness. Plus, I really want someone to take
pictures of me and Tyra Banks naked on a Caribbean beach.
</P>
<P>
   We reach the front of the Gaultier line only to find that the
rumors that the designer is interested only in blonds are true.
Suddenly the guys who dyed their hair on a tip don't seem so
pathetic. Gaultier takes a quick look at me, thanks me for my time
and offers me a piece of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, the hair-rumor mill generates better news.
Issey Miyake is said to be looking for guys with shaved heads.
After an hour and a half in line, I approach the casting table and
I can feel it _ they are interested.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Usually the design team half looks at me, half sifts through the
composite cards that other guys have left. But here, four sets of
eyes, including those of Naoki Takizawa, the head menswear
designer, are riveted on me. I'm no longer bumbling
self-consciously up to the table, but striding smoothly and
confidently.
</P>
<P>
   I remember an article I've read about Japanese business
practices. I identify the most important person at the table
(Takizawa), use both hands when I pass him my book and complete the
transaction with a neat bow. He bows back in acknowledgment of my
flawless etiquette and then examines the book, lingering
promisingly over several of the pages and whispering to his
stylist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please step around to the back,'' the designer says, motioning
toward a curtain behind the casting table. There is clothing, and
young Japanese fitters are dressing a few chosen models in various
ensembles. They give me beige drawstring pants and a long-sleeve
canvas T-shirt with a dragon embroidered in bronze thread on the
front. It fits perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kawaii,'' I say, using one of the three Japanese words I know.
``Cute.'' Everyone laughs. ``Yes, kawaii,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   As I walk in the clothes, they take Polaroids of me, one a
full-body shot and then a close-up; they measure my arms and legs
and take my shoe size. For me, that's the clincher _ an experienced
model had explained that if they get as far as measuring you for
shoes, you're in.
</P>
<P>
   I leave the casting call pitying the poor fools still waiting in
line for a job that's already mine.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, when Issey Miyake sends the list of confirmed
models to my agency, my name is nowhere to be found. I'll never
learn why.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I never do get to walk in any shows. But I do get
invited to a postshow party for Gucci at Bar Ricci, Milan's
trendiest gay nightspot, which is a favorite of the visiting
fashion flock. The monumental Stazione Centrale, Mussolini's
architectural triumph, is just up the road, and it casts a
disapproving but ineffectual shadow over the revelry.
</P>
<P>
   The trendy camouflage pants and military haircuts of the
partygoers seem at first glance right out of the days of Il Duce.
But one look at the crowd tells you that the ``fashionisti'' have
triumphed over the fascisti.
</P>
<P>
   The DJ spins a new Italian dance hit whose chorus goes, ``I'm
horny, I'm horny, so horny, horny, horny.'' Boy George is there.
Models, designers and celebrities mingle and flirt.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of 15-second conversations with many of my
acquaintances from the last two weeks, I spot Kevin, a model I
posed with for a day on the Lower East Side for an Italian
magazine. We quickly fall to discussing the only areas of interest
between us _ how the shows have gone. Understandably, this is not
my favorite topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did pretty well,'' Kevin says coolly. ``I got, like, five or
six things. Plus Gucci booked me, but they didn't use me. Still had
to pay me though.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guch is, like, 4 G's. And Versus was like 15 hunj. Most of the
others were 4 or 5. But you know, the agency takes, like, 50
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' I say, attempting to commiserate. ``It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   I had no shows to boast about. The conversation moves on to
girls. ``I mean, you don't even have to try here,'' Kevin says.
``You just stand around and profile and they come to you, you know
what I'm saying?''
</P>
<P>
   Right on cue a beautiful young woman passes behind him. ``Like
that, right now,'' he says. ``Just walk by you and touch you and
pretend like they brushed up against you. They know why we're here.
They know we're clockin' bank. That's why it's so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, I did not measure up to Kevin and the rest of the
competition. I spent $2,000 on air travel, hotels and meals in
Milan, and I didn't earn back a penny. No callbacks, no bookings,
no women pretending to brush up against me. I have to question if I
have any future in modeling.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow I know that when the next round of shows begins in
Paris, I'll be on a plane. Unless of course, my father finds those
pictures of me in the peacock feathers.

 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chief executive of Mattel Inc. likes to wake up every
morning to CNN Headline News. And she can be certain the television
set will be on in the morning. After all, it's on when she falls
asleep. Yes, her husband does mind, but it's a habit she finds hard
to break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it's a fear of missing something that's going on in
the world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Barad does not miss much, and she seems to want the same
for employees. As she has risen to the top of Mattel, a $4.8
billion company, she has tried to transform a corporate culture
that once reminded her more of a bank than a toy maker.
</P>
<P>
   When she and her top managers want to communicate a message to
employees, for example, they work up skits and take to a makeshift
stage in the cafeteria at Mattel's headquarters in El Segundo,
Calif. To announce that the company was going to make every day
casual day, all the senior executives dressed up in bathrobes,
leather jackets and the like to demonstrate fashion do's and
don'ts. (Ms. Barad herself has had trouble giving up her more
formal wardrobe; she says employees kid her about being ``casually
challenged.'')
</P>
<P>
   In other skits, Ms. Barad, a onetime drama major, has played a
beatnik, a rapper and a Star Trek officer.
</P>
<P>
   She has also replaced Mattel's steady work hours with a schedule
that is more flexible than Ballet Recital Barbie. Every Friday is
now a half-day at Mattel, and employees can take off four Fridays
of their choosing each year. They get 16 hours off every year to
volunteer at a local school. In addition to vacations, for most
employees in Mattel's American offices there is a company-wide
break at the end of December that lasts about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best people are attracted to places that not only fulfill
them on an intellectual level, but also take into consideration
life-style issues,'' she said. ``To ignore that and assume it
doesn't matter to somebody is pretty naive. I'm not saying we don't
need people to work; obviously, we need them to work harder as it
gets tougher in the environment we're in. But we also need to
understand the need of people who are being creative to have that
down time.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Barad, 47, the down time at work is nonexistent, and she
said her energy level could sometimes wear on her colleagues. But
it is that drive that helped build sales of Barbie under her
direction from $200 million in 1982 to $1.9 billion in 1997, the
year she became chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Her challenge has also grown more difficult of late. Mattel, the
world's largest toy company, announced late last month that
earnings growth for the year would be about 9 to 12 percent, rather
than the 18 percent that Wall Street had anticipated, because of
declining sales to Toys ``R'' Us, the retail chain that accounted
for 18 percent of Mattel's revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Barad was named chief executive, in January 1997,
Mattel's stock was trading for less than $30 a share. It rose to
more than $46 in March but has since fallen sharply; it closed
Friday at $29.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad has said that if performance deteriorates sharply, the
generous time off given to employees as a reward may have to be cut
back. Many analysts, however, have said that Mattel's overall
strategy is sound and that the company should return to
outperforming broad stock-market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad said she typically puts in 11-hour days that are
filled with meetings _ ``too many, too many'' _ but she focuses on
areas like marketing and creative solutions where she feels she can
contribute the most. A recent Barad brainstorm, for example, led to
Mattel's plan to offer visitors to its Web site the chance to
design their own one-of-a-kind friend of Barbie called ``My
Design.'' The specifications are sent directly to a manufacturing
facility (Cost: about $40, plus shipping and handling).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad also interviews candidates for key positions, down to
the vice-presidential level, in meetings that may last up to an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually that's when defenses break down, and that's when you
really get to see who is sitting across from you,'' she said. ``I
really just try to get into the person as deeply as I can: what
interests them, who are the people they would like to spend time
with if they could choose anyone, what they do when they are not
working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to really get to true answers about somebody,''
she added. ``Anything that you can do that can touch upon a real
aspect of the person will give you more insight into who they are
than any business question. I also like to ask about their worst
failure, and what they did to overturn it. If it's not big enough,
they're not a risk taker. And if you've never been put in a
difficult situation, I don't want you there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once someone joins her management team, Ms. Barad said, she is
committed to seeing the person succeed. ``If things are working
out, you won't see me a lot,'' she said. ``But if things are not, I
will tend to get involved to really understand where the issues are
and where I can be a support system. My job is to shore things up,
not to necessarily watch them as they break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad said she does get frustrated, though, with employees
who do not push far enough or hard enough, as Mattel will have to
do to meet its long-term goal of increasing net income by 15
percent every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have years to make things happen,'' she said.
``Children change faster than adults, and to be representative of
where their interests lie, we've got to work very, very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barad is not bashful about her need for down time for
herself. She said she is typically out the door by 6:30 p.m. to be
home for dinner with her husband and two teen-age sons. She takes
Saturday off from work, and after spending Sunday morning on
paperwork, she spends the rest of the day with her family.
</P>
<P>
   She sometimes takes work home during the week but not does not
expect much from herself late at night. ``I figure that by 9
o'clock,'' she said, ``I'm so burned out, what am I giving
anyway?''

SEEKING SAFETY IN THE BOND WORLD? WATCH OUT FOR ITS MINEFIELDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Oct. 9)  
 (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last quarter, mutual fund investors learned just how wrong they
can be when they do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   The right thing in the last few months has been for investors to
exit stocks altogether, or at least to cut their holdings in
equities and take refuge in bonds. But investors who did so got it
wrong if they fled to funds that buy corporate debt,
emerging-markets issues, mortgage-backed securities or
convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the market witnessed an event in the last
quarter that is rare indeed: Treasuries left other bonds in the
dust.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, all bonds trade in tandem vis-a-vis Treasury
securities with similar maturities. But in the decoupling of bond
prices, which began in August and has continued, prices of
corporate bonds, junk issues, mortgage-backed securities and
emerging-markets bonds have fallen while Treasury securities have
risen.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to this injury, even if investors did things
doubly right _ abandoning stocks and getting into a fund that buys
Treasury securities _ they found that they would have been better
off owning individual Treasuries outright.
</P>
<P>
   For these two reasons, bond funds demonstrated their severe
limitations during the most recent quarter. Pile on top of these
disappointments management fees _ in general about 1 percent _ and
you have a sad story for investors in bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most bond fund returns were not anywhere near as
dismal as those of stock funds, many of which registered
double-digit declines during the quarter. While taxable bond funds
as a group eked out a gain of 0.3 percent in the quarter ended
Sept. 30, municipal bond funds returned 2.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When specific areas of the bond market are examined, it becomes
clear that the average bond fund came in well below its
corresponding index. For example, the tiny gain for taxable funds
was far below the 4.23 percent return of the Lehman Brothers
Aggregate Bond Index, which is used by Morningstar Inc., the
Chicago financial publisher, as the benchmark for the universe of
taxable bond funds it tracks. Long-term corporate bond funds rose
an average 1.52 percent compared with the 4.95 percent return of
their benchmark index.
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories are seen in fixed-income areas that showed big
losses for the quarter _ emerging-markets and high- yield bonds.
The J.P. Morgan emerging-markets bond index lost 21.23 percent,
while the average fund in the area fell 32.37 percent. And the
First Boston high-yield bond index declined 6.15 percent; the
average junk-bond fund lost 7.71 percent. Both benchmarks are used
by Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal bond funds that invest in long-term issues nationwide
returned 2.92 percent, modestly less than the 3.08 percent return
of the Lehman Brothers index but considerably less than the Bond
Buyer long-term index, which rose 4.37 percent in the quarter. And
the First Boston convertible bond index was down 10.85 percent,
versus a loss of 11.2 percent loss for the average convertible bond
fund. (But a comparable Merrill Lynch convertible bond index was
also down 11.2 percent) .
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for indexes to beat the returns of individual
managers. It happens in more and more stock funds every year. The
trouble is, mimicking the returns of various fixed-income indexes
is far more difficult for investors than mirroring the performance
of the main stock indexes.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for this. One is a bond's maturity.
Unlike stocks, which are essentially open-ended investments, bonds
mature, or repay principal at a predetermined date. Bond funds, to
diversify and have enough cash to cover shareholder redemptions,
typically invest in bonds of varying maturities and durations _ the
amount of time it takes to receive the present value of all the
interest and principal payments from a bond.
</P>
<P>
   However, bonds of a certain maturity are likely to perform quite
differently than those of another. In the third quarter, for
instance, the biggest decline in yields _ 23 percent _ and biggest
corresponding rise in price came in the five-year Treasury note.
But the average duration of Treasury bonds held by Morningstar's
universe of government bond funds is eight years, not the five-year
paper that provided the biggest bump.
</P>
<P>
   What that meant is that funds with lots of bonds maturing in
eight years did not move up as much as those limited to five-year
maturities. Of course, nobody could have predicted that five-year
securities would attract so many investors. And, going forward,
longer-term Treasuries could outperform. But given that bond funds
are constrained in their holdings, it does make picking spots in
the market rather tough.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in credit quality _ a big risk associated with
fixed-income investing _ are another reason it is difficult to
mimic bond fund indexes. Although bonds of many different qualities
declined during the quarter, those with lower grades fell much
further than their higher-quality brethren. Too many iffy issues in
junk-bond funds dragged down their performance much further than
the indexes.
</P>
<P>
   The best returns in the quarter were in funds that invest in
long-term Treasuries. These include the closest thing to owning
long-term bonds outright, the various American Century Benham
Target funds, which own bonds with specific maturities. Five of
these funds, which returned between 8.41 percent and 10.4 percent,
landed in the top 20 taxable bond funds during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, some emerging-markets bond
funds did so poorly that they lagged behind even the
worst-performing stock funds. The two biggest money-losers in the
taxable bond arena were the Morgan Stanley Institutional Emerging
Debt A fund, which lost almost 40 percent of its value, and Phoenix
B Emerging Markets Bond fund, down 36.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Losses in some junk-bond and convertible-bond funds were not as
severe _ but still nasty. The John Hancock High Yield Bond B fund
fell 18.06 percent during the third quarter. Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter B Convertible fund lost 15.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that fund managers can make a difference, some of the
other winning taxable bond funds were those that buy international
fixed-income securities, like FFTW International Fixed Income, up
10.42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   How could some international bond funds do so well when the vast
majority declined? The manager of FFTW International, Liaquat
Ahamed, chief investment officer of Fischer Francis Trees &AMP; Watts
in New York, made three good calls. He had longer-term bonds in the
portfolio, stuck with countries rated AA or better and concentrated
holdings in Germany. The fund's small size also helped: it has just
$77 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Even though bond returns are outpacing those of stocks, bond
funds have other pitfalls to be aware of. While owning a portfolio
of bonds in a fund can reduce the risk that one particular bond
issuer will fail, you're never quite sure of what you own.
</P>
<P>
   And because funds hold bonds of different maturities, it's
tougher to buy a fund for a specific purpose, like paying for a
child's college education in 12 years. Such a goal can be achieved
easily through holdings of individual bonds, typically zero-coupon
securities, which make no payments until maturity.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem lies in fund costs. With returns in
the low single digits, expenses of 1 percent are a big bite out of
shareholders' pockets. And because the management of these funds is
typically less active than that of a stock fund, one wonders about
the bang shareholders are getting for their bond buck.

GREECE AWARDS RAYTHEON $1.45B PACT FOR PATRIOT MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. Friday said it won a long-awaited contract to
supply Greece with $1.45 billion worth of Patriot missiles and
other military equipment _ welcome relief for Raytheon's
Massachusetts workers, who have been fretting about layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot missile, made famous during the Gulf War for
intercepting Iraq's Scud missiles, is built at Raytheon's Andover,
Mass. plant, which just this week announced 400 new job cuts, on
top of several earlier cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Greek missile order won't reverse those layoffs,
Raytheon spokeswoman Toni Simonetti said, ``What we we hope this
will do is help us stabilize our employment in Andover.''
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon currently has 2,952 employees in Andover, but many have
been idle for months, because of a lack of new orders for Patriot
and Hawk missiles, which are also assembled there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just hasn't been enough work to keep them all busy,''
said Simonetti. In fact, Raytheon in August announced 261 layoffs
in Andover because several hoped-for missile orders from foreign
countries were delayed because of global economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big contract,'' Simonetti said of the Greek Patriot
business. ``We're very happy about it. It's an important win for
the Andover operations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Andover plant is already operating well below historical
levels because production of another major missile, the AMRAAM, was
moved to Tuscon earlier this year. The shift was part of Raytheon's
consolidation efforts following its buyout of the defense units of
Hughes Electronics Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the plant will benefit from Raytheon's decision to
consolidate all of its circuit card assembly work in Andover, but
that shift has yet to occur.
</P>
<P>
   The union that represents Raytheon's manufacturing workers in
Andover welcomed news of the Greek missile order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we've been waiting for for a long time,''
said Michael Zagami, business manager of Local 1505 of the
International Brothers of Electrical Workers in Waltham.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had had this news sooner, maybe we might not have had
the layoffs,'' said Zagami, who blasted Raytheon officials earlier
this week for reneging on commitments to keep jobs in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The order for at least four, and possibly, six Patriot missiles
is the largest element of the Greek military contract. Raytheon
said the Patriot business could be worth as much as $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Greece will become the ninth country to buy the Patriot system.
The others are the United States, Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Germany, the Netherlands, Japan and Taiwan. Raytheon is also
targeting the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and South Korea for
Patriot sales, but analysts fear that economic and political
turmoil in those countries will likely delay any new orders.
</P>
<P>
   Greece will also buy 45 of Raytheon's new T-6A Texan II military
trainer aircraft. The planes, built in Wichita by Raytheon's
aircraft subsidiary, are valued at $200 million. Deliveries start
in July 1999 and extend through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The nation also awarded a $145 million contract to upgrade its
Hawk air-defense system to HKV, a joint venture between Raytheon
and Norway's Kongsberg Gruppen ASA.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek military is undertaking a major five-year
modernization that will cost nearly $16 billion, said Achilles
Paparsenos, a Greek Embassy spokesman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon had been expecting the Greek order for months, but
despite finally claiming it, the company still expects slower
growth in the next few years as economic weakness causes nations to
scale back their military purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Raytheon cut its sales growth forecast and
said it would cut its defense workforce 16 percent _ 5,300 more
jobs than planned _ to cope with slumping demand overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it now expects annual sales growth of 6 percent
to 8 percent, compared with an earlier estimate of 10 percent. By
stepping up cost reductions, however, Raytheon said it expects
profits to grow at a faster 10 to 12 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon also took a $284 million charge against earnings,
mostly to cope with weakness in its engineering unit.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon's Class B shares closed at 55 1/8, down 1 7/8.

ARIEL SHARON: FEISTY POLITICIAN IS NOT A NATURAL DIPLOMAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Sidebar with ISRAEL-SHARON)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Ariel Sharon has a law degree, and fancies himself a
farmer. But for more than three decades his role in Israeli public
life has been that of an unapologetic warrior, first on the
battlefield and later in the bare-knuckled combat of domestic
partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   With his blunt tongue, barrel chest and bar-scrapper's demeanor,
Sharon at 70 is to his many critics here a caricature of right-wing
intransigence. To his equally numerous admirers he is a living
symbol of unrelenting dedication to Israel's national survival.
</P>
<P>
   Still conveying physical vigor within an impressively expanding
frame, he remains pugnacious to a fault. Both his friends and foes
would agree that the new foreign minister is not a natural
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   A Zionist underground operative as a teen-ager and an infantry
commander wounded in the 1948 war of independence, Sharon has
fought, and fought memorably, in virtually every major military
engagement in his country's history.
</P>
<P>
   He commanded the legendary armored division that crossed and
seized control of the Sinai in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. He
returned to active service after a three-month retirement to lead
Israel's badly outgunned armored divisions to victory, again in the
Sinai, in the war of 1973.
</P>
<P>
   As defense minister in 982, Sharon led Israel's invasion of
Lebanon, defying international condemnation with unrelenting
artillery assaults on Beirut neighborhoods and Palestinian refugee
camps believed by the Israeli high command to be Palestine
Liberation Organization redoubts.
</P>
<P>
   To some, both in Israel and abroad, Sharon's Lebanese incursion
will forever be associated with the massacres by Lebanese Christian
Phalangists, allies of the Israelis, of a reported 460 unarmed
Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   In an official inquiry in Jerusalem and in a subsequent libel
trial he brought in New York, Sharon was seen to have effectively
refuted charges that he knew of and condoned the Phalangists'
attacks beforehand. But the government investigating commission
held that his failure to prevent the killings constituted grounds
for his dismissal from the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1982 invasion, Israel has been mired in an unpopular
open-ended occupation of southern Lebanon, an operation with
constant casualties among young inductees for which Sharon is still
often blamed.
</P>
<P>
   To many Israelis, however, the Lebanese incursion was ultimately
a risk worth taking, as it succeeded in crushing the PLO militarily
and driving its forces far from Israel's borders. The PLO's defeat
at Sharon's hands in Lebanon led eventually to its renunciation of
armed warfare against Israel and embrace of the peace negotiation
process for which Sharon as Foreign Minister will now be
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In civilian life he proved as savvy a political operator as he
was a military strategist, helping to break Labor's hold on the
Knesset and making himself an indispensable binding force within
successive fractious Likud coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   His investiture as foreign minister next week will mark his
sixth Cabinet appointment in 21 years. He previously held the
agriculture and defense portfolios under Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, trade and housing in Yitzhak Shamir's government, and
national infrastructure _ essentially, a settlements support
directorate _ in the administration of Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   As a key member of the ``inner cabinet'' in Begin's first
government, Sharon began the construction and systematic expansion
of new Israeli housing developments throughout the West Bank, Gaza
Strip and Galilee area territories occupied by Israel since 1967, a
policy that he and his opponents alike would agree remains his
signal domestic political achievement.
</P>
<P>
   At 70, Sharon remains one of the great polarizing fixtures of
Israeli political life. An acerbic critic of the other leading
soldier-politician of his generation, Yitzhak Rabin, Sharon
attacked the Oslo peace accords as ``terrible and dangerous'' and
condemned Rabin's negotiating partner, Yasser Arafat, as a ``war
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   He angrily opposed any diplomatic discussions of the return of
even an internationally demilitarized Golan Heights to Syria. A
secular Jew in the manner typical of his generation of native-born
Israelis, Sharon became an outspoken and effective defender of new
Orthodox Jewish settlements in the predominantly Palestinian areas
of the West Bank, cementing his position as a bridge between the
traditional secular right and the new militant religious factions
within the Likud coalition.

TWO MODERATE DEMOCRATS FACE TOUGH CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One is a black Democrat representing a
majority-white district in rural southwest Georgia. The other is a
white Democrat who hails from a sprawling South Carolina district
where blacks are more than 30 percent of the voting-age population.
</P>
<P>
   Both are moderates facing tough reelection battles that may turn
largely on the strength of black voter turnout. And the question
facing them was the same: Would they vote for an open-ended
impeachment inquiry against a president who is popular among
African-Americans?
</P>
<P>
   For Representatives Sanford D. Bishop Jr. of Georgia and John M.
Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the answers turned out to be
different. Spratt voted Thursday with the Republican majority to
launch only the third presidential impeachment inquiry in US
history; Bishop voted against the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   Their decisions underscored more than just the dilemma that
confronts many congressional Democrats who represent districts that
are both black and white, rural and urban. While black voters are
more united around Clinton and tend to vote Democratic, polls show,
whites are split in their attitudes about the president and in
their vote.
</P>
<P>
   As lawmakers try to wrap up their work this weekend and return
home to campaign for the Nov. 3 elections, they will find how their
votes on impeachment are playing among the voters. In districts
where candidates need the support of both black and whites, any
action in the impeachment process could simultaneously attract and
alienate important constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for a lot of Democrats is how many white voters do
they have in their districts for whom not only is this inquiry a
big deal for them, but who are anti-Clinton and will vote solely on
the basis of how their member of Congress votes in terms of the
impeachment proceedings,'' said David Bositis, senior political
analyst at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a
black think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, the most conservative member of the Congressional Black
Caucus, joined his 35 black colleagues in the House in voting
Thursday against the Republicans' unrestricted probe of Clinton
that could go beyond his relationship with former White House
intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the caucus members voted for the Democratic
alternative that would have placed more limits on the inquiry.
Those two _ Representatives John Lewis and Cynthia McKinney of
Georgia _ opposed any type of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   While Spratt may face the wrath of blacks voters who may
perceive his vote in favor of an impeachment inquiry as a vote
against Clinton, for Bishop, his vote may turn out to be the bigger
political gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his other black colleagues, who conspiciously rallied on
the House floor against an open-ended inquiry, Bishop was low key.
He had refused to reveal how he would vote in advance.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the vote, Bishop said: ``After
prayerful consideration and thoughtful deliberation in consultation
with my constituents,'' he decided against voting for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been politically expedient, and voted for the
Republicans resolution, but I could not in good conscience put my
personal and political interests ahead of the well-being of the
people'' of his district and the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went on, ``The president's conduct was wrong, it is
indefensible, and he should be punished. But it is the president
who should be punished, not the country.''
</P>
<P>
   By voting against the inquiry, Bishop could face a backlash from
white and rural voters, who are in the majority in his heavily
agricultural district and who are less enamored with Clinton than
Bishop's black constituents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bishop's is the only one among the 11 congressional races in
Georgia considered up for grabs, said Bill Shipp, the publisher of
a popular political newspaper in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Bishop cast his vote, Shipp said the ``best
politics'' for Bishop was to vote for the inquiry. ``It doesn't
matter much with the black vote, but it will matter a lot with the
white vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp said Bishop's opponent, a conservative businessman from
Albany, Joe McCormick, is likely to use a ``no'' vote against
Bishop. ``He will beat him over the head with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Silas Lee, a political pollster and sociologist at Xavier
University in New Orleans, said that Spratt's vote also contained
risk. He ``alienated 30 percent of his electorate, or a majority of
that 30 percent,'' Lee said. ``That that is not a good position for
anyone seeking reelection.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Lester, a Democratic pollster, said that ``even among
African-American voters, it's difficult for them to make the case
that there should not be any action taken by Congress against the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Brent Weaver, executive director of the South Carolina
Democratic Party, said Spratt's Republican challenger, Rock Hill
businessman Mike Burhold, had already begun ``trying to connect him
with the president and make them much closer than they may be.''
</P>
<P>
   He conceded Spratt's vote may not sit well with black voters in
his district. ``There's a fine line to tow in regard to this issue
_ not upsetting African-Americans who are in support of the
president and those Democrats who are,'' he said. Although Spratt's
and Bishop's vote could cause problems among some constituents, the
impeachment drive may stay on the margin of issues voters care
about in their districts, said Bositis at the Joint Center.
</P>
<P>
   The key for them and similarly situated Democrats will be voter
turnout, he said. ``The Democrats main problem in regard to turnout
is there is a big proportion of people in the country, maybe a
majority, who really don't care about this scandal at all,''
Bositis said. ``The problem is that a lot of those same people
don't care about politics either, and so they don't vote.''

COMMENTARY: OH, BY THE WAY ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The boldface word in the 5th graf should be italicized.) 
(mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt the fun Congress is
having with its impeachment hearings and all. But, well, there's
just this little problem going on in the rest of the world. It has
to do with economics. You see, the world's first truly global
economy is going through its first truly serious global crisis. If
you follow the global credit crunch and market declines as they are
displayed on graphs on a Bloomberg machine, they each look like an
EKG tracking a massive heart attack. So, you know, we might want to
talk about it. I mean, not all the time. Maybe just in between the
impeachment hearings and the release of the next Tripp tapes. Like
I said, I don't mean to interrupt ...
</P>
<P>
   BUT HAVE WE GONE NUTS???
</P>
<P>
   We are not just heading for lower growth, and possibly a
recession. We are seeing at minimum a slowdown and at a maximum a
breakdown in the whole progression toward free-market capitalism.
That progression has enormously benefited Americans and millions of
people in emerging markets, where $350 billion has been invested
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, some of that investing was done without proper regard to
the risks, as banks, mutual funds and individuals indiscriminately
chased higher and higher yields anywhere in the world.
Unfortunately, what is happening now is that those same investors
are, without any distinctions between good and bad countries,
pulling their money out in pursuit of lower and lower risks,
putting all their money into T-bills or a mattress. The net result
is to choke off credit to everyone, from bad Russian banks to good
Brazilian factories to promising American start-up companies, in a
way that can only lead to misery and unemployment. As the vice
chairman of Goldman Sachs International, Robert Hormats, says, ``We
have not seen a withdrawal of liquidity this big from the Third
World since the good lord parted the Red Sea to let the children of
Israel walk through.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republican-led Congress is having a grand time,
recklessly dragging out the impeachment of the president until
Christmas _ and it's not even clear  &UR; which  &LR; Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that because of this financial crisis we must
ignore President Clinton's horrendous personal behavior. But it is
to say we've got to recognize that the global context that existed
when this affair first erupted has fundamentally changed. You may
not know that from watching CNN or MSNBC, with their 24-hour-a-day
impeach-a-tainment shows. But it has. And it has changed into a
global crisis that requires enormous political leadership in
general and U.S. leadership in particular. It is time, therefore,
to take Gerald Ford's advice and work out a censure plea bargain
between Clinton, Kenneth Starr and Congress and be done with this
affair _ now.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the dollar fell by 20 Japanese yen in two days. That
is the sort of volatility you expect in the Mexican peso. It just
doesn't happen with the dollar. It is like seeing a cat fly. When
panicked markets overshoot this badly, you have to overshoot them
right back. What is needed now are some holy-cow, in-your-face,
stick-this-in-your-portfolio-and-smoke-it, confidence-building
measures by the U.S., Europe and Japan to break the negative
psychology of the markets and stoke up some real worldwide demand.
That requires, among other things, a U.S. president able to
galvanize the process, explain it and press it forward.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires a steep drop in the key interest rate by the
Federal Reserve from the current level of 5.25 percent; an
incremental drop won't do it. And it may require using some of the
budget surplus for a tax cut. It also requires a cut in
German-European interest rates. And it certainly requires an
emergency cleanup of the bankrupt Japanese banking system. The real
systemic threat to the global economy today is the continuing risk
of large-scale bank failures in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a test, folks. If this credit crunch continues it
will have enormously destabilizing effects. Because on the one hand
the world is telling developing countries to reform their
economies, clean up their banks and get their financial software up
to Western standards. And on the other hand, it is telling them
that they are going to have to do this with much, much less capital
from the developed countries, or with much, much higher interest
rates at home. That is a prescription for political explosions all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, I didn't mean to interrupt ...

   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. said Friday that 27 senior executives
would retire or change jobs at the end of the year, as William Clay
Ford Jr. and Jacques Nasser began putting their stamp on the
company as they move toward becoming chairman and chief executive,
respectively, on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant change was the creation of the position of
chief of staff _ an unusual title in American industry. Ford also
announced the retirement of its general counsel and its top
executives for auto manufacturing, auto parts production, engine
production, quality control, human resources and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up will trim the number of executives at the rank of
vice president and higher to 40 from 45.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Pestillo, an executive vice president, was promoted to
vice chairman and chief of staff and will oversee the general
counsel's office, regulatory compliance, government affairs, human
resources and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   While chiefs of staff are common in state and federal agencies,
the position is rare at big American companies. Pestillo, a
longtime ally of Ford, said it made sense for an automaker to
combine a wide range of administrative tasks under a single
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``These activities interact fairly regularly, particularly in a
highly regulated industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street loves Pestillo, because his negotiations with the
United Automobile Workers union have kept Ford free of strikes
since 1986, even while controlling labor costs. General Motors
Corp. and Chrysler Corp. have been repeatedly crippled by walkouts.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent and third-youngest retiree Friday was Charles
Szuluk, the 55-year-old president of Visteon Automotive Systems,
Ford's huge auto parts division. Ford began taking steps two years
ago to prepare Visteon to be spun off. But in recent months, a
consensus has been forming at the company that any such move should
be delayed for several years, to allow Visteon to win more business
from other automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Szuluk said that his retirement reflected satisfaction with the
work he had already done at Visteon and his desire to ``go to
Florida and improve my golf handicap.''
</P>
<P>
   Visteon will now be run by less senior executives. Craig
Muhlhauser, a Ford vice president, will replace Szuluk, who is a
group vice president. Edward Hagenlocker, the 58-year-old chairman
of Visteon and a vice chairman of Ford, announced last month that
he would retire at the end of this year, and has not been replaced.
Instead, John Devine, Ford's chief financial officer and an
executive vice president, will add oversight of Visteon to his
responsibilities, but no Visteon title.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ford named James Padilla, who has turned around the
company's operations in Latin America, to become group vice
president for manufacturing, replacing Robert Transou, who is
retiring.

SHELL ATTEMPTS TO FOSTER NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CAPITALIZE ON THEM 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of Dr. Harold Vinegar's most promising inventions had a
three-year coating of dust when a colleague stopped by his
laboratory at Shell Oil Co. and stunned him with a seemingly casual
question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any ideas?''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his file cabinet were photos and vials of treated
soil, evidence of a technological breakthrough capable of cleaning
up the dirtiest of industrial sites, transforming tar-contaminated
soils into clean, white beach sand.
</P>
<P>
   What really amazed Vinegar was that someone inside Shell saw a
business opportunity in an idea that the oil company's top
executives repeatedly had rejected. Not even inquiries from
potential customers such as General Electric Co., anxious to use
Vinegar's technology to clean up their polluted sites, could pique
their interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just unbelievable,'' Vinegar says. ``The argument had
always been, `We're not interested in that business _ we're in the
oil business.' Suddenly, here was a group of people that were both
scientists as well as entrepreneurs and eager to take a new idea
and look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Vinegar and others now call ``revolutionary'' was a radical
new venture for the fiercely secretive company. Shell was quietly
forming a business to uncover cutting-edge technology buried deep _
and all too often lost _ inside its maze-like bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some Shell-sized businesses created from
Shell's technologies in the past where Shell got virtually no
profit,'' says Bill Dirks, leader of the effort called Shell
Technology Ventures. He conceived and sold the idea of creating a
company to commercialize discoveries made in Royal Dutch
Shell/Group's labs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, short-sighted policies that allowed other companies
to license Shell-authored technologies enabled them to profit from
the oil company's innovations. Shell, whose exploration and
production research lab has a $500-million-a-year budget, had made
discoveries that led to such breakthrough ideas as the floating
drilling rig, and a computer chip design that was the precursor to
random access memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal _ I have a hard time getting our employees to believe
it some days _ our goal is to be a Fortune 500 company in 10
years,'' says Dirks, president and chief executive officer of Shell
Technology Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Shell _ and Dirks _ is to create an
environment within the world's largest public oil company where
entrepreneurs can thrive and build a start-up company. In the past,
Shell, and other big oil companies, have done a great job
developing technology and a miserable job of marketing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is dramatically different,'' says Fred
Lowther, chairman of the Washington, D.C., law firm Dickstein,
Shapiro, Morin, and Oshinsky, which specializes in launching
start-ups at energy companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly countercultural to energy companies,'' says John
Griffin, partner in the Houston office at Heidrick &AMP; Struggles, the
executive search firm, referring to the concept behind the unit.
``Energy companies are so driven to be proprietary. What Shell
(said) is, `We've got a machine in here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin and Lowther are both members of a four-person advisory
board Dirks set up to help guide the venture.
</P>
<P>
   For Vinegar and his fellow researchers, the new company has
created for the first time at Shell a forum for discussing and
selling ideas, unleashing a wave of entrepreneurial energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly people are taking things off their shelves,'' Vinegar
says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Research cut back industrywide &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shell's new venture comes at a time when researchers at oil
companies feel a bit like an endangered species. The oil industry
dramatically scaled back research and development spending in the
late 1980s and early 1990s. And today's low oil prices intensify
pressure to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   A common worry within the industry is that this bottom-line
focus will stifle innovative ideas and the entrepreneurial culture
necessary to foster them _ the lifeblood of an effort such as
Shell's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice idea but it depends on how it's managed,'' says
Ronald Robinson, president of Texaco Technology, referring to
Shell's new venture.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming pressure to deliver strong profits could
discourage scientists from embarking on new, risky ideas that hold
out an equal promise of breakthrough and a failure, Robinson warns.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage innovation, Robinson has set aside 7 percent to 10
percent of his research and development budget for scientists to
pursue the projects of their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't use it,'' he says incredulously. ``The pressures on
them to produce things that are incremental is so great at the
price of oil we have today,'' Robinson explains. ``We need a
different culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem industrywide is that when researchers devote their
efforts to sure things, the results only yield relatively minor
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mindset is such that when the price of oil is $13 or $14,
the opportunity to stick your neck out _ the culture's just not
there,'' Robinson says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Products give business boost &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite such industry pressures, Shell unveiled its new
technology venture in August, and the business is off and running
with two new products.
</P>
<P>
   Vinegar's invention had already spawned a 2-year-old company,
TerraTherm Environmental Services, which specializes in removing
hazardous waste from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The second business idea is being developed through a joint
venture with Halliburton Co. It involves a process that expands
pipe casing in oil wells drilled in difficult to operate places,
such as mile-deep waters.
</P>
<P>
   This approach solves the problem that forced companies to use
progressively smaller diameter pipe as a well got deeper. By
expanding the pipe, oil companies can drill smaller holes while
drilling deeper, greatly reducing the cost.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two years, Shell Technology Ventures hopes to sell
technology that produces heat from natural gas without a flame.
This could enable industrial plants to substantially reduce
hazardous emissions and could someday allow the development of
flameless industrial or home furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another technology promises to lower infrastructure costs
and operating expenses at natural gas processing plants by
stripping liquids from natural gas more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   While Dirks has the backing of one of the world's richest
companies, the launch of the group is something of a high-wire act.
He has to balance the uncertainty of any one technology's success
with the need to deliver profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell, even when you have the right new market and
the right financing ... which new business is going to be a billion
dollar business and which is going to be a flop,'' Dirks says.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Technology Ventures has ``got to show very rapid
profitability,'' he notes. He predicts it will meet that point in
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to find a way somehow to pay back the corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting ahead of the curve
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Shell's budding business opportunities often never
saw the light of day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy in Shell for decades has been, `Our technology
is for our beneficial use only,''' Dirks says. ``We never
purposefully in Shell have had a philosophy of sharing our
technology with the commercial marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1994 with an initiative launched by
Philip Carroll, then Shell Oil's chief executive officer. The
high-level effort sought to develop new ventures outside Shell's
core oil and gas business to provide new and better sources of
future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dirks, then a 37-year-old geologist who'd been with
Shell for 13 years, was on a conventional career track involved in
U.S. exploration. He saw change engulfing the industry and he
wanted to be ahead of it.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's effort provided an opportunity for Dirks, who held
what he describes as ``an interesting conversation'' with Jack
Little, then president of Shell Exploration &AMP; Production Co. Dirks
told him he didn't want to be onshore exploration manager anymore
and asked Little, now CEO of Shell Oil, for the chance to lead the
team developing growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Little didn't grant Dirk's wish, but left him an opening by
providing some time, a few workers and a small budget to work on
the initiative. Dirks and his team began asking for ideas from
researchers and even set up a ``Wild Ideas'' Web site on Shell's
in-house computer network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we'd get a response, it kept being from somebody in
the labs, and they'd pull open a drawer, and out would come a
patent or out would come a document that had been buried and it
would be fabulous,'' Dirks recalls.
</P>
<P>
   After months of culling through ideas from Shell's labs in
Houston, Dirks' team had a stack of about eight or 10 ideas to
choose from.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became very clear: Shell was a Fortune 500 company with a
lot of R&AMP;D that could be leveraged,'' Dirks says. ``To me, there
was no reason why we couldn't become a competitor to Lucent
Technologies in our own industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The geologist-turned-entrepreneur now had to become a political
strategist as well to garner support within this global company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to market the idea to parts of Shell that I didn't even
know existed,'' Dirks said.
</P>
<P>
   To guide his campaign, Dirks drew a map of what he called
``company stakeholders,'' listing likely backers and critics, and
he embarked on an eight-month campaign for support.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over he made that argument that if Shell invested in
marketing its technologies, it could create billion-dollar
businesses. At the same time, it would maintain control of its
technologies for Shell and other users.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with business plans for both the new venture and a new
company based on Vinegar's technology, Dirks won approval from Jack
Little to launch Shell Technology Ventures as a U.S. effort in the
spring of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The unit moved quickly to act on Vinegar's invention and
established a new company to launch it called TerraTherm
Environmental Services. It quickly set up a marketing plan, hired
an employment agency to staff TerraTherm, and set up TerraTherm
offices in The Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   At a Shell test facility in southwest Houston, which Vinegar
calls his ``playground'', Shell has tested Vinegar's equipment for
removing contaminants from the soil, as well as tools for
underwater seismic surveys and well logging exercises.
</P>
<P>
   While showing a visitor around the site, which looks like a
miniature golf course of oil-field contraptions, Vinegar lingers
almost lovingly at the TerraTherm equipment. It includes a sort of
industrial electric blanket that heats the ground to temperatures
of 1,000 degrees Celsius, literally boiling out harmful
contaminants such as PCBs, the acronym for Polychlorinated
Hydrocarbons. This process is sold as odorless, noiseless and
doesn't require disturbing the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It has been used in six jobs in the past two years, including
the cleanup of a former drag strip Superfund site in New York owned
by General Electric and a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers job on the
island of Saipan, where the carcinogenic chemical leaked out of
transformers islanders used to decorate their homes and family
gravesites.
</P>
<P>
   While Vinegar says the technology is effective, he admits the
price of doing the jobs will limit the market. To create a mass
market among industrial operators, they'll need to reduce the cost
enough to make this type of cleanup competitive with the price of
capping a polluted site and walking away from it.
</P>
<P>
   TerraTherm also is examining options to use the technology in
such situations as cleaning up chemical plant sites, railroad yards
and even sterilizing the soil in farm fields to get rid of harmful
pests.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Partnership takes shape &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as the discovery and development of Vinegar's technology
helped garner support for the new venture from Shell, Dirks logged
another milestone in reaching a joint venture agreement with
Halliburton.
</P>
<P>
   The pact with the oil-field service and supply giant to market
Shell Technology's other big product helped sell the concept of the
new business unit to the powers that be at Shell's parent, Royal
Dutch/Shell in July.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, Shell Technology Ventures went from being a
domestic organization to become a global organization with
deep-pocketed support.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, this second venture also demonstrated that marketing
new ideas in the oil service business is a tricky sell. Shell
Technology realized that, to commercialize its inventions, it would
need help from the companies that control access to oil company
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But convincing big oil-field service companies, such as
Halliburton or Schlumberger, to join in a Shell-led venture
represented a new way of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   It took a year for Halliburton and Shell to overcome mutual
suspicions prior to forming the latest of Shell Technology
Ventures' businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants an extra competitor, particularly when that
competitor is as large as Shell,'' notes Dirks.
</P>
<P>
   That venture represented a change from the traditional
relationship in which oil-field service companies traditionally
have licensed technology from oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Halliburton officials say they were concerned that they would be
blamed if the joint venture failed, potentially antagonizing one of
their best customers. Shell executives feared that Halliburton
would not work hard to sell a technology that might compete with
some of its existing products.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those soft issues are very, very important,'' says Ali
Daneshy, vice president of integrated technology products at
Halliburton Energy Services in Houston. ``Today we are very
comfortable with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology will make a difference,`` he notes.
</P>
<P>
   Called Enventure Global Technology, the tool uses a device,
called a pig, made of secret materials crafted with special angles,
that expands the width of the pipe casing like a hand pushing
through a tight sock. It allows the operator to drill deeper, using
fewer strings of casing to complete a well while also taking less
time.
</P>
<P>
   Shell is still working on convincing other oil-field service
companies that it is not a competitor. And if Dirks keeps up the
dogged persistence and sensitive politicking that already have
changed so many minds, he may just end up being successful.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's not content.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, the track record has yet to be proven,'' he
says. And while there are pressures to succeed, &UR;  &LR; Dirks says the
greatest challenge is to deliver on the promises he has made to his
colleagues who, like him, have left promising careers to pursue
this vision of Shell Technology Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do anything that's going to cost them their
jobs because we couldn't get this profitable,'' Dirks says.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices now are a major worry in the business _ slowing
exploration and triggering thousands of layoffs. Earlier this week,
Shell said it would cut 740 jobs, or 20 percent of its work force
at its exploration and production unit. But Dirks argues the
technologies he is developing will end up cutting costs, and
ultimately changing the way the energy industry _ and possibly
other industries as well _ do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's big money to be made _ if I can find one big-hit
technology, we can start a Shell-sized business,'' Dirks says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes one semisubmersible drilling rig venture to do
that, which is why I think we're going to make it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Filmmakers say portraying heaven is one of their trickiest tasks
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angels playing harps. Gates of pearl. People wearing crowns as
they float blissfully about a golden city nestled in the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   It might be heaven, but it's hell for filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Images of heaven have inspired people of faith for ages, but the
subject is a major pain for filmmakers. The problem? A
conflict-free existence with no nasty villains may be great
theology, but produces boring movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you say, 'We all live in peace and harmony and worship
God,' you don't have much of a plot after that,'' said Fritz Boger,
a minister who teaches a course on film and faith at Columbia
Theological Seminary in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Ward disagrees. He's the director of ``What Dreams May
Come,'' a multimillion-dollar movie released last weekend that
focuses on the afterlife and stars Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Ward departs from the traditonal view of heaven. In his vision,
each person experiences a different version of heaven. And his
angels aren't winged, celestial creatures. They curse; one cranky
angel even challenges another to a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said he had to do something different because he was
tackling a subject that filmmakers dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen paradise or heaven depicted in a compelling
fashion,'' Ward said during a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Blame some of that on Christian theology.
</P>
<P>
   In the book of Matthew, Jesus declares that romantic
relationships are dissolved in heaven _ ``For in the resurrection
they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like angels in
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers, however, know that audiences love a good love story.
That's why the most memorable films on heaven spend more time in
their movies developing romantic relationships than exploring
ephemeral theological themes.
</P>
<P>
   In ``What Dreams May Come,'' Williams' character discovers that
heaven is hell without his soulmate and romantic love.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Defending Your Life,'' director/actor Albert Brooks has to
go to heaven before he can finally meet the perfect woman; ``Made
in Heaven,'' with Timothy Hutton and Kelly McGillis, focuses on a
heaven filled with gardens and bucolic countryside, where they make
love.
</P>
<P>
   Many film critics and directors agree that it's a mistake to
attempt to portray heaven literally. It's better, they think, to
hint at the afterterlife symbolically.
</P>
<P>
   As examples, they point to the startling communion scene at the
end of ``Places In the Heart,'' and the joyous banquet in the
enchanting Danish film ``Babette's Feast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're (working) with some spiritual themes, all you can
do is infer,'' said the Rev. Timothy McNulty, a Presbyterian
minister who publishes ``Visual parables,'' a newsletter that
examines religious values in film. ``Any attempt to photograph or
pin it down doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Such films also bog down when filmmakers make heaven too
sentimental. That's one of the problems Nancy Dixon of
Lawrenceville had with ``What Dreams May Come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overdramatic,'' Dixon said. ``It seemed kind of silly
that the family's two kids would die, then the dog, then the wife _
everybody's dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers have been much more successful capturing the
netherworld on film.
</P>
<P>
   Torment is a much easier concept to grasp than bliss, said
Barbara DeConcini, an Emory University professor who is an
authority on religion and film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what it means to be utterly miserable,'' DeConcini
said. ``What makes eternal damnation horrifying is the notion that
the worst you've ever felt is going to be your state forever.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Garden will have to roll with The Rock
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCCAYSVILLE, Ga. _ Like archaeologists on a dig in ancient
lands, Lyn and I began uncovering The Rock that sits majestically
on the hillside sloping to Fightingtown Creek.
</P>
<P>
   This adventure, started a couple of weeks ago, must be done in
stages, as it requires both patience and strength. Patience to weed
out the myriad plants, some tiny, and strength to dislodge the
bigger trees and shrubs that long ago took up residence on the big
stone, spreading tenacious roots deep and wide.
</P>
<P>
   The uncovering launches my gardening on the creek side of the
cabin, coming after months of clearing and digging and planting on
the road side. There, hundreds of excavated rocks form borders and
designs around dozens of plants, creating a kind of mountain
symphony, bearing witness to one more effort to garden against the
odds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the creek side, the land had remained untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Now the touching begins. Fitting that it should start with what
arguably is the most impressive part of the landscape. This huge
outcropping, this gigantic piece of gray stone inspires awe; it is
a focal point that no amount of shrubbery can equal in this wild
garden.
</P>
<P>
   I always knew The Rock had presence, but only after we cleared a
bit of its surface did I know just how much presence. Less obscured
by brush, it is much larger than I had thought. Also, looking down
at it from the porch, I was surprised at its clearly defined shape,
a half-moon, with ruffled edges resembling flower petals on the
curved side. It must measure 20 feet across and 10 feet deep.
</P>
<P>
   On the straight side of The Rock, toward the cabin, several
stones just the right size for sitting are lined up. Sit on those
stones and face the big half-moon, and you feel as if you are part
of an audience looking down at a stage. It is easy to imagine
Cherokee elders sitting on these rocks, addressing a group of
council members on The Rock below.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever uses this massive piece of rock has had, it always has
had respect, I know.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who sees it stops and stares in much the same way that
we all stare at Fightingtown Creek, at the ocean crashing against
rocks, rolling onto sandy shores. There is power in all these
marvels of nature _ a seductive, mesmerizing power.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovering The Rock is, in a sense, freeing it, unleashing its
power.
</P>
<P>
   First, I collected the mosses growing on its surface, anchored
in years of leaf mold. With trowel and pruners, I loosened huge
sheets of these tiny plants, cutting away roots from surrounding
shrubs. With the mosses bedded down in the roadside garden, I
returned to pull out briars and weeds and little pines and laurels.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn raked the leaf mold, pulled weeds and held on to my overalls
to keep me from falling overboard when I leaned over the front of
the stone to prune some shrub from a crevice. Every 20 minutes or
so, we rested on the rocks, looking down at the gray half-moon,
marveling at its change.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly in silence we stared, discovering mottling of charcoal,
light and dark grays on the newly uncovered surface, crevices we
did not know existed. No longer absolutely flat, it bulges gently
here and there.
</P>
<P>
   What else will we discover? Artifacts from other lives, other
times?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not. That won't matter. The Rock, big, beautiful,
powerful, this first and foremost feature in the garden by the
creek, soon will be free.

 &HT;    What to look for before you tickle the ivories
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When shopping for a piano, don't be intimidated by the number of
options. Some key points to remember:
</P>
<P>
   -- Tone. For most, it's the most important feature. Play, or
have a salesperson play, the same short piece on every piano you
consider.
</P>
<P>
   -- Touch. Make sure the keys travel smoothly and quickly,
allowing a full range of expression.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tuning. Ask a technician about the tuning stability of the
various brands you consider.
</P>
<P>
   -- Beauty. Examine the luster and finish of the cabinet. Does it
invite touch? Is it smooth? Is the finish durable?
</P>
<P>
   -- Value. Ask around for brands that have reputations for
quality and durability.
</P>
<P>
   -- Image. Ask the dealer how well the manufacturer is
established and if it has a reputation for quality and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   -- Life. Ask the dealer about its service policy.

 &HT;    `Decorator pianos,' idle or high-tech, can fine-tune rooms
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suzy Berliner and Sandy Hartman may not play the piano, but
their elegant white grand does far more than collect dust _ it
makes a nice backdrop for cat hair.
</P>
<P>
   That's because their large black and white Himalayan, Rhett
Butler, is the only one in their house who uses the piano _ for a
snooze under the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took piano lessons as a kid but only practiced right before
the lessons,'' Berliner said. ``That was the extent of my
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when she and Hartman built their new home in Buckhead last
spring, its two-story living room screamed for something with some
scale _ and not necessarily the musical kind _ so a grand fit the
bill. ``We bought it just for the look,'' Berliner said. ``But when
someone comes around who can actually play it, it's great!''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the piano is in harmony with a
growing number of others across middle-class America that are
assuming a new role _ as decoration. And that's not such a sad note
for an instrument celebrating almost 300 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the right space, a beautiful piano becomes sculpture,''
said Charles Gandy, an Atlanta interior designer. ``For a lot of
people, the grand is a symbol that they've arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every ``decorator piano'' sits idle. After decades of
relying on sales to moms and dads bent on tapping their kids'
musical talents, piano retailers can vouch: The piano's gone
high-tech. Among their hottest sellers are computerized acoustical
players that offer thousands of songs using compact discs for hours
of continuous music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have Rachmaninoff playing in your living room while
you're giving a party,'' said Barbara Kirby of Piano Gallery in
Atlanta _ without hiring anyone to tickle the ivories.
</P>
<P>
   The trends reflect the buying habits of consumers who can afford
such a luxurious decoration. ``It used to a real bread-and-butter
thing with kids and lessons,'' said Lori Morse of Baldwin Piano &AMP;
Organ Co. in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Decorator and automatic player pianos are a far cry from what
Italian harpsichord maker Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori had in
mind when he invented the piano around 1700. Although it would
assume various forms over the next three centuries _ grand, square,
upright, spinet, console _ and finishes, including ebony, walnut,
mahogany, rosewood, ivory and white _ the basic instrument remains
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Grand pianos typically boast better tone than common uprights,
so they cost more; the tilt-top models, therefore, bring more class
to interiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up in a little town in Ohio in the '40s, I thought
anyone who had a grand was a millionaire,'' Kirby said.
</P>
<P>
   Today's models start at about $10,000 and can reach $150,000 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   And though some buyers have good intentions, others buy grands
with no plans for learning to play. ``I think prestige is what
they're after,'' said Al Rich of Jim Scott Organ &AMP; Pianos in
Marietta, Georgia. ``A grand piano adds an element of elegance to a
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich, who estimated some 5 percent of his sales are decorator
pianos, gets a lot of business from designers shopping for
furniture in a specific size and price. ``Quality doesn't come into
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's the ``piano-shaped object'' their clients are
after. ``They'll say, 'We don't care if it plays' because their
decorator's told them it will look good in their home,'' Morse
said.
</P>
<P>
   One driving force is today's popular house designs. Builders, in
devoting most living space to the great room, have shrunk the less
popular formal living room. Buyers, in turn, have turned to
alternative uses for the living room, such as home offices and
music rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Powers of Atlanta chose the latter. ``I wanted something
that looked like a nice piece of furniture when you walked in the
house,'' she said. So she bought a Baldwin grand _ a white one for
making the room look more contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy had a client with an even bolder idea. ``We refinished the
piano in Chinese red to match other things in the house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Decorating magazines also have taught consumers how to use the
piano as a grand display for accessories. ``People love the idea of
grouping silver-framed pictures on top of one or a nice vase of
roses,'' said Linda Westbury, an Atlanta interior designer.
</P>
<P>
   Gandy takes the opposite approach in his Atlanta condo with the
80-year-old grand he acquired from a friend's estate _ one he
actually plays. ``It's a beautiful thing to look at, so I don't
decorate it,'' said the award-winning designer, who takes lessons
every week. ``I cherish the piano too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if they don't play, some buy pianos for entertaining,
whether the player is human or digital.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin's ConcertMaster has a built-in hard drive that can play
almost 10,000 songs using a floppy or compact disc and provide up
to 20 hours of continuous music. The player, which sells for about
$7,000, also can be wired into the home's sound system. ``The piano
is activated, but you have accompaniment playing behind it,'' Morse
said.
</P>
<P>
   For about $5,000, even standard uprights and grands can be
retrofitted for players.
</P>
<P>
   Such advancement has made the piano, the third largest household
investment, appreciate in value even more than it has throughout
time.
</P>
<P>
   Powers knew that when she went shopping for her grand, but she
had an ulterior motive. ``I played growing up, participated in
talent shows, recitals,'' she said. ``It was a big part of my life,
so I wanted to make sure my kids would learn, too.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, she's content to use the white piano as decoration. But
she's pulled out some of her old sheet music from childhood _ just
in case.

 &HT;    Savoring Seattle: Pack an appetite with your poncho
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL OCTOBER 11: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE_First you notice the baby. All pink cheeks, she is
gnawing on a bright blue potato. Then there's the dude squatting
beside his bicycle, packing a case _ a whole case! _ of peaches
into the side pouches of his two-wheeler. By the time you see the
man ambling around with a bunch of red-veined Swiss chard sprouting
from his backpack, you don't give it a second thought _ even though
it kind of reminds you of van Gogh's lost ear.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Seattle. Everything you've heard is true.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon is redder. The berries are bluer. The greens are
greener. No wonder people here are literally becoming attached to
their food. They are the counterparts of Parisians who wander the
streets with baguettes under their arms. Already known as a mecca
of earth-loving, bike-riding, coffee-drinking individualists, this
city is blossoming into a full-blown food lover's paradise, a
veritable Eden by the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Roll over, James Beard. Au revoir, Alice Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is creating an exciting culinary vocabulary that is
uniquely its own. Unlike the South, which boasts a mythic cuisine
some 300 years in the making, this 150-year-old food culture
continues to evolve even as it flourishes. Think of foragers
gathering wild blackberries and chanterelles, fishermen catching
black cod and halibut, Asian immigrants disseminating their own
techniques and ingredients, and farmers planting exotic produce
beside their native stands. Think of hippies who stashed homemade
beer under their beds in the 1960s, then built the microbreweries
and vineyards of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that along with the Space Needle, the
harbor and the aquarium, one of the town's top tourist magnets is
its open-air produce stall. Founded on Puget Sound in 1907, Pike
Place Market is one of the world's great markets _ a sensual
overload that crushes with the perfume of flowers and food. You
know the 16th-century Italian artist Arcimboldo, the one who
painted images of the human face made up of various fruits,
vegetables, flowers or fish? One can only imagine what he could do
with this cornucopia of lobster mushrooms, Dungeness crabs and dewy
raspberries.
</P>
<P>
   In this nine-acre historic district with some 300 commercial
tenants, there are hole-in-the-wall oyster bars, a pirogi stand, a
Latin grocery, a Turkish fast-food joint, the original Starbucks,
an Italian food shop that stocks 100 brands of olive oil, and a
gardening center with seeds for things you've never heard of: 12
different basils, 68 kinds of tomatoes, even Baby Boo Mini
Pumpkins. Louis DeLaurenti, proprietor of the Italian place, slices
into a wedge of pecorino cheese and reminisces about the days when
he used to stack salt cod on the counter _ naked. These days, you
get your fish packed on dry ice to take home or you can nibble
smoked salmon straight off the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Or you go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco's got better restaurants, but we don't worry
about it,'' says seafood expert Jon Rowley, who taught local
fishermen the quality-control measures that have put the region's
oysters and salmon on the global map.
</P>
<P>
   Why worry, indeed, when you can order corned-beef hash and a
poached egg for breakfast, fried razor clams and wild blackberry
cobbler for lunch, then slurp oysters and wine all night long.
That's the real-people food.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a trend, it's pan-Asian. Blowfish, Wild Ginger,
Etta's Seafood, Flying Fish: These are the restaurants where some
of the city's top talents are fusing Asian and indigenous flavors.
This means peanut noodles twirled with pea vines and
ginger-barbecued pork, Alaskan spot prawns fired with chile
peppers, skewers of scallop satay.
</P>
<P>
   But to see what the locals are eating, you must get out and
wander _ to the organic markets, ethnic groceries and neighborhood
P-Patch where residents grow their own stuff.
</P>
<P>
   At the Japanese grocery Uwajimaya, there are tanks of oysters,
abalone and long-schnozzled geoduck clams. Also rice cookers, sushi
trays, an entire sake department and the tiniest six-packs of beer
you've ever seen: 4 1/2-ounce Sapporos.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of downtown, you'll find the University District
Farmers Market, a showcase for the organic bounty of the land. On
Saturdays from May through October, you see home cooks and chefs
loading their bicycles and knapsacks with currant tomatoes,
butterscotch melons and purslane.
</P>
<P>
   Potatoes? Bet you can't eat just one. One vendor has 10 kinds,
including Ruby Crescents, Russian Banana fingerlings, German
Butterballs and blues. At the sprout stand, there are radish
sprouts, mustard sprouts, corn sprouts, cilantro sprouts, arugula
sprouts _ 10 varieties in all. This is the place to fill a vase
with tufted ``Teddy Bear'' sunflowers and giant dahlias, dip into a
pot of buckwheat honey or muse over the umpteen greens sold by the
region's Southeast Asian farmers, from bok choy to pok choy to baby
bok choy.
</P>
<P>
   If these earthly delights inspire you to get a little closer to
nature, pick a P-Patch garden and wander through it. This
25-year-old model of urban neighborhood gardening includes 38
public sites around the city. The Belltown patch, just north of
Pike Place Market, is all done up with tile mosaics, wrought iron
sculpture, sunflowers and garlic blossoms. In a sculpted metal
chalice over the entrance, somebody has added a bunch of plastic
grapes. Somewhere, Bacchus is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Down at the Interbay P-Patch, Starbucks executive Ray Schutte is
putting in his winter crop of greens, and Rowley, the seafood
expert, is turning piles of compost. So what's with this town?
``Until you have gone through 40 days of gray, you don't understand
sunshine,'' Schutte says.
</P>
<P>
   Get Rowley going and he'll wax elemental about the Pacific
Northwest cuisine, how it all comes from earth, compost, salt, sea.
``Copper River king salmon with fresh morel mushrooms _ life
doesn't get any better than that,'' says this man with cheeks like
dappled peaches. ``Unless you have room for strawberry shortcake
made with old-fashioned drop biscuits and red, sweet, juicy
June-bearing strawberries picked that morning.''

 &HT;    Seafood stands out but is hardly alone in the coastal city crazy
about freshness
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE_Like any happening town, this one's got its list of hot
restaurants. We went down the list. Then we begged our friends to
take us to the places that aren't on anyone's list, which is where
most people eat anyway. Here are some of the winners _ from family
fish houses to sublime sushi bars to early-morning breakfast
joints.
</P>
<P>
   -- THE ATHENIAN INN. This is one of those quintessential
greasy-spoon diners that apparently hasn't changed much since Greek
immigrant Papa Papadakis founded the place in 1909 in the heart of
Pike Place Market. Beginning at 6:30 a.m., longshoremen and folks
staring at the wrong side of morning plop down on the red Naugahyde
stools to load up on hangtown scrambles (fried oysters and eggs),
five-egg omelettes and other cholesterol-laden anachronisms. If
you've partied too much _ or just want to get up at the crack of
dawn and contemplate the harbor _ this is the spot. It's been a
long time since we even thought about corned beef hash and poached
eggs. But after eating precious food at all those hot-list
restaurants, it was mighty tasty. Get some crusty hash browns, skip
the bad coffee and, if you need it, have a Bloody Mary. Remember
``Sleepless in Seattle''? We don't, either. But portions of it were
shot here _ and there are photos on the front windows to prove it.
Oh, yeah, that's Papa's picture over the bar. Pike Place Market,
main floor arcade. 206-624-7166.
</P>
<P>
   -- BLOWFISH. So why can't we have places like this in Atlanta?
This reasonably priced pan-Asian hangout has tasty food _ and it's
cute as a button, too. In a dining room where origami birds swoop
down from the ceiling, the Little Mermaid's friends frolick on
mosaic tiles behind an open-air cook space. And thanks to those
Japanese pachinko machines, the bar's got visual pop and a sense of
fun (the state won't allow you to gamble, but the game machines
provide a lot of noise and atmosphere). About the food: Most plates
are meant to be shared like tapas. Some good choices were the
hichimi squid with sesame aioli, skewers of prawns with shiitake
mushrooms and a plate of ultra-tender grilled asparagus. Especially
intriguing, and a meal in itself, was the fried rice with shrimp
and that weirdly sweet Chinese sausage. If you need to chill, get a
lemongrass lime rickey. A beautiful thing in a tall frosty glass,
it's made from vodka infused with lemongrass and kaffir lime
leaves. 722 Pine St., at the Paramount Hotel. 206-467-7777.
</P>
<P>
   -- CHINOOK'S AT SALMON BAY. When you want to get out of the
downtown grind and chow down on some honest local food, go to
Chinook's. (A Chinook, by the way, is a noble thing, being both the
name of a Native American tribe and the largest species of Pacific
salmon.) Go for a crab Louie or a chunk of salmon roasted on an
alder plank. A purely Northwestern thing, the alder wood imparts a
mild zing to the oily pink fish (you can also get halibut cooked
the same way). The Louie is an iceberg salad that still hits the
spot after all these years; you can add shrimp, but since you are
in Seattle, stick to the Dungeness crab. For dessert, the piece de
resistance is the wild mountain blackberry cobbler with vanilla ice
cream. These are not commercial berries _ but wild thangs from the
Cascade Mountains. Omigod. Our waitress told us that since her mom
was headed to town, and since this was their all-time favorite
dessert, they would surely end up here. This is an old-fashioned
fish house with a relaxing family ambience; and it's fun to watch
the boats ease in and out of historic Fishermen's Terminal. 1900 W.
Nickerson St. 206-283-4665.
</P>
<P>
   -- ETTA'S SEAFOOD. Chef Tom Douglas is the culinary star of the
Pacific Northwest, and you can count on a good meal at any of his
three restaurants (Dahlia Lounge and Palace Kitchen being the other
two). A friend told me about coming to Etta's and staying all day,
sampling the entire menu. The emphasis is on fresh seafood, of
course, and Asian and Latin flavors are tossed in with a creative
hand. We had a midafternoon snack of pristine oysters _ Malpeques,
Penn Coves, Snow Creek Triploids, Elfin Coves and Salutation Coves
_ and a bracing glass of white wine. Stopping in again one night,
we peeled our way through a platter of delicious sea-salty prawns
fired with red chilis. And the waitress was nice enough to let us
get a half order of peanut noodles tossed with pea vines and
ginger-barbecued pork. Which meant there was room for nectarine
cobbler and ice cream. The room is lovely and bright at midday; at
night, it takes on a romantic glow that makes it a perfect place to
take a date. 2020 Western Ave. 206-443-6000.
</P>
<P>
   -- EMMETT WATSON'S OYSTER BAR. Seattle's first oyster bar was
born back in the '70s, when newspaper columnist Watson went to New
Orleans and got the idea that what his town needed was a few oyster
dives. The place is so authentic that the prestigious James Beard
Foundation honored it last year for ``regional distinction.'' In
other words, it's a dump with really good food. The fish and chips
are killer, and the salmon soup is truly memorable. A broth like
melted garlic is poured over a slab of bread, along with chunks of
salmon and a dollop of sour cream. There's an inviting patio, a
laid-back staff, blue-check plastic tablecloths, menus on brown
paper bags and Emmett memorabilia (he still writes for The Seattle
Times and likes to call himself mayor of Lesser Seattle, as in:
``Tourists, go home!''). 1916 Pike Place, in the rear of the
Soames-Dunn Building. 206-448-7721.
</P>
<P>
   -- SHIRO'S. Shiro's is to Seattle what Soto is to Atlanta and
Nobu is to New York. Many people say it is not only the best
Japanese restaurant in town, but the best _ period. When we
wandered into the clean, well-lighted space, chef Shiro Kashiba was
visibly excited about the day's catch. ``Albacore,'' he said,
deboning the fish. Since he's the kind of chef you trust
absolutely, we asked him to send out the freshest bites. Three
courses later, there it was _ chunks of raw albacore in a
glistening ponzu sauce with grated daikon and slivered shiso leaf.
Sublime. Baked black cod was sweet and ever so slightly charred at
the edge. Just right. The tuna nigiri shimmered like rubies; the
yellow fin was luxurious. With nothing more than some cold sake,
these clean, simple tastes reminded us of how sensual pleasures
become memories. 2401 Second Ave. 206-443-9844.
</P>
<P>
   -- WILD GINGER. Walking around one night after a Wagner opera _
it must have been 1 a.m. _ we were grateful to find this highly
regarded pan-Asian room still cooking. We were smitten by the satay
bar, a big grill in the back of the room where you can sit and
watch the cook sling out skewers of lemongrass chicken, young
mountain lamb, fat, juicy scallops and big ol' prawns. But as
card-carrying noodle slurpers, we were underwhelmed by the fat,
overcooked strands in our shellfish saute. Never write a place off
over one misfire, but this trendsetter should realize there's
plenty of emerging competition in the sea. 1400 Western Ave.
206-623-4450.
</P>
<P>
   -- GOOD BITES: It's hard to say which is prettier at Lush Life,
the patio or the antipasto platter. But since we couldn't eat the
patio, we dug the golden beets, the cold mackerel, the olives,
cheeses, marinated red peppers and mushrooms. 2331 Second Ave.
206-441-9842. At Pike Place Market, check out Piroshky Piroshky for
pirogis like they make in the old country. If you get addicted,
they ship. 1908 Pike Place. 206-441-6068. In the Capitol Hill
neighborhood, there's authentic Guadalarajan cuisine _ and lots of
big plastic calla lilies _ at Galerias. We liked the tostaditas
with caviar. 210 Broadway East. 206-322-5757.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   -- Where to stay: One good way to find a room is by calling the
Seattle Hotel Hotline: 1-800-535-7071. One recommendation is the
WestCoast Vance, which is moderately priced and about a 10-minute
walk from downtown. The 1920s hotel has newly remodeled rooms that
are ideal for the solo or business traveler (that is, they tend to
be on the smaller side). $110-$130 per night. 620 Stewart St.
800-426-0670, 206-441-4200.
</P>
<P>
   -- Where to see the salmon jump: The Hiram M. Chittenden Locks
at the Lake Washington Ship Canal has a fish ``ladder'' where you
can watch salmon migrating from salt water to their native

 &HT;    Project Open Hand provides meals to AIDS patients _ men, women,
children
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_If it weren't for Project Open Hand, Ed Cross wouldn't
be living in Atlanta. He might not be living at all.
</P>
<P>
   Cross, 32, diagnosed as HIV-positive more than a decade ago,
moved to the metro area in 1994 after hearing about the innovative
food delivery program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went on disability, and I had no money left for food,'' says
Cross, who now lives in Chamblee with his partner, Paul N. Walker.
``In Florida, we had a food pantry, but not meals already prepared.
Here, we just have to warm up the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding _ it celebrated its 10th anniversary last
month _ Project Open Hand has served 6,000 men, women and children
more than 2.75 million free meals. The organization now has a $1.8
million operating budget, 20 staff members and more than 1,000
active volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Such was not always the case. In the late '80s, founder Michael
Edwards-Pruitt, 49, was delivering meals for AID Atlanta. The
organization managed to feed 14 people one meal five days a week.
The food was gathered from shelters and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't enough,'' Edwards-Pruitt says. ``I saw people in
desperate condition, people alone, dying of malnutrition. So I
decided to start a program to deliver two meals a day, seven days a
week, and cook the meals myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Project Open Hand was totally volunteer-run.
Stephen Woods, 42, was an early volunteer. ``I did everything here
at first _ shop, cook, pack, deliver,'' he says. ``I'd be at Cub
Foods at 6 a.m. and volunteers would be waiting for me when I got
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who himself has been living with HIV for a decade, made
himself so indispensable that when Open Hand received its first
grant in 1989, he was hired as the first paid staff member. He took
over as executive director in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, Project Open Hand has never missed a delivery in its
10-year history, although the aftermath of Hurricane Opal in 1995
proved a challenge _ meals were cooked on a single gas burner and
packaged by flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Woods oversaw the organization's most far-reaching
change, a shift from ready-to-eat hot food to a cold-food delivery
system. Freshly prepared meals are quickly chilled to below 40
degrees to prevent bacteria growth, then packaged into microwavable
containers for next-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 160 degrees, food continues to cook for six hours, so by
the time the client got it, the food had less nutritional value,''
Woods says. ``Delivering the meals cold not only preserves
nutrition, but it gives clients a choice when to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, volunteer nutritionists from Georgia State University and
Grady Memorial Hospital analyze the menus, planned on a 28-day
rotation to ensure variety and palatability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how nutritious the meal is if the client
doesn't eat it,'' says Development Director John Fritchie.
Everything is prepared from scratch. Favorite dishes include baked
ham with orange sauce and roasted sweet potatoes with lime and
coconut.
</P>
<P>
   To deliver two meals a day dependably (Saturday's delivery
includes Sunday's meals), Project Open Hand has become a model of
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, volunteers can be found preparing, packaging
and sorting meals at the organization's headquarters in Midtown. As
the lunch hour approaches, drivers arrive to pick up the meals and
begin their routes, mapped out so carefully that Fritchie says a
volunteer ``could fly into Atlanta without knowing the city'' and
not get lost.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the volunteers, who come from across metro Atlanta
and as far away as Rome and Athens, working at Project Open Hand
has become a highlight of their week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts the weekend off right,'' says Michelle Yablin, 38,
of Roswell, who's been packing food at the facility for nearly five
years. ``I started coming because I had a lot of AIDS deaths among
my friends,'' she says. ``Working here truly makes me feel good,
and everyone here is warm and welcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie Wasil, 40, has been driving in from Lithonia weekly for
more than a year, partly because she enjoys the camaraderie of the
food assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to seeing the regulars every Saturday,'' she
says. ``I know I'm doing something good.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Open Hand primarily serves people inside the Perimeter,
unable for logistical reasons to reach outside I-285.
</P>
<P>
   But the need is great and Woods is hopeful his organization can
work with other groups outside its target zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to partner with local schools and religious
institutions to establish satellite drop-off sites where they would
deliver to clients,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One satellite distribution route has already been started in
Gwinnett County, run by AID Gwinnett, and another in Cobb County at
St. Ann Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The need for expansion is urgent, says Woods. ``There is much
more AIDS in outlying communities now.''
</P>

NFL COULD USE MORE FANTASY, LESS OF REAL THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING TO RESTORE FIRST LINE OF LEDE)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
UNDATED - If the NFL ever wanted to retreat
<TEXT>
<P>
   into a fantasy world, this would be a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The No Fun League was especially so Sunday. In Phoenix, where
our TV games are chosen by sadistic network weasels, we were
treated to the Dolphins-Jets punt-a-thon and the ultimate atomic
stink bomb: Philadelphia at Denver.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying the Eagles gave up in the second half. They gave
up in the first half. At one point, the Philadelphia secondary was
actually playing hacky sack.
</P>
<P>
   But in all fairness, I noted that the Eagles were careful never
to actually touch the hem of Terrell Davis' garment.
</P>
<P>
   Other rotten match-ups: Giants-Bucs, Chargers-Colts and, of
course, Seahawks-Chiefs, which was halted for 54 minutes because of
heavy rain and lightning _ the only fireworks during a dismal NFL
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   For the average fan, this turn of events might lead to dire
consequences _ yardwork, baby-sitting or, horror of horrors, a
Sunday afternoon cooking show.
</P>
<P>
   While braising pork chops might seem more appealing than
watching Danny Kanell impersonate an NFL quarterback, this isn't a
problem for fantasy leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some might argue that fantasy leagues are saving the
NFL from itself.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the league. Five weeks into the season, there are three
winless teams (Washington, Carolina and Philadelphia) and seven
teams with one victory. Other teams with slightly better records
(Arizona, New Orleans and Atlanta) just don't have the legs to
last.
</P>
<P>
   Quick quiz. The Dallas Cowboys' next three opponents have how
many wins among them? Answer: one.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, two of them are actually tied with Bye Week.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the bad football, fantasy owners always have a
reason to watch the games.
</P>
<P>
   Without fantasy football, the Eagles-Broncos might have seemed a
little, ah, dull. Don't tell that to the guy who started John Elway
at quarterback, only to watch Bubby Brister get the privilege of
whacking out the Eagles. (By the way, it's really hard to pry a
shoe out of a big-screen TV.)
</P>
<P>
   This game featured a slew of fantasy favorites besides Elway.
With Denver, you had Davis, wide receivers Rod Smith and Ed
McCaffrey and tight end Shannon Sharpe. As for the Eagles, some
poor souls were rooting for receiver Irving Fryar and running backs
Duce Staley and Charlie Garner.
</P>
<P>
   News that the Falcons were blowing out the Panthers was fine
with fantasy owners who started Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler,
running back Jamal Anderson or receiver Tony Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Purists argue that fantasy leaguers don't watch the games for
the right reasons, that we should be more interested in wins and
losses than statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this weekend, the winless Eagles play the winless
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The purists can have my ticket. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the performance of Panthers quarterback Kerry
Collins against Atlanta. He ran up his numbers after Carolina was
behind, 38-3, and this week he benched himself in favor of backup
Steve Beuerlein. I think Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart
will have a bounce-back game against Cincinnati. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for Miami rookie John Avery to find his way into the
lineup. Coach Jimmy Johnson never has been enamored with starter
Karim Abdul-Jabbar. In Kansas City, Rashaan Shehee looked good in
relief of Donnell Bennett on Sunday, but Bennett should be back
this week despite a bruised hand. Don't expect Cowboys running back
Chris Warren to score two touchdowns every week, but he will get
significant time spelling Emmitt Smith. Running back Gary Brown
appears to have the starting job for the Giants, such as it is. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week it's Detroit receiver Johnnie Morton, who had two
catches for 138 yards and one touchdown. Morton is good, but he's
not going to catch too many more 98-yard bombs. &QL;

 &HT;    CLINTON CHALLENGES CONGRESS TO HIKE SCHOOL FUNDS
 &HT;    600&AMP;adds.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drawing a line in the sand in his budget battle
with an outgoing Congress, President Clinton warned Friday that
lawmakers ''should not go home'' until they increase spending on
classroom initiatives by about $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said the money is needed to renovate schools, hire thousands
of new teachers and help children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans countered that Clinton was picking a fight
over education, the last smoldering pillar of what one called a
''failed agenda,'' as a smoke screen to deflect public attention
from his troubles over Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The public wrangling took place on a day when Clinton signed a
continuing resolution to avert a government shutdown by funding
federal operations through Monday night, to give White House and
congressional negotiators time to hammer out agreement on dozens of
outstanding spending issues.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting from budgeting to politicking, Clinton fired an
election-year broadside at the Republican-led Congress, chastising
legislators for failing to pass White House-backed bills aimed at
campaign finance reform, curbing cigarette sales to youths, raising
the minimum wage and providing low-income Americans with new
health-care guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ''But still, it is not too late for us to go forward together on
our children's future,'' Clinton said in a brief statement on the
South Lawn. ''Politics,'' he said, ''should stop at the classroom
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stopped short of threatening to veto legislation that
didn't fully fund his education proposals. But his top economic
adviser, Gene Sperling, said earlier, ''We would not sign, or would
veto, a budget that was weak on education. If it does not go a long
way toward meeting the president's priorities, the president will
not sign this budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has requested $17.7 billion in spending on education and
training programs for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The requests include $1 billion for building new classrooms and
another $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers, in an effort to
reduce class size to an average of 18 pupils per classroom for
grades kindergarten through three.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also requested $4.6 billion for Head Start and $7.8
billion for Title I, two programs aimed at improving the
educational prospects for children from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the bill passed late Thursday night by the House comes
up $4 billion short of White House funding proposals, said
Sperling.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with funding is that the White House had
originally counted on revenues generated by an increase in
cigarette taxes to pay for increasing the number of classrooms and
teachers in public schools. The prospect of receiving those
revenues collapsed earlier this year, however, with the defeat of
comprehensive tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's top domestic policy advisor, Bruce Reed, said there
was nevertheless no reason to also kill the prospects for reducing
class sizes, which can top 28 students per class in many elementary
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still need smaller classes,'' said Reed. ''We'd like this
Congress to get some work done. They killed the tobacco bill. They
killed campaign finance reform. They killed the patients' bill of
rights. We're not going to let them kill education.''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans retorted that Clinton was playing politics with
schoolrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did not make one call to any Republican congressional
leader to discuss improving education'' all year long,' said Rep.
John Boehner, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president's attacks on our agenda are simply the politics
of deflection and avoidance: deflecting attention away from his
failed agenda, and avoiding the subjects of grand juries, perjury,
abuse of power and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans said they had worked hard to pass an education
budget that addressed many of the priorities Clinton outlined, as
well as others he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans have passed 22 major education initiatives,''
House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Bill Goodling said
in a prepared statement. ''The president's bills didn't pass
because they don't focus on quality and they don't drive dollars
directly to the classroom. Instead, they create top-down federal
education programs run by Washington bureaucrats.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The threat of a showdown over education comes against a backdrop
of furiously paced negotiations over a host of budget areas,
ranging from Clinton's proposal for $18 billion in additional
funding for the International Monetary Fund to his request for more
than $1 billion to pay U.S. arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 appropriations bills that provide a road map for how
the government will spend $1.7 trillion next year, only four had
been sent to the White House for Clinton's consideration as of late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, Clinton has signed into law two, which pay for water
and energy and military construction. He has vetoed one, an
agriculture bill Clinton claimed came up short in funding for
emergency farm aid, and has not yet acted on the other, the giant
defense appropriations bill.

AMERICANS NUMBED BY CLINTON CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Three weeks after Seattle radio station KJR-FM
declared itself Clinton free, the ``swear jar'' that benefits a
children's charity has maybe $200 in it.
</P>
<P>
   At $10 a pop, that means callers have mentioned the president's
name on air no more than 20 times in as many days. The station's
disc jockeys and newscasters haven't had to pay up once.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not indifference that has engulfed KJR's employees and
audience, said program director Gary Bryan. It's exhaustion. Like
much of America, he said, they simply can't stand to hear any more
partisan haggling over whether to impeach President Clinton.
They're both bored and embarrassed by the process, rather than
riveted by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming like the O.J. Simpson case: What more is there
to say?'' said Bryan, whose station's '70s music format attracts
largely female listeners ages 30 to 50, a key constituency of
Clinton's. ``We're just picking this thing over in minute detail
and watching it devolve into a political food fight...It's just not
entertainment anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with dozens of people from around the country found
many no longer amused by the daily doings in Washington D.C., or
even interested in them. The sex scandal is no must-see soap opera,
several noted, since there are villains but no heroes, developments
but no real drama, a congressional investigation but no
cliffhanger. Few, after all, said they expect Congress to impeach
the president for lying during a deposition in a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel apathetic, I feel disgusted,'' said Noreen
McCracken, a Venice, Calif., hairdresser. ``I try to keep up with
it to a point, but then I get so angry I don't pay as much
attention as maybe I should...There's no chance he'll be impeached
anyway, but, hey, the Republicans have a majority so we'll have to
wait until the elections to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Neal, an executive secretary in Atlanta, is happy there is
a GOP majority, and would like to see Clinton impeached, too.
Still, she conceded she hasn't been watching Washington with glee
-- or even at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a Republican president, I'd probably pay more
attention,'' she said. ``I'd feel like I had a more vested
interest. But I didn't vote for the guy and I say let's get rid of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   This blend of anger and inattention is driven, for some, by a
sense that the major steps in the scandal have been hugely
overhyped. To Chris Kelly, head writer for the TV show
``Politically Incorrect,'' each of this month's climactic events _
from the release of the Starr report to Thursday's vote to begin
impeachment proceedings _ comes to seem like another installment in
the ``Friday the 13th'' horror movie series, where the killer
appears to die only to return again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always say, ``This time, Jason's really going to get
his,' `` said Kelly, whose Los Angeles-based show has been making
an effort to open on other topics but inevitably wends its way to
Clinton. ``After awhile, it gets hard to get people in the
theaters...A great story needs change, and with this one the
suspense level is very low.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, suspenseful or not, the seriousness of the charges
against Clinton -- and the fact that he is the third president in
US history to face impeachment proceedings -- demands America's
attention, several of those interviewed said. New York photographer
Gwendolen Cates said she watches and listens and reads about each
development because she should, although she'd rather not. She also
said that she finds the entire process demeaning and demoralizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of feel like it's my responsibility to know what's
going on, but it's also discouraging. . .,'' said Cates, a
self-described liberal Democrat who does not want to see Clinton
punished further. ``Congress supposedly represents the people, but
it seems like they have absolutely no concern for what the people
want, if you look at the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, poll after poll has shown that support for Clinton
remains high while his impeachment is a low priority for most
voters. Pollsters and voters alike say those numbers reflect the
economy's continuing strength despite turmoil in the financial
markets and, particularly among women, a belief that White House
policies have benefitted them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, their lack of vocal outrage over Thursday's
congressional vote to hold impeachment hearings may have indirectly
empowered Congress to ignore the will of the people, many voters
conceded. Several added that they believe the latest vote, largely
along partisan lines, was based purely on politics. After the
November elections, they expect the issue to be dropped quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised it got this far. I thought Congress would have
gotten the message by now...,'' said Dan Dimendberg, co-president
of the Ridgefield High School Young Democrats in Ridgefield, Conn.
``There's no real chance he'll be impeached, though that doesn't
make it less interesting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cindy Wunsch, who manages country music singers in
Nashville, ``I was paying attention at the height of it, but I'm
completely apathetic now. It's almost pointless to talk about it
anymore. It seems absurd. He's not going to get impeached, so why
bother?''
</P>
<P>
   Wunsch compared the current situation to the season of
``Dallas'' that ended with Bobby Ewing waking up and declaring it
all a dream. As she noted with a laugh, ``That took up a whole lot
of time and energy for nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another turnoff has been what many voters consider manufactured
outrage among congressmen. As Larry Doyle, who writes for ``The
Simpsons'' TV show noted, Democrats would be calling for
impeachment if the president was a Republican while Republicans
would be demanding an end to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at it and say no one has any moral authority,''
Doyle said. ``Their opinions are meaningless, and I'd bet a lot of
people feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Coral Quiet, who practices medicine in Phoenix, went so far
as to say she actively tries to ignore updates from Washington
because she considers Clinton's personal life irrelevant to his
professional one. She also said the current situation bears no
resemblance to Watergate, when solemnity surrounded Richard Nixon's
impeachment hearings and Congress rose to the occasion with an
almost unprecedented level of bi-partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reflection of our current political environment that
they'll only be going ahead with (the hearings) after the next
round of elections,'' said Quiet. ``I think it's cowardly and it
assumes the American people are a bunch of morons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Buchanan, a contract administrator for a San Francisco
area construction company, said the point is that Clinton lied to
the court in a civil case and then again to the American people. He
also said that he expects more citizens to keep closer tabs on the
case -- and clamor for impeachment -- if the US stock market
continues its downward slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that I think it's a business decision, but I do
believe that a lot of people are just inherently selfish and they
have been willing to overlook a whole lot of things in a good
economy,'' said Buchanan, who chose not to vote for any
presidential candidate in the last national election. ``When they
get disappointed, they'll get pissed and there just happens to be a
fairly easy vehicle right before their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Allan Landau, a Chicago-based photographer who doesn't
follow politics regularly, said he will take notice once the actual
hearings are under way. For now, however, he said the case is not
holding his attention because it lacks tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the impeachment part will get people's attention again,''
said Landau, a native of Canada who has lived in the United States
since 1977. ``No one thinks he will be impeached. But no one really
thought we'd be where we are now two weeks ago. So they'll probably
watch.''

He seemed to come out of nowhere, firing an M-1 rifle on a busy

he was a law student, and killing two men he had never met. Since
then, from his room in a state psychiatric ward, Williamson sued a
psychiatrist who had seen him just half a dozen times eight months

HOLDOUT   WOES TRIM BRUINS' SEASON HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Step 2 in the Bruins' long crawl back to respectability
begins Saturday night with the start of their 1998-99 season. After
going bust the year before, when it finished dead last in the
Original 26, the once-proud franchise found its way back to the
dinner table last year, qualifying for the playoffs and even
winning two postseason games against the Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   What's in store for '98-99?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll be a great team,'' said resident realist
Pat Burns, ready to take his charges into his second season as the
Makeover King on Causeway Street. ``We'll be a good team. You'll
have to work hard to beat the Bruins.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that the Bruins will start the season, and
perhaps go well into the 82-game schedule, minus holdouts Kyle
McLaren and Anson Carter. Part of the reason this is not a great
team is that the Bruins, like many NHL clubs, have been hit with
their share of the payroll blues. The defense will have to go
forward without McLaren, one of its key components the past three
years. The front line will have to move ahead without Carter, whom
the Bruins acquired in hopes that he would develop into an impact
player. His impact right now is the void he leaves at left wing.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition of the Bruins that will be unveiled this evening
against the St. Louis Blues will be much like last season's club.
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; They'll be honest at both ends of the ice and prone to
clogging up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Ray Bourque, their old man in the ``C,'' will be back on the
blue line, beginning his 20th season as the anchor of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Jason Allison and Sergei Samsonov, the 1997-98 rookie of the
year, will team up on their top line, most likely starting with
newcomer Antti Laaksonen.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Bryon Dafoe will be the No. 1 netminder, looking to build on
his impressive 30-25-9 season and erase the memory of the long
Brian Bellows softy that beat him to end the playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   When Bruins fans first come to Causeway Street, the most
noticeable difference will be the absence of the old Garden. The
proud old barn was in its initial stages of demolition when the
Bruins' '97-98 season ended. It since has been swept away, every
last seat, girder, and gummy linoleum tile, and the sterile,
behemoth FleetCenter finally has been revealed for all the sporting
world to see. A large field of asphalt, what amounts to a parking
lot, sits hauntingly vacant where the Garden once stood.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Vault, Bruins fans will see a few wrinkles here at
the dawn of a new season.
</P>
<P>
   To wit:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; There has been a European enhancement of the Boston lineup.
Laaksonen, via the University of Denver, hails from Tammela,
Finland. Another new forward, Peter Nordstrom, was born in
Munkfors, Sweden, and played the last three seasons in his
country's Elite League. They join Samsonov, Dmitri Khristich, and
P.J. Axelsson in the club's United Nations division. The Bruins
arrived late in the race to acquire international talent. By the
time they jumped into the Russian market, making the long-forgotten
Dmitri Kvartalnov their top pick in the '92 draft, the best of
Mother Russia's skating sons already had been acquired by other NHL
clubs (Example: Sergei Fedorov got grabbed at No. 74 by Detroit in
'89 and was in the October 1990 Red Wings lineup).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Don Cherry is in the house. The flamboyant and at times
bombastic former Bruins coach will participate in pregame
festivities, handing Burns the Jack Adams (coach of the year)
Award. Grapes and Boston boss Harry Sinden parted as, shall we say,
less than amiable partners in the spring of '79. Much has happened
in the years since. The Berlin Wall is gone. The WHA is gone.
Cherry even once has complimented a European player during his
wildly successful Canadian TV gigs (the ``I Love All Things
Canadian And Nothing Esle Hour''). Grapes is older now. Look for
the white-haired guy dressed in a shirt that has a starched 8-inch
collar with a giant red maple leaf on his back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Bobby Orr is in the house. The great No. 4, joined by former
teammate/broadcaster Derek Sanderson and Bourque, will present
Samsonov with the Calder (rookie of the year) Trophy in the pregame
show. Four Calders in the same cauldron _ Orr in '67, Sanderson in
'68, Bourque in '80, Samsonov in '98. The joint still jumps when
Orr comes walking down the runway. Samsonov was born in October
1978, when Orr was about to begin his fourth year of retirement. If
that makes you feel old, bunky, cheer up, because sideburns are
back and you'll be able to pull on those psychedelic bellbottoms
again any day now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Speaking of follicle fashion, Burns has a far more
conservative haircut this year. The long locks are gone. He looks
even more like the cop walking the beat now. If he trims an equal
amount every year, he'll look like Kojak by the time he enters year
No. 4 of his deal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; The ice surface holds a couple of significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1: The ``wings'' have been clipped off the blue-tinged
crease area in front of the net, allowing attacking players to move
closer to the cage. Had the wings been clipped last year, Tim
Taylor's controversial goal against Washington would not have been
wiped from the scoreboard. Who knows what would have happened after
that? And if there hadn't been too many men on the ice in Montreal
...
</P>
<P>
   No. 2: The net has been moved an extra couple of feet away from
the end boards. The Lords of the Boards did this in hopes of
opening up the game, allowing more playmaking. If Cam Neely were
still playing (and who says he won't someday?), this change would
allow Claude Lemieux less of a chance to play hide 'n' turtle. That
alone might take Neely's rehab up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; And for the first time in nine-plus seasons, the Blues will
come to town without Brett Hull. The Golden Brett ran off to Dallas
in the offseason, signing on with the Stars for a three-year deal
worth some $17 million. In his best days, Hull was the league's No.
1 sniper. In his worst days, he was still a frightening factor in
the St. Louis offense, even with that ``One Way'' sign stapled to
his helmet.

THREE YET TO RETURN FROM TRIP TO FLORIDA

   ATTLEBORO, Mass. _ As family members set up a web page and
posted a reward for three missing Attleboro men, police in Orlando,
Fla, where they were last seen nearly two weeks ago were turning up
scant clues in the mysterious disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting and watching,'' said Catherine Ryder, sister of
Scott Renquin, one of the missing men, who had gone to Renquin's
time-share condominium in Orlando for vacation and disappeared in
that city Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a licensed pilot and a certified SCUBA diver so we never
worried about him going off on side trips,'' said Ryder. ``This is
highly unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Orlando Police have reached what is very nearly a
dead end in their search for 35-year-old Renquin and his friends
Daniel Nelson, 32, and Roger DesVergnes, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Det. Barbara Bergin, lead investigator for the Orlando Police
Department, said police aren't ruling out anything, but there is no
evidence of foul play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no evidence of anything whatsoever, except that they
didn't go home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people orchestrate their own disappearances, but we
don't think that's the case,'' said Bergin. ``These men had
families and responsibilities to return to and we have no reason to
think that wasn't what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryder said the web page was set up by her husband and a friend.
The DesVergnes family has posted a reward of up to $5,000 in the
case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The men were expected home Oct. 2 and when relatives contacted
police, investigators went to the time share condo and found a
refrigerator stocked with food and beverages worth about $200 and
$500 in cash in a floor safe. Toothbrushes and razors, were all in
place.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is still unaccounted for, however, is their
rented GMC Jimmy with four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Bergin said that the three men came to Orlando to hang out, play
some pool and relax. They wanted to get outdoors, Bergin said. They
told Renquin's childhood friend, Kevin Kennedy, who lived in nearby
Longwood, that they might do some fishing and barbecuing.
</P>
<P>
   That was Sept. 28. Kennedy made plans to meet them at a downtown
nightclub complex two days later, but they didn't show. Staff at
Orlando's Sunshine Resort, where Renquin shared ownership of unit
105, saw them the afternoon of Sept. 28, but not after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking they may have gone four-wheeling in the truck
they rented and somehow driven into a swamp or a lake,''
DesVergnes' cousin David DesVergnes said Friday. ``We got a call
from a woman today who said she remembered a similar missing person
case where a person accidentally drove into a hidden lake and the
body wasn't found until the lake was dredged.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the men were reported missing, police have searched the
woody, rural areas around Orlando but have turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also have kept the names and photographs of the
three men on television and in the local paper for more than 48
hours. If any of the men had used a driver's license or credit card
to rent a boat, airplane or dirt bike, police would know it by now,
Bergin said.
</P>
<P>
   DesVergnes, who works at DesVergnes Construction Company in
Attleboro, has three children. Renquin has owned Renquin Unlimited
Auto Body Shop in Attleboro for the past five years. Nelson is the
father of a 5-year-old boy who he left with relatives while he went
on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a home on Lindsey Street, David DesVergnes said his
cousin, Roger, loves the outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several family members live on this street.'' DesVergnes said.
``We have a lot of land here and he would take his hovercraft-type
vehicle out on the pond in the backyard. He loved outdoor sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ryder, who is from Windham, Maine but is staying with
her parents in Attleboro during the search, said her brother is
``rough on the outside but he has the biggest heart of anyone. He
would give you the shirt off his back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One good thing to come out of this is the stream of people who
have called to to say how he touched their lives,'' she said.

GOP BEGINS PLANNING IMPEACHMENT STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day after an historic vote to launch an
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, some GOP members were
suggesting that the hearings would focus mostly on whether Clinton
was engaged in a coverup, rather than his sexual relationship with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee met privately
Friday to begin developing their strategy for hearings to be held
after the Nov. 3 elections. While no decisions were made Friday
about how to proceed, there were signals that the
Republican-controlled committee is trying to avoid details on the
physical nature of the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely a no-brainer that they will focus on
obstruction of justice as opposed to a lying about sex,'' said
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican. Shays
said the committee might try to broaden its scope by examining
whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice on an array of issues,
including campaign finance and the use of FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is clearly where they are going,'' former federal
prosecutor Joseph diGenova said about focusing on the alleged
coverup. ``It makes a lot of sense. The coverup stuff is easier to
understand, and it gets away from the unseemly and distasteful
aspects of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of that strategy, Republicans would like Clinton to
``stipulate'' that he does not dispute some key facts in the case.
This would allow the committee to narrow its focus considerably,
looking only at areas in which Clinton disputes the report by
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether Clinton wants to stipulate to
any facts in the case. While Clinton has admitted having a
relationship with Lewinsky that was ``not appropriate,'' he denies
committing perjury when he claimed he had no sexual relations with
her. There has been speculation that Republicans want the president
to agree that he had a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, which
would enable the GOP to avoid interrogating Lewinsky about the kind
of sex she had with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans cringe at the thought that they would have to
ask Lewinsky about such matters in a nationally televised hearing.
Indeed, Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde, an Illinois
Republican, has played down the possibility of subpoenaing Lewinsky
and said Friday he won't ask Clinton to testify. The president
hasn't ruled out voluntarily testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some GOP members prefer that the impeachment proceeding
focus on whether Clinton and Lewinsky conspired to cover up their
relationship. The clearest sign of this strategy came, according to
diGenova, when the committee's Republican counsel, David P.
Schippers, announced his list of 15 possible impeachable offenses
and added the allegation that Clinton and Lewinsky conspired in
what amounts to a coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on an alleged coverup also would help Republicans draw
parallels with the Watergate case in 1974, in which former
President Nixon was forced from office largely because of a
coverup.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about whether Republicans will find it
worthwhile to pursue allegations that Clinton committed perjury.
Democrats in the last several days have said that any attempt to
impeach Clinton for perjury would prompt them to focus on the fact
that House Speaker Newt Gingrich was allowed to remain in office
after he was reprimanded for &UR;  &LR; making false statements to the House
ethics committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gingrich case, the ethics committee found that the
speaker misused a tax-exempt organization for political purposes,
namely to build a Republican majority in Congress. The committee
also found that Gingrich made false statements about the tax-exempt
work to the committee. Gingrich wound up being reprimanded by a
395-28 vote in the House and required to pay a $300,000 fine, but
he was allowed to remain in office.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat and the
only other sitting House member to be reprimanded for false
statements, said in an interview Friday it would make no sense to
impeach Clinton for lying, because he and Gingrich were accused of
a similar violation and allowed to remain as House members. Frank
was reprimanded in 1990 for writing a misleading memo in an attempt
to end a male prostitute's probation and using his House privileges
to waive parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Frank, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said the
comparison between the Gingrich and Clinton cases was valid.
``Although Gingrich wasn't under oath, it was still a lie to a an
official body,'' Frank said, referring to the ethics committee.
``It is a crime of making false statement to government
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans prefer to point to parallels in another case,
the ouster of Senator Bob Packwood, an Oregon Republican. The
Senate ethics committee voted unanimously to expel Packwood on
Sept. 7, 1995, prompting him to resign the following day before the
full Senate took a vote. The committee charged Packwood with sexual
misconduct, misuse of office and obstructing the committee's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The committee sent its recommendation of expulsion to the Senate
after determining that Packwood in his own version of a coverup,
altered diaries that contained information about his relationships
with various women.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who served on the
ethics committee, said his vote to expel a fellow GOP senator shows
that House and Senate members take such responsibilities seriously
and won't make a partisan vote on Clinton. As for the parallel
between the Packwood and Clinton cases, Smith said, ``Yes,
(Packwood) did make an attempt to keep certain diary entries from
us that would have been incriminating to him. So in terms of
obstruction, there is a parallel.''

JEB BUSH AHEAD IN FLORIDA, WHERE VOTERS YEARN FOR NEW LEADERSHIP

<P>
   MIAMI _ With polls showing the Republican Jeb Bush still a
commanding front-runner in the election for Florida governor, the
underdog Democratic candidate, Lt. Gov. Kenneth MacKay, wasted no
time on niceties this week in the first of three scheduled debates.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay opened his remarks by attacking Bush for failed business
deals, as well as for supporting school vouchers and for opposing
gun control and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But in this unusually lackluster race in what is ordinarily a
competitive two-party state, yearnings for new leadership for a new
millennium seem to be figuring more prominently as a deciding
factor among voters than any particular issue, or candidate's
liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel in general that it's time for a change,'' said Jay
Malina, chairman of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce and one
of the candidates' questioners in a televised debate Thursday in
Orlando that had audience participation from three other Florida
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll by Florida Voter, a nonpartisan polling
organization in Fort Lauderdale, shows Bush leading by 17
percentage points, 55 percent to MacKay's 38 percent, with only 7
percent of respondents undecided. The same September poll found
that only 31 percent of Floridians said they were interested in the
race, a sign that most voters have not tuned in, just weeks before
they are due at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the numbers attest to Bush's success in
reinventing himself over the last four years after losing to the
Democratic governor, Lawton Chiles, by only 64,000 votes out of
more than 4 million cast in 1994. A Miami businessman and son of
former President George Bush, he has campaigned relentlessly in
Democratic strongholds he once ignored, toned down conservative
talk and stayed away from divisive issues to broaden his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, 45, is also younger and more photogenic than the
65-year-old MacKay, an advantage he seemed to exploit during the
debate Thursday by punctuating his answers with smiles and saying
in closing remarks that he offered ``the passion and the energy to
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, in turn, portrayed the election as ``a choice between a
person who has a proven record and experienced leadership in the
state, and a person who is very articulate but who's untried.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University
of South Florida in Tampa, said: ``It's Florida's version of the
Dole-Clinton race. It's the same chemistry. The young and the old,
and the perception of vigor and youth and a new vision.''
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, a well-liked former state legislator and congressman who
has served as Chiles' lieutenant governor since 1990, is also
dogged by what most accounts have seen as a disorganized campaign
and by the troubles of a Democratic Party that antagonized its
black constituents when Democratic state representatives kept a
black legislator from becoming their leader.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay has not been able to galvanize registered Democrats in a
state where they dominate Republicans 45 percent to 40 percent, or
even win over those who agree with his position on issues like
abortion. The Florida Voter poll found that among voters who
support abortion rights, as MacKay does, he leads over Bush by only
one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   During an hourlong debate in which all the questions came from
studio audiences and covered a wide variety of subjects, MacKay
tried to focus on Bush's negatives, like his share of campaign
money from oil, tobacco and gambling interests _ ``What were these
people promised in exchange for that money?'' he repeatedly asked _
and on the differences between the two candidates in a campaign
with no overriding electoral issue except perhaps the poor
performance of the state's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supports school vouchers that would allow parents access to
private schools as an incentive for overall school improvement, but
MacKay opposes the vouchers because he says public schools would
end up stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mention of the White House scandal.
</P>
<P>
   During a lively exchange, MacKay handed Bush a copy of a school
prayer bill vetoed by Chiles, pressing him to take a stand on the
issue. ( Bush did not.) The front-runner Bush mostly ignored the
attacks, repeatedly saying that ``we can do better'' without
offering many specifics, and defending himself against the
accusation that he would be beholden to special-interest money by
saying that ``my principles are rock solid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has been more mean to me than Buddy MacKay was,''
Bush later told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, while Bush campaigned in Jacksonville, MacKay swept
through Palm Beach County, a liberal Democratic stronghold, with
the governor in tow. He found a receptive crowd at the Century
Village West retirement community in Boca Raton, where Democrats
promised to turn out the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very hopeful,'' said Isabella Fink, 81, a vice president
of the local Democratic club. ``We're going to push it up. I
believe we'll make it. He's a good, qualified person. He's not
trading on his father's name. The truth is, this man knows the
business of government and that's important.''
</P>
<P>
   At least publicly, MacKay remains optimistic too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a pile of undecided voters, a whole bunch of
people who are just beginning to focus on this race,'' he said
after the debate. ``I think you're going to see the polls closing,
I really do. I think we can win this race.''

VICTIM OF CHERNOBYL BACK IN THE US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In late September, as autumn was turning to winter in
north central Europe, Alexei Anatolevich Saponchikov, a victim of
the Chernobyl nuclear fallout, returned to the orphanage for
disabled children in Belarus that had been his home for so long.
</P>
<P>
   When they heard his car approaching, the 130 children who live
at the orphanage rushed to the windows to welcome their friend back
from America. Some on crutches hobbled out to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Alexei, who is called ``Alosha'' and still
struggles with the juvenile arthritis and severely stunted growth
that plague him as a result of the radiation spread across Europe
by the Chernobyl explosion in the Ukraine in 1986, cried with
excitement to see his old friends.
</P>
<P>
   But his joy was mixed with pain over the realization that he
might, again, be back for good at the orphanage where he was taken
a dozen years ago after his mother abandoned him when he was 11
months old. After 15 months in the United States, Alosha's
immigration papers had expired.
</P>
<P>
   The boy _ who weighs about 40 pounds and stands just 38 inches
tall _ held firmly to the hand of Daniel Joyce, the man who had
become his surrogate father and accompanied him to Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce made the bittersweet journey with Alosha not only because
he loves him, but to see Belarus and US officials about remedying
insufficient documentation to allow Alosha to stay in the states
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was certain when we started out,'' Joyce said this
week about their trip to Belarus. ``Alosha knew we were trying our
best to get him to come back, ``but that it was a chance and he
accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chernobyl Children Project in Hingham, Mass. paid for their
flight to Belarus. At first, Joyce and Alosha stayed with Alosha's
doctor in Gomel, about an hour's drive from the orphanage. Alosha
visited with his girlfriend, Lena, and with Max, a Chernobyl victim
with thyroid cancer, who had stayed with the Joyces with him. Then,
the orphanage director drove them to the only home Alosha had known
until last year.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 days, Joyce, 39, the director of systems support at
Fidelity Investments in Boston, stayed at the orphanage with
Alosha, sleeping on a couch and making two 16-hour overland
journeys to Minsk, the Belarus capital, to see Belarus and US
officials about Alosha's documentation.
</P>
<P>
   He returned with a six-month medical visa for Alosha to return
to this country and said that a more permanent arrangement will
take ``anywhere from two to three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Alosha's apprehension at returning to Belarus was not that the
people at the orphanage treated him badly. On the contrary, they
cared for him well, allowing him to come to Boston in the summer of
1997 for respite and medical treatment with 83 other Chernobyl
victims under a program sponsored by the Chernobyl Children
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the orphanage and the governments of Belarus and the
United States gave permission for Alosha to extend his stay for
medical treatment for his many orthopedic ailments related to his
arthritis, unavailable in Belarus. He also had dental surgery for
seriously rotted teeth.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 months, Alosha has been living just outside
Boston, at the Milton home of Dan and Janet Joyce and their three
sons, Dan, 15, Doug, 12, and Ryan, 8. There, he has experienced a
sense of family for the first time in his tragic life.
</P>
<P>
   With an impish smile almost as broad as he is, Alosha has stolen
the hearts of all who've met him. His ailments and severe joint
deformities have prevented him from growing beyond his 38-inch
frame.
</P>
<P>
   What was to have been a summer's stay in 1997 was extended after
the Joyces and doctors at The Floating Hospital for Children at New
England Medical Center, which gives free medical treatment to the
Chernobyl children, convinced the governments of Belarus and the
United States how vital such treatment was for Alosha.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, Belarus won
independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. It is still a
very poor country with medical supplies in short supply. Joyce was
stunned at what he saw at the orphanage, ``badly burned children,
some with birth defects, broken legs, epilepsy.''
</P>
<P>
   On his recent return there, Alosha was knocked down by children
rushing to a meal and the femur of his left leg was broken. ``They
don't have any facilities there,'' Joyce recalled this week. ``So,
we made a splint with sticks and clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Alosha is back in Milton now and waiting for the next chapter of
his life to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is in a cast and on crutches, he continues to go
on a bus to the Glover School, working at a fifth-grade level.
While he needed an intrepreter when he first arrived, he now speaks
English without a trace of a Russian accent, and has forgotten some
of his native language.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny as Alosha is, he horses around with the Joyce sons as if he
were 6 feet tall. Now, the brothers vie over who is going to carry
him around the house while he wears the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, in anticipation of Halloween, Alosha donned a
magician's top hat and hammed it up for a photographer. Around his
neck he wore a cross that the Joyces had given him. He will always
love them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the time he has been here, Alosha has had his first-ever
birthday party at 13, grew to love chicken, and sang Russian folk
songs at karaoke nights. He is an extrovert.
</P>
<P>
   Though his diminutive size first attracts, it is Alosha's blue
eyes that arrest. Even while he is trying to be a flippant
teenager, they harbor a deep melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   With his major physical problems, Alosha knows his medical
future is uncertain. His medications, alone, Joyce said, cost about
$235 a month. The Joyces are planning a fund-raiser on Nov. 14 to
help meet Alosha's needs.
</P>
<P>
   But, Alosha still flashes his dimpled smile that moves so many
to tears. The Delta Air Lines crew that flew him and Joyce free
from New York to Boston last week were among them.
</P>

IN BEIJING, A FILM EPIC WITH ITS OWN PLACE IN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As the crowd of mostly young Beijingers filed in from
the misty night off Tiananmen Square, it was obvious this was not
your everyday world film premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were cameras flashing, huge movie posters and a high
proportion of men with ponytails. But instead of a red carpet,
there were metal detectors and X-ray security machines. And weren't
those bouncers People's Liberation Army guards?
</P>
<P>
   In an incongruous mix of old and new, politics and
entertainment, China held its first Hollywood-style movie premiere
Thursday night. And it chose as its theater the epicenter of
Chinese politics, the vast auditorium of the Great Hall of the
People.
</P>
<P>
   In wooden seats with narrow desks, where Communist Party
delegates usually listen to speeches about Deng Xiaoping Theory, an
eclectic collection of film buffs, foreign movie stars,
entrepreneurs and government bureaucrats watched the world premiere
of the Chinese director Chen Kaige's new historical epic, about the
violent battles that led to the unification of China in 221 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   It was tantamount to having ``Saving Private Ryan'' first
screened on the floor of the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a night of incongruities, perhaps the greatest of all was
simply seeing Chen, whose films are often banned or cut in his
homeland, celebrate and be celebrated on the stage normally
occupied by the likes of President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The film's producers applied to rent the hall for the world
premiere after Chinese censors signed off on the film a few weeks
ago. And to everyone's surprise, they were told they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is beyond my imagination that one of my films could be
shown in the Great Hall of the People _ like a dream,'' Chen said.
``It's a change. Is it a reason for optimism? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the event was tame by Western standards _ stretch
limousines and Versace were out, Volkswagens and tight jeans were
in _ many in the crowd enjoyed the buzz. After the film a number
headed out to a late-night champagne reception at a trendy French
club called Maxim's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I've taken part in a premiere,'' Wang
Zhiwen, a popular young Chinese actor and one of the movie's male
leads, said as he drew on a cigarette under the club's low
stained-glass ceiling. ``It's the first time in Chinese cinematic
history that it has occurred. It's not bad. I think it's necessary,
and now that there's been a first, there's bound to be a second and
a third.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets were hard to get for the film, a big-budget sweeping
story about a king's increasingly ruthless attempts to fulfill his
vision of a unified nation and an assassin's attempt to thwart his
violent march. (King Qin lives to prevail over his enemies,
becoming China's first emperor.)
</P>
<P>
   It features some of China's biggest stars, including Li Xuejian
as the king, who believes that all means of killing and torture are
justified by his noble goal, and Gong Li, already well known in the
West, as his beautiful girlfriend, who ultimately is so repulsed by
his cruelty that she helps arrange an assassination attempt against
him, which fails.
</P>
<P>
   Literally translated, the movie's title is ``Jingke Stabs the
Qin Emperor'' _ Jingke is the hired killer.
</P>
<P>
   Even government officials who called at the last minute for
tickets had to be turned away. ``The past few days, the phone
hasn't stopped ringing with people asking for tickets,'' Chen,
wearing a dark suit, said from the Great Hall's cavernous stage.
``I thank you for your presence, and I apologize to friends who
couldn't get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese who attended the film, which lasts nearly three hours,
said they enjoyed it, though some quibbled with its historical
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very authentic and brought to life a period that we
mostly know through books in school,'' said Zhang Pu, a stylish
women in a short black suit who said a friend involved with the
movie had given her a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked toward his white late-model car, Wang Shangli, a
prosperous-looking businessman wearing a gold chain and diamond
ring, said: ``It's the first time such a big epic film has been
made in China. I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who won the Cannes Palme d'Or in 1993 for his banned
``Farewell My Concubine,'' said this was the first of his seven
films that the Chinese censors had approved unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Chen, who despite world acclaim has previously
insisted on making his films in Chinese and in China, said he would
make his next movie in the United States and in English, in part to
avoid the political and financial hassles of filmmaking in his
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   On its surface the new film is an apolitical, even vaguely
patriotic rendering of the founding of China. But it is also a
not-so-subtle allegory about a once-idealistic leader turned
dictator that parallels China's current political situation in some
respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rulers of China always promise to give people a better life,''
Chen said in an interview. ``But how do you get there? How do you
achieve your goal? What they have ended up doing is often against
their dreams.'' In the movie, the king buries whole cities of
children alive in the name of creating a ``bountiful nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The film will be distributed by Sony in the United States, where
its English title will be either ``The First Emperor'' or
``Assassin.''
</P>
<P>
   With its $10 million budget and vast, fast-paced battle scenes,
the movie was a first for Chinese cinema. Thousands of extras _
soldiers from the Chinese Army _ were moved around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult,'' a weary-looking Chen said. ``I'm not very
experienced at how to make action movies.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and the stars seemed right at home on Thursday night at
Maxim's as they sat on a plush banquette amid the flash of cameras,
drinking champagne and smoking cigarettes. Across the room a
Japanese camera crew followed Honami Suzuki, a popular Japanese
actress, who had flown in from Tokyo for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Li Xuejian, who played the King of Qin, agreed that
there would be more premieres to come. As he left Maxim's, beaming,
briefcase in hand, Li, who often stars in modern-day dramas, was
asked how it felt to play a king-turned-emperor, honored at such an
event, in such a vast, ambitious film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very addicting!'' he said.

SHARON NAMED FOREIGN MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also: ISRAEL-SHARON-PROFILE)  
(JT) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed Ariel
Sharon, a hawkish former defense minister, to be Israeli foreign
minister on Friday in an effort to placate the far right as he
moves closer to turning over more West Bank land to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   With his appointment, Sharon, 70, an ardent advocate for Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, is expected to quell domestic
opposition to the concessions that Netanyahu is supposedly prepared
to make at a peace summit conference in the Washington area next
week.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Sharon, who is currently the minister of national
infrastructures, has maintained that redeploying Israeli troops
from more than an additional 9 percent of the West Bank would be a
``national disaster.'' In assuming the role of foreign minister,
however, he would be forced to abandon his public opposition to
Netanyahu's decision to withdraw from another 13 percent of the
Palestinian territory _ even if he votes against the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon will be drawn directly into the issue, since Netanyahu
has appointed him to direct the final status talks with the
Palestinians, which would follow the signing of an interim peace
agreement. Last week Sharon told an Israeli newspaper that,
negotiations or not, he would never shake the hand of Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, whom he has long disdained.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders and Israeli leftists were divided in their
reactions, in similar ways. Some professed to be aghast, and some,
like Nabil Sha'ath, the Palestinian transportation minister, said
they were willing to ``forget history'' if Sharon's appointment
provided Netanyahu the political backbone to sign a deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House and State Department officials
pledged to work closely with Sharon and emphasized that the
personnel in an Israeli government are an internal affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arik Sharon is the most fitting person in the state of Israel
for the position of foreign minister,'' Netanyahu said, using his
nickname. ``He brings with him rich experience, creativity, proven
working ability and I think that he well knows both the wounds and
damages of war as well as the fruits of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharon has never hidden his beliefs,'' he continued, ``and his
words have influenced the way that the redeployment will be carried
out if not its extent.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to Sharon, Netanyahu has decided on a new location for
the nature reserve that would constitute 3 percent of the West Bank
land. It was supposed to be in the Judean desert near Israel's
eastern border, which Sharon argued would pose a strategic security
risk. Instead, it was decided on Thursday that the nature reserve
would instead be on the slopes of the Hebron hills, much closer to
existing Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli political observers believe that Netanyahu has
eviscerated his right-wing opposition with this appointment,
signaling that he genuinely intends to bring home a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the right wing now if Sharon is in the foreign ministry
and negotiating with the Palestinians?'' asked Uzi Benziman, an
editorial board member of the newspaper Haaretz and author of a
critical biography of Sharon. ``It will be just the settlers and
some real hard-liners who don't comprise more than 15 percent of
public opinion. So it's really quite an intelligent move,
suggesting that Netanyahu means business in trying to get an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians took the news hard, and read it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a clear-cut message from Bibi,'' Saeb Erekat, a
lead negotiator for the Palestinians, said, using Netanyahu's
nickname. ``I imagine people will try to explain Netanyahu's
intentions as trying to get the support of the right. What he is
trying to do is make peace with the right wing at the expense of
making peace with us. It means he wants to continue on the path of
non-negotiations, because he wants to continue to be prime minister
at any cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon declined to be interviewed Friday because his appointment
must still be approved by the Cabinet on Tuesday, an approval that
is expected. An aide, Raanan Gisin, said Sharon accepted the
position so that he could ``stem the tide of dangerous developments
and contribute to fighting the risks facing Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired general who fought in every Israeli war, Sharon, 70,
is a leading figure of the Likud Party who has done much battle
with the Likud prime minister. At the most recent party convention,
he said that Netanyahu didn't know his right hand from his left,
which the prime minister dismissed Friday as a comment made ``in
the height of political arguments.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Netanyahu first formed his Cabinet in 1996, the fact
that he did not give Sharon a senior position caused an 11th-hour
crisis before the swearing-in ceremony. Sharon retreated to his
family farm in the Negev, and David Levy, who had been named
foreign minister, said he would not serve unless Sharon was given a
post. Netanyahu then created a Cabinet job, the minister of
infrastructures, especially for Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Levy resigned in January after a lengthy power struggle with the
prime minister, and since then Netanyahu has been serving as his
own foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, a member of the old guard, has a complicated political
past, highlighted by a string of military victories, and checkered,
to many, by his indirect role, as defense minister, in the Lebanese
Christian Phalangist massacre of unarmed civilians in the Sabra and
Shatila refugee camps in Lebanon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis, even those who despise his politics, see him as a
strong, experienced figure who knows his mind and who is capable of
being moderate when he has power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, the right-wing political establishment nearly
universally applauded the appointment. Uzi Landau, who is a Likud
hard-liner, said he was relieved to hear confirmed what has been a
rumor for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more safe about the negotiations if Minister Sharon is
directly involved,'' said Landau, who heads the Parliament's
security and foreign affairs committee. ``Undoubtedly it will
facilitate the situation for the prime minister to show the right
that Arik Sharon is identified with the program, so therefore they
can live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Right before the announcement was made, leaders of the National
Religious Party, who had threatened to bring down the government,
changed their combative tone. They emerged mollified from meetings
with Netanyahu late Thursday, saying they would leave the
government intact. Still, they would not connect their change of
heart to the nomination of Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appointing Sharon is a political step we like very much,''
said Shaul Yahalom, the minister of transportation and a leader of
the National Religious Party. ``But it will have no effect on how
we see the peace agreement. Our concern there is on whether any of
the 160 Jewish settlements are endangered.''
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Sharon comes against a backdrop of violence
that has erupted this week. Friday, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier,
Michal Adato, was stabbed to death by a Palestinian man as she got
off a bus in her hometown, the settlement of Tomer in the Jordan
Valley. Netanyahu reported that he had received a sympathy note
from Arafat, who condemned the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, in the continuing clashes between Palestinian
youths and soldiers in the divided city of Hebron, 32 Palestinians
were lightly injured by rubber bullets after the funeral of a
Palestinian protester shot dead on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After Netanyahu made the announcement Friday, an Israeli
reporter introduced a question by stating that Netanyahu had
diminished the political threat from the right wing by appointing
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you willing to sign on that?'' Netanyahu said. ``I do not
know that. I do know one thing that when you are dependent on the
vote of one or two people you can never know what will be.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to his razor-thin majority in parliament _
which some analysts perceive to be his key motivator in appointing
Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, this reflects the political weakness
of Netanyahu,'' said Yaron Ezrahi, a leading intellectual and
critic of the prime minister. ``He has recognized that the next
redeployment is inevitable if he doesn't want to be seen as
contributing to the wave of political violence that would follow a
failure. But he doesn't have the domestic political power to carry
out the big decision on his own.''

ITALY'S CENTER-LEFT GOVERNMENT TOPPLED BY ONE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ By only one vote, the center-left prime minister of
Italy, Romano Prodi, lost a confidence vote in Parliament Friday
and was toppled from power.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of his government after two and a half years, the
second-longest tenure since World War II, suggested that the
chronic political instability that marked Italy for decades had
sprung back to life.
</P>
<P>
   Though obliged to tender his resignation, Prodi will remain in
charge as a caretaker prime minister until a new government is
formed. He may get a second chance to form a new majority, but even
if he does, negotiations to that end could take days and even
weeks, clouding decisions on such urgent issues as the crisis in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO military planners preparing for possible air strikes
against Yugoslavia had expected to use key air bases in Italy. In
his weakened position, Prodi will have difficulty persuading
Parliament to approve NATO strikes. He will have similar problems
passing the 1999 budget, which is necessary before Italy can cut
its lending rates, a requirement for joining the single European
monetary unit, the euro, on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after Friday's vote of 313-312, in a tense and at
times raucous session, Prodi met with President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro to submit his resignation and discuss his options. In the
coming days Scalfaro will consult with dozens of other leaders to
ascertain whether Prodi has enough lingering support to try to form
a new government. If not, the president is expected to turn to
another political leader.
</P>
<P>
   If no compromise is found, Italy could be plunged into early
elections. But parties of all political stripes may be reluctant to
push things that far, for opinion polls suggest that voters are no
more enamored of the center-right opposition parties than they are
of the governing majority.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi, an economist, is admired by his Western allies as a
down-to-earth leader who vowed to tame Italy's bloated economy and
reckless government borrowing and actually lived up to his pledge.
By raising taxes, lowering interest rates and reducing the deficit,
Italy met the requirements for membership in the euro last spring,
a feat that only a year before was considered impossible by German
and French economists.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi was helped by a healthy global economy and a rare
consensus among industrialists, labor unions and taxpayers, who
feared that exclusion from the euro would condemn Italy to Third
World status.
</P>
<P>
   But his fiscal discipline was not followed by reform of a
political system that is inherently fragile. There are more than 40
parties in Italy, and the government's efforts to amend the
constitution to introduce a two-party system failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the Italian political system changes, Italy is
condemned to political instability,'' said Sergio Romano, a former
diplomat and political science professor. ``The country needs
stability and credibility, and that will never happen as long as
the government is hanging from a thread.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Prodi won with a patchwork quilt of center-left factions
mostly made up of Catholic moderates and leftists. He relied on a
fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a
majority in the lower house. And that alliance, fragile from the
beginning, finally frayed to the breaking point this week. The
hard-line leader of Communist Refounding, Fausto Bertinotti, said
his party would vote against the 1999 budget and would also end its
28-month-old pact with the center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   That position drove the moderate wing of Communist Refounding,
worried that a vote against Prodi would open the doors to a
center-right government, to split away. But the 20-odd deputies who
defied Bertinotti were not enough to squeeze Prodi through.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I am not bitter,'' Prodi said moments after his defeat. ``Even
today I received a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end the coup de grace was delivered by one of his own, a
member of the coalition. ``They have won by the treachery of one
single person,'' Sergio Mattarella, a deputy in Prodi's coalition,
angrily told reporters, referring to Silvio Liotta, a member of the
Italian Renewal Party. Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who heads
that party, said Liotta would be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi has often said he would not govern with any other majority
than the center-left one that elected him in 1996. But throughout
his tenure, he was forced to seek temporary alliances to push
through major policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled to the last to try to keep his original majority
intact. On Thursday, in an effort to woo more moderate Communists
to his side, the prime minister, a staunch ally of the United
States, warned that he would oppose a NATO strike aimed at stopping
Serbian violence in Kosovo unless the U.N. Security Council
approved the attack. Washington maintains that NATO does not need a
new U.N. resolution to order a strike.

ON OVERSHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, October 11, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was one of the shabbiest and most alarming episodes of the
decade: a president hounded from office by the congressional
majority, abetted by an angry press.
</P>
<P>
   David Baltimore's forced resignation as president of Rockefeller
University in 1991 is worth considering, and not just because there
has appeared an exquisitely well-informed and fair-minded account
of the path that led to it. The story casts some light as well on
events that led to the impeachment inquiry for President Clinton.
It even offers a glimpse of where we might go from here.
</P>
<P>
   We owe a good deal to Daniel Kevles. He is one of the nation's
most distinguished historians of scientific politics, a professor
of the humanities at the California Institute of Technology, the
author of a memorable portrait of the scientific community that is
modern physics, and of another study of the early 20th century
quackery that was the eugenics momenent.
</P>
<P>
   He also is a man of no discernible politics aside from good
science. ``The Balitimore Case: A Trial of Politics, Science and
Character'' is not an easy read, for it goes to great lengths to
lay out the biochemistry underlying the experiment at the heart of
the affair. Nor have I read and understood every word of its 509
pages. But Kevles' conclusions carry great weight.
</P>
<P>
   Let me remind you of the broad outlines of the story.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a beguiling young whistleblower named Margot
O'Toole. She had been hired as a post-doc by a cellular
immunologist named Thereza Imanishi-Kari in 1985, and introduced
into a lab at the Cancer Center of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, where the usual fear and loathing among anxious
graduate students prevailed _ perhaps slightly more than the usual.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to duplicate the results of an experiment that required a
series of demanding techniques, the younger woman became convinced
that Imanishi-Kari had fabricated some data. Writes Kevles,
``O'Toole's dogged insistence that she was right and her supervisor
was wrong lay at the heart of the affair.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Toole complained. Nobel laureate David Baltimore defended
Imanishi-Kari (he was her co-author on the paper in question), and
in due course, O'Toole's complaint boiled over and out of the
university. When it fell into the hands of a pair of self-styled
``science cops'' at the National Institutes of Health, it began to
attract a national audience. Walter Stewart and Ned Feder,
freelance students of scientific misbehavior, were tipped to the
issue by another disaffected student.
</P>
<P>
   That Baltimore, director of MIT's Whitehead Institute, was one
of the most senior &UR;  &LR; figures in all of biology added charm. Stewart
and Feder in turn succeeded in interesting a pair of staffers who
worked for US Representative John Dingell, powerful chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell was no stranger to science _ he had been a chemistry
major as an undergraduate at Georgetown University, a scientist
brother was working at the NIH. But he nevertheless had declared a
kind of war on the universities in the late 1980s. Staff leaks and
one-sided hearings his principle weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was that Dingell hauled Baltimore before his committee
and provoked a memorable confrontation in the spring of 1988. A
year later, Baltimore was tapped to become president of Rockefeller
University in New York City _ once the nation's premier center of
molecular biology, but in need of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, egging on federal investigators and the news
reporters covering their proceedings, were perhaps the most
important actors in the drama: a handful of rival Harvard
professors, who professed to be shocked by their MIT colleagues'
science.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation escalated. Imanishi-Kari's notebooks were sent
to the Secret Service and pronounced to have been doctored.
Preliminary reports were leaked. Criminal referrals were made.
James Watson, discoverer of the structure of DNA (and former
Harvard professor), urged that Baltimore be stripped of his Nobel
Prize. Those resisting reorganization at Rockefeller University dug
in their heels against his attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, The New York Times pursued the story with
prosecutorial zeal. And when Baltimore finally stepped down in 1991
_ ``Nobelist Caught Up in Fraud Case Resigns as Head of Rockefeller
U.'' _ a reporter described the ``spectacle'' of his downfall as
seeming ``larger than life, with an effect greater than any case of
scientific fraud in memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevles' findings? That Imanishi-Kari was innocent. That her
Harvard foes didn't make a good-faith attempt to replicate the
crucial experiment, though all the necessary help repeatedly had
been offered. That the Secret Service investigation of the lab
notebooks had been thoroughly discredited. That without Baltimore's
defense, Imanishi-Kari, a Brazilian-Japanese better at tracking
antibodies than at defending herself in English, likely would have
been railroaded out of science. That the press by and large didn't
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great injustice was perpretrated in the name of scientific
integrity and the public trust ... '' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Kevles' book, Roy Porter, an English historian of
medicine, wrote, ``Where else (but America) would this storm in a
teacup _ after all, it wasn't such an important paper in the first
place _ get blown up into a megascandal, involving the expenditure
of goodness knows how many manhours and dollars and the venting of
such acrimony?''
</P>
<P>
   Where indeed?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the point of the story. Imanishi-Kari got tenure at
Tufts. David Baltimore got a good job as president of the
California Institute of Technology. (Kevles had been teaching there
for 30 years.) Scientists still get to take their notebooks home at
night. And John Dingell got dumped; his overreaching contributed to
the Republican landslide of 1994. Though he remains in office, the
Republican majority that swept to office stripped him of his
power &UR;  &LR; _ its leaders even tried to compel his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   No excess John Dingell ever committed, however, compares to the
arrogance and roughshod bullying of the current GOP congressional
leadership. Forty years out of power and the first thing they do is
shut down the government. Next they attempt to impeach the
president, after he balances the budget. (Can you remember the
other nine items of the famous ``Contract With America.'') It is
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; What will happen to Bill Clinton and the presidency? Great
injustices will be done. But before long, the Republicans will lose
their power. Just like currency traders, the political leadership
has overshot.

IN CLOSED-END FUNDS, A FIRE SALE

 By RICK GLADSTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the embers still smoldering from the financial-market
firebombings of the third quarter, prospective investors in
closed-end funds might want to borrow a few lessons from junkyard
dogs and other naturally skilled scavengers: Venture forth, sniff
around and, perhaps, bite.
</P>
<P>
   The adventurous will inevitably be drawn to what appears to be
the wasteland of emerging-market closed-end funds, which endured
some of the worst of the destruction. Many have fallen by more than
half from what were already low levels; some are trading for a few
dollars or less a share.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who bought these funds years ago, when prices were
high and Wall Street gushed about the coming boom in Asia, Russia
and Latin America, buying may seem less tempting now that the
economies there have fallen so steeply. But if you missed the peak,
opportunity may be staring at you.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I think the most money will be made over the
next 12 months _ the most money in the closed-end fund universe,
anyway,'' said Thomas J. Herzfeld, chairman and president of an
investment advisory firm in Miami that is considered an authority
on closed-end funds. ``They've just been pummeled. Fifty, 60 and 70
percent losses are not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   These funds, which issue a fixed number of shares that are
traded like those of ordinary companies, have often fallen much
further than the underlying values of their holdings have. This
divergence is especially wide in Latin America, where stock prices
as measured by the Morgan Stanley Capital International index for
the region have fallen 45 percent this year _ most of that in the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the gap helps create a new opportunity, Herzfeld and others
say. Eventually, the shares and net asset values should converge.
</P>
<P>
   Buying shares of a fund that is trading at a 25 percent discount
to its net asset value, for example, is like buying a $100 stock
for $75. Many of these funds, however, are trading at even greater
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Closed-end funds can trade at discounts for various reasons _
shaky economic fundamentals, bad management, poor performance. But
the severe declines in stocks have contributed to some of the
widest discounts in years, especially among Latin American equity
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Herzfeld cited the Latin American Discovery fund, whose discount
grew from 2 percent in March to 21.7 percent at the end of
September. The Latin American Equity fund behaved similarly; its
discount widened from 15 percent in February to 29.9 percent at the
end of September.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the selloff is that many investors panicked after
Russia defaulted on its debts in August. Sensing a spreading
malaise, they dumped shares no matter where their funds were
invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one really knows where the bottom is, but there's no
question that discounts have gotten pretty deep,'' said Gregg
Wolper, international funds editor at Morningstar Inc., the
financial publisher in Chicago. ``That's why more of the bargains
are in Latin America.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say funds invested in central Europe were also unfairly
pummeled. Douglas Beck, an emerging-markets strategist at Merrill
Lynch, is looking at funds with stakes in Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic, which he saw as likely to recover even if Russia
kept foundering: ``I think it's time for investors to dip their
toes back into certain markets. What we're telling clients is,
regardless of what discounts do, we're making the assumption that
discounts are close to an extreme. If you're looking to gain
exposure now, the ability to purchase a diverse pool at a 20 to 25
percent discount is a tremendous opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was looking at two funds that do not have exposure to
Russia: Central European Equity, which is 30 percent invested in
Germany, and Central European Value, heavily invested in the Czech
Republic. Both are trading at discounts of substantially more than
20 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many people doubt that the worst is over. Some
closed-end fund strategists say they remain extremely wary about
Latin America partly because it is unclear whether countries like
Brazil, Venezuela and Mexico will need to devalue their currencies
or require International Monetary Fund bailouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's good reason to feel the contagion has seeped into
Latin America,'' said Michael T. Porter, a closed-end fund analyst
at Salomon Smith Barney. ``If you feel it's a question of when, not
if, the currencies come under great pressure, then a 30 percent
discount in closed-end funds today may not look so big.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter said he was looking at emerging-market bond funds;
although the shares of these funds are not trading at steep
discounts _ some are even trading at premiums _ their yields are
relatively high.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a slow-growth global environment, I might want to take bond
funds relative to equities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As examples of possible buying opportunities, he offered the
Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Debt fund, which was yielding
nearly 15 percent at the end of September, and Templeton Emerging
Markets Income, yielding 13.6 percent. The Morgan Stanley fund has
a discount of 23.2 percent, and the Templeton fund has a premium of
1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Porter argued that even if countries represented in these funds
devalued their currencies, the damage would be minimal because much
of the debt held by the funds is denominated in dollars. But stocks
in equity funds are denominated in local currencies and can tumble
in value if there is a devaluation.

 &HT;    The kick: When it leaves the foot, it leaves the mind
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons kicker Morten Andersen has set seven NFL
records, but there's one he wants more than any other _ George
Blanda's career scoring mark of 2,002 points.
</P>
<P>
   In his 17th season, the native of Denmark has 1,668 points,
fifth in history, and Sunday night he'll get a chance to close the
gap when the Falcons play the Giants in East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Giants Stadium can be tough on a kicker,with tricky winds common
this time of season. Andersen, 38, spoke with the
Journal-Constitution about the job of kicking.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you change your approach kicking outdoors, especially in a
place like Giants Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   A: You try not to let the wind or any element control your
thought process, but if there's a crosswind, you've got to give it
credence. You never give up the goal post or completely (aim) a
ball outside, but you change (the aim) just a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're second in NFL history with 383 career field goals, 13
behind Minnesota kicker Gary Anderson, who also is second in NFL
history with 1,731 points. Do you keep tabs on him?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't look at the stats much. I used to all the time. I
know my points (27 this season) ... but I don't know where
everybody else is. I know he has more than me and more
opportunities (Anderson is leading the league with 52 points,
including 11-of-11 field goals; Andersen has hit 5-of-5 this year).
But that's one of those things I can't control.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your biggest goal?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've said for the last year and a half that I want to break
Blanda's record. It's certainly not unrealistic that Gary would do
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you miss a kick, or go in a slump, do you focus on
correcting the mistakes you made? Or do you shut them out of your
mind and just concentrate on the positive?
</P>
<P>
   A: I look at every kick objectively every Monday, analyze it and
keep a very detailed diary of every kick in my career. I have a
seven-step checklist for every kick. I confront the mistake head-on
and try to make improvements. But I try not to dwell on it too
long, just like I try not to dwell on a good kick too long. I've
always said when it leaves the foot, it leaves the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you ever picked up a fumble and run, thrown a pass, or a
block?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. No. No. I have made a couple tackles ... I say tackles;
I've pushed a couple people out of bounds, using the sideline to my
advantage. I can't say I've boned somebody, I haven't laid wood, I
haven't crushed somebody. I mean, look at my (scrawny shoulder)
pads.

 &HT;    Proven Porsche captures pole at Road Atlanta
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ To the surprise of no one, the No. 26 Porsche GT1 that
won the 24 Hours of Le Mans took the No. 1 position for Friday's
Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Porsche, the only GT1 in the top seven, had a top lap of
124.95 mph, turning the 2.6-mile circuit in 1:13.754.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the leaders _ including the fourth qualifier, the
Atlanta-sponsored No. 7 Lease Plan Ferrari 333SP are in the World
Sports Car or the similar Le Mans Prototype Class, which also isn't
surprising, because those cars generally are faster and easier to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   The top five includes two Porsches (one LMP) and three Ferraris,
bringing back memories to some fans of days past when the two
battled on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Lease Plan Ferrari, driven by Wayne Taylor, Eric van de
Poele and Emmanuel Collard ran the course in 123.65/1:14.531.
</P>
<P>
   The Petit, a 1,000-mile or 10-hour version of the famous French
endurance race, starts today at 11 a.m. and finishes at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be like Le Mans but with a little more intensity,'' said
No. 26 co-driver Yannick Dalmas of France.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Allan McNish of Scotland said the winner will have to
have a ``great deal of dedication, commitment and a good car,''
because the Road Atlanta circuit is so demanding technically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best I've ever seen,'' McNish said, but it is
demanding as many learned, especially in the ``esses'' at the top
of the hill after Turn 1. That area had a good collection of
fiberglass and headlight pieces scattered around it after
qualifying was over.
</P>
<P>
   Luck is a big factor at Road Atlanta, too, as Team Panoz
learned. The No. 5 Panoz GT1 won't be in the race because of some
bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Johnny O'Connell of Phoenix was blazing downhill into the
final turn on his first lap of qualifying, hit a patch of oil on
the track and skidded into the wall beneath the press tower. It's
doubtful that No. 5 will be in the starting grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no flag warning us to slow down,'' O'Connell said.
It went up shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   There are still two Team Panoz cars competing. The No. 4 GT1,
driven by David Brabham, Andy Wallace and Scott Pruett qualified
10th with a best lap of 119.76 mph/1:16.951.
</P>
<P>
   No. 07 Panoz Q9 GT1, the hybrid V8/electric motor tandem, driven
by Doc Bundy, John Nielsen and Christophe qualified 12th at 117.52
mph/1:18.415.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-built No. 63 Kudzu Mazda with owner/driver Jim
Downing, Yojiro Terada and Howard Katz qualified 14th at 112.13
mph/1:22.190. The Kudzu is the only rotary engine-powered car in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the race are teams from BMW and Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   BMW actually had a team with three cars at Road Atlanta, but
technicians weren't satisfied with the performance of the cars' new
engines.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes team had a conflicting schedule with FIA races at
Homestead, Fla., and Laguna Seca, Calif., in the next three weeks.

A FUND'S LETTERS CAN COOL LOVE'S FIRE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By ERIC HUBLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It remains one of the most memorable letters I've ever received,
up there with my acceptance to college and the emotive notification
from my mother that my childhood pet cat, Noodle, was dead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the early 90s, and I was back from two years working and
traveling in Asia, where I had been mightily impressed with the
so-called tiger economies. I had put a full quarter of my
individual retirement account into the T. Rowe Price New Asia fund.
</P>
<P>
   My money had doubled in a matter of months, and I was sure that
was just the beginning. I'd seen those hard-working Asians with my
own eyes, riding three to a scooter to their Japanese-financed
factories and the nirvana of assembling fluorescent tubes for $3 a
day. History belonged to them, and New Asia was making me a player.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in November 1993, along came a missive, postmarked
Baltimore, that had an effect not unlike that of a ``Dear Eric''
letter putting the brakes on a rapturous love affair.
</P>
<P>
   After starting off buoyantly, Martin G. Wade, the president of
the fund, delivered what I still remember as a shocker. ``A fund
like New Asia should not represent a major portion of your equity
assets,'' he wrote. It was like being hit with the ``Let's just be
friends'' line.
</P>
<P>
   Wade was right, of course. The fund peaked a month later, slid
back to the price where I'd bought it and is still falling. On Oct.
1, assets were down to $543 million, from $1.6 billion when Wade
wrote his letter.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fund companies are not always so blunt. At times it's
important to read the subtext of their communications. Consider the
nuanced language in the current ad campaign of Fidelity
Investments, starring Peter Lynch and Lily Tomlin.
</P>
<P>
   Its slogan, ``Know what you own and know why you own it,''
invites the investor to share the burden of understanding
investments with Fidelity. ``You're responsible, too,'' is the
message I hear.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, letters to shareholders seem designed to counteract
a different sort of advertising, the kind that blares about
performance and that often persuades people to put money into the
fund in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   An example from James E. Stowers, president of Twentieth Century
Investors (now American Century), went out in November 1991, when
the Ultra Fund basked in the glow of 12-month returns of almost 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This short-term progress, while exciting, is not sustainable
for either Ultra or any other conventional investment,'' Stowers
warned.
</P>
<P>
   But if the letter was meant to discourage investments, it didn't
work. Assets continued to flow in, leading Stowers to follow up in
May 1992 with a note that said, ``We think it is important for our
investors to understand the short-term risks involved in
common-stock investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern for caution that fund companies show in these
letters is sometimes matched only by the contrition they profess
after turning in poor performance. Years after Stowers' letters,
when American Century's Vista fund was underperforming, the company
sent out a letter expressing abject humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fund's 1997 return was disappointing _ it lost value
during a year which saw strong stock performance,'' wrote Robert C.
Puff, the chief investment officer. ``We have spent many hours
examining why Vista's recent results did not achieve what we had
hoped.'' Puff, who I imagined garbed in sackcloth, concluded,
``Thank you for your patience.''
</P>
<P>
   The market leader in lowering expectations, though, may be the
Vanguard Group of Malvern, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, John J. Brennan, the chairman of Vanguard, wrote
to investors in its famous index funds, then being showered with
good press, to express concern that ``given all the recent
publicity, and its focus on indexing's extraordinary returns,
investors may not fully appreciate the risks associated with an
investment in stocks through one of the portfolios of Vanguard
Index Trust.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Brennan did a stint on the customer-service phones, and
was so alarmed to hear investors say they expected index funds to
keep returning 20 percent a year that he made the communications
department bump a manager profile from the shareholder newsletter
and replace it with a special piece on investment risk.
</P>
<P>
   It may be wise to listen to such advice. Brennan's warning in
the June 30 semiannual report this year, just before the market
peak, was this: ``Though we claim no predictive powers, we feel
safe in saying that such outsized returns can't continue
indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   And you didn't have to pay a broker to tell you that.

MUNICIPALS: PRIME TIME FOR THE OTHER HAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Ill., Ohio)   (ART ADV: Graphic of the top 5 long-term muni funds is being sent
to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11)  
 (af)  
 By ABBY SCHULTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
  Turmoil in global equity markets has sent investors scurrying for
the safety of United States Treasury bonds. But investors willing
to forgo the ironclad government guarantees of Treasuries may be
able to garner significant extra income after taxes _ and still
maintain relative safety _ by investing in a municipal bond fund.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Muni bonds almost always make sense for investors in high tax
brackets, because federal income taxes, which go as high as 39.6
percent, can take a big chunk from the coupon income of Treasury
securities; income from munis is generally not subject to federal
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the tax advantage of municipals makes sense for
people in any tax bracket, largely because the yield of municipal
securities with maturities of five years or more is nearly the same
as the before-tax yield on comparable United States Treasury
securities for the first time in more than a decade. Usually, muni
yields are only 80 percent to 85 percent of Treasury yields.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-quality 30-year muni, for example, was recently
yielding about 4.64 percent, or 98 percent of the yield of a
30-year Treasury bond, said Richard J. Moynihan, director of
municipal securities at the Dreyfus Corp.
</P>
<P>
   After taxes, an investor in the 36 percent tax bracket, for
example, would wind up with a yield of 3.03 percent on the 30-year
Treasury, only 65 percent as much as the investor in munis,
Moynihan said. (Put another way, the tax-equivalent yield of that
muni for this investor is 7.25 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   And an investor in the 28 percent bracket would wind up with an
after-tax yield of only 3.4 percent on the 30-year Treasury bond,
just 73 percent as much as the muni.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value is screamingly there in municipals,'' Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Willmann, who oversees fixed-income securities at USAA
Investment Management in San Antonio, agreed. ``If you pay any
federal tax at all, you are better off in municipals,'' Willmann
said. ``That's maybe a rash statement, but that's pretty close to
true.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors with less than $100,000 available for a muni
portfolio, mutual funds are generally the best way to go. That's
because muni bonds are generally sold in lots of $25,000, meaning
it would take $100,000 to get a reasonably well-diversified
portfolio of four issues.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fund investors give up an important protection
enjoyed by people who hold bonds outright: If a bond is held to
maturity, the principal is repaid. A fund makes no such promise.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal yields are relatively high because low interest rates
this year prompted record issuance of new munis as well as
refinancings of older issues. The extra supply put downward
pressure on prices throughout the muni market, pushing up yields,
which move in the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of Treasuries, meanwhile, rose to 30-year highs, as
Americans and foreign investors _ many of whom receive no tax
benefit from munis _ rushed into Treasuries, pushing down yields. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What happens next?
</P>
<P>
   If global equities markets stabilize and the United States stock
market pulls out of its slump, Treasury prices could fall. The
``devil's advocate'' view, said Eric Jacobson, a fixed-income
analyst at Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, is
that prices of munis would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The more common opinion, Jacobson said, is that the municipal
market is cheap and that there is plenty of room for prices to
rise. If the economy slows or even slips into recession, municipal
securities will provide more income than Treasuries after taxes,
and they will resist credit depreciation more than bonds issued by
corporations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Making the case for general obligation bonds, which are backed
by the full faith and credit of a municipality, he said, ``Most
city governments have done a good job of putting their fiscal house
in order over the last few years, so it'll be a pretty slow process
of deterioration if they are hurt by recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors worrying about a recession might want to steer
clear of some of the best-performing funds, which can be loaded
with ``nonrated'' municipal bonds, or securities issued by weaker
municipalities. A lot of managers think that the current yields on
many weaker credits are not high enough to compensate investors for
the risk, Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   So while good managers can pick their way through weaker
credits, many are choosing instead to buy high-quality muni bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Investors looking for managers who can take advantage of
carefully researched bargains among higher-yielding, nonrated
securities should stay away from high-yield municipal bond funds
that are often required to have a big percentage in lower-quality
issues, said Michael J. Chasnoff, a financial planner in
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want a fund that can be more opportunistic, you need a
national fund,'' Chasnoff said.
</P>
<P>
   What else should investors watch for in a muni fund? Low
operating expenses, Chasnoff said, because even superior returns
may not compensate for extra costs. He recommends funds with
expense ratios below the average of their peer group _ 1.10 percent
for long-term national municipal funds, for instance, according to
Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   And what about single-state muni funds? These often make sense
for investors who live in a state with high taxes, like California
or New York, because the income will be exempt from state as well
as federal taxes. The downside of a single-state fund is that it
offers less diversification by making an investor dependent on the
local economy.

<P>
   Many investors give more thought to breakfast than to their
money market funds, which they have used mainly as a place to park
their cash between stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   But with the average money market fund now leading the
performance race against stocks _ and these days, that lead seems
to widen almost every week _ people are starting to take these
funds more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   General-purpose money funds have been yielding around 5 percent,
while the average domestic stock mutual fund was down 13.4 percent
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, $94 billion poured into them in the third quarter, the
largest quarterly inflow on record, according to IBC Financial Data
of Ashland, Mass. Few investors, however, examine what their
money-market funds own or try to determine whether the funds have
made the best choices.
</P>
<P>
   A first consideration in picking a money market fund is its
expenses, since the returns do not vary much. ``Investment
brilliance doesn't show itself in a money market fund,'' said Gary
Schatsky, a fee-only financial planner in New York. ``Therefore, I
advise my clients to look for funds with the lowest expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding such funds can be more complicated than it sounds. To
draw in cash, many funds temporarily waive their expenses, which
can run as high as 1.86 percent of assets, or offer high teaser
rates. These funds may be good deals for investors with short time
horizons, though not necessarily for long-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are funds that have consistently low expenses but
offer little convenience. The funds with the lowest expenses
generally have high minimum investments _ often $20,000 or more _
and allow check-writing only for big dollar amounts, while perhaps
charging high fees for each check.
</P>
<P>
   Such a fund has little appeal to the big group of investors who
see their money market funds as high-yield checking accounts for
big-ticket monthly expenses like mortgages and car payments. But it
may have great appeal for another group: those who want to keep
their money untouched for six months to a year or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies now offer funds for both types of investors.
Scudder Kemper Investments, for instance, started the Zurich
Yieldwise Money fund in April 1997 to attract savers. It requires a
$25,000 minimum investment, allows an account holder to write
checks of only $1,000 or more and charges $2 for every check.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, which ranked 12th among general purpose funds, had a
seven-day yield of 5.29 percent through Sept. 29 and an expense
ratio of 0.34 percent of assets. Zurich Yieldwise is meant for an
investor ``who wants to maximize the return on the cash portion of
their portfolio, but again isn't planning to spend the money
anytime soon,'' said Michael Harrington, who runs the Zurich money
funds for Scudder Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Zurich Money fund has a minimum of only $1,000
and allows unlimited check-writing for amounts of $500 or more. The
fund, ranked 37th on the general purpose list, has an expense ratio
of 0.48 percent and a seven-day yield of 5.13 percent through Sept.
29.
</P>
<P>
   Money market funds are a lot like mutual funds _ a pool of
assets owned by many investors _ with an important difference. Each
day, mutual funds must price the securities in their portfolio
according to market price, which creates a fluctuating net asset
value, while money funds have a constant net asset value of $1 a
share. That means an investor's principal remains intact in a money
fund despite market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission requires these funds to
invest mostly in top-quality short-term securities. The securities
must have maturities of 13 months or less, and the average maturity
of the entire portfolio cannot be more than 90 days. The
restrictions on credit quality protect investors from default,
while the short-maturity rules protect investors from interest-rate
risk, said Peter Crane, managing editor at IBC.
</P>
<P>
   Performance of money funds is described in terms of the current
seven-day, or SEC, yield: the annualized return of the dividend
payouts of the underlying securities for the previous seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The funds also report the ``effective seven-day yield,'' which
calculates what the return would be if the dividends were
reinvested. Investors should also consider longer-term statistics,
like one-year or five-year total returns, which include any capital
gains, Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should also decide whether they want a taxable fund or
a tax-free fund, which may yield more than the taxable fund after
taxes. Relatively high yields have added to the appeal of a
different tax-free investment _ municipal bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the same is not true for tax-free money funds, which have an
average yield of 3.23 percent, or more than one and a half
percentage points below the 4.87 percent of general purpose funds.
That makes tax-free funds beneficial only to investors in the top
tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   And some tax-free funds that are specifically aimed at investors
in high-tax states like California or New York.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of taxable funds: government funds and the
higher-yielding general purpose funds. Government funds must buy
mostly short-term Treasury securities and obligations of government
agencies like the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., while general
purpose funds can invest in higher-yielding short-term debt, like
certificates of deposit issued by banks or savings institutions and
bankers' acceptances, which are short-term notes issued by
commercial banks, according to IBC. Even fatter yields are found in
corporate commercial paper.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in government funds tend to be more conservative. For
that reason, Crane recommends funds that buy only Treasury
securities. People who invest in general purpose funds are taking
on slightly more risk for a little extra yield.

A BANKRUPTCY RUSH, JUST IN CASE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., N.Y., Calif., Va.)   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By all accounts, President Clinton plans to veto the bankruptcy
bill now in the final stages of approval in the Republican
Congress. But many debtors aren't taking any chances.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers across the country are reporting a surge in bankruptcy
filings by clients rushing to beat the tough new standards in
legislation agreed to by House and Senate negotiators on Wednesday
and passed by the House on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would force many families of four making more than
$51,000 a year, and individuals making more than $17,900, to repay
part or all of their credit card bills and other unsecured debts by
going into Chapter 13 bankruptcy, instead of walking away from them
by filing Chapter 7, which cancels most debts.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said President Clinton was unlikely to sign the
measure, but lawyers for debtors said many consumers couldn't
afford the risk that he would change his mind. ``If they are going
to have to file, we recommend that they do it without waiting,''
said Melvin Kaplan, a bankruptcy lawyer in Chicago who handles
about 1,000 cases annually and whose business has shot up 40
percent over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   William Binzel, vice president for government affairs for
Mastercard International, said bankruptcy lawyers were creating a
sense of panic among debtors when none was warranted. ``Income is
only the first threshold,'' he said of the proposed rules. ``Then
judges will look at expenses in each metropolitan area'' to
determine if a debtor can pay some credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in Manhattan,
disagreed. ``If your Chapter 13 fails because you get sick or lose
your job or your car gets stolen, this bill says that you could be
denied refuge in Chapter 7 and be thrown to the mercy of the credit
card companies,'' he said. ``Whether you could stay in bankruptcy
would depend on the luck of the draw as to what judge you get, and
that introduces a degree of uncertainty that makes it crazy to
delay filing.''
</P>
<P>
   Juntikka said his business had increased by a third in recent
weeks and he had four dozen files on his desk representing people
who could be forced into Chapter 13 under the proposed rules.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of one of his clients, Elaine Salmon, 43, a city
corrections officer at the Bronx House of Detention for Men,
illustrates the problems many consumers face. Because Ms. Salmon
makes a $35,000 base salary, she would be forced into Chapter 13
under the rules in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But while her income places her statistically in the ranks of
the middle class, she said her finances had been devastated by a
marital separation, her 9-year-old daughter's illnesses and the
theft of her Jeep, on which she has been unable to collect
insurance compensation. She is sinking under $36,200 in unsecured
debt.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the burden, Ms. Salmon took her daughter out of Catholic
school and ended the girl's skating lessons. But, realizing such
moves were ineffectual against debt so large, she went to
Juntikka's office on Wednesday to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not living some high life like the banks are saying on the
television,'' Ms. Salmon said, referring to assertions of abuse of
bankruptcy by debtors.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card industry says the overhaul is needed to reverse
an explosion of personal-bankruptcy filings to a record 728,000 in
the first half of this year and to force deadbeats to repay some
debt.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the bill would not stop abuses by wealthy
individuals, who could put their assets into homes in Florida or
Texas, where state laws protect even the most expensive homes from
creditors so long as they bought the homes two years or more before
filing bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Norma Hammes of San Jose, Calif., the president of the National
Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Lawyers, called the final
legislation ``a nightmare for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have little red sticky tags on about 20 cases,'' she said.
She has flagged them to be filed immediately if the bill is sent to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And H. Jason Gold of Gold &AMP; Stanley in Alexandria, Va., a lawyer
who represents creditors, said that if the bill became law it would
prove impractical and be ``bound to fail'' because it didn't
reflect the economic realities that debtors face.

A PLAY ABOUT GAY JESUS GIVES BLASPHEMY A BAD NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most electric moments in ``Corpus Christi'', Terrence
McNally's play about a gay Jesus, come when you arrive at the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street, Catholic protesters in white berets recite
Hail Marys into a megaphone. If you approach the police barricade
that pens them in, they ply you with leaflets charging that the
play portrays ``the Blessed Virgin screaming obscenely to St.
Joseph for sexual relations'' (sadly, it doesn't).
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the controversy, the entire run at the 299 seat
Manhattan Theatre Club is sold out. Should you manage to lay hands
on a ticket, you have to run a gauntlet of burly security guards
and pass through an airport metal detector to get to your seat.
</P>
<P>
   The experience is disorienting _ part First Amendment vigil,
part X-rated movie. ``Corpus Christi'' became instantaneously
notorious in May, when the New York Post revealed that it depicted
a Jesus who has sex with his apostles. After receiving telephone
calls threatening violence, the Manhattan Theatre Club canceled the
production.
</P>
<P>
   But the play was reinstated a week later amid protests from
nearly every important dramatist in America and many elsewhere.
Since restoring the play, the Manhattan Theatre Club has been
congratulating itself on its fearless defense of free expression.
</P>
<P>
   What a letdown, then, to finally see ``Corpus Christi'' and
encounter neither blasphemy nor artistic courage. On the first
score, the play comes up short. It is not, in fact, a work of
savage (or even mild) anti-clericalism. There's no nudity or sex
onstage, and though the Vatican regards the notion of a noncelibate
gay Jesus as heretical, the playwright's intention is not
sacrilegious.
</P>
<P>
   McNally's updating of the life of Jesus is much in the spirit of
``Godspell'' _ if slightly more risque. But while there's nothing
very shocking about ``Corpus Christi'', its dramatic and
intellectual thinness is stunning. McNally's real offense is
invoking a great theme and an all-important principle for something
as trite and banal as this.
</P>
<P>
   The play is in essence a gay retelling of the Gospel. Thirteen
male actors perform a variety of parts in a series of sketches. In
the first, Joshua, a.k.a. Jesus, is born in a sleazy East Texas
motel room (the woman screaming for sex is on the other side of a
thin wall). At 1950s-era ``Pontius Pilate High'' in Corpus Christi,
Texas _ the town where McNally grew up _ Joshua is bullied into
playing football and taunted by his peers as a ``faggot.'' An
encounter in the school bathroom leads to an affair with a sinister
classmate named Judas.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Joshua hitchhikes across the desert and has
occasional conversations with his dad, God. He performs miracles
and gathers disciples. One is a doctor, another an actor, another a
male prostitute. They go to gay discos and spread the Word. Joshua
performs a marriage for two of the apostles. After a scrumptious
Last Supper, Judas betrays him with a French kiss. On the cross,
Joshua is mocked as ``King of the Queers.''
</P>
<P>
   The staging and performances are competent, if uninspired. The
real limitations are those of the writer, whose hallmarks are weak
sophomoric humor and a cloying sentimentality. It's a gag line in
this play when someone exclaims ``Jesus H. Christ!'' Joseph opposes
naming his son Jesus, because people will thing he's a Mexican. ``I
hear hammering,'' Jesus tells his mother. ``Of course you do,'' she
says. ``Your father's a carpenter.''
</P>
<P>
   This is silly, and not really funny, but the intent is not to
ridicule. The spirit is rather one of camp reverence. McNally, who
was raised a Catholic, apparently considers himself in sympathy
with the deeper meaning of Christianity, which he boils down to an
injunction to be nice to everybody. His setting is supposed to
teach us that Jesus loves gay people, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone miss the point, one of the apostles appears onstage
to explain it to the audience after the crucifixion. ``If we have
offended, so be it,'' he declares. ``He belongs to us as well as
you.''
</P>
<P>
   This is weak Christian tea. Equally pallid is McNally's
stereotyped portrayal of gay people. Like many of his other plays,
``Corpus Christi'' seems like ethnic PR, in the vein of ``Fiddler
on the Roof'' or the movie ``Moonstruck.'' McNally wants to present
homosexuals to heterosexuals as witty and wonderful. Though his gay
characters aren't always perfect, the overall picture is of a
delightful bunch of fellas. Gay men have flair, taste and humor.
They love Callas and cooking. They are sensitive and deep.
</P>
<P>
   Where McNally fails time and again is by drawing gay people as
types rather than complex characters. Watch the clip from the film
version of ``Frankie and Johnny,'' for which McNally wrote the
screenplay based on his own theater play. Michelle Pfeiffer's gay
next-door neighbor, played by Nathan Lane, is a cut-up, whose jokes
are usually variations of the theme of being a man who likes other
men.
</P>
<P>
   In another McNally play-turned-film, the maudlin soap opera
``Love! Valour! Compassion!,'' Jason Alexander minces around, puts
on women's clothes and continually bursts into show tunes. Watch as
he riffs on those annoying heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Corpus Christi,'' the disciple characters are thinly
sketched versions of familiar cliches: the taciturn hairdresser,
the buff male hustler, the yuppie lawyer. This may be Bethlehem,
but it's still The Birdcage.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing on the fact that the play portrays a Christ who has
sex with his disciples, the press has encouraged a misconception
about McNally's work. Most people now assume that ``Corpus
Christi'' is an expression of ACT-UP-style radicalism _ the theater
of queer outrage performed with an NEA grant. But McNally wants to
enlarge the bourgeoisie, not ``epater'' it. ``Corpus Christi,''
like his other plays, is a work of unchallenging, middlebrow
subscription theater on a touchy theme.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's nothing wrong with middlebrow theater if done
well. Neil Simon has his place. But Neil Simon doesn't congratulate
his audience for being brave enough to laugh at his jokes. And Neil
Simon can be funny.

<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan _ Kabul's largest children's hospital, like
Afghanistan itself, is a study in want.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray machines have no film. The burn unit has been shut for
lack of gauze and ointments. When a child needs a shot, parents are
sent to the bazaar to buy the medication and a syringe. No records
are kept of the 500 youngsters treated each day as out-patients,
for this requires stationery, and there is a shortage of paper and
pens.
</P>
<P>
   In the neonatal unit, a baby born two months prematurely was
fighting for his life last week in a faulty 32-year-old incubator
with a cracked glass casing. A few rooms away were four new
machines ready to be uncrated, but no one knew how to use them. The
day after the equipment arrived, the relief agency that bought them
was expelled by the army of the Taliban, the Islamic movement in
power here. With it went the workers who knew how to operate the
incubators.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three months have passed since 23 international aid
groups left this country rather than obey a command to move their
non-Afghan employees into a decrepit and abandoned row of college
dormitories at the capital's edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban have since expanded their military control to 90
percent of the country and hardened the hold of their puritanical
brand of Islam on the people.
</P>
<P>
   But even some Afghans who are most critical of the Taliban's
austere rule say that the aid groups should have been more flexible
and that the world overlooks the good the Taliban have done in
bringing peace and social order.
</P>
<P>
   THE POVERTY: MONEY FOR THE SICK IS SPENT ON GUNS
</P>
<P>
   With winter approaching and hunger already here, it is hard to
tell if Kabul is at the cliff's edge of a catastrophe or merely in
the throes of severe hardship, something to which residents are
sadly accustomed. The international agencies had been supplying
clean water and fresh bread and medical necessities _ services that
benefited 400,000 people, a third of the city's population.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one to take their place. The Taliban are preoccupied
by war, and that is where their money goes. Government employees
have not been paid in two months. Beggars are everywhere. Old men
and young children station themselves inside potholes, serving as
human markers for dangerous ruts in the roads, hoping grateful
drivers will toss them a tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been surveying the hospitals and their shelves are
empty,'' said Christophe Luedi of the Red Cross, one of the few
relief groups still working here. ``It is hard to measure the
impact of this on the population because many people have simply
stopped going to see the doctors. What is the use? Many are being
told to just go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Public Health is in a war-ravaged building. The
metal frame of the facade remains but the glass is long gone, and
visitors can enter through empty spaces where there once were
doors, windows and walls.
</P>
<P>
   There, Mullah Mohammed Abbas, the health minister, insisted that
Kabul is undergoing only ``minor nutritional problems,'' but he
suggested a tour of local hospitals and clinics knowing full well
what there was to discover.
</P>
<P>
   At the Indira Gandhi Child Health Institute and Hospital, bony
boys and girls rested on cots in a nutrition ward that was depleted
of even milk and vitamin-enriched biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have great needs,'' said Dr. Mohammed Hussein,
the deputy director. ``We have been left alone and we are now in
God's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   THE AID GROUPS: A CULTURAL CLASH AND STUBBORNNESS
</P>
<P>
   The departure of the aid groups _ known colloquially as NGOs, or
nongovernmental organizations _ is a matter of great
finger-pointing, with the Taliban and the agencies reproaching each
other for what each side sees as the other's unreasonableness.
</P>
<P>
   Western charities, with their Western ways and Western
expectations, were never a comfortable fit with the Taliban. At
times the mullahs, the Islamic teachers, demanded that women at the
agencies stop working in any place where they might be seen by a
man who was not a blood relative. Strict laws of purdah _ the
protective seclusion of women _ were to be maintained.
</P>
<P>
   But the aid groups were sometimes mulish as well, according to
local officials from the United Nations and the Red Cross who
exchanged their candor for confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban are neither skilled bureaucrats or intellectuals,
and the NGOs were unwilling to accept their authority,'' one of
these officials said. ``The Taliban have this village mentality.
They're used to having their leaders respected. They were offended
to have their religious beliefs questioned by people who assumed
some kind of moral superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions steadily built. The Taliban wanted an accounting of
how aid money was being spent. They also did not want Afghans to
work for the agencies without a government ID card, a proposal the
agencies took to be a means for interfering in hiring decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in what became the last straw, the mullahs told the NGOs
to move their staffs into the dilapidated dormitories, which had no
water or electricity. The Taliban said a central location would
make aid workers easier to protect, but they also admitted a desire
to restrict the movements of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue for the Taliban was control, and we couldn't give in
to that,'' said Liz Spencer, a spokeswoman for the Agency
Coordinating Body for Afghan Relief. ``And what about the donors?
Who would give us $1 million, especially to repair college
dormitories, especially given the Taliban's views on education for
women?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, though, I don't think anybody really thought the
Taliban were serious about closing us down. They gave us a
deadline, but we thought we'd be allowed to continue. Then _
surprise, surprise _ they came and sealed the offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, shorn of purpose, a few groups are negotiating for a
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's work to be done and no way to do it from outside the
country,'' said one NGO official who regretted leaving and has
since come back. ``Besides, when there are important human rights
issues _ as there clearly are here _ it's more important to retain
a presence and build a rapport with people. Over time, we can work
away at the gender and other issues.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   THE TALIBAN: LOSS OF FREEDOM IS PRICE OF SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban and the international community have so far failed
to get along. Though the movement now controls most of the country,
only three nations _ Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates _ have recognized the Taliban as a rightful government.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights violations are cited as the cause for keeping a
distance. The Taliban's Muslim clerics _ rooted in village life
that has changed little in 1,000 years _ have imposed an
interpretation of Islamic law that punishes adulterers and
homosexuals with death by stoning. Thieves have their hands cut off
on Friday afternoons, an event customarily announced the night
before so thousands can witness severe justice in a soccer stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Women and girls have been barred from work and school, their
aspirations secreted away like messages in bottles. In the few
circumstances when women are allowed out of doors, they must wear
burkas, a head-to-toe garment with only a mesh of material at eye
level to peer through.
</P>
<P>
   In villages, where three-quarters of Afghanistan's 15 million to
20 million people live, the Taliban's religious dictates have
brought little change. Few girls have ever gone to school; women
covered their faces even as they worked in the fields. But in
cities like Kabul and Herat, Western and secular ideas had taken
hold, and the new restraints are stifling.
</P>
<P>
   In private conversations, complaints against the Taliban easily
spill out, though they are often accompanied by varying sums of
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Taliban, this country belonged to warlords, and the
simple act of going to visit my village was an impossibility,''
said a U.N. official who is Afghan. ``My daughters sit in the house
and cry to me: We want education. This is a heartbreak, but peace
is the first priority for people here. The Taliban must be given
credit for accomplishing this.''
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan, so often at the crossroads of history, has suffered
20 years of combat, including an occupation by the Soviet army and
then a civil war among the Muslim holy warriors who threw them out.
Kabul itself is hopelessly scarred, its water and sanitation
systems in ruin. Buildings are freckled with bullet holes _ or
entirely torn open by rockets. Spent artillery shells are sometimes
used as highway dividers. Hundreds of thousands have fled.
</P>
<P>
   After a remarkable string of victories, the Taliban marched into
Kabul two years ago. Their movement had been born in Islamic
schools favored by refugees and the poor. Strict Islamic codes,
applied with the confidence of absolute truth, were seen as a way
to cleanse a wayward country. Worldly Kabul was a special target
for Taliban reformation.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the violence that had come with anarchy was
replaced with a less capricious brutishness dictated by religion _
a tradeoff many were ready to accept. The Taliban were harsh
occupiers, but they were not brigands. They did not loot and rape.
</P>
<P>
   THE KORAN: WHAT DOES ALLAH THINK OF ELVIS?
</P>
<P>
   Taliban leaders argue that the world has been so busy condemning
their social beliefs that their restoration of social order has
been slighted. Al-Haj Maulavi Qalamuddin, the religion minister, is
tired of hearing about the oppression of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a country on fire, the world wants to give a match,'' he
said, his thumb at work on a strand of brown prayer beads. ``Why is
there such concern about women? Bread costs too much. There is no
work. Even boys are not going to school. And yet all I hear about
are women. Where was the world when men here were violating any
woman they wanted?''
</P>
<P>
   It is Qalamuddin, acting in his capacity as head of the General
Department for the Preservation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice,
who enforces religious laws. Cruising the streets in pickup trucks,
his men fly a white flag of purity while also carrying Kalashnikov
rifles and shoulder-fired, rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   A measure of the effectiveness of these moral vigilantes is the
declining need for them. At the risk of a severe thrashing, few
women would any longer chance being seen without a burka. Men shy
away from forbidden fun, like flying kites or playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, new dictates are always being announced, the latest one
forbidding male tailors to take a woman's measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the mandatory growing of beards began to be more
stringently enforced. Some men, though dutifully sprouting
whiskers, had kept them trimmed. The Prophet Mohammed never tidied
his beard, the Taliban explain. Violators are locked up for 10 days
of religious instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions, too, are being eliminated. Stores cannot sell them;
people cannot play them. For a while, the Taliban were going door
to door to confiscate TVs, but this practice was stopped a few
weeks ago when it was discovered that Taliban pretenders had been
doing the same thing as an easy way to obtain an expensive
appliance.
</P>
<P>
   Surreptitious video-watching inevitably goes on. ``We realize
that television can be used to propagate good, but negative
television is more popular,'' said Qalamuddin, a powerful-looking
man with the shape of a kettle stove. ``Only one in 100 cassettes
we confiscate are good. The rest are Indian movies and outright
pornography, and these are polluters of the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Music is banned as hedonistic, though tape players are still
available, their use intended only for approved recordings.
Something that might be called Taliban rap _ prayerful chants
without instrumentation _ is deemed acceptable. A typical lyric is:
``Do not kill the flowers of the mosque. Do not kill the words of
the Koran. Do not kill the Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   Music appreciation is not an offense that leads to jail.
Contraband cassettes are merely confiscated, the unspooled tape
then hung from trees and telephone wires.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why people continue to take the risk. Hamid Gul,
18, said he plays his Elvis Presley recordings, careful to keep the
volume low. Hamayun Ahmed, a driver, replaces his cassette of
Pushtun pop with Taliban rap each time he approaches a checkpoint
or toll booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban are too religious for me, but they have stopped
the thefts and the killings,'' Ahmed said. ``Maybe someday they
will also figure out how to supply some food.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelter, food, even schools for girls: these things will all
come in time, promised Maulavi Saeed Ahmad, the deputy minister of
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have suspended, not ended, school for girls,'' he said.
``The Koran is the same for males and females, though one must
understand that there are certain injunctions when it comes to
women.''
</P>
<P>
   School curriculums, whether for boys or girls, are matters that
must wait for all fighting to stop. ``We are in a state of war now,
but when this is over, all the mullahs will meet night and day and
formulate these policies,'' said Maulavi Ahmad, who occupies an
important post for someone only 28. ``In the meantime, the world
must be patient with us. We are not fanatics. We are people of
principle, not fanaticism.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he described himself as a man of everyday
concerns, the father of a 4-year-old boy. ``And I pray to God that
he grants me 20 more sons,'' he said hopefully. ``That is my wish
from Allah, that I am given this many sons and may they all die as
martyrs.''

TAIWAN MOUNTS PR OFFENSIVE ON EVE OF TALKS WITH BEIJING

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Deep in the corridors of Taiwan's Mainland
Affairs Council, faceless bureaucrats have been busily tabulating
lists of insults and injuries, faxes and phone calls, homicides and
other hostilities _ for use in a simmering public relations war
with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   They've determined, for example, that while Taiwan approved 205
separate measures over the past decade aimed at relaxing tensions
with mainland China, the communists broke 25 promises, rejected 114
pleas for cooperation and failed to answer 14 phone calls and 11
faxes from Taipei officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Taipei's statisticians found that Taiwanese
businessmen on the mainland were the victims of 27 murders, five
accidents, 44 assaults, 28 kidnappings and 29 disappearances.
</P>
<P>
   These and dozens of other seemingly arcane statistics and
analyses are part of a Taiwanese public relations offensive in
advance of a resumption of high-level contacts between Taipei and
Beijing beginning Friday in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's top political envoy, Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation, will meet in Shanghai with his Beijing
counterpart, Wang Daohan. It will be their first meeting since
1993. The 1993 talks, held in Singapore, were the first open
contact between Taipei and Beijing since the communists won control
of the mainland in 1949 and drove the Nationalists into exile on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Koo and Wang were preparing for a second meeting in mid-1995
when Beijing froze all talks and launched a year of war games in
the Taiwan Strait in retaliation for a high-profile visit to the
United States by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
   Relations have improved in recent months, leading to the
agreement to meet next week. But the two sides have different
expectations for the meeting. Beijing is pressing Taiwan to agree
to political negotiations on reunifiction and wants an agreement to
inaugurate direct postal, shipping and air services.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials, however, say there will be no political
discussions and are portraying the first meeting as more form than
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will warm up and improve the atmosphere,'' said Chong-Pin
Lin, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council in Taipei. ``The
very act of meeting will have that affect.''
</P>
<P>
   Lin dismissed Beijing's calls for political talks on
reunification, saying the two sides first had to determine how to
handle issues that had been agreed upon for discussion in the
previous talks. Those issues included fishing disputes, joint
efforts to combat crime, and the protection of Taiwanese business
people working in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that the meeting will regularize normal
communications,'' Lin told a small group of visiting American
journalists. ``We hope this will set in motion preparations for
future consultations.''
</P>
<P>
   If Beijing wants to make progress in the talks, Lin added, it
should renounce its longstanding policy of refusing to rule out
force for the recovery of Taiwan. Beijing, which considers the
island a renegade province, says it will invade if Taiwan tries to
declare independence.
</P>
<P>
   The mainland government has become increasingly alarmed over the
rising popularity of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive
Party in Taiwan. In local elections last November, the DPP for the
first time outpolled the Kuomintang Party, which had ruled the
island since Gen. Chiang Kai-shek and his forces fled there in
1949. It is also expected to mount a strong showing in legislative
elections in December.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the party's growing popularity was a major factor
in Beijing's decision to return to the talks and to mount a
full-court press against Taiwan's efforts for more international
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DPP won 12 of 23 positions in the local elections and it
scared the life out of them in Beijing,'' said Julian Baum, Taipei
correspondent for the Far Eastern Economic Review. ``Beijing is
getting more sophisticated and now wants to win diplomatically and
politically what it failed to win by war in 1949.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, President Lee's government says Taiwan's destiny
must be determined by its 21 million people. Polls show most are
opposed to reunification with China until the mainland becomes
democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great majority of our people support maintenance of the
status quo,'' said foreign ministry spokesman Roy Wu. ``Status quo
for the time being means we will decide later _ either toward
independence or toward reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu dismissed Beijing's proposal for a Hong Kong-style ``one
country, two systems'' reunification policy for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Taiwan will not accept one country, two
systems,'' he said. ``We prefer one country, one good system. That
means freedom, democracy and respect for human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wu and other officials said, Taiwan will
continue its uphill struggle for international recognition and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   But it can expect strong opposition from Beijing, which views
any effort by Taiwan for international recognition as one more step
toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   During the more than three years since the last cross-strait
talks were suspended, Beijing cranked up its international campaign
to further isolate Taiwan diplomatically and to portray the island
as obstinate and uncooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, at least eight countries have broken diplomatic
relations with Taiwan in favor of Beijing, Wu said. Taipei now has
official ties with only 27 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Correspondent Baum said Beijing is exerting tremendous pressure
on governments and organizations that have ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Top Taiwan officials can't go anywhere,'' he said. ``China is
really playing hardball and it's been very tough on Taiwan's
international status.''

BUSINESS, CONSUMER MEASURES GET SHORT SHRIFT IN 105TH CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite a Republican Congress and a president who
often embraces corporate America, many of business's top priorities
are headed for the graveyard as Congress winds up its work for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest likely casualty: a sweeping overhaul of banking,
brokerage and and insurance laws, which would have updated
Depression-era regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Business lobbyists considered it a huge accomplishment to line
up the major players from all three industries behind the bill.
Squabbling among banks, brokerages and insurance firms had killed
similar measures about a dozen times over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, the Senate returned the bill to committee and
declared it all but dead, due to opposition from Senator Phil
Gramm, Republican of Texas. ``It's mostly dead,'' said David Pratt
of the American Insurance Association. ``There's one `Hail Mary
pass' left that might work, one 100-yard bomb play.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeat of the financial services bill would not be the only big
loss by big business this session. The Senate Friday approved
legislation that would encourage the United States to take action
against countries that engage in religious persecution. Businesses
fear the bill would lead to economic sanctions against more
countries, which they say are ineffective and harmful to US
companies.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton seems likely to veto a bill that would make it
harder for consumers to escape their debts by filing for
bankuprtcy. Credit card companies, department stores and other
lenders had ushered the bill through both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, lawmakers are considering a tax bill that is far
smaller and far less beneficial to business than many lobbyists had
hoped. And just three weeks ago, lawmakers denied President Clinton
so-called ``fast track'' powers to negotiate new trade treaties,
which most big businsses say are vital to opening new export
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I have a pro-business Republican majority, I don't
have enough votes to get done what I'd like to get done,'' said
Bruce Josten, chief lobbyist for the US Chamber of Commerce, one of
the largest business lobbies. ``I need more votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, who oppose big business on may issues, said the
105th Congress did little for them, either. ``This was not a
consumer-friendly Congress, not at all,'' said Frank Torres,
legislative counsel at Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   In short, both business and consumer groups said their biggest
victories in the two-year session came by playing defense, killing
off proposals that their opponents had proposed. Amid the Monica
Lewinsky scandal and talk of impeachment, both sides found it hard
to go on the offensive and push big new initiatives through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, for example, mourned the death of the ``Patient
Bill of Rights,'' which would have imposed broad new regulations on
health-maintenance organizations. Business lobbyist Josten,
meanwhile, said blocking the health bill was one of his top
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   And while Josten was sorry that the bankruptcy bill faced a
likely veto, Consumers Union considered that prospect a big win for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, business claimed its accomplishments in the 105th
Congress. An increase in the number of skilled, foreign workers
admitted to the United States each year seems likely to become law.
High-tech firms said they needed more foreigners because the tight
US job market made it hard to find skilled computer workers, but
unions and other worker groups said the measure would merely
depress US wages.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses also supported a moratorium on new taxes on goods
bought or sold over the Internet, which the Senate approved
Thursday. A similar version has passed the House, and President
Clinton has said he would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Several major business issues are not yet resolved, though their
fate will likely be known by the end of the weekend. Congress is
scrambling to finish work on major legislation so that lawmakers
can return home for the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist of timing, the new hurdles to the financial
services overhaul arose only one day after the merger of Citicorp
and Travelers Group Inc. became final.
</P>
<P>
   That merger, which formed the world's largest financial services
company, created momentum for the financial services bill when it
was was announced last April. The new company, called Citigroup
Inc., brings banking, securities, insurance and other financial
services under one roof. But under current law, which dates to
1933, no single company can offer all those services.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Congress said that the merger showed that the market
has moved faster than the lawmakers. The said Congress must update
the banking laws so that US companies could form the same kind of
financial-service supermarkets that are common in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with existing law, Citigroup could divest of insurance
underwriting businesses or seek to be regulated under a different
type of bank charter. The company has five years to comply with
existing laws _ enough time, perhaps, for Conress to change the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Morris, a Citigroup spokesman, said the company had no
comment Friday on the bill, ``certainly not about its demise,
because it is not dead.'' The financial services overhaul could be
revived if Gramm removes his opposition. Gramm has said he wants
the bill to limit the scope of the Community Reinvestment Act,
which requires banks to meet the credit needs of communities where
they do business, because he believes community groups abuse the
law.
</P>
<P>
   Also yet to be resolved is whether Congress will agree to $18
billion in funding for the International Monetary Fund, and whether
it will approve a package of tax cuts.

VICTIM OF CHERNOBYL BACK IN THE US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GLORIA NEGRI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In late September, as autumn was turning to winter in
north central Europe, Alexei Anatolevich Saponchikov, a victim of
the Chernobyl nuclear fallout, returned to the orphanage for
disabled children in Belarus that had been his home for so long.
</P>
<P>
   When they heard his car approaching, the 130 children who live
at the orphanage rushed to the windows to welcome their friend back
from America. Some on crutches hobbled out to greet him.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-old Alexei, who is called ``Alosha'' and still
struggles with the juvenile arthritis and severely stunted growth
that plague him as a result of the radiation spread across Europe
by the Chernobyl explosion in the Ukraine in 1986, cried with
excitement to see his old friends.
</P>
<P>
   But his joy was mixed with pain over the realization that he
might, again, be back for good at the orphanage where he was taken
a dozen years ago after his mother abandoned him when he was 11
months old. After 15 months in the United States, Alosha's
immigration papers had expired.
</P>
<P>
   The boy _ who weighs about 40 pounds and stands just 38 inches
tall _ held firmly to the hand of Daniel Joyce, the man who had
become his surrogate father and accompanied him to Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce made the bittersweet journey with Alosha not only because
he loves him, but to see Belarus and US officials about remedying
insufficient documentation to allow Alosha to stay in the states
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing was certain when we started out,'' Joyce said this
week about their trip to Belarus. ``Alosha knew we were trying our
best to get him to come back, ``but that it was a chance and he
accepted that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chernobyl Children Project in Hingham, Mass. paid for their
flight to Belarus. At first, Joyce and Alosha stayed with Alosha's
doctor in Gomel, about an hour's drive from the orphanage. Alosha
visited with his girlfriend, Lena, and with Max, a Chernobyl victim
with thyroid cancer, who had stayed with the Joyces with him. Then,
the orphanage director drove them to the only home Alosha had known
until last year.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 days, Joyce, 39, the director of systems support at
Fidelity Investments in Boston, stayed at the orphanage with
Alosha, sleeping on a couch and making two 16-hour overland
journeys to Minsk, the Belarus capital, to see Belarus and US
officials about Alosha's documentation.
</P>
<P>
   He returned with a six-month medical visa for Alosha to return
to this country and said that a more permanent arrangement will
take ``anywhere from two to three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Alosha's apprehension at returning to Belarus was not that the
people at the orphanage treated him badly. On the contrary, they
cared for him well, allowing him to come to Boston in the summer of
1997 for respite and medical treatment with 83 other Chernobyl
victims under a program sponsored by the Chernobyl Children
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the orphanage and the governments of Belarus and the
United States gave permission for Alosha to extend his stay for
medical treatment for his many orthopedic ailments related to his
arthritis, unavailable in Belarus. He also had dental surgery for
seriously rotted teeth.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 months, Alosha has been living just outside
Boston, at the Milton home of Dan and Janet Joyce and their three
sons, Dan, 15, Doug, 12, and Ryan, 8. There, he has experienced a
sense of family for the first time in his tragic life.
</P>
<P>
   With an impish smile almost as broad as he is, Alosha has stolen
the hearts of all who've met him. His ailments and severe joint
deformities have prevented him from growing beyond his 38-inch
frame.
</P>
<P>
   What was to have been a summer's stay in 1997 was extended after
the Joyces and doctors at The Floating Hospital for Children at New
England Medical Center, which gives free medical treatment to the
Chernobyl children, convinced the governments of Belarus and the
United States how vital such treatment was for Alosha.
</P>
<P>
   Bordered by Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, Belarus won
independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. It is still a
very poor country with medical supplies in short supply. Joyce was
stunned at what he saw at the orphanage, ``badly burned children,
some with birth defects, broken legs, epilepsy.''
</P>
<P>
   On his recent return there, Alosha was knocked down by children
rushing to a meal and the femur of his left leg was broken. ``They
don't have any facilities there,'' Joyce recalled this week. ``So,
we made a splint with sticks and clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Alosha is back in Milton now and waiting for the next chapter of
his life to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is in a cast and on crutches, he continues to go
on a bus to the Glover School, working at a fifth-grade level.
While he needed an intrepreter when he first arrived, he now speaks
English without a trace of a Russian accent, and has forgotten some
of his native language.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny as Alosha is, he horses around with the Joyce sons as if he
were 6 feet tall. Now, the brothers vie over who is going to carry
him around the house while he wears the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, in anticipation of Halloween, Alosha donned a
magician's top hat and hammed it up for a photographer. Around his
neck he wore a cross that the Joyces had given him. He will always
love them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the time he has been here, Alosha has had his first-ever
birthday party at 13, grew to love chicken, and sang Russian folk
songs at karaoke nights. He is an extrovert.
</P>
<P>
   Though his diminutive size first attracts, it is Alosha's blue
eyes that arrest. Even while he is trying to be a flippant
teenager, they harbor a deep melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   With his major physical problems, Alosha knows his medical
future is uncertain. His medications, alone, Joyce said, cost about
$235 a month. The Joyces are planning a fund-raiser on Nov. 14 to
help meet Alosha's needs.
</P>
<P>
   But, Alosha still flashes his dimpled smile that moves so many
to tears. The Delta Air Lines crew that flew him and Joyce free
from New York to Boston last week were among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing Alosha has given us,'' Dan Joyce said, ``is
the sense of hope and love he has, in spite of the fact that he
grew up in such poverty and hardship.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

needs may do so sending checks to The Alosha Fund: US Trust, Box

   FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Undated) - If the NFL ever wanted to retreat
into a fantasy world, this would be a good time. The No Fun League
was especially so Sunday. In Phoenix, where our TV games are chosen
by sadistic network weasels, we were treated to the Jets-Dolphins
punt-a-thon and the ultimate atomic stink bomb: Philadelphia at
Denver. Now I'm not saying the Eagles gave up in the second half.
They gave up in the first half. At one point, the Philadelphia
secondary was actually playing hacky sack. By BILL MULLER. Story

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Rocked by its worst harvest in 45 years and a
plummeting ruble, Russia appealed Friday for relief aid from the
European Union. It has also approached the United States and Canada
for help.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov broached the question of relief
at a meeting Friday with Jacques Santer, the president of the
European Union. ``There has been a request for humanitarian aid,''
a spokeswoman for Santer said. ``There are no details yet.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said the Russians had begun to sound out
the United States and Canada about arranging shipments of food.
``They have told us they want to talk to us about what is
possible,'' the official said. ``They are looking at the
acquisition of grains and other commodity supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Russian officials are still trying to figure out how much
help they need, there is no mystery about why the Kremlin is
asking. Russia is being pushed to the brink, anxiously facing a
harsh winter and fearful that it may lack the food, medicine and
power to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Food is a big worry, a result of bad luck, bad agriculture and a
collapsing economy. Western experts say Russia may have enough to
survive the winter but that the country's reserves will be
dangerously depleted by the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's production of grain is way down, mainly the result of
this summer's drought in the Volga River and Ural regions.
</P>
<P>
   But the downturn also reflects the nation's sorry experience
with agriculture, which has been slow to reform since the breakup
of the Soviet Union. Outdated farm equipment, the result of a lack
of investment, as well as inadequate supplies of fertilizer and
deficient storage have also contributed to the bad harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's grain harvest this year will reach about 52 million
tons, down from 88 million tons last year, according to a new
projection by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That would make
it the worst harvest since 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle inventories and other livestock have also declined, a
consequence of shrinking supplies of feed grain.
</P>
<P>
   Aggravating the problem, Russia's financial crisis has led to
sharp cutbacks in food imports. Russia has imported about half of
the food it has consumed in recent years, making the recent falloff
in imports especially serious.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about 15 ships full of frozen poultry from the U.S.
have delayed unloading their cargo because payment has not been
made and Russia's creditworthiness is now in question.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Russian government has issued assurances that
there will be sufficient food to get through the winter. A senior
Agriculture Ministry official said Friday that he did not
anticipate the need for emergency imports of grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``With last year's carry-over of 20 million tons, the grain
balance is such that there will be no need for centralized
purchases,'' Vyacheslav Chernoivanov, the deputy agriculture and
food minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, Russian officials have already begun to
discuss food shipments.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said that the Russians had talked informally
about obtaining 3 million tons of wheat, 1.5 million tons of corn,
500,000 tons of soy meal and 100,000 tons of meat. Speculation
about U.S. food shipments to Russia has driven up commodity
futures.
</P>
<P>
   Other U.S. officials said, however, that the total size of the
Russian request is unclear and that the Kremlin is still trying to
figure out what it may need.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear how the shipments would be financed or how
much the cash-poor Russians can afford to pay for themselves. U.S.
officials are considering a number of ways to help, including soft
loans and outright grants of food.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Closer to home, Russia has suggested that Belarus and Ukraine
repay their debts for shipments of Russian natural gas by providing
food instead of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of replenishing hard currency reserves Russia will be
receiving foodstuffs and will eat them up,'' the newspaper
Kommersant observed wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov and his new coalition government have promised other
steps, as well. To ease the way for imports, Russia is considering
abolishing import duties on meat, butter, grain and other food.
</P>
<P>
   It is giving the agricultural industry five years to repay debts
to the state budget. It is also allowing Russian regions to pay
some of their debts with deliveries of food.
</P>
<P>
   Russia consumes about 70 million tons of grain a year, of which
22 million tons is used for food products. The rest is used largely
for cattle feed and seed.
</P>
<P>
   Grain, however, may play an increasingly larger role in the
Russian diet as Russians substitute bread for high-priced meat.
</P>
<P>
   A paradoxical result of Russia's disastrous harvest is that the
quality of the grain has improved. Experts say the dry summer made
the grain more suitable for milling.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's looming food shortage is hardly the only humanitarian
issue here. The financial crisis has also interfered with the
import of medicines, many of which are produced abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The socioeconomic crisis has hit all aspects of the health
system, stopping us from doing our job,'' Vladimir Starodubov, the
new health minister, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the general problem that is crippling all aspects
of the society: a debilitating shortage of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Tax collection is down, and Primakov acknowledged Friday that he
had no idea where the money would come from to fund the
government's budget for the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is still holding out hope that it can persuade the
International Monetary Fund to distribute billions in more aid.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF does not give money on humanitarian grounds. It is
looking for signs that Primakov is prepared to advance market
reforms. And the government's absence of an economic program and
its talk of printing money to pay back wages has not comforted the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the sources will be for financing the
government program which is being worked out,'' Primakov said.

DOW AND NASDAQ RALLY TO END A TURBULENT WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market rallied Friday, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq index jumping 5.2 percent and the Dow Jones
industrial average climbing 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that rebound only added to the lore of the week that was _
five days of trading frenzies in stocks, bonds and dollars that
will be the talk of Wall Street for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what was so striking was that it was not just one market
that went wild this week: The dollar plunged 13.8 percent against
the Japanese yen, its biggest decline in 27 years; the yield on the
30-year bond, after falling to a 31-year low of 4.72 percent on
Monday, hammered bonds by surging back to 5.12 percent. And then
there was the stock market. The Nasdaq dropped 7.6 percent despite
Friday's rally. The Dow moved in a 450-point trading range during
the turbulent week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit in awe at it,'' said Charles Clough Jr., chief
investment strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., of the week's
volatility. ``We've never had moves like this.''
</P>
<P>
   And Abby Joseph Cohen, the market strategist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., admitted that the volatility added to the jitters that had
left many on Wall Street walking on eggshells. When prices ``jump
around quite a bit and jump out of their normal pattern, people get
nervous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There are always winners and losers in markets, but the focus in
this time of global financial uncertainty is going to be on the
losers.
</P>
<P>
   One, according to people familiar with the fund, is Tiger
Management LLC, the hedge fund run by Julian Robertson, which is
said to have lost nearly $2 billion when the yen rallied against
the dollar and the Tokyo stock market rose. Tiger Management had a
large bet that both the Japanese yen and some Japanese stocks would
fall. But his fund is still up about 10 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Another loser may be the U.S. economy. It is clear already that
this volatility is contributing to the decisions of thousands of
investors to cut back on riskier companies. Bankers are also
talking about becoming more cautious, making it harder for
businesses to grow.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday, the Dow rose 167.61 points, to 7,899.52,
finishing the week up almost 115 points, or 1.5 percent. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks rose 24.95 points, or 2.6
percent, to 984.39, down 1.8 percent for the week. The Nasdaq index
jumped 73.37 points, to 1,492.49.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was led by the stocks that had been pummeled earlier
in the week and were now seen as bargains to many investors.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign stock markets also rallied, with the Financial Times 100
index up 2.7 percent in London, the CAC 40 index up 4.5 percent in
Paris and the DAX 30 index up 2.3 percent in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S. bond market, government securities sold off for the
fourth consecutive day, with the yield on the 30-year bond jumping
from 4.99 percent on Thursday to 5.12 percent. The price, which
moves in the opposite direction, fell 1 29/32, to 105 23/32.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreign exchange market, the dollar continued to fall
against the yen, dropping 1.8 percent, to 116.95 yen from 119.05
yen. That was a big drop for a normal day, but almost stabilizing
after the 8.1 percent plunge on Wednesday. The dollar was little
changed against the German mark, slipping to 1.6363 marks from
1.6375.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market was led higher Friday by Microsoft, up 5 11/16,
to 96 7/8; Intel, up 5 3/8, to 83 13/16; Dell Computer, up 4 3/8,
to 52 13/16; and Cisco Systems, up 3 3/8, to 50 1/16. The four
stocks accounted for about half of the rise in the Nasdaq index.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Money center banks rose for the second day. That sector has been
among the hardest hit since the stock market reached its peak in
July. Despite the cumulative 8 percent rally in the last two days,
the S&AMP;P index of big banks is off 40 percent since July 17. J.P.
Morgan, which was one of the Dow leaders, rose 4}, to 84 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer of First Albany
Corp., said the rally on Friday, after all the volatility, added up
to ``a modestly positive week.'' But he quickly checked his
optimism: ``It may be a head fake,'' he said. ``We have had so many
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The selloff in the foreign exchange market, traders said, was
caused by hedge funds and other institutions as they reversed
trades that had been originally based on the idea of borrowing
money cheaply in Japan to put at work at higher rates in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   That unwinding, spurred by fears that a higher yen would make
many of those deals unprofitable, accelerated this week as the
dollar fell through the 130 level and turned a lot of positions
into losses.
</P>
<P>
   That helter-skelter rush for the exits also pushed bond prices
down. To pay off their yen loans, traders had to sell U.S. bonds,
pushing both bond prices and the value of the dollar lower.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the bond market was the reversal of trades by
funds owning mortgage-backed securities. For several weeks, as
interest rates fell, managers of funds owning mortgages abandoned
those securities because they feared that lots of homeowners would
refinance at lower rates. When that happens, fund managers rush to
buy 10-year Treasury notes to keep their cash invested.
</P>
<P>
   But when interest rates began to rise this week, fund managers
reversed those positions, selling 10-year Treasuries to buy higher
yielding mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the wild swings, it is no surprise that some investors
just threw up their hands and put their money in three- and
six-month Treasury bills. ``Everyone is shifting into the short
end,'' said Michael Cloherty, market strategist at Credit Suisse
First Boston. That's ``where the real haven is.''

ON A ROLL, ARMSTRONG GEARED UP FOR WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While one American _ Bobby Julich _ decided to pull out of this
week's world championship race in the Nethlerlands, another _ Lance
Armstrong _ was raring to go. Which reflects the way the racing
season has gone for the two riders. Both had successes, but they
peaked at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who missed all of the 1997 season when he was
diagnosed with testicular cancer and subsequently underwent
chemotherapy, got back on this bike &UR;  &LR; last spring, not sure how he
would fare. He was hot at first but then dropped out of a European
race on a wet and windy day in March, and when he came back, he
``didn't unpack my bike for four weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he did unpack it, he was on a roll. Armstrong finished
second in the national road race in Philadalphia in early July, won
the Cascade stage race in Orgeon later that month, and was on his
way. By late summer, when he returned to Europe, he finished fourth
in the Tour of Holland stage race and fourth in last month's Tour
of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Julich, on the other hand, geared his spring racing to getting
in shape for the Tour de France. It worked, and he placed third in
the three-week race, the best finish by an American since Greg
LeMond won his third title in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he acknowledged, he's tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a long season,'' he said by phone earlier this
week in a conference call. ``I'm tired, since I've just been going
nonstop; I think I'll go home (to Philadelphia) and take a break.''
</P>
<P>
   The worlds, he said, ``are something that you want to be 100
percent top form, and I've not been feeling so good, so I've
withdrawn myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the event, Armstrong, who won the world road race in
1993, said he was ready for tomorrow's 162-mile road race and the
time trial, in which he placed fourth, although he does wish the
championships were earlier in the season. ``It's really an event
that shouldn't be in October,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 27, has been as surprised as anyone with his success
this season. ``I had no idea,'' he said. ``If somebody were to tell
me at the beginning, I would have said you were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But now he's certain he's back on track. ``I feel like a
professional cyclist again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he's determined to keep biking in a perspective that he
didn't have before. ``It's a good balance I have now; before, it
wasn't quite there,'' he said. ``Before, I was putting too much
pressure on myself. Now the emphasis is just on doing my best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to look at things anymore in terms of winning;
that's too lofty. I just want to look at it as just being there and
contending.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who plans to ride the Tour de France next year, also
hopes to ride some mountain bike races in 1999 and might try out
for the Olympic team for mountiain bikes as well as road bikes in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Armstrong, the men's road race team for the world
championships includes pro champion and Killington stage race
winner George Hincapie, Trent Klaska, Chann McRade, Chris Horner,
Christian Van de Velde, Chris Homer, Dylan Casey, David Clinger,
and Jonathan Vaughters.
</P>
<P>
   The women's team will include Dede Demet, Mari Holden, Karen
Kurreck, Elizabeth Emery, Emily Robbins, Pam Schuster, Kendra
Wenzel, and Julie Young.
</P>
<P>
   The men's under-23 team includes two New Englanders _ Tom Davis
from Mashpee, Mass. and Justin Spinelli from Nashua, N.H.

COMMENTARY: THE CYBER DONALD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No trophy wives. No gaudy Rolexes, Julian Schnabel paintings or
custom-made Armani suits. No Gordon Gekkos, Sherman McCoys, Donald
Trumps. The 1990s model of high-flying self-made zillionaire, we've
been repeatedly told, is as different from his 1980s predecessor as
a fully loaded Jeep is from a Porsche. Instead of vulgar Reagan-era
barbarians at the gate, we're getting dressed-down microgeeks who
don't know or care how much money they have and are so busy
dispensing utopia to the entire globe through technology that they
don't have time to lord their good fortune over us peons who can't
install a printer without crashing Windows.
</P>
<P>
   But as I stood in front of a glass cabinet at Draeger's in San
Mateo, just south of San Francisco, recently, I wondered. Draeger's
is the lush Silicon Valley supermarket where you can buy not only
all the healthy foods you want but choose from a dizzying array of
brandies and cigars to finish off that abstemious meal. In this
locked cabinet were small bottles of balsamic vinegar that cost
more than those vials of coke Wall Street traders were snorting in
the '80s. Is it progress that our new rich can turn salad dressing
into a status symbol?
</P>
<P>
   Standing there with my nose pressed against the glass, I
realized it was only a matter of time before the culture would stop
lionizing our '90s tycoons and turn on them, much as it did on
their prototypes of the go-go '80s. All it takes to grease the
skids is a steep decline in the stock market (both Tom Wolfe's
``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' and Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street''
took off in post-crash '87) and an ugly, protracted battle between
the government and a corporation synonymous with the era's
accumulation of money and power (Drexel then, Microsoft now).
</P>
<P>
   It also helps if some celebrity member of the freshly minted
zillionaire class presents himself to the public as the
personification of arrogant, self-infatuated plutocracy _ and last
week the '90s may have finally got just the cyber-Trump it's been
asking for. The Wall Street Journal revealed that Nathan Myhrvold,
the 39-year-old chief technology officer of Microsoft, is not only
starring in ads promoting the joys of owning a private Gulfstream
jet but is also the ``Anonymous'' who wrote a lengthy firsthand
account in Vanity Fair of spending $12 million for his own first
Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
   The piece and ad both ran in October's ``New Establishment''
issue, in which Myhrvold, often described as Bill Gates'
intellectual guru, was rated No. 23 in the list of top moguls of
the Information Age. ``At the Davos, Switzerland, powerfest,'' the
magazine notes, ``the organizers put him on a panel with Elie
Wiesel and Desmond Tutu.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to imagine Wiesel or Tutu touting their Nobel
Prizes _ as Myhrvold does his advanced degrees from Cambridge and
Princeton in the Gulfstream ad _ to endorse so much as a Subaru.
But the ad is just a warm-up for Myhrvold's article, a New Age
hybrid of consumerist pornography and let-'em-eat-cake memoir.
``I've bought a lot of big-ticket items in my day, from real estate
to publicly traded companies,'' the author writes while coyly
introducing us to such pals as ``one famously parsimonious
billionaire'' and `` `C,' a billionaire known for his Zen-like
affinity for solitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest we think Myhrvold is frivolous, he sternly warns us that
``your life is on the line'' when shopping for this particular
big-ticket item: ``Buy a bad plane and you could be dead.'' Lest we
think a $12 million jet is a wasteful extravagance, he points out
that ``in bulk,'' jet fuel ``is actually cheaper than Diet Coke,''
and adds up how much of his precious time he'll save once he need
no longer cool his heels waiting for connecting commercial flights
in first-class lounges. Lest we confuse him with '80s-style
potentates like investment bankers _ whom he labels ``high-rent,
hired-gun slimeballs'' _ he pours on Princeton-Cambridge literary
allusions unknown to Nasdaq: Virgil and Dante and ``The Remains of
the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   But actually Myhrvold's prose resembles no writer's so much as
that of Sinclair Lewis _ minus, alas, the irony. Rhapsodizing over
his new plane, the Microsoft mogul writes in dead earnest: ``Each
tiny detail _ the satin chrome finish on the cabinet latches, the
edge work in the lavatory, the memory foam in the seats _ reveals
fresh marvels.'' He might as well be Babbitt, the go-getting
real-estate man of Zenith, a fictional 1920s equivalent to our
Seattle and Silicon Valley, as he hyperventilates over every
fixture in his ``altogether royal bathroom of porcelain and glazed
tile and metal sleek as silver.'' Though separated by decades, both
are bloated products of a boom on the eve of a bust.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Garth Drabinsky watched the world premiere of
``Fosse: A Celebration in Song and Dance'' in August, he knew the
stakes were high. The entertainment company he had founded _ Livent
Inc., based in Toronto _ had struggled for months to pay its bills.
Its credit was so poor that its bonds were considered junk.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian impresario didn't just need a hit; he needed a
megahit. Drabinsky had spent three years working out the details
for the opening of ``Fosse'' that Sunday night in Toronto, pushing
himself, he said later, to his physical limits.
</P>
<P>
   And for a few hours, at least, his work seemed to have paid off.
Roy Furman, Livent's new chief executive, told Drabinsky at the
premiere that ``Fosse'' would be ``a spectacular asset'' for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   What Drabinsky did not know was that at a secret meeting earlier
that evening, Furman and Livent's corporate directors had planned
Drabinsky's ouster, suspecting that he had helped inflate profits
by millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, locksmiths would change the lock on his office,
where he kept not only Livent documents but also piles of private
papers. And newly hired security guards would memorize his photo
and take up stations at the company's entrances with orders to keep
him out.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky's famously lavish spending had suddenly caught up with
him and the company he created in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In June, cash troubles had forced him to turn over control of
Livent to Michael Ovitz, former president of Walt Disney Co., in
return for a $20 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Robert B. Webster, one of the new executives hired by
Ovitz, was startled when he found the Livent accountants reluctant
to talk to him. In a court affidavit, Webster said he became
``greatly concerned'' when some of the accountants told him that
Drabinsky had warned them not to provide certain financial
information until the producer had reviewed and approved it.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Thursday, Aug. 6 _ three days before the ``Fosse''
premiere _ five accountants gave Webster details that, he said,
``cast doubt upon the veracity and accuracy'' of the company's
books.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky has refused repeated requests for an interview, and
Ovitz and his team have provided little information on what they
call ``accounting irregularities.'' But details about the dispute
have emerged in papers that are part of a lawsuit Drabinsky filed
last month against KPMG, the giant accounting firm, which is
conducting a forensic investigation into the accounting
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky won a small victory in the case this week when the
judge said the producer might review the accountants' investigative
report before they gave it to Ovitz. Livent's new managers have
said the suit is a desperate attempt to delay the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Livent's board have said privately that
Drabinsky kept two sets of books for expenses like advertising _
hiding, in the official set, some of his extravagant spending by
shifting it to other accounts. He kept a separate list, they said,
of the actual advertisements for each show.
</P>
<P>
   After the ``Fosse'' premiere on Aug. 9, the cast and company
employees celebrated at an opening-night party. Drabinsky, by his
account, left early to help edit a television commercial for the
show, which he did until 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky had been home only a few hours when Furman called at
5:30 a.m., telling him he was suspended and summoning him to an
8:30 a.m. meeting at the offices of the company's lawyers. There,
Furman and other executives warned him to stay away from Livent's
premises. Drabinsky's partner, Myron Gottlieb, was also suspended.
</P>
<P>
   According to Webster's affidavit, Drabinsky admitted at that
meeting that he was aware of the accounting irregularities, but
said he thought they were balanced out by the tens of millions of
dollars that Livent had written off in late 1997 and early 1998.
Webster said, however, that those write-downs had no connection to
the irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Webster said in the affidavit that the irregularities ``will
ultimately be shown to have been known to and directed by''
Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky has said through his spokesman that he did nothing
wrong, and has questioned why Ovitz and his team have only now
brought up the accounting problems. Ovitz had hired KPMG Peat
Marwick to review the company's books before he took over. But KPMG
found nothing that caused Ovitz to find another place to invest his
$20 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday a spokesman for Drabinsky said that the producer would
not comment further on the ``vague assertions'' made by Webster and
others. ``He'll address these issues in court at the appropriate
time,'' said David Weiner, the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky also successfully argued to the judge that many of
Webster's statements on his reputed role in the accounting
irregularities, including many of those detailed here, were
irrelevant to his case against the KPMG accountants and should be
struck from the court record.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb's lawyer did not respond to repeated requests for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time that Drabinsky, 48, a man long known for
his artistic vision, abundant confidence and high-spending ways,
has built a sprawling entertainment company, only to be tossed out
when questions arose about his accounting.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Drabinsky, a former entertainment lawyer, founded
Cineplex Odeon, building it from an 18-screen theater company in
Toronto to an 1,800-screen chain sprawling across the United States
and Canada. MCA, one of the company's big investors, dismissed him
in 1989 amid questions of aggressive accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, Drabinsky built Livent in much the same
way. He and Gottlieb bought a Toronto theater from Cineplex in
1989, and then expanded rapidly by building new theaters and going
deeply into debt.
</P>
<P>
   Livent now owns five theaters in four cities _ New York;
Toronto; Vancouver, British Columbia; and Chicago. On Broadway,
Drabinsky, with much bravado, opened ``Ragtime'' in Livent's new
$22.5 million Ford Center for the Performing Arts on Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after that the producer's unrestrained spending on
sets, cast, costumes and advertising caught up with Livent, and not
even $76 Broadway tickets covered the bills. When Ovitz came to the
company's aid, the big-talking producer lost his position as
chairman and chief executive. He continued as chief creative
director, earning a salary of $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ovitz and his team were aware of the cash problems,
they say they did not expect the financial fiasco they soon
discovered.

SNOWLESS SLOPES JUST RIGHT FOR MOUNTAIN BIKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLINGTON, Vt. _ The 1,000-space parking lot outside the base
ski lodge is packed with cars, but there are no ski racks on their
roofs. The people waiting in line for the gondolas aren't wearing
wool hats or mufflers. And there's not a ski or a ski boot in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, you'll see a bike rack on every car, a helmet on every
head, and yes, a mountain bike next to almost every person in line.
</P>
<P>
   Never let it be said that skiers ignore the slopes just because
there's no snow on them. Both the athletes and the mountian
managers realize that the terrain and gondolas can be put to good
use in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   So on a recent cloudless, 55-degree day, with trees along Route
4 in central Vermont bursting with red, yellow, and green leaves,
it was no surprise that some bikers decided to leave the
exhaust-filled roads and head up the mountain, along with tourists
who ride the gondola just for the view.
</P>
<P>
   Next weekend, Killington will begin making snow in full force
and remove from the gondola cars the hooks from which to hang
bikes. But for now, two wheels substitute for two skis.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the bikers go straight down the Cascade or Double
Dipper ski trails _ even the boldest realize that a steep mountain
with no snow can be more treacherous than a mountain with snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killington did a good job cutting single-track trails just for
bikes,'' said Bob Rebolledo, getting ready for his second run of
the day. ``You don't want to go down these Alpine slopes because
there are a lot of hidden rocks that are dangerous and it's steep
and you're just on your brakes all the time, so it's no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   His friend Burl Amsbury had some dried blood on one leg as
evidence that even on the special trails, you can still take a
spill.
</P>
<P>
   But Amsbury shrugged it off, saying, ``You've got to pay your
dues, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   While the blanket of colors covering the mountains might not be
as blazing as last year (``Too much rain early in the season,'' is
the diagnosis from hiking guide Walt Gropar), most bikers said the
scenery is a main attraction on Killington.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardy, who drove up from Newport, R.I., with his friend
Sarah James, said things can be a blur as he's making his way down
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I buzz down, but you have to stop every now and then,'' Hardy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smollen, who came from Chicago to ride down the mountain,
put the scenery in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'm not looking at the leaves on the way down,'' he
said with a laugh. ``Just on the way up. So yeah, I see the foliage
on the ground after it's fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   The bikes that are either brought up by their owners or rented
(350 were rented at Killington last Sunday) are better suited for
mountainous terrain than ever before. In addition to the thick,
knobby tires and flat handlebars that are better for maneuvering,
the bikes can have up to 24 speeds. Some have cantilever instead of
side-pull brakes, and shock absorbers on the front, back, or both.
</P>
<P>
   As for garb, Killington biker Damian Stowell explained that
aesthestics are not the issue when it comes to mountain biking;
safety is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to crash, but it's inevitable,'' said Stowell,
sporting a well-worn helmet and arm pads,
</P>
<P>
   His friend David Hess was equipped with plenty of protection. He
wore his soccer chin pads and had a full-coverage helmet that made
him look like Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my teeth the way they are,'' he said matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   The two, who came up with two other friends from Boston, said
they are prepared to ``go up and shoot down the mountain until they
quit running the lift'' at 5:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Scott, who mans the gondola that goes up to Killington Peak,
said, ``Mountain bikers are a very reliable crowd for us. They're
out here in the pouring rain, and as soon as I get snow, they'll be
skiing for me as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the conditions are right, when the nights are cold enough
to keep the man-made snow on the ground and the gondolas are still
taking bikes up, the skiers/bikers will do both in one day.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Elles, who owns the First Stop/Board Barn on Route 4, has
seen the crossover firsthand. He started his shop 19 years ago,
renting skis and selling small accessories.
</P>
<P>
   When he began renting bikes 12 years ago, he opened a shop right
next door but with a separate entrance ``because bikers and skiers
didn't see eye to eye. There was no respect for a ski shop that
carried bikes.'
</P>
<P>
   Now he sells both skis and bikes and wants to connect the two
buildings since ``everything is starting to blend together.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott stressed that the bikers don't have to be hard-core to go
down the mountain. Although some come down in 15 minutes, others
can take up to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of bikers in the leisurely category. Two
fathers, Rusty Williams and David Osborne, and their 7-year-old
sons were headed out to ride down the mountain while their wives
and other children took the gondola back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful day, and if you walk around up here, you can
see the whole area,'' said Williams, of Wayland, Mass. ``The kids
are really good bikers, and we're going to go really, really slow
and meet the others at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Still others say they don't need the gondola at all to enjoy the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Alpert, a dentist in Stamford, Conn., who has a house near
Killington, makes the drive up north every weekend to either ski in
the winter or bike in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But like a cook who disdains a microwave, Alpert said he prefers
to use human energy to power his way both up and down the mountain
and through the surrounding woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like saying, `Let's go for a beautiful ride in the
country,' and then getting on Interstate 91,'' he said. ``For me,
part of the reward going downhill is earning it coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHERE ELSE TO RIDE BEFORE THE SNOW FALLS ...
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Many downhill and cross-country ski areas in New England have
mountain bike trails and offer rentals. Others, like Wachusett and
Butternut mountains in Massachusetts, are state reserves, and
biking is not allowed on the trails, although it is permitted on
the fire roads and surrounding areas. &QL; 
In addition, here are some of the resorts that offer lift or
gondola services to bikers: &QL; 
 &QL; 
Vermont: Mount Snow, Stowe, Stratton, Sugarbush
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire: Attitash, Loon, Snow

 NEW YORK: soon discovered.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After he was dismissed in August, Drabinsky battled with
Livent's lawyers for weeks to try to get piles of personal papers
he had kept in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky had also decorated his office walls, the adjoining
hallway and the boardroom with his private artworks. But Livent now
demanded that he produce proof that he owned the art, which he
eventually recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky even had his own personal bookkeeper, Lorraine
Valentine, at Livent. Ms. Valentine kept the financial records for
the producer's personal tax returns. Livent officials would not say
whether the bookkeeper's salary was paid by the company or by
Drabinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For days, investigators from the Canadian affiliate of KPMG
sorted through thousands of documents in the offices of Drabinsky,
Gottlieb and Ms. Valentine, deciding which belonged to Livent and
which were personal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Drabinsky's objections, the KPMG investigators have kept
items like his personal diary, papers on a Toronto art gallery he
owns, and architectural drawings for a weekend home he had wanted
to build in Uxbridge, Ontario, but later abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say that the diary includes details pertinent to
their accounting inquiry and that they have evidence of business
dealings between the gallery and Livent. It is not clear why the
architectural drawings were retained.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Aug. 13, the investigators let Drabinsky enter
Livent's headquarters, with KPMG security guards escorting him to
his office, which was then almost devoid of documents. ``The
atmosphere was highly intimidating,'' Drabinsky wrote in court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the court papers filed by KPMG investigators,
Drabinsky grew angry during his visit. He was ``verbally abusive
and swore several times,'' wrote Gary Gill of KPMG Investigation
and Security Inc. ``I also heard him shout and yell several times
at his bookkeeper, Ms. Valentine,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When Drabinsky filed suit against KPMG, he said the firm should
be dismissed from the investigation because it had several
conflicts of interest. For almost two decades, KPMG's tax
accountants have prepared Drabinsky's personal tax returns and
often provided advice on matters related to Livent.
</P>
<P>
   KPMG investigators have argued that they avoided Drabinsky's tax
documents during their investigation, and that they have not talked
to the firm's tax accountants about Drabinsky or tried to get
information from them. They say they have used none of Drabinsky's
personal information in their investigation and have followed all
ethical rules.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a judge said that KPMG, which has completed its
report, must allow Drabinsky to see it to ensure that none of his
personal tax information has been used by the investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were suspended, both Drabinsky and Gottlieb have
tried to stay out of the public view. Drabinsky has been handling
his legal predicaments from an office in his home, but his art
gallery _ the Drabinsky-Friedland Gallery in Toronto _ is still
open.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man now receives a salary. And much of their personal
wealth is tied up in Livent stock, which cannot be sold. Both U.S.
and Canadian exchanges suspended trading in it on Aug. 10, when the
company announced the discovery of the accounting irregularities
and officially suspended Drabinsky and Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators say they will not allow trading until the company
releases more information on the severity of the accounting
problems, which the company says date back to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky says he owns ``directly and indirectly'' 2,167,875
shares, which, based on the stock's last price of $6.75, would be
worth more than $14 million. But the shares are no doubt worth much
less now.
</P>
<P>
   In his court affidavit, Drabinsky said he feared his reputation
would soon ``be completely destroyed'' with the aid of his ``own
accountants.''
</P>
<P>
   The impresario, once so full of bluster, says the days following
the premiere of ``Fosse'' ``were the worst two weeks of my life.''

SCHROEDER TELLS CLINTON HE BACKS ACTION BY NATO IN KOSOVO  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ _ The German Chancellor-elect, Gerhard Schroeder,
told President Clinton Friday that he would support a decision by
the caretaker German government to authorize NATO to use force over
Kosovo if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Schroeder made it clear, German officials said, that any
authorization for German troops and airplanes to participate in any
NATO action should wait for the newly elected parliament, which
will take its seats on Oct. 26. That parliament is expected to
elect Schroeder as chancellor on Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they were relieved that
Schroeder and his prospective foreign minister, Joschka Fischer of
the Green Party, would not block the use of force by NATO or
undermine the effort to increase the pressure on the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, to take NATO's threats seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The officials have told the Germans that their forces _ the
Germans have offered some 14 fighter jets and up to 500 troops _
would not be crucial in the early stages of any NATO action in any
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, and above all the Yugoslav president, should hope that
we will take a less decisive approach'' than the current government
of Helmut Kohl, Schroeder said Friday morning. ``He must fulfill
the U.N. resolutions completely, and we will do all we can to
ensure it is fulfilled. The U.S. knows that is our view.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said: ``Nothing has changed in the basic position of
Germany with respect to Milosevic. Milosevic should not think that
the new government will take a less firm position than the old
one.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``we agree with the positions of the Western alliance that
there must be a serious pressure on Slobodan Milosevic,'' Fischer
said, ``in this transition situation, the Americans have to
understand that our possibilities for action are very limited.''
</P>
<P>
   After their White House meeting, Clinton emphasized the
importance of the NATO authorization of force _ a vote that may not
take place until Tuesday or even Wednesday, officials said Friday.
There is a desire to see the results of talks in Belgrade between
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic, the officials said, and
the Italians need to sort out a new government after the coalition
of Prime Minister Romano Prodi collapsed earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first issue is whether Germany will support NATO issuing
the action order to make sure that the plans are in place and
authorized if NATO action should be needed,'' Clinton said. ``That
is what he said yes to today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I am convinced it is important that we
authorize NATO to act. That's where the agreement is.'' German
officials say the current Cabinet is expected to vote on Monday to
authorize the use of force by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said that Germany ``does not have a vested interest in
going into war in Kosovo,'' but said, with his usual vagueness: ``I
find it very important to reveal a certain degree of decisiveness
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at a news conference later at the German Embassy here,
Schroeder said, ``I don't even want to think about what happens if
the U.N. resolution is not fulfilled'' by Milosevic.

NASA SEEKS PRIVATE FIRM TO MAKE HABITATION MODULE AVAILABLE AS
EMERGENCY SHELTER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  with NASATECH-CHART 
 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASA's Johnson Space Center thinks technologies in its TransHab,
a large inflatable ``habitation module'' could be put to good use
in places other than space _ maybe for some type of emergency
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed is a private company willing to take the
techniques used to make the Transit Habitat into commercial
products.
</P>
<P>
   NASA just might find a company poised to do so at its three-day
Inspection98 program beginning Wednesday. Johnson Space Center will
display more than 200 technologies and exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to put NASA's technology into general use. At the
program, Johnson's third, NASA may also find a company or person
who can partner with on research or projects.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of business, industry and education, and
community leaders are invited. More than 4,000 people, including
those from outside the country _ especially those outside the
aerospace community _ are expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we hope is people will find technology that they can use
in their businesses or take home and turn into commercial
products,'' said Kathy Jurica, who is chairing Inspection98.
</P>
<P>
   There are different ways to get NASA technology. Some of it is
in the public domain and available free. In cases involving
patented technology a licensing agreement may be needed. NASA would
receive a licensing fee and royalties that could be based on a
percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   A partnership with NASA could also be set up. That's what
happened with Robert Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who has a doctorate in anatomy, went to Inspection96
searching for technologies that would help him teach anatomy and
physiology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a place to go see what I would have not otherwise
known about,'' he said. ``I was looking for educational application
of technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, an adjunct professor at University of Houston and a
professor at Montgomery College in Conroe, had an idea to create a
virtual reality human body as a teaching tool. He was hoping NASA
had developed the technology that would allow him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He found it had not. But he also found that NASA was interested
in partnering with him to create that technology, which also has
applications for space use. NASA, he said, is interested in the
effects of microgravity, which means virtually no gravity, on
people; and in using a virtual body to design the next generation
of spacesuits.
</P>
<P>
   At the Inspection in 1996, Rice met Anthony Bruins, a NASA
systems engineer. Bruins, Rice said, had immediate enthusiasm for
Rice's idea and has sheparded him through the NASA process.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Rice set up in the Institute of Somatic
Sciences at the Houston Advanced Research Center in The Woodlands
north of Houston. Somatic refers to bones, muscles and nerves. By
the time the next Inspection rolled around, Rice had developed a
prototype for a virtual body. He displayed a virtual shoulder area.
</P>
<P>
   In January of this year, Rice was approved to get NASA funding
for his work. This year, he'll display an entire arm. The computer
simulation acts and looks like a real arm. It can also be moved and
felt.
</P>
<P>
   Also because of the 1996 program, Montana Biotech hooked up with
a NASA researcher. Both study organisms that live in extreme
environments. A person familiar with Montana Biotech attended the
program and put the small Montana-based business in touch with the
NASA researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The company and researcher collaborated informally, and Montana
Biotech later signed an agreement to work with NASA to study how to
sterilize rock samples containing bacteria. That research will be
used for handling samples collected from Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Combie, owner and vice president of Montana Biotech, said
the relationship has been mutually beneficial as the technology
developed may have commercial application in the future &UR; .  &LR; The
connection, said Montana Biotech president Fred Albert, has allowed
the company to progress more quickly on studying effects of
radiation on microorganisms.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA researcher has also added to Montana Biotech's
collection of organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Both praised the Inspection program with Albert saying he would
like to attend one in the future to see what else the company could
get involved in.
</P>
<P>
   Those interested in Inspection98 can get information by phone
(281-244-1316) or e-mail (inspection at jsc.nasa.gov). &QL;

YEN'S RISE AGAINST DOLLAR IS THREATENING JAPANESE EXPORTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The yen's sudden jump against the dollar this past week
threatens to take the momentum out of Japan's exports by making it
more costly for America and other foreign markets to buy Japanese
products.
</P>
<P>
   If the yen's new-found strength lasts, economists say, it could
even prolong Japan's worst postwar recession.
</P>
<P>
   Big corporate exporters like Sony Corp., Honda Motor Co., Fuji
Photo Film Co. and NEC Corp. have been caught off-guard by the
yen's abrupt about-face. The yen's higher exchange value makes
their products more expensive abroad and lowers the value of their
foreign earnings when converted back into yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the high yen trend continues, we will see the influence on
our sales and profits within several months,'' Tamotsu Iba, vice
president of Sony, said in a statement. ``The current rapid rise in
the yen does not reflect the fundamentals of the Japanese
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until this week, the yen had been weakening for months, a
reflection of the litany of economic problems confronting Japan:
debt-laden banks, rising bankruptcies, falling domestic sales,
plummeting business confidence and a stock market that has
continued to flirt with 12-year lows. Asia's economic crisis put
further downward pressure on the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But the yen's weakness has also been regarded as a benefit to
Japan because it has helped stimulate exports, the one area of
Japan's economy that has continued to maintain relative health.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the abrupt change to a stronger yen, combined with signs of
economic weakness appearing in Japan's most important market, the
United States, has raised doubts about Japanese exporters as well.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices of companies heavily dependent on exports have been
falling recently. Many of those companies are the bluest of Japan's
blue chips, the industrial elite of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Honda shares, for example, fell 470 yen Friday, to close at
2,900 yen, while Sony's shares declined 380, to 7,770 yen. Honda is
now trading at about 9 times earnings, while Sony trades at 16
times earnings. In comparison, shares of the Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., which is less dependent on exports to the United
States than Honda and Sony, trade at 27 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say in any definitive way what the exact impact
could be without knowing each companies' hedging ratios, the final
demand for their products and where they are produced,'' said Kathy
Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman, Sachs (Japan) Ltd. ``But I
still think that, net-net, it's hard to say it's positive for the
exporters.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some companies did offer rudimentary snapshots of the potential
impact of the yen's swing.
</P>
<P>
   A one yen move in the dollar-yen exchange rate makes a 5
billion-yen difference in Sony's profits. Thus, the recent seesaw
of the rate from 135.35 yen to the dollar when trading opened this
week to 116.95 yen in late New York trading Friday caused a slide
of more than $780 million in potential earnings from Sony's
operating profits. The Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest car
company, sees a 10 billion yen swing in operating profits every
time the dollar-yen exchange rate fluctuates by one yen.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's rise is not necessarily viewed as a bad development
elsewhere in Asia _ in fact, other weakened Asian economies could
benefit from a rising yen because it would make their exports more
competitive. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and
Thailand rose Friday because of that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan has been counting on its mighty car and electronics
manufacturers with their vast global sales networks to generate the
cash needed to keep its gross domestic product from slumping
further than the 1.8 percent decline the government has projected.
With much of Asia still stuck in an economic rut and the domestic
market in a funk, the Japanese exporters are regarded as
increasingly important to Japan's still elusive recovery.
</P>
<P>
   If the U.S. economy slows further, as many believe it will, and
the yen maintains its current strength, corporate Japan will face
an unprecedented jump in excess capacity and inventories, which are
already at levels that are pressuring prices. While the long-term
impact of the drop in the dollar could become moot overnight should
sentiment turn again, sudden swings in the exchange rate can hurt
day-to-day corporate decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movement affects short-term business conditions, too, in
terms of competitiveness,'' said Aston Bridgman, a spokesman for
NEC, the world's second-largest semiconductor manufacturer. ``If
we're bidding on projects, we can quickly become uncompetitive when
exchange rates swing like they have today and yesterday.''

INS REQUIRED TO DETAIN CRIMINAL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS UNTIL
DEPORTATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a two-year delay, a federal mandate became effective
Friday that requires the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
detain all criminal illegal immigrants until deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Some INS officials say the new policy will cause crowding
problems and budget headaches.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate, included in a 1996 federal law, no longer allows
INS officials to decide whether permanent residents who have been
arrested but are not considered dangerous can be released pending
the outcome of their deportation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The provision, part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and
Immigrant Responsibility Act, was meant to toughen up U.S. borders
and immigration policy. But in testimony before congressional
committees, the INS had argued that it did not have the resources
to implement the new policy. As a result, the agency was granted
two one-year delays in implementing it.
</P>
<P>
   The INS still estimates it lacks 17,000 to 27,000 beds to
adequately detain the criminal illegal immigrants it has been
mandated to hold.
</P>
<P>
   In the INS region that includes Texas, officials said the ratio
of illegal immigrants they must keep in detention to those they can
release will stay about the same _ 75 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But local offices in Texas had mixed reactions on how the new
mandate will affect them.
</P>
<P>
   The INS Service Processing Center in El Paso will face ``major
crowding,'' said Vincent Clausen, assistant district director for
detention and deportation there.
</P>
<P>
   Clausen said the office is using the new provisions from the
1996 law to speed up deportation, but his and other stations face
another problem _ ``non-removables,'' immigrants from countries
with no political ties to the U.S. These immigrants face long-term
detention because they cannot be returned.
</P>
<P>
   The INS agrees with Congress that criminal illegal aliens who
commit aggravated felonies or are deemed dangerous by an
immigration judge should be detained, and the agency has always
done so, said Russell Bergeron, a spokesman for the national INS
office.
</P>
<P>
   But Bergeron cited an example of a man who struggled with drug
addiction, was arrested for possession of narcotics, served a short
sentence and probation, went through rehabilitation and now has a
family and holds a job. If such a person visited relatives outside
the U.S. and truthfully answered whether he had ever been arrested
upon returning, the INS would automatically detain and deport him.
</P>
<P>
   The same provision that limits INS officials' discretion also
provides some new tools to deal with the mandate and more quickly
deport criminal illegal immigrants. INS officials can now:
</P>
<P>
   Immediately detain and deport an illegal immigrants who shows up
at any port of entry without proper documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reinstate prior orders'' or immediately deport someone who has
already been deported, without time-consuming paperwork or a
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Finish deportation paperwork while illegal immigrants serve
their criminal sentence so they are deported without delay upon
completing their sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The INS and Congress have blamed each other for the lack of
resources devoted to detention. Hill staffers say the INS never
provided Congress with information about what the provision would
mean and how much it would cost, and INS officials say Congress
doesn't really understand the immigration problem and has not
earmarked enough money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was completely avoidable and unnecessary,'' said a
Capitol Hill staffer who works on immigration. ``They don't have
their act together. It's very troubling they come here at the last
minute and try to point fingers at Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bergeron places more responsibility on Congress: ``Clearly,
we have indicated to Congress through the two annual reports we
submitted, and with testimony, that the current levels would not be
sufficient to meet the mandatory detention requirements.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to give patients more power in dealing
with health insurance companies died Friday, a casualty of heavy
lobbying by the insurance industry and of the sex scandal that has
enveloped President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents said similar legislation would be back
in 1999. But this year's struggle shows once again how difficult it
is to pass health care legislation affecting doctors, patients,
lawyers, insurers and employers of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the demise of Clinton's plan for universal health
insurance in 1994, he and his allies in Congress have tried to
achieve the same goal step by step. But even these proposals have
set off fierce fights about the proper role of government in
regulating one of the nation's biggest industries.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 50-47 Friday in the waning hours of the 105th
Congress, the Senate rejected a Democratic move to take up a bill
to define patients' rights and to regulate health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' rush to adjournment hit a big bump Friday when Clinton
demanded money for education initiatives that he proposed early
this year. Senior lawmakers said they would work through the
weekend and negotiate with the White House as they try to complete
work on bills to finance the operations of the federal government
in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill defining patients' rights was needed to
protect millions of Americans who have had problems with HMOs. They
asserted that conservative Republican senators like Trent Lott of
Mississippi and Don Nickles of Oklahoma never really wanted a bill,
and worked with insurers to sidetrack legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, who introduced their own bill to define
patients' rights in July, said Friday that Democrats had passed up
many opportunities for compromise because the Democrats wanted an
election issue more than they wanted a new law. Democratic
candidates are, in fact, campaigning on the issue. But some
Republican candidates are also promising to pass legislation
helping HMO patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``Big money and powerful
special interests kept us from debating this issue in the United
States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, said, ``Passage
of real patient protections should have been the highest priority
of this session of Congress,'' but Republicans ``thwarted us at
every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican bill was narrower in scope than the
Democratic bill. The Democrats said their legislation would have
covered three times as many people as the Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nickles, the assistant majority leader, said,
``The Democrats trashed our proposal and never tried to work with
us to come up with common elements that could become law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged that HMO patients
had ``some legitimate concerns and problems,'' and he added, ``I do
believe that we are going to address this next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a bill to define patients' rights and regulate
HMOs in July. But in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans had such
profound disagreements that they could not even get such
legislation to the floor for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The measures considered this year, known as the Patient
Protection Act and the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, would have
guaranteed access to emergency care and medical specialists and
would have permitted patients to appeal the denial of care to an
independent panel of medical experts. The Democratic bills would
also have made it easier for patients to sue HMOs and recover
damages for the improper denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress sets uniform national standards for health
insurance, that would be a major departure from the practice of the
last half-century. Such insurance is regulated mainly by the
states. Standards vary widely, and federal law severely limits the
states' ability to regulate employee health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the outlines of a potential compromise were
discernible in May. But Democrats were reluctant to compromise.
After months of haggling over procedural questions, Senate
Republicans eventually concluded that they did not have to deal
with the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer pleas for congressional action were ultimately drowned
out in the debate over the possible impeachment of Clinton, and he
had no political leverage to force Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of HMOs, insurance companies and employers _ the
Health Benefits Coalition _ vehemently opposed new federal mandates
on health plans, saying such requirements would increase costs and
reduce the number of people with coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition began its lobbying and advertising campaign on
Jan. 21, the day of the first news reports about the president's
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton gave many speeches about HMO
legislation, but his fight for the legislation suffered as he
devoted more and more of his energy to fighting for the survival of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's summer recess, from July 31 to Aug. 31, was a
turning point. ``August was not about health care,'' said Suzanne
DeFrancis, vice president of Porter Novelli, an advertising and
public relations company that worked with the Health Benefits
Coalition. ``August was about Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted his affair with Ms. Lewinsky in a televised
speech on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who led the fight for a bill to give patients more
power in dealing with health insurers, said, ``To the extent that
the public was focused on the whole White House problem, it may
have emboldened the Republicans to shut us out of debate on HMO
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits Coalition, who is
also vice president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, said the coalition had spent ``a little over $2 million''
on lobbying and advertising against HMO bills. In addition, he
said, ``our member organizations have probably spent another $1
million on advertising, and that does not include the cost of staff
work and time spent on fax, phone calls, direct mail and tens of
thousands of action alerts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Danner said the money was well spent. ``It's a good investment
for the next Congress,'' he said. ``This issue will definitely be
back, for two reasons. The number of uninsured people continues to
go up. And after several years of relatively flat premiums, we now
expect more significant increases in the cost of health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to pick up seats in the House and the
Senate next month, so there may be more hostility to government
regulation in the next Congress. On the other hand, the whole issue
of regulating HMOs may be swept up in presidential politics if one
or more candidates stress the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable,
which represents 200 large companies, said the group had spent $1
million on its own radio and newspaper advertisements against HMO
legislation. The coalition and the Business Roundtable ran
advertising in 23 states, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Two House Republicans, Charlie Norwood of Georgia and Greg
Ganske of Iowa, continually prodded their party leaders to pass a
bill defining patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Norwood said: ``I am very
disappointed that the Senate has not moved a bill. Senators did not
act because they didn't have to. Their mind is on Clinton's
problems. You can't carry on a conversation up here for more than
one minute before impeachment comes up. The Senate put off the
health care issue, but it's not going away. I will butt my head
against this wall until we get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Rickard, senior vice president of Ryder System Inc., the
transportation service company, who coordinated the lobbying for
the Business Roundtable, said: ``This year started out with
tremendous momentum for a patients' bill of rights. There is a
strong probability that legislation would have passed in the
absence of our efforts to educate Congress and the public about the
costs of such mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Taylor, chief lobbyist at the AFL-CIO, said: ``Senate
Republicans got away with an amazing tactic. They pulled
legislation from the floor whenever it appeared that Democrats
would offer patient protections as an amendment, and the
Republicans were afraid to bring up their own sham bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidates say frustration with HMOs still seems
to be running high outside Washington. A survey by the National
Journal found that campaign advertisements mentioning health
insurance far outnumbered those referring to the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put patients and doctors back in charge of medical
decisions, not managed care bureaucrats,'' Gail Riecken, the
Democratic candidate in Indiana's 8th Congressional District, says
in one commercial. In another, Shelley Berkley of Las Vegas tells
voters, ``I believe all of us should have the right to choose our
own doctor, see a specialist when we need one and know that medical
decisions are being made by doctors and patients, not accountants
and clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., who is running for re-election,
promises legislation to ``hold HMOs 100 percent accountable for
improper care.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said: ``Health care is not a Democrat
issue any more. We are not afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that some Republican candidates for the House, like
Ernest Fletcher in Kentucky, were promising to fight for HMO
legislation.

 &HT;    Task force endorses using codes to track HIV cases
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDs: Writethru includes report on decision to use numerical
codes
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Task Force on AIDS decided on Friday to
endorse using numerical codes instead of people's names to keep
track of HIV infections in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The task force's recommendation to the state Department of Human
Resources is not binding, and DHR will continue to seek public
comment on the issue until the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   DHR will make its own decision on an HIV reporting system
sometime in the summer of 1999, and the system will be implemented
in 2000, said David Johnson, a senior public health adviser with
DHR.
</P>
<P>
   No one at Friday's meeting contested the need for some kind of
surveillance system that would allow doctors and epidemiologists to
learn which geographic areas and population subgroups are being
hard hit by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get those numbers out, there's no way I'm going to
get funding,'' said Dr. Harold Katner, a task force member who
treats HIV-positive people in Macon. ``I don't know how else we can
set up programs to deal with areas with a high growth rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that using names to report HIV infections would
provide the highest possible accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   But community advocates strongly oppose reporting names, saying
it could create opportunities for breaches of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The numerical codes, or unique identifiers, recommended by the
task force would be similar to those now used in HIV reporting
systems in Maryland and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   These 12-digit codes include the last four digits of an
individual's Social Security number, the six digits of that
person's birth date, one digit representing race or ethnicity and
one digit for gender.
</P>
<P>
   To submit comments on an HIV reporting system, send letters to
the Department of Human Resources: HIV Reporting Comments, Georgia
Department of Human Resources, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch,
2 Peachtree St. N.W., Sixth Floor Tower, Room 6-407, Atlanta, GA
30303-3186.

   After a 7-Year Summer, Economic Leaves Turn
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for the United States economy has ``weakened
measurably,'' Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told a
group of economists last week. Though current indicators remain
fairly healthy, he said, ``we are clearly facing a set of forces
that should be dampening demand going forward to an unknown
extent,'' including a ``scary psychology'' in financial markets and
fears that gloomy market news will undermine consumer confidence
and chill spending.
</P>
<P>
   Fed watchers found in Greenspan's remarks strong hints that
further interest-rate cuts were in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after his testimony, J.P. Morgan economists said they
expect a recession in 1999, which would end the nation's longest
peacetime economic expansion. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   World Markets Keep Roiling; World Leaders Keep Squabbling
</P>
<P>
   A five-day conference of finance ministers and central bankers
in Washington ended without agreement on any coordinated steps to
bolster the world economy, despite a direct appeal for a unified
plan from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders and the president of the World Bank broke with
the United States and the International Monetary Fund over
strategies for restoring stability in global financial markets.
Latin American governments, envious of what they consider lenient
treatment of Russia, called for more generous financial aid for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar sank sharply against the Japanese yen, not because
anyone thought Tokyo's new stimulus package would end the country's
recession, but because hedge funds and other investors were
unwinding dollar investments and buying yen to repay loans to
Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
   The falling dollar took the wind out of the Treasury bond
market's sails; yields bobbed back up to levels of two weeks ago.
Stocks were exceptionally volatile, with the Dow soaring or
plunging wildly at times on several days, only to reverse course
and close nearly unchanged. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Market Turmoil Doesn't Kill Companies' Urge to Merge
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions are crawling tentatively out of the
bomb shelters to test the wind again. Clear Channel Communications
said it would buy Jacor Communications for $2.8 billion in stock;
the combination would be the second-biggest radio station owner in
the country. Cardinal Health, a drug wholesaler, agreed to buy
Allegiance, which sells medical supplies, for $5.4 billion in stock
and debt.
</P>
<P>
   AMP won two rounds in its struggle to escape a hostile takeover
by Allied Signal; the Pennsylvania House passed a favorable bill,
and a federal judge challenged Allied's plan to install a group of
its employees as AMP directors. Allied said it would complete its
tender offer anyway. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Columbia/HCA's problems with the government metastasized far
beyond the criminal investigation of billing practices at some of
its Florida hospitals. In a civil suit, the government accused
Columbia and Quorum Health Group of systematic fraud involving
hundreds of hospitals collecting inflated reimbursements from
Medicare and other programs over a 14-year period. ... The Justice
Department sued Visa USA and Mastercard International on antitrust
grounds. ... The Philippine government brokered a deal among
unions, creditors and management that will allow Philippine
Airlines to resume operations this week. ... Citibank said it would
scrap hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of core back-office
computer systems and build a new Internet-based retail banking and
investment service from scratch. ... Republicans in the two houses
of Congress settled on a single version of a new bankruptcy law
that would make it much harder for consumers to get relief from
debts. Democrats urged President Clinton to veto the bill as too
harsh on low-income consumers. ... The chip makers Advanced Micro
Devices and Motorola turned in surprisingly good earnings reports. &QL;

PANEL MEMBERS DISAGREE ABOUT IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Fla., Ill., Mich.)  (lb) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after the House authorized an impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton, Judiciary Committee members appear
to be at odds over what kind of investigation to conduct, with
Democrats pushing to summon a parade of players in the scandal and
Republicans suggesting narrowing the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they would like to call the central characters in
the Lewinsky scandal to judge their credibility. That potential
list includes Monica Lewinsky; her mother, Marcia Lewis; the woman
who surreptitiously tape-recorded Ms. Lewinsky's conversations,
Linda Tripp; Clinton's confidant Vernon Jordan; and Betty Currie,
Clinton's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats said they would be interested in shining the
spotlight on independent counsel Kenneth Starr, calling him as a
witness to quiz him about purported ``leaks'' from his office, the
way he conducted his investigation and his relationship with Mrs.
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde, who
initially opposed calling Starr, said Friday that he would not
object if Democrats subpoenaed Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that they'd be clobbered politically if they
didn't call Kenneth Starr,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a
member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are reluctant to summon a roster of players
before the committee, hoping instead to rely on the witnesses'
depositions and grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our responsibility to conduct a full-scale trial,''
said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., a member of the panel, who wants
to call Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel and close
Clinton adviser. ``The Constitution gives the Senate the power to
try.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, R-Ill., said he saw ``no need'' to call Ms. Lewinsky, who
testified to the grand jury under an immunity agreement that he
said gave her no reason to lie. But a lawyer familiar with the
proceedings said Republicans are weighing whether to call Mrs.
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman also said it is unlikely that Clinton would be
subpoenaed to testify. Clinton's lawyers are invited to attend the
hearings, which are expected to begin in mid-November, and they are
free to question witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Republicans are considering whether to scale back some
of the charges or simply zero in on the most important right away,
perjury and obstruction of justice, members and a Republican
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde left open the possibility on Friday that the inquiry
could wander into other areas, such as Clinton's ability to lead.
Asked whether he might call high-ranking Pentagon officials before
the panel to ask if Clinton has retained his credibility as
commander in chief, Hyde said, ``It's a possibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the first orders of business for the committee and its
staff will be to draw up a list of facts and give them to Democrats
and the White House. An agreement on those facts, called a
stipulation, could speed up the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, is expected to meet with
David Schippers, the Republicans' investigative counsel, on Tuesday
to begin the process in a closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are hoping the White House can stipulate some basic
facts, such as authenticating phone records and logs. But reaching
consensus on others, like the differences in testimony between Ms.
Lewinsky and Clinton about their sexual relationship, could be a
lot more difficult, they indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally, we could get some stipulations so we wouldn't have to
go chasing around to reinvent the wheel,'' Hyde said. ``We can find
out what we want them to admit and see if we can get some
stipulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Republicans need to hold full and fair hearings,
Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts argued that to accomplish that,
the key players must be called before the committee. But there is a
political calculus behind this strategy, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a circus and they know it,'' Meehan said.
``It's not the basis upon which to impeach the president.''
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic aide said about the prospect of Ms. Lewinsky's
testimony on national television: ``The more you get back into
this, the more you look like a sexual inquisitor. People are fed up
with all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules governing the inquiry, both Hyde and Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the panel, must agree
on subpoenas. If there is no agreement, Republicans on the
committee can vote to overrule Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said Friday that Starr's oversight of the
investigation and his use of Mrs. Tripp to record conversations,
are integral to the case. They say they want to establish whether
Starr's evidence is tainted and whether Starr directed Mrs. Tripp
to prod Ms. Lewinsky to ask the White House for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have the person who submitted the 445-page
report,'' Meehan said. ``You don't have a judicial proceeding and
have the prosecutor not appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would also query other witnesses about Starr and his
tactics, they said.

COWBOYS THINK PANTHERS WILL GO TO WALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Carolina Panthers tight end Wesley Walls has
averaged 58.6 receptions a season over the past three seasons. But
part of the Panthers' winless record has been underscored by Walls'
lack of involvement in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   He has just seven receptions for 84 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys expect the Panthers to try to change that tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best tight ends in the league and he makes a
lot of plays,'' said Cowboys strong safety Darren Woodson, who'll
draw part of the coverage assignment on the 6-foot-5, 250-pound
Walls. ``When they were rolling on offense, he was making plays.
One reason they are 0-4 is because they have not gone to him as
much. I'm sure they'll go to him (tomorrow). They have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said that perhaps the club's
quarterback change might help Walls. Steve Beuerlein was selected
as the starter in midweek after Kerry Collins asked to be benched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve is a smart enough quarterback that he will make sure
that he incorporates Walls into the offense,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger role for Walls will put more pressure on Woodson and
the rest of the Cowboys' secondary, particularly first-year
starting free safety Omar Stoutmire.
</P>
<P>
   In five games this season, Stoutmire has been a sturdy run
supporter with 27 tackles, fourth-most on the team. But he has just
one pass defensed as the Cowboys have often taken him out on
passing downs.
</P>
<P>
   When he has played against the pass, he has tried to keep his
mistakes to a minimum. There have been two notable ones this year.
He was beaten on a 23-yard touchdown pass to Shannon Sharpe against
the Broncos when he was fooled on play-action pass. He also failed
to provided deep help on Leslie Shepherd's 40-yard touchdown pass
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar has made a couple of first-year mistakes,'' Gailey said.
``But there have only been a few. If you can keep your mistakes
down to a minimum the first year you start, then you are playing
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoutmire said he knows teams will try to take advantage of his
youth. But he is confident that he can be a deterrent for passes
thrown his direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think I'd get suckered in a lot on play-action, but I've
been able to make some plays,'' Stoutmire said. ``I'm trying to get
better each week.'' &QL; 
BRIEFLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he is surprised that teams still punt at Deion
Sanders. ``I thought they'd reach that point. But do you want to
take a chance on aiming it hard out of bounds and risking an
18-yard punt? (Teams) are telling their guys that, `Hey, he's just
a guy. We can cover him.' I hope they keep telling their guys that.
He believes he can score a touchdown on every punt return.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Antonio Anderson, who has been out since
undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his knee last month, has been
working out and could play as soon as next week.

TCU RUNS A TAG TEAM TO SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Limping off the field in the second overtime
Saturday against Vanderbilt, TCU tailback Basil Mitchell turned and
pumped his fist in encouragement to his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's running had put the Frogs at the Commodores' 8-yard
line. But if TCU was going to win this game, it was going to come
down to the work of LaDainian Tomlinson.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson broke through for 4 yards up the middle. And then he
steamrolled inside for the final 4 yards for the winning touchdown
in a 19-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   And still pumping his fist on the sideline was Mitchell, who
made the drive possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so pumped up for L.T.,'' said Mitchell, who gained
125 yards against Vanderbilt. ``The thing is, I always want to see
him do good.''
</P>
<P>
   That unselfishness has given the Frogs one of the most potent
rushing attacks in the nation. The two have combined for 666 yards
and eight rushing touchdowns this season.
</P>
<P>
   TCU ranks second in the Western Athletic Conference in rushing
(250.3 yards a game) behind Air Force and eighth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very quality running backs who can just wear down
a defense,'' said Fresno State coach Pat Hill, whose Bulldogs face
TCU tonight at Amon Carter Stadium. ``They can just put you in so
many tough situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who has been the Frogs' leading rusher the past two
seasons as a three-year starter, is more of an elusive runner.
Tomlinson, on the other hand, relies more on power and often seems
as inclined to run through a defender as he is to go around him.
</P>
<P>
   But even with their varying styles, TCU coach Dennis Franchione
says there isn't a situation where he would prefer one over the
other. Since he switched Tomlinson from fullback to tailback three
weeks ago, Franchione has allowed his two tailbacks to rotate
themselves in and out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't have that kind of confidence in those two, then
there's no way I would allow them to handle the substitutions,''
said Franchione, who has the Frogs off to a 3-1 start this season.
``But they are both good running backs and they are very unselfish.
As far as I'm concerned they are both starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Both have already been named WAC Mountain Division player of the
week. Tomlinson earned his honor after rushing for 99 yards and two
touchdowns against Air Force. Mitchell earned his after rushing for
186 yards and three touchdowns in the season opener at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that says it all right there,'' running backs coach
Mike Schultz said. ``Any time you have two different guys in your
backfield receive that type of honor this early, then I think it
tells a lot right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even more gratifying than the yards and production is to
see how unselfish the two are. The only thing that really seems to
matter to them is winning. And that is what makes it fun for me as
a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson and Mitchell say what has made this season enjoyable
for them is the multiple-set offense brought in by Franchione,
which has allowed them to pick up yards off both the option and on
draw plays. It has also helped having an athletic quarterback such
as Patrick Batteaux, who is a consistent threat to run the
football.
</P>
<P>
   Batteaux, a converted wide receiver, is the Frogs' third-leading
rusher with 223 yards on a team-high 74 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense is designed to put us in the best position
possible,'' said Mitchell, who is averaging 6.5 yards per carry and
107.8 yards a game. ``We're getting the ball in a lot of one-on-one
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us a chance to show our athletic ability, as opposed
to us just running into a host of people. And because of that, the
results have been nothing but positive.'' &QL;

AGGIES LOOK TO SNAP TOP-10 JINX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Never one to dawdle when finding a seam
in an opposing defense, Texas A&AMP;M tailback Dante Hall is even
quicker to cut short a line of questioning about the Aggies' recent
struggles in high-profile games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, we have to win a game like this to get over the
hump,'' Hall said, providing the answer before a reporter could
finish his query about today's matchup between No. 18 A&AMP;M (4-1,
1-0) and No. 2 Nebraska (5-0, 1-0). ``I'll be glad when we do, so I
can start getting some new questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, a common theme will continue to be the
Aggies' 10-game losing streak against top-10 foes they will carry
into today's 2:30 p.m. matchup in Kyle Field. But only two of those
losses occurred at Kyle Field and the Aggies had opportunities to
win both games before falling to No. 6 Texas, 16-6, in 1995 and to
No. 9 Arkansas, 23-22, in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a chance to play the Cornhuskers in front of a pro-A&AMP;M
crowd and on a grass field, where coaches believe option teams are
less effective, has boosted the spirits of Aggies' players and
coaches as they attempt to record the school's first victory
against a top-10 opponent since knocking off No. 8 Houston, 17-13,
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches will tell you that option teams don't execute as well
on grass as on artificial turf,'' said A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum,
echoing sentiments expressed earlier in the week by Missouri coach
Larry Smith. ``They have more secure footing on turf. When you're
making those tight, 90-degree cuts, that really helps.''
</P>
<P>
   For an 11-point underdog like A&AMP;M, a raucous home crowd also
helps. A&AMP;M is 45-4-1 at Kyle Field during the 1990s. The .910
winning percentage at home that ranks fourth among Division I-A
teams in this decade. To liven the mood for Nebraska, A&AMP;M officials
have urged fans to wear maroon shirts as part of a ``Maroon Out''
promotion designed to inspire the home team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we shouldn't let anyone come in here and take a
win from us at our home,'' Hall said. ``We need to feed off the
crowd and play with a lot of excitement. We've been playing hard.
But the excitement hasn't been there.''
</P>
<P>
   It has returned this week, said offensive guard Cameron Spikes,
a lifelong resident in the Bryan-College Station area who termed
today's contest ``the biggest game I can think of in A&AMP;M's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Nebraska represents the highest-ranked
opponent to visit Kyle Field since No. 2 Texas in 1983. The
Cornhuskers, in the estimation of A&AMP;M wide receiver Chris Cole,
arrive primed for a fall after struggling to beat Oklahoma State,
24-17, last week in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage is set here for a big win and we're hungry for it,''
said Cole (23 catches, 387 yards), who has accounted for 59 percent
of A&AMP;M's receiving yards, as well as all three touchdown grabs.
``We've fiddled around with some of these lesser teams and didn't
put them away like we should. But this week, focus won't be a
problem. We need that big win to get into that elite class of
teams, and we're in a great place to take advantage of this
chance.''
OPTIONAL TRIM HERE
</P>
<P>
   The place will be Kyle Field, where Slocum has a 2-2 career mark
against top-10 foes. The field will be covered with grass, a
surface that yielded close calls for the Cornhuskers last week
against Oklahoma State and last season against Missouri (45-38
overtime win). The crowd should be loud.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else you need, R.C.?
</P>
<P>
   ``A nice, soaking rain wouldn't be all bad,'' Slocum said.
``Let's slow that thing down into a mudhole.''
</P>
<P>
   A higher authority has yet to rule on that last request.

BRAVES' OUTFIELDER JONES EVOKES COMPARISONS TO GREATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The average 21-year-old baseball player usually goes
through some ups and downs. But Atlanta Braves outfielder Andruw
Jones seemed to go through the extremes this season.
</P>
<P>
   He started in a 4-for-40 swoon that got him demoted from the
leadoff spot, then finished the season as the youngest player in
major-league history to hit at least 20 homers and steal 20 bases
in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox pulled him from a game against the Chicago
Cubs on July 21 because of his lack of hustle, then a month later
proclaimed him the greatest center fielder in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hard time at the beginning,'' Jones acknowledged.
``But I've worked out of that, and I'm happy with the success I'm
having right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are, too, but still they expect bigger and better
things. Young talent like Jones, along with an incomparable
pitching rotation, is why baseball's team of the '90s expects to
continue that success into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Cox was pulling Jones out of the game, he still was
comparing him to baseball's greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who doesn't respect the game enough to give 100
percent on every play needs somebody to talk to him,'' Cox said at
the time. ``Unfortunately I've talked to him a lot. He's got to
grow up; it's as simple as that. No one is bigger than the game. I
didn't act that way when I was 21, and neither did Willie Mays or
Hank Aaron.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, even if it is premature, do put Jones in the same
class as Mays and Aaron, and they were relieved to see him respond
positively to Cox's heavy-handed discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad,'' Jones said. ``Nobody likes to get pulled out of
a game. I lost my focus. I went out there and apologized for what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   He also finished the season hitting .274 with 30 homers, 91 runs
batted in and 27 stolen bases. Aaron, at the same age, hit .314
with 27 homers, 106 RBI and three stolen bases. Ken Griffey Jr. hit
.327 with 22 homers and 100 RBI. Mays was in the military.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones' defense is what impresses most, and he's expected to
win the first of many Gold Gloves this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably one of the best center fielders in the game
today,'' Reds bench coach Denis Menke said. ``He makes all the
plays look easy. He reminds me of Devon White. He's one of those
players that you say, `Well, we've got something for quite a few
years.' I don't know of too many others who are any better.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense, already pretty good, should only get better, and
the Braves think they have a superstar who could one day put
together the kind of season Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa did this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't call myself a home-run hitter,'' Jones said. ``I do
whatever I can to help the team win. If I need to hit a home run, I
hit a home run. If somebody makes a mistake, you hit the home runs.
But I'm not like McGwire or Sosa or (Andres) Galarraga; I can't hit
them every day. I can, but I don't look to do that. I just go out
and do my game.''

TEXAS-OU THE BIG GAME _ JUST NOT NATIONALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every player and coach who has taken part in a Texas-Oklahoma
game at the Cotton Bowl say the same thing. The rivalry is
unmatched in their experience in excitement, emotion and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``OU weekend is unique, and it's not comparable to any other
games,'' Longhorns senior linebacker Dusty Renfro said. ``It's a
neutral site, and each team has the same number of fans. It's
always such a battle because of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team is going to play above their heads no matter what
their records or rankings are.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But Texas enters today's game with a 3-2 (1-1 Big
12) record; Oklahoma is 2-2 (0-1). Neither team has received a vote
in either poll this week, which reflects the lack of national
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer, who has been advising
Sooners coach John Blake, won't make be makin' the scene today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the same anymore,'' Switzer told the ``Austin
American-Statesman,'' when asked about the Texas-Oklahoma rivalry.
``There was a time when one team would be No. 1 in the country and
the other would be No. 2. Both OU and Texas had national
prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC Sports passed on carrying the game as a regional telecast,
the first time since 1989 the game won't be televised by a national
network. However, more people could see the game because it will
air on the Big 12's syndicated regional network. That telecast will
be available in 25.5 million homes, including markets such as
Boston, Detroit and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the kids care about that stuff,'' Texas coach
Mack Brown said of the TV situation. ``When you get out there to
play, the kids don't know who is watching it on TV. Our kids tried
hard last Saturday night against Iowa State, and it was on
pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does matter is that these kids were raised watching Texas
and Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Texas-Oklahoma _ or, if you prefer, Oklahoma-Texas _ is
still a Big Game around these parts, even if it doesn't have the
sizzle in national circles. College football fans are more likely
to ask about the outcome of the Tennessee-Georgia and UCLA-Arizona
games before seeking a score from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone under 25 years of age has a very different view
of Texas-Oklahoma,'' said Chris Fowler, host of ESPN's ``College
GameDay'' preview show. ``I'm old enough to know what that game
means, and that's one of the games on my list that I'd like to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the national scene, Texas-Oklahoma is an afterthought. But
I think things are cyclical and there will be a time when
Texas-Oklahoma returns to national prominence.''
</P>
<P>
   And Texas-Oklahoma is not alone. The Florida State-Miami game is
not one of the top five games on tap for today, either. ``Who would
have thought that possible?'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   This decade has contributed to a drop-off in the national
profile of the Texas-Oklahoma series. Counting today, the teams
have entered the Cotton Bowl with a combined winning percentage of
.631. In no other decade has that number been as low.
</P>
<P>
   The best decade for the series was the 1970s. From 1970-79, the
Longhorns and Sooners entered the game with a combined 62-4-1
record, a winning percentage of .925. In the '70s, on eight
occasions both teams were ranked and six times both were
undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when I was at Texas in the early '70s, it didn't get
any bigger than that,'' Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes said. ``It was
really a big deal. I think it's still a showcase game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those games you look forward to because it's been
a rivalry for so long,'' Renfro said. It's probably the biggest
game for each team every year. There's a lot of testosterone
flowing. It's pretty intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to be an all-out brawl for 60 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown was Oklahoma's offensive coordinator in 1984, so he will
experience the rivalry from both sides when he descends the Cotton
Bowl ramp shortly before noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Barry (Switzer) hired me, he said, `You need to
understand there is one thing that is really important at Oklahoma,
and that's to beat Texas,''' Brown remembered.

DALLAS HOPING TO SCRIPT A BLOCKBUSTER ENDING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Hollywood ending, that's all Stars '98 lacked.
</P>
<P>
   While basking in the silence of a Stars locker room seconds
removed from a Western Conference Finals-ending, season-ending loss
to Detroit in Game 6 in June, team owner Tom Hicks realized how
close he was to having himself a blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly well-scripted season simply lacked an
audience-grabbing, good-guys-win finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically saw that we weren't able to match up with
Detroit,'' Hicks said. ``I went to Jim Lites and Bob Gainey and
said: `Bring me a proposal on what will make us match up with
Detroit.'''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure an ending fitting of a Presidents' Cup winner, general
manager Gainey and team president Lites suggested the Stars needed
two additional leading men, a Tom Cruise-like headliner and a
Steven Segal-like enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks opened his checkbook and signed on to almost $8 million in
additional payroll to go with $31.7 million he spent last season.
</P>
<P>
   He added ``Golden'' Brett Hull to a cast already peppered with
box-office draws like Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk and then
signed brawler Brent Severyn to safeguard his investment.
</P>
<P>
   Like adding Matt Damon to a cast that already had Leonardo
DiCaprio, the Stars have a possible ``Titanic'' brewing this
season. Then again, if another meltdown happens, this season might
play like ``Waterworld''.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated production premieres tonight at Reunion
Arena, and critics already acclaim that Dallas has assembled an
all-star cast capable of bringing back NHL's Oscar _ a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the pieces are in place to win a Stanley Cup,'' Gainey
said. ``In competition, though, things do not always unfold
according to script. A blockbuster has a lot of elements _ plot
twists, intrigue, hardship.''
Casting call
</P>
<P>
   Gainey began punching up the cast for this season July 3.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher remembers preparing to tee off
that day when his cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   His agent had news. Hatcher had a new teammate. The Stars had
signed Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking: `Now we can go do it,''' Hatcher said. ``I
think we would've made a run anyway, but the acquisition of him put
us that much closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting ``that much closer'' cost Hicks $17 million, a price tag
that comes standard with established box-office draws like a
``Golden'' Brett for three years. Severyn took another $425,000.
Hicks spent another $4.5 million to keep his supporting cast from
heading elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Craig Ludwig and forward Guy Carbonneau had already
been re-signed, and deals with defenseman Darryl Sydor and forward
Jamie Langenbrunner followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' leading man, Modano, had been satiated with a
six-year, $43.5 million contract late last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks spent a lot on talent this summer. The Stars have a
payroll around $39 million as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is set. Hicks said that's as big as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   A few critics evoke comparisons to a certain off-Broadway act
called the New York Rangers. That $45 million production failed to
land a playoff berth last season.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars have back-to-back Central Division championships
and added a Presidents' Trophy and a Western Conference finals
berth last season.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks has a break-even point for this season, too, a longer run
than last.
</P>
<P>
   A profit is highly unlikely until the new arena opens in 2000,
he said, when it's hoped a championship will pay off with sales of
luxury boxes and season-ticket packages.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he decided to field a winner at a loss. A happy
ending will provide an avenue to draw in a nontraditional hockey
fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it my investment,'' Hicks said. ``I realized that this
town loves a winner; look at the Cowboys and the Rangers. So I
decided to give them a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   It's up to Stars coach Ken Hitchcock to turn the ``pieces'' into
a winner from his rink-side director's chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the six-month battle you have to go through,''
Hitchcock said. ``If you ever want to the opportunity to play a
team like them sometime down the road when it's on the line, you
are going to have to get a lot better during the regular season.''
The storyline: us vs. `them'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine million dollars, six months, 82 games and likely two
playoff series just to get another shot at ``them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Stars locker room, ``them'' needs no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back Stanley Cup champion Detroit has played Lex Luthor
to Dallas' Superman, Darth Vader to Dallas' Luke Skywalker, Dr.
Evil to Dallas' Austin Powers.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-6-2 record against a deeper, stronger, better Red Wings
lineup last season frustrated them. Another winless season at Joe
Louis Arena buried them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we added Hull, it had nothing to do with beating Detroit.
People will say that, but it had nothing to do with it,'' Hitchcock
said. ``It had to do with our viewing of the 100 or so hockey games
we played last year. We had a very difficult time in long stretches
with offensive production. ... That deficiency, which was there
during the regular season, became more magnified in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it be the failed ending or an inability to match up with
``them,'' Hull is here and so far the reviews have been dazzling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Stanley Cup goes through Dallas,'' Edmonton
president and general manager Glen Sather said. ``Dallas
strengthened themselves the most. Look on paper and Dallas
seemingly solved a lot of problems that they had.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Stars return two proven goal scorers in Modano and
Nieuwendyk and added another in Hull.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Stars return goalie Ed Belfour and a defense that
allowed an NHL-best 1.88 goals against average.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Stars added an enforcer that everybody considered
so critical for the long-term health of the team.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the Stars added a blend of depth and pizzazz to match,
if not surpass, ``them.''
</P>
<P>
   So then does anything less than a Stanley Cup become a failure?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say that,'' Hicks said. ``In any sport,
you have to take small steps.''
The final script
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig says that before him waits a group of players better than
most he played with in Montreal, a big compliment considering that
group won a Stanley Cup in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a contender,'' he says of his Stars teammates. ``We're
not a championship team ... yet.''
</P>
<P>
   To go from being an extraordinary array of talent to a Stanley
Cup champion, he explains, requires a certain touch, the steps that
Hicks speaks of.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia had plenty of talent last season, and lacked
chemistry to turn that into a Stanley Cup. Big-bucks forwards Eric
Lindros and Chris Gratton were unable to turn a 95-point season
into anything better than a first-round playoff loss.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has talent that was good enough to win a Stanley Cup in
1996, and has lacked only toughness to return to Stanley Cup form.
Coach Marc Crawford had bailed from frustration by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a lot of talent last season, and lacked health to
turn that into a Stanley Cup season. The Stars lost 318 man games
to injury last season, including long absences by guys like Modano
and Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modano and Nieuwendyk getting hurt, that may happen again,''
Sather said. ``Bryan Marchment is still out there lurking, waiting
in the wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchment sidelined Nieuwendyk less than 20 minutes into last
season's playoff opener with a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
Many, like Sather, felt that kept Dallas from a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Minus Nieuwendyk, the Stars lacked enough firepower to topple
the Red Empire in a Western Conference Finals showdown. Modano,
Carbonneau and Jere Lehtinen accounted for six of the Stars' 11
goals in that series.
</P>
<P>
   Even with casting changes, a few questions will need to be
answered in the season-long script.
</P>
<P>
   How will Modano blend with Hull? Will the Stars be able to avoid
injury? Can the second line score in the playoffs? Will Belfour be
Superman in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   And the real cliffhanger, will it all be enough to win a Stanley
Cup?
Cue the ending
</P>
<P>
   If Hitchcock learned anything last season, it's this:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are one step away, you might as well be 100 steps away
because that one step will keep you away forever,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   While bringing in Hull and Severyn has brought them closer,
final reviews will depend a lot on the ending.
</P>
<P>
   So how far away are they from producing a blockbuster instead of
a bust?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the hard thing to define,'' Gainey said. ``Maybe, the
better question is how far away were we. We were, last year, too
far away.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the fans saw their Stars, they were limping off
into the sunset without the Cup, without the girl and without
defeating the Red Empire.
</P>
<P>
   End of season. Roll credits.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup, the girl and the empire still waits.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to give patients more power in dealing
with health insurance companies died Friday, a casualty of heavy
lobbying by the insurance industry and of the sex scandal that has
enveloped President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents said similar legislation would be back
in 1999. But this year's struggle shows once again how difficult it
is to pass health care legislation affecting doctors, patients,
lawyers, insurers and employers of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the demise of Clinton's plan for universal health
insurance in 1994, he and his allies in Congress have tried to
achieve the same goal step by step. But even these proposals have
set off fierce fights about the proper role of government in
regulating one of the nation's biggest industries.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 50-47 Friday in the waning hours of the 105th
Congress, the Senate rejected a Democratic move to take up a bill
to define patients' rights and to regulate health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' rush to adjournment hit a big bump Friday when Clinton
demanded money for education initiatives that he proposed early
this year. Senior lawmakers said they would work through the
weekend and negotiate with the White House as they try to complete
work on bills to finance the operations of the federal government
in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill defining patients' rights was needed to
protect millions of Americans who have had problems with HMOs. They
asserted that conservative Republican senators like Trent Lott of
Mississippi and Don Nickles of Oklahoma never really wanted a bill,
and worked with insurers to sidetrack legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, who introduced their own bill to define
patients' rights in July, said Friday that Democrats had passed up
many opportunities for compromise because the Democrats wanted an
election issue more than they wanted a new law. Democratic
candidates are, in fact, campaigning on the issue. But some
Republican candidates are also promising to pass legislation
helping HMO patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``Big money and powerful
special interests kept us from debating this issue in the United
States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, said, ``Passage
of real patient protections should have been the highest priority
of this session of Congress,'' but Republicans ``thwarted us at
every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican bill was narrower in scope than the
Democratic bill. The Democrats said their legislation would have
covered three times as many people as the Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nickles, the assistant majority leader, said,
``The Democrats trashed our proposal and never tried to work with
us to come up with common elements that could become law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged that HMO patients
had ``some legitimate concerns and problems,'' and he added, ``I do
believe that we are going to address this next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a bill to define patients' rights and regulate
HMOs in July. But in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans had such
profound disagreements that they could not even get such
legislation to the floor for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The measures considered this year, known as the Patient
Protection Act and the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, would have
guaranteed access to emergency care and medical specialists and
would have permitted patients to appeal the denial of care to an
independent panel of medical experts. The Democratic bills would
also have made it easier for patients to sue HMOs and recover
damages for the improper denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress sets uniform national standards for health
insurance, that would be a major departure from the practice of the
last half-century. Such insurance is regulated mainly by the
states. Standards vary widely, and federal law severely limits the
states' ability to regulate employee health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the outlines of a potential compromise were
discernible in May. But Democrats were reluctant to compromise.
After months of haggling over procedural questions, Senate
Republicans eventually concluded that they did not have to deal
with the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer pleas for congressional action were ultimately drowned
out in the debate over the possible impeachment of Clinton, and he
had no political leverage to force Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of HMOs, insurance companies and employers _ the
Health Benefits Coalition _ vehemently opposed new federal mandates
on health plans, saying such requirements would increase costs and
reduce the number of people with coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition began its lobbying and advertising campaign on
Jan. 21, the day of the first news reports about the president's
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton gave many speeches about HMO
legislation, but his fight for the legislation suffered as he
devoted more and more of his energy to fighting for the survival of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's summer recess, from July 31 to Aug. 31, was a
turning point. ``August was not about health care,'' said Suzanne
DeFrancis, vice president of Porter Novelli, an advertising and
public relations company that worked with the Health Benefits
Coalition. ``August was about Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted his affair with Ms. Lewinsky in a televised
speech on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who led the fight for a bill to give patients more
power in dealing with health insurers, said, ``To the extent that
the public was focused on the whole White House problem, it may
have emboldened the Republicans to shut us out of debate on HMO
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits Coalition, who is
also vice president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, said the coalition had spent ``a little over $2 million''
on lobbying and advertising against HMO bills. In addition, he
said, ``our member organizations have probably spent another $1
million on advertising, and that does not include the cost of staff
work and time spent on fax, phone calls, direct mail and tens of
thousands of action alerts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Danner said the money was well spent. ``It's a good investment
for the next Congress,'' he said. ``This issue will definitely be
back, for two reasons. The number of uninsured people continues to
go up. And after several years of relatively flat premiums, we now
expect more significant increases in the cost of health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to pick up seats in the House and the
Senate next month, so there may be more hostility to government
regulation in the next Congress. On the other hand, the whole issue
of regulating HMOs may be swept up in presidential politics if one
or more candidates stress the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable,
which represents 200 large companies, said the group had spent $1
million on its own radio and newspaper advertisements against HMO
legislation. The coalition and the Business Roundtable ran
advertising in 23 states, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Two House Republicans, Charlie Norwood of Georgia and Greg
Ganske of Iowa, continually prodded their party leaders to pass a
bill defining patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Norwood said: ``I am very
disappointed that the Senate has not moved a bill. Senators did not
act because they didn't have to. Their mind is on Clinton's
problems. You can't carry on a conversation up here for more than
one minute before impeachment comes up. The Senate put off the
health care issue, but it's not going away. I will butt my head
against this wall until we get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Rickard, senior vice president of Ryder System Inc., the
transportation service company, who coordinated the lobbying for
the Business Roundtable, said: ``This year started out with
tremendous momentum for a patients' bill of rights. There is a
strong probability that legislation would have passed in the
absence of our efforts to educate Congress and the public about the
costs of such mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Taylor, chief lobbyist at the AFL-CIO, said: ``Senate
Republicans got away with an amazing tactic. They pulled
legislation from the floor whenever it appeared that Democrats
would offer patient protections as an amendment, and the
Republicans were afraid to bring up their own sham bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidates say frustration with HMOs still seems
to be running high outside Washington. A survey by the National
Journal found that campaign advertisements mentioning health
insurance far outnumbered those referring to the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put patients and doctors back in charge of medical
decisions, not managed care bureaucrats,'' Gail Riecken, the
Democratic candidate in Indiana's 8th Congressional District, says
in one commercial. In another, Shelley Berkley of Las Vegas tells
voters, ``I believe all of us should have the right to choose our
own doctor, see a specialist when we need one and know that medical
decisions are being made by doctors and patients, not accountants
and clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., who is running for re-election,
promises legislation to ``hold HMOs 100 percent accountable for
improper care.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said: ``Health care is not a Democrat
issue any more. We are not afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that some Republican candidates for the House, like
Ernest Fletcher in Kentucky, were promising to fight for HMO
legislation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ The last time Wendell Williamson drew
national attention, it was one January day in 1995. He seemed to
come out of nowhere, firing an M-1 rifle on a busy street near the
campus of the University of North Carolina, where he was a law
student, and killing two men he had never met.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Chapel Hill shootings made headlines for a few
days. But at Williamson's trial, the jury found him not guilty by
reason of insanity, accepting his lawyer's argument that he
suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and had believed he was saving
the world with his random killings.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next turned the case into one that has captured
the attention of lawyers and mental health experts across the
country. From his room in a state psychiatric ward, Williamson sued
a psychiatrist who had seen him just half a dozen times, the last
occasion eight months before the killings. Williamson contended
that the doctor, Myron B. Liptzin, had not made a correct
diagnosis, had not explained how seriously ill Williamson was and
had not followed up after their sessions ended.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Williamson won a jury verdict of $500,000 that has
provoked a furor in North Carolina and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Although violent criminals have won malpractice cases against
their therapists before, critics of this verdict say its size and
Williamson's notoriety send a destructive message: that the legal
system is willing to let people hold someone else accountable for
their actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the attempt to shift responsibility in our
society,'' said Bruce Berger, a Raleigh lawyer who represents
Liptzin. ``Nobody's responsible for their own actions anymore. It's
always somebody else's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers across the state have called the verdict ``another
tragedy'' that ``bodes ill for society.'' Psychiatrists here and
around the country say the verdict may discourage therapists from
treating psychotic patients. Liptzin himself says that the facts do
not support the verdict and that he will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the verdict, including lawyers' groups and
advocates for the mentally ill, say it stands for nothing more than
that two categories of people are entitled to appropriate care of
the psychologically disturbed: the disturbed people themselves and
the people they might injure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week at the state hospital where, under the
verdict in the criminal case, he is required to live in a locked
psychiatric ward until he can prove he is no longer a danger,
Williamson, now 30, said the verdict in the civil case showed that
he and the people he killed were all victims of Liptzin's failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The murders would not have happened if Dr. Liptzin had done
his job properly,'' Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson testified at the trial of his suit last month,
telling the jurors that Liptzin ``had more control over the
situation than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Liptzin, who also testified, said in an interview that the
verdict ``makes no sense.'' Part of the rationale for his appeal,
he said, is that the verdict seems to establish a rule that
psychiatrists should police their patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person is ultimately responsible for himself,'' Liptzin
said. ``How can I be responsible for something that is not
predictable?''
</P>
<P>
   Liptzin acknowledges that he did not find Williamson to be a
paranoid schizophrenic. But his reports show that he did diagnose
psychosis with ``delusional disorder grandiose.'' Liptzin says the
treatments for the two conditions would be identical, while
Williamson's lawyers say Liptzin's diagnosis significantly
understated the patient's problems.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, held in Orange County Superior Court in Hillsborough,
expert witnesses hired by Williamson's lawyer told the jurors that
Liptzin had not given Williamson the care other psychiatrists
typically provide. Liptzin's experts said he had done all that any
reasonable psychiatrist could.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, four of the jurors said the panel had been most
troubled by the fact that Liptzin had not appeared to stress to
Williamson how ill he was and had not given him a specific referral
to another psychiatrist at the end of their six sessions. (Liptzin,
now 64, was then about to retire.)
</P>
<P>
   Williamson says Liptzin was ``wishy washy'' about how sick he
was. Liptzin said that, if he was gentle in his talks with
Williamson, it was because he had learned that such highly
intelligent but disturbed patients respond better to invitations to
cooperate in their treatment than to orders from psychiatrists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Liptzin was treating Williamson as if he had a cold,'' not
a serious mental illness, said Gordon Poer, one of the jurors.
</P>
<P>
   But Liptzin said Williamson clearly understood the severity of
his condition. No doctor, he said, could be expected to continually
monitor a patient who seemed to be progressing to guarantee that he
did not launch a psychotic assault eight months later.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Liptzin and Williamson were first brought together in 1994, when
a dean at the law school persuaded Williamson to go to the student
health service. Williamson had disrupted a class by insisting that
he had telepathic powers. Liptzin was then director of psychiatric
services for the university's student health services.
</P>
<P>
   Liptzin soon learned Williamson had been suffering psychological
problems for several years. Williamson, a slender young man with a
stylish bush of curly brown hair, had been an Eagle Scout, swim
team captain and student body president in high school. He had
graduated with honors from the university here. But by the time
they met, the young man talked incessantly about being ``the
world's first telepath.'' He described how other people could
inflict excruciating pain on his shoulder with their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier, the doctor learned, Williamson had been
involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for a time after
campus police picked him up for screaming at students in a busy
campus gathering place. He hit himself in the face until he cried.
He told doctors then that a voice from ``the thing'' tormented him
with grotesque images.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in 1992 had released him after the short hospitalization
because there was no evidence he was a danger to anyone. Doctors
had noted in their records, though, that Williamson kept a gun in
his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the civil case agreed that Williamson improved while
seeing Liptzin. The patient began taking anti-psychotic medication
and was able to finish the semester. By then, the gun was back at
his family's home in the western North Carolina mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened when Williamson and Liptzin parted after
the six visits is a matter of dispute. Liptzin testified that
Williamson understood he was seriously ill and would have to seek
out a different psychiatrist if he needed to continue his treatment
because Liptzin was retiring that summer. Liptzin acknowledged he
did not give Williamson a specific referral to another doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson said he had not understood he was seriously ill.
Liptzin gave him the impression that he could experiment with going
off his medication if he told someone like his mother that he was
doing so. He stopped taking the medication. ``He seemed OK,'' his
mother, Fonda Williamson, said as she waited outside Broughton
State Hospital in Morganton, N.C. for a visit with her heavily
medicated son this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents aren't in control of a grown man with a delusional
mental illness,'' Mrs. Williamson said. ``All we had to go on was
what he told us.'' Neither Liptzin, nor anyone else, she said, ever
told her or her husband the details of his problems. She said the
first time she ever heard the term ``paranoid schizophrenic'' was
after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   After the summer at home in 1994, Williamson returned to Chapel
Hill that fall. His psychological deterioration resumed. That
January, he made his careful plans and walked down Chapel Hill's
Henderson Street with the rifle he had brought back to school and
hundreds of rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict on Sept. 21, state officials have said they
will make legal claims to have the state take much of any award
Williamson might one day receive from Liptzin's insurance company.
The officials say the state is entitled to be compensated for the
costs of Williamson's hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that Liptzin, 64, had no way of knowing on that
January Thursday that his former patient had carefully gathered
hundreds of rounds of ammunition and prepared a backpack with such
items as rope and condoms to deal with any hostages he might end up
with that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the families of Williamson's victims say his $500,000
victory is a fresh assault. Carol Reichardt's son Kevin, was 20
that January afternoon when he was bicycling down Henderson Street
on his way to a college class. Williamson blew him off the bicycle
with a shot powerful enough to pass through a truck and then
pursued him with the rifle at close range as he tried to crawl to
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Reichardt said she believed Liptzin and many other people
at the university could have intervened as Williamson's
psychological problems became obvious. If they had, she said, she
is sure her son would be alive today. The other victim was Ralph W.
Walker Jr., 42, a restaurant worker who was killed when he opened
his front door to leave for work.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, her family feels it has twice been denied
justice while Williamson had been rewarded. ``He knows,'' she said,
``how to work the system.''

CONGRESS PASSES STOPGAP FUNDING BILL TO KEEP GOVERNMENT RUNNING
THROUGH MONDAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a repeat of the stalemate that led to government
shutdowns three years ago, Congress was forced Friday to pass a
stopgap funding bill to keep federal agencies running through
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency measure, approved unanimously in the House and by
voice vote in the Senate, is necessary because Republican leaders
and the White House have been unable to reach agreement on a final
package of 1999 spending measures.
</P>
<P>
   Although both sides continued to express hope that their
differences over hundreds of items could be settled during weekend
negotiations, each staked out hard-line positions that, if
unresolved, could lead to a partial government closing early next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days into the 1999 fiscal year, the Republican-led Congress
has passed only six of the 13 major appropriations bills needed to
fund government departments and agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to finish up and begin campaigning for re-election,
lawmakers are trying to roll at least a half-dozen of the remaining
measures into one catchall measure known as an omnibus bill.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But President Clinton has threatened to veto the legislation
if it does not include his demand for about $4 billion in
additional education funding. The money would be used to help hire
more teachers, remodel and build more schools.
</P>
<P>
   GOP members insist on holding the line on new spending. Rep.
Harold Rogers, R-Ky., described Clinton's requests as ``frills''
that could not be paid for under the strict spending limits agreed
to in the 1997 balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP also accuses Clinton of trying to tap into the fiscal
1988 surplus to pay for his programs. Republicans prefer to use the
surplus to fund tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance at the White House with Democratic leaders,
Clinton blasted the Republicans as architects of a ``do-nothing''
Congress, noting that they had killed tobacco legislation, campaign
finance reform, a new minimum wage law and the so-called patients`
bill of rights that Democrats had tried to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget is purely and simply a test of whether after nine
months of doing nothing we are going to do the right thing about
our children's future,'' he said, adding that lawmakers ``should
not go home until they pass a budget that will strengthen our
public schools for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was determined to use the 1999 education
spending to ``make a down payment'' on hiring 100,000 new teachers
and reducing class size in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans responded that the president was simply trying to
play up differences over education matters to ``invigorate'' the
Democratic Party's base in the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not willing to increase spending so that the American
people's surplus is spent by this government,'' said House Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders also stressed that they are ``committed'' to
avoiding a repeat of the two government shutdowns. The GOP got most
of the political blame for those closings, and suffered some
setbacks in the 1996 elections because of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to work tomorrow. We may work Sunday. We are
going to stay here until we get the people's business done,'' said
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress had failed to pass the short-term spending measure
Friday, most government operations would have come to a halt at
midnight when another stopgap budget measure, passed two weeks ago,
was due to expire.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress fails to reach an agreement with Clinton over the
weekend, another short-term measure would have to be approved to
keep agencies operating beyond Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the standoff Friday ensued because of a dispute over
education, other issues are also standing in the way of a final
spending agreement. They include funding and reform measures for
the International Monetary Fund, anti-abortion and
anti-environmental provisions, disagreements over how the 2000
Census should be conducted, and arguments over more than 150 items
contained in the individual spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some lawmakers have complicated the negotiations by
trying to attach favored provisions to the spending bills, moves
that could create more barriers between the White House and
Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, wants language
added to the omnibus measure that would prevent the federal
government from claiming a large share of settlement money that
Texas and other states might get from tobacco companies. Billions
are at stake, but Hutchison's language would limit Washington's
take to $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal by Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., would make changes to the
military pension system to make it easier for people who had served
for 20 years to get an increased pension, a measure that would add
millions to future government outlays.
</P>
<P>
   On the more ``absurd side,'' as one congressional official put
it, is language that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
wants to add that would delay the start of duck-hunting season in
his state by a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers prepared to dicker over the spending bill
language and other weightier policy matters, government agencies
were preparing themselves for the possibility of a shutdown next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Bosses dusted off their emergency closing plans, which they used
during the two partial shutdowns in late 1995 and early 1996, and
began making decisions about which employees would have to report
to work and which ones would be furloughed until spending matters
are settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep hearing them say, `We're not going to shut the
government down,' but I'm not sure any of us really believe that,''
said one Justice Department official. &QL;

NEW YORK GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE EMBRACES CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With his campaign in demonstrable trouble, Peter
Vallone, the Democratic candidate for governor of New York, has
adopted the novel strategy of embracing Bill Clinton, even as most
other Democrats are keeping the beleaguered _ but still popular _
president at arms' length.
</P>
<P>
   In his newest advertisement, Vallone, speaker of the New York
City Council, defends the president, says he has been an ardent
supporter of New York, and urges the country to move on. ``I think
it's time someone stood up for President Clinton and stood up to
all the Republicans who are trying to tear him down,'' Vallone
somberly intones, as he stares straight into the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure the president if necessary,'' the speaker concludes in
the 30-second ad, which began airing statewide Thursday night.
``Then forgive him and move on for the good in our hearts and for
the good of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic candidates around the country to stand with the
president, but Vallone is, according to political strategists, the
only Democrat running for significant office to use a defense of
Clinton as a campaign tactic. Even though the president remains
popular _ even more popular in New York than elsewhere _ Vallone's
decision to use his dwindling cash to broadcast support for the
president is surprising. Governors _ and candidates for governor _
have no direct involvement with matters of impeachment,
</P>
<P>
   But the ad does set Vallone apart, which, the speaker's camp is
evidently hoping, might help his faltering campaign against a
popular incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad premiered, coincidentally, the same day that a
Times/CBS News Poll of the governor's race showed the Republican
incumbent, George Pataki, with a 2-1 lead over Vallone. The poll
also indicated that the speaker was barely known outside of New
York City and that even in the city, where registration is
overwhelmingly Democratic, he and Pataki are in a dead heat:
Vallone 39 percent, Pataki 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone's campaign manager, Kevin McCabe, said the campaign was
making a ``substantial buy'' throughout the state with the ad,
which was produced by Doak, Carrier &AMP; O'Donnell, but was not
specific. As of the beginning of this month, Vallone had only
$250,000 in his campaign treasury, compared to Pataki's $9 million,
but the speaker is continuing to raise money. Most will go to
television advertising, according to a campaign aide.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said that he thought Vallone was ``the only major
candidate in the country on the air defending the president.'' A
spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, Tony Wyche,
agreed. ``To our knowledge, this is the first such ad, in terms of
paid advertising by candidates,'' he said. Jennifer Duffy, an
editor at the Cook Political Report, a national newsletter based in
Washington, also said she knew of no Democratic candidates running
similar advertisements. Several Republicans are running political
commercials critical of the president, she added.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe said that the speaker was moved to run the ad because he
felt strongly about a subject that has obsessed the whole country.
Referring to Vallone, McCabe said, ``A light goes off in his head:
`People ought to know where you stand on this stuff.'''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vallone, ``I think that I reflect the opinion of most New
Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times/CBS News Poll released this week, well after
the Vallone campaign says it decided on the new ad, supports
Vallone on that score. The poll found that while 67 percent of
Americans approved of Clinton's job performance, New Yorkers had an
even more favorable opinion, with 75 percent saying they approved
of the way he was handling his job.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Roemer, co-chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
said he thought the Vallone approach would be effective in New York
because the president remains popular there, but ``it may not be
the thing you would do in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   In another finding that would encourage Vallone's new strategy,
registered voters who participated in the poll indicated in
overwhelming numbers _ 74 percent _ that Clinton's troubles would
have ``no effect'' on their vote this fall in the race for U.S.
Senate. Although the question was not asked in the poll of the
governor's race, it is likely that voters would have similar
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Given the president's popularity, especially in New York, most
political analysts described the advertisement as savvy. ``It's not
a bad move,'' said Henry Sheinkopf, a Democratic political
consultant who is not working for a gubernatorial candidate. It
gives Vallone ``an instant ID on issue people feel strongly
about,'' Sheinkopf continued, adding that it would also separate
him from the Republicans. ``Of course,'' he added, ``it has nothing
to do with the governor's race.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts said the advertisement also spoke to the deep
trouble Vallone's campaign is in just three and a weeks before the
primary. Several said it was a clear attempt to rally his
Democratic base _ African Americans, liberals, gays, women and
other groups that have generally strongly supported Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``To spend limited resources now appealing to people so close to
you ideologically and politically is a real danger sign,'' said
Philip Friedman, a political strategist not involved in the
Vallone-Pataki campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a difficult race,'' McCabe acknowledged. ``But
there's some freedom in having a difficult race.''
</P>
<P>
   Though governors have no role in impeachment proceedings,
Vallone defended the ad as relevant because he is the Democrat
running for the highest office in New York, and in the ad
criticizes Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican
incumbent. ``Now Al D'Amato, George Pataki and the Republican Party
are determined to bring the president down _ even if it means
hurting our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, in fact, has maintained a studied silence on the
president's travails, which drew an attack from Vallone at a news
conference on Thursday. ``I think sometimes silence is worse than
taking a stand,'' Vallone said. ``I think the governor should come
out and take a stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's campaign spokesman, Michael Marr, described the ad as
``nothing more than a publicity stunt by a candidate who has no
message, no money and no momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said the White House did not ask him to make the ad, nor
did he ask its permission. And, he insisted, it was not an effort
to elicit more fund-raising help from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vice President Al Gore spent the day campaigning
with Vallone, including making appearances at two fund-raisers, and
Clinton is scheduled to campaign with him on Monday. The president
will also appear with Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, the
Democrat challenging D'Amato. Schumer has not shied away from
Clinton, though he is not featuring him in any ads.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in this campaign season, Vallone did distance himself
from the president. He declined to attend Clinton's fund-raiser for
the Democratic Party the night before the Democratic primary, first
saying that he had pressing campaign commitments and then that he
wanted to have dinner with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only candidate now trying align himself with the
president as Election Day nears. In September, Parris Glendening,
the Democratic governor of Maryland, publicly snubbed the
president, declining to show up at an event with him and then
canceling a planned fund-raiser with him.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, he backtracked, seeking Clinton's help
campaigning, as polls showed his opponent, Ellen Sauerbrey, closing
in. Political analysts said Glendening may have been concerned
about losing support among traditional Democrats, especially
African American voters, who, polls have shown, have been
consistently supportive of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Political strategists say Vallone appears to have a similar
worry. ``This is an ad to me that speaks to Democrats, not voters
as a group,'' said Ms. Duffy, of the Cook Political Report. ``I
don't think it's going to change the ultimate outcome, but what it
might do is prevent it from being more of a wipeout.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, the political strategist, praised Vallone for ``saying
the right thing at the right time clearly and well.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said the advertisement would appeal to core Democrats,
but said he doubted that people would vote for Vallone because of
his position on a national issue. If that is the Vallone strategy,
it is ``a bit of a stretch,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone said on Thursday that he decided to air the commercial
not to get more votes, but because ``it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCabe, his campaign manager, hinted at a less lofty motive.
`We'll see if it starts to resonate,'' he said of the commercial.
``We should get some movement.''

A U.S. MESSAGE TO MILOSEVIC TURNS INTO FULL-DRESS TALKS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ What was initially described as a mission
of Richard Holbrooke delivering a message to Slobodan Milosevic _
comply or else on Kosovo _ has turned into negotiations that are
being dubbed a ``mini-Dayton,'' U.S. officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. envoy, Holbrooke, who negotiated an end to the war in
Bosnia with a plan that was signed in Dayton, Ohio, ended his fifth
session with the Yugoslav leader late Friday evening. The pair were
expected to continue negotiating over the weekend and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of more than eight hours of talks Friday, Holbrooke
had nothing to say to reporters about the likelihood of a NATO
attack on Serbia. But one U.S. official familiar with the
negotiations that started Monday said Holbrooke had ``made some
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the outcome of Holbrooke's efforts could
still go either way: NATO airstrikes against Milosevic or a
peaceful resolution to the crisis that would include some kind of
international presence in Kosovo over the approaching winter.
</P>
<P>
   The international presence would accomplish two things.
</P>
<P>
   One would be to allow the verification of the withdrawal of
extra Yugoslav army and Serbian police sent to Kosovo to snuff out
a separatist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal would be to ensure that the more than 250,000
ethnic Albanian refugees whose homes were torched by the Serb
forces be allowed to return to their villages and prepare for the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   A solution could include a ``light'' NATO contingent and a
``heavy'' civilian presence, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations headed for more sessions, some similarities
with the diplomacy that ended the Bosnia conflict were being drawn.
Holbrooke is accompanied by a State Department lawyer, Jim O'Brien,
a special assistant to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
drew up the the legal framework of the Dayton documents. Holbrooke
is also accompanied by two high-ranking army generals.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, has been
assigned the task of talking to the ethnic Albanian leadership in
Kosovo and is expected to travel there Saturday, while Holbrooke
plugs along with Milosevic. Hill will be carrying with him an
interim plan for the political status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While the focus is on Milosevic, whose forces have rampaged
through ethnic Albanian villages for the last three months, the
ethnic Albanian leadership in Kosovo has raised the demand of
independence that Washington says it cannot support. Thus the
ethnic Albanians have to be persuaded to accept a political plan
that puts off the question of Kosovo's status for three years but
does allow for greater Albanian representation in Kosovo's
government in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said there were certain incentives built into
Holbrooke's offer to Milosevic that boiled down to the notion that
the easier the Yugoslav leader makes it for the West, the more he
gets. The harder Milosevic makes it, the less he gets.
</P>
<P>
   The outline of Holbrooke's approach appears to bank on the
notion that Milosevic should accept a peaceful resolution in order
to get a problem off his hands. ``He's spending 76 percent of his
budget on security while the rest of the country goes to hell,''
said a U.S. official. ``That causes problems for him.''
</P>
<P>
   A sign that Holbrooke and Milosevic might be inching toward some
middle ground came from Milsovic's side too. Two days ago, he
denounced the threats of NATO attacks as ``criminal aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, state controlled television, which is Milosevic's
mouthpiece to his public, was more mellow. An announcement said
that it was hoped that ``common reason would prevail'' and that a
``peaceful solution'' could be found.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate of Holbrooke's demands concerns the
withdrawal of the extra military and police from Kosovo to
positions they held before fighting started in March and putting
away of heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian special security police who Washington asserts are
responsible for atrocities against ethnic Albanians have to be
``reformatted'' in a way that restores some confidence to the
ethnic Albanians, a U.S. official said. The ethnic Albanians
outnumber Serbs in the province by nine to one but the police and
military forces are entirely Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   It is the visible presence of these security police, some of
whom can still be seen in their vehicles near the ethnic Albanian
villages they destroyed, who are intimidating the refugees from
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   The separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, which appears to have
been weakened but not smashed by the Serbian tank and artillery
offensive, announced a formal cease-fire Friday. The guerrillas
said they would suspend operations ``out of respect'' for the
negotiating efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In both Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, and in Belgrade,
international aid workers began an exodus from Serbia. The U.N.
high commissioner for refugees said it was withdrawing most of its
foreign staff in anticipation of a NATO attack. Western embassies
continued to send non-essential staff and families by road to
Hungary Friday.

DOCTORS USING HYBRID EGG FOR INFERTILE OLDER WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors in New York have become the first to try to make an
infertile woman pregnant by plucking the genes out of one of her
eggs and inserting them into a younger woman's egg that has had its
own genes removed. The resulting hybrid egg is then fertilized and
placed into the older woman's womb.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether anyone treated with the technique has
become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new technique has been described by its developer,
Dr. James Grifo of New York University, as an effort to help women
with longstanding infertility, other scientists have called it a
step toward human cloning and said it raises troubling ethical and
medical questions.
</P>
<P>
   Grifo declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn O'Dell, a spokeswoman for New York University, said the
technique was intended to help older women, particularly those for
whom in vitro fertilization had failed, to give birth to children
who are their own genetic offspring. Currently, the only way some
of those women can become pregnant is to use an egg donated by
another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Grifo reported at a medical conference on Thursday that he and
his colleagues had tried the new technique in just two patients so
far. The first woman, 47 years old, did not become pregnant, and
the second, age 44, underwent the procedure only last week and has
not yet had a pregnancy test.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is based on the theory that many older women are
infertile not because of problems with the DNA in their eggs but
because of the age of the cytoplasm, which contains cell
structures, chemicals and nutrients needed to support the egg's
growth and development.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Keith Latham, a developmental biologist at Temple University
in Philadelphia, said Grifo's technique might have unforeseen
risks. Combining the cytoplasm of one woman's egg with another
woman's genes could cause problems, Latham said.
</P>
<P>
   Cytoplasm plays an important role in programming the expression
of genes from both the sperm and the egg, he explained. In this
case, the maternal genes will have been programmed by the older
mother's cytoplasm, but then they and the sperm will be acted on by
the younger woman's cytoplasm.
</P>
<P>
   The different sets of instructions might conflict, he said. He
noted that similar experiments in mice had resulted in
abnormalities that were passed on to succeeding generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're creating something here that never exists in nature,''
he said. ``It's an admirable objective to help infertile couples
have children, but in this case, the application is going way ahead
of knowledge of the scientific or biological consequences. We have
no idea what the potential is for birth defects, or problems in
children in the next generation. It amounts to experimentation on
humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lee Silver, a molecular biologist at Princeton University,
said: ``What's most fantastic is that this is exactly the
technology used for cloning. It's nuclear transfer, exactly what
you would do in cloning, except in cloning you would be
transferring an adult cell.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The technique, Silver said, is just ``the first step along the
way'' to human cloning.
</P>
<P>
   The technique also has philosophical implications, he said,
because any children from it will carry some genetic material that
came from the woman who donated the egg.
</P>
<P>
   That is because eggs contain structures called mitochondria,
which are important in cell metabolism and also carry genetic
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls will pass on this foreign mitochondrial DNA to all their
children, and so on,'' Silver said. ``These will be the first
germ-line genetically engineered children.''

BILL TO PUNISH NATIONS DENYING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM PASSES SENATE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Friday unanimously approved a compromise
bill that would require the government to deal with countries that
persecute citizens for religious beliefs by using measures ranging
from the mildest private rebuke to tough economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the International Religious Freedom Act, would not
force the president to impose automatic sanctions but would allow
him to decide whether and how to act against violators. It would
require the State Department to issue annual reports of each
country's record on religious freedom, and would require the
president to take action based on those reviews. As a check on the
administration, the bill would create a 10-member independent
commission that would publish its own review of religious liberties
country-by-country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragic reality is that literally millions of religious
believers elsewhere in the world live under constant, oppressive
fear at the prospect of being arrested, imprisoned, tortured or
even killed, simply for their religious faith,'' said Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill grew from an effort more than a year ago by the
Christian Coalition and other conservative religious groups to
require the government to step up its fight against religious
persecution from Sudan to China.
</P>
<P>
   It struck a chord in the corridors of Capitol Hill as well as in
churches and synagogues across the country, and was soon embraced
by religious organizations including the Episcopal Church and the
American Jewish Committee. ``No government has the right to tell
people how to worship and certainly not the right to discriminate
against them or persecute them for the way in which they choose to
express their faith in God,'' said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   But it took weeks of closed-door negotiations before the Senate
Friday approved a compromise measure, 98-0. The negotiators agreed
to give the president greater discretion in determining which
penalities to impose on countries.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders whisked the bill to the House, where speedy
approval is expected this weekend. Administration officials said
Clinton would sign the bill, reversing earlier threats of a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the legislation would fulfill a promise that House
and Senate Republican leaders made earlier this year to
conservative religious groups, handing conservatives a rare
legislative accomplishment to campaign on with the congressional
elections less than a month away.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles said the bill's supporters were not ``trying to score
points'' but rather to ``change the behavior of countries around
the world to allow more religious freedoms.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation cited a stream of gruesome
incidents _ from the killing of Christians in Pakistan and Sudan to
the torture of Tibetan Buddhist monks _ as evidence that stricter
measures were needed.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming support for the legislation masked differences
among Republicans over the bill. Social conservatives like the
Christian Coalition say the measure is essential to protect
religious freedom worldwide. But moderates and business groups,
like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the bill's sanctions would
alienate important diplomatic and trade partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``While well-intended, this bill could easily become
counterproductive to U.S. interests and foreign policy
objectives,'' said Frank Kittredge, vice chairman of USA Engage, a
coalition of 676 small and large business, farm groups and trade
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials took advantage of the Republican
divisions, and of the eagerness of Republican leaders to produce a
bill before Congress adjourns in the next few days, to wring the
last-minute concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill advances the cause of religious freedom and gives the
president the flexibility he needs without undermining relations
with important countries around the world,'' said Stuart Eizenstat,
an undersecretary of state who was the administration's chief
negotiator with Congress on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation calls for the State Department to conduct annual
reviews of religious freedoms just as the department does now on
human rights. The bill would create a new office within the State
Department, headed by an official with ambassadorial rank, to
monitor religious liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those reports and other information, the administration
would determine whether a country violated citizens' religious
beliefs and should be punished. The toughest economic sanctions,
including U.S. opposition to loans by international financial
institutions, would be imposed only on countries that engaged in
``systematic, on-going and egregious'' violations like torture or
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   The president would be allowed to waive sanctions for ``national
interests'' or if the administration deemed that the penalties
might provoke a popular backlash against religious minorities.
Relief aid would be exempt from sanctions. The independent
commission mandated by the bill would publish its own review of
religious liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I am not eager to enact a new sanctions law, I
believe we are setting an important precedent with this bill in
terms of what should be contained in any sanctions law,'' said Sen.
Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Administration officials and the bill's two chief sponsors,
Nickles and Lieberman, hammered out the final details late on
Wednesday, Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>
   In late September, Nickles altered his original bill to win the
support of two Republicans, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Rod Grams
of Minnesota, who had bottled up the legislation in committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bill that will focus America's attention on the
desire to advance religious freedom around the world while doing no
harm to America's national security, diplomatic or economic
interests abroad,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage of the legislation culminated more than a year of
congressional action on the measure, which has been considerably
softened over time.
</P>
<P>
   In May the House voted, 375-41, to impose automatic sanctions
against countries that permit or endorse a pattern of violent
attacks or other persecution against religious believers.
</P>
<P>
   But the House bill faced immediate and immovable opposition in
the Senate because of Republican resistance to automatic economic
sanctions. Senators also complained that the original House bill
would indiscriminately sanction close allies like Saudi Arabia,
Germany, Israel and Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with what they considered a weaker bill or no bill at all,
House leaders quickly embraced the Senate version.

CHARGES MADE AGAINST DRUG DEALERS WHO CATERED TO OFFICE WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Law-enforcement officials announced the indictments
Friday of 102 members of a sophisticated drug operation that
discreetly sold millions of dollars' worth of crack cocaine to
white-collar workers in midtown Manhattan over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Careful not to draw attention to themselves, the dealers, from
five drug gangs, largely sold their drugs indoors, rarely fought
over territory and catered to their most cherished customers, what
the dealers called the ``S and T crowd'' _ the suit and tie crowd _
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the gang members' practice of selling drugs
indoors and the fact that they shunned firearms showed the
evolution and adaptability of the drug trade under the Giuliani
administration's crackdown on quality-of-life crimes.
</P>
<P>
   They said a continuing demand for drugs fueled the operation.
Half of its $5 million in annual sales were made to white-collar
workers, investigators said. Business was most brisk in the early
morning, when office workers arrived for work, and at noon, when
they went on lunch breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Arsenault, assistant Manhattan district attorney, said
the white-collar workers ``bought big and they paid twice as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   In a shift from the aggressive, gun-toting drug gangs of the
early 1990s, the five gangs involved apparently shunned
confrontation with other gangs to avoid drawing police attention.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the gangs operated out of the former Evans Hotel at
273 W. 38th St. near Eighth Avenue, and then worked around the
corner in the Mammoth Pool Hall at 550 Eighth Ave., officials said.
To avoid warfare, dealers declared a truce and worked out a shift
schedule among themselves, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers from different gangs shared customers and drug supplies
and even warned each other when police approached, investigators
said. In a major shift that law-enforcement officials said helps
explain the city's plummeting homicide rate, disputes among the
gangs were settled by slashings and stabbings, not by gun battles.
Gang members told the police that they no longer carry guns because
they fear that they will be stopped by police officers enforcing
the city's crackdown on low-level crimes, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The lucrative operation ended after a rival gang from Boston
tried to move in on the operation, law-enforcement officials said.
A shooting in January drew the attention of the police and
eventually led to Friday's indictments.

SOUTH AFRICA STRIKES DOWN HARSH LAWS ON GAY SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Citing a provision in the new
constitution, South Africa's highest court struck down the
country's sodomy laws on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, gay rights have been protected here since the country
passed its provisional constitution in 1994. But many of older laws
remained on the books. The suit decided by the Constitutional Court
Friday was brought by the National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian
Equality and was not opposed by the African National Congress
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're happy,'' said Mazibuko Jara, the coalition's
national manager. ``We welcome the decision as confirming the
values and principals of our constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa's constitution _ the world's most liberal _ bans
``unfair'' discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sex,
pregnancy, marital status, ethnic origin, color, age, disability,
religion, conscience, belief, culture, language and birth, as well
as sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh laws that the court overturned classified sodomy as a
Schedule 1 offense, like murder or rape, punishable by life
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   A more esoteric law also struck down Friday, Section 20A of the
Sexual Offenses Act, which was written after a vice raid on a gay
men's party in the 1960s, outlawed any behavior ``at a party'' _
defined as a gathering of more than two men _ that led to sexual
gratification. Under that law, gay activists said, a man could be
jailed for giving another man a come-hither glance, if seen by a
third man, who could be the arresting officer.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws were seldom enforced in recent years, and there have
been Gay Pride marches for a decade now. But two Cape Town
prisoners who engaged in consensual sex were charged with sodomy
last year, and the threat of such prosecutions still existed,
particularly in prisons and the army under conservative commanders,
activists said.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has become increasingly liberal since the days when
army officers tried to change homosexuals by giving gay recruits
electric shocks while showing them pictures of naked men. Military
and police codes of conduct now ban anti-gay discrimination, and a
few government-owned corporations like the national electric
company recognize same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   But most corporations and government departments do not, and
other laws prevent, for example, adoption by gay couples. A
spokesman for the gay rights coalition said Friday's broad ruling
might be used to challenge those laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was written by Judge Lori Ackerman with a concurring
ruling by Judge Albie Sachs, who wrote that it should be seen as
``part of a growing acceptance of difference in an increasingly
open and pluralistic South Africa.''

   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ The space shuttle Discovery's engines
shut down seconds before liftoff on Thursday, prompting Sen. John
Glenn to scramble out of the cockpit and run for his life _ knowing
all the while that it was just a drill.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who made history on Feb. 20, 1962, as the first American
to orbit Earth, was aboard the shuttle with six crew members at
least 31 years his junior for a dress rehearsal of the scheduled
Oct. 29 launching that will mark his return to space. There was no
fuel in the shuttle's rocket engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything proceeded very smoothly,'' Lisa Malone, a
spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
said of the 25-hour practice session, which simulated an aborted
liftoff at the Kennedy Space Center here.
</P>
<P>
   After 91 shuttle flights in 17 years, such countdown exercises
typically do not attract much attention. But more than 100
journalists from around the world converged on the space center to
witness the practice session. Responding to the heightened
interest, NASA provided live television coverage and running
commentary during the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, 77 and a four-term Democratic senator from Ohio, used a
question-and-answer session at the launching pad on Thursday to
complain about news media reports that focus on him instead of on
the scientific aspects of the planned nine-day mission. Glenn, who
is retiring this year, will do geriatric research as the
Discovery's rookie payload specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his preflight jitters almost 37 years ago and
now, Glenn said: ``Back then, I was scared to death I might catch a
cold or something and I might be replaced. I feel that same way
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   For Thursday's test, NASA cameras followed Glenn and the other
astronauts every step of the way from their living quarters, where
they donned pumpkin-colored pressure suits, to the top of the
195-foot launching tower, where they were strapped into their seats
in the shuttle's crew module for about three hours.
</P>
<P>
   Cameras mounted in the cramped cockpit documented the action as
the astronauts, one by one, crawled head first through the
Discovery's circular hatch and climbed into seats that tilt them on
their backs when the shuttle's nose is pointed skyward for liftoff.
The crew, consisting of six men and one woman, moved through
procedures they will perform on the day they are launched into
space. Onboard computers halted the countdown five seconds before
the moment of liftoff _ 1.6 seconds past the ignition time for the
Discovery's three hydrogen-fueled main engines. On cue, the
astronauts then scrambled out of the crew module unassisted, as
they would have to do in the event of a fire, explosion or serious
fuel leak during the actual countdown. In a real emergency, they
would jump into baskets and slide down a cable to the ground, where
they could take refuge in a concrete bunker.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain proficiency, launch controllers rehearsed countdown
procedures four times during the summer's shuttle flight hiatus,
but without the crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the test where we really start to put our heads down
and concern ourselves with the task at hand,'' said Steve Altimus,
the NASA test director. He attributed ``a buzz of excitement''
among the controllers to the publicity surrounding Glenn. ``We're
all kind of excited about launching a national hero, a space
pioneer,'' Altimus said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Earth orbit, the crew will deploy and retrieve a
Sun-studying satellite, test equipment destined for the Hubble
Space Telescope, and conduct more than 80 scientific experiments in
fields ranging from solar physics to internal medicine. Glenn will
be the chief subject in a series of tests comparing the
physiological effects of reduced gravity _ bone and muscle loss,
balance disorders, a depressed immune system and sleep disturbances
_ with the frailties of advanced age.

REPUBLICANS PLAY TO THE FOLKS BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss., Pa., Okla.)  (mk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 60 years behind the times, the House voted
Friday to condemn the Nazi-Soviet nonaggression pact of 1939.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, a nonbinding resolution, was brought to the floor
by Rep. John Shimkus, R-Ill. He is of Lithuanian descent, has a
pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown of Collinsville and wants to
try to highlight his support for the Baltic states' past efforts
against Soviet repression.
</P>
<P>
   Shimkus' measure is an example of how members of Congress are
spending their time as they stand idle and wait for Republican
leaders to reach agreement on spending bills with the White House,
thus avoiding a government shutdown and allowing them to go home
and campaign for the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   With time on their hands, many Republicans are using the House
floor as their personal stage to elicit votes on topics that they
can boast about to the folks back home. Most of these matters have
little chance of finding their way into law, but members hope to
turn them to their advantage on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other items whose sponsors hope will not
attract attention. These tend to be special-interest matters that
members hope will escape scrutiny in the rush to leave town. The
sponsors of these measures now have the added advantage of the
impeachment inquiry, which has been preoccupying Congress, the news
media and the public and giving them cover to move their pet causes
quietly into the gigantic omnibus package that Congress will
eventually present to Clinton for signing.
</P>
<P>
   These quieter measures include one proposed by Mississippi's two
senators, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, both Republicans. They want
agriculture export credits to buy chickens for Russia, which has
bought the chickens but cannot pay for them. The chickens are from
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have little influence in the Republican-controlled
Congress. But some Democrats are close enough to Republican
leaders, and to Republican goals, that their measures are taken
seriously. These include Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., the ranking
Democrat on the national security subcommittee of the
Appropriations Committee, who is pushing a measure to increase
military pensions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example of an attempt to force a vote for
political advantage is a measure that would require minors to
notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives from
federally funded family planning clinics.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders allowed the measure to be brought to the floor as
a way to appease the more conservative members, who believe they
have been shortchanged by the budget process. It passed the House
by a vote of 224-200 but has almost no chance of becoming law. The
Senate does not plan to take it up, and Clinton would almost
certainly veto it.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., said that votes like these were
important because they put their sponsors' ideological foes on the
record as opposing something that sounds reasonable, and that
opposition can be used against them in the Nov. 3 election.

GAY MAN SEVERELY BEATEN IN WYOMING; 2 MEN CHARGED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ At first, the passing bicyclist thought the
crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence was a scarecrow. But when he
stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of
Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to
the fence 18 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in
a coma in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here,
Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on
charges of kidnapping, aggravated robbery and attempted
first-degree murder. Two women described as friends of the men,
Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have been
charged as accessories after the fact to attempted first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's friends said that he did not know his alleged
tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery,
although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality
may also have been a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very open about his sexuality,'' Tina LaBrie, an
anthropology student here, said of her friend. ``I admired him for
that because it is very courageous to be yourself even when others
disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot,
2-inch man who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of
the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter
Boulden, a friend of Shepard's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two men came up
and talked to him,'' Boulden, a 46-year-old university lecturer of
social work here, said today between tears. ``He indicated he was
gay, and they said they were gay, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, he is in a coma,'' continued Boulden, who visited his
friend at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. ``I don't
think anybody expects him to pull through.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied at a boarding
school in Switzerland before moving back to the United States to
attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an
oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard was born
in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much of his
youth there.
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling as a
freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie and
her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this
foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found
himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a
treeless landscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle
and a busy freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup
trucks outnumber sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment
revolves around this Saturday's homecoming football game and the
start of the hunting season in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wyoming often bills itself as the ``equality state,''
in reference to its being the first state to give women the vote,
the state legislature has repeatedly voted down hate crime
legislation on the grounds that it would give homosexuals special
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wyoming is not really gay friendly,'' Marv Johnson, executive
director of the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said from Cheyenne. ``The best way to characterize that is
by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened
homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the
packing plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university
within days. One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which
drew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and
straights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in,'' recalled the
bartender, Matt Galloway. ``He wasn't drunk when he went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents
today that McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured
Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Beating him inside the truck, the pair drove him one mile
southeast to an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the
County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, the men tied
their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped him with
a .357 magnum ``while he begged for his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said that Shepard also suffered burns on his body.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly beating the young man to death, Laramie Police
Commander David O'Malley said, the assailants stole his wallet and
shoes and left him tied to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The police commander said that when his officers arrested the
two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357
magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit
card. He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home.
</P>
<P>
   The police commander said that the two women helped the two men
dump their bloody clothing, and that they reported hearing the men
make anti-gay remarks. Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the
university, lived with Henderson. Ms. Price lived with McKinney.
The police did not say what the other three did for a living.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled to understand
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence
because the local Gay Association completed plans on Tuesday night
for ``Gay Awareness Week 1998.'' The weeklong series of events
starts here Sunday with a local observance of ``National Coming Out
Day'' and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of
``Heather Has Two Mommies,'' a book about lesbian families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very
low,'' said Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. ``Openly gay
behavior is not only discouraged, it's dangerous.''

GRAMM SEEMS TO DOOM VOTE ON BANKING BILL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a lone senator standing in the way, a bill to
overturn Depression-era restrictions on the financial-services
industry was put into a legislative deep-freeze Friday, its
prospects for passage reduced to almost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though both Democratic and Republican Senate leaders said
they had nearly 90 votes to pass the measure, Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, threatened to tie up the Senate in procedural maneuvers
out of his long-standing opposition to portions of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., added two
unrelated ``poison pill'' amendments to the bill, which had the
effect of shelving the measure unless Gramm's opposition ends.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, passed by the House last May, would lift legal
barriers and allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies
to merge with fewer regulatory restrictions than they now face.
</P>
<P>
   For senators who had been working for decades to enact the
measure, Friday's events came as a bitter disappointment. Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said: ``The bill has strong support, but
we are down to one or two people who are standing in the way of the
first real successful effort to modernize our banking system in 20
years. It's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, joined by Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., has crusaded
against portions of the bill that would strengthen the Community
Reinvestment Act, which requires banks to provide services to low-
and moderate-income areas. Gramm, who has vowed to kill the bill
over this issue, has long been a critic of these requirements,
although no banking or other major industry group supports his
view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Gramm is standing up on principle because he believes
CRA is extortion,'' said Larry Neal, a spokesman for Gramm. ``And
there is a general reluctance to believe someone could stand up on
principle and do this. Right now, the bill seems firmly planted in
the grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm would become the next chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee if the current chairman, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
fails to be re-elected next month and if Republicans retain control
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the Senate, a single senator can block
legislation through procedural roadblocks. With enough time, such
opposition can be overcome. But with the 105th Congress in its
final days, there is not enough time for backers of the bill to
mount a procedural counterattack. As a result, unless a compromise
with Gramm is reached, the chances are high that the bill will die
when the session ends.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Lott tried to get Gramm to budge, through a
combination of harsh words and public reprobation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lott, who supports the measure, took to the floor
to complain about a ``spectacle very unbecoming of the Senate'' and
vowed ``to use every tool at my disposal and do everything possible
to make sure who knows who is holding this up.''
</P>
<P>
   He was joined by Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who said the Senate
was being held ``hostage'' and added that ``I can use the word
`extortion''' to describe Gramm's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had received the support of nearly every financial
securities industry group, the result of carefully crafted
legislative compromises to get the bill through the House.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the target of heavy lobbying by Citigroup, the new
financial-services company created by the merger of Citibank and
Traveler's Group, which needed portions of the bill to allow
certain parts of the merger to go forward immediately. Other
financial-services groups said the measure was needed to make U.S.
financial firms more globally competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the proponents of this bill, this is extremely
discouraging,'' Martin Farmer, a lobbyist for the Independent
Bankers Association, said. ``The prospects for its passage right
now are gloomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the maneuver orchestrated by Lott, if Gramm drops his
opposition, the two ``poison pill'' amendments, one eliminating the
``marriage penalty'' on federal taxes and the other to allow for
school vouchers, would be lifted and a Senate vote on the bill
could proceed.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk the bill could possibly be attached as
a rider to an omnibus spending bill now before the Senate. But to
accomplish that, the approval of the Treasury Department would be
needed and that has not been forthcoming. The Treasury Department
has objected to portions of the bill that expand the Federal
Reserve Board as the top banking regulator at the expense of the
Treasury.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Paradoxically, Gramm's opposition over the expansion of
community reinvestment obligations provided a victory for consumer
groups, which have the exact opposite point of view. These consumer
groups had opposed the measure because they felt it did not go far
enough in broadening the reinvestment rules. On Friday they
welcomed the demise of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers say they will bring up this measure again next year.
``If this bill were on the House or Senate floor, it would have
passed by a huge majority,'' said Edward Yingling, the chief
lobbyist for the American Bankers Association. ``That makes it
likely it will pass next year.''

KNOBLAUCH CAN'T ARGUE THIS CALL: HE'S NOTORIOUS

   CLEVELAND _ Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch was greeted as
a hero throughout Ohio Friday. The Akron Beacon Journal put him on
Page 1 and named him Cleveland's MVP of Game 2 of the American
League Championship Series. Fans at Jacobs Field gave him a
standing ovation when he was introduced during pregame ceremonies
last night. Knoblauch got more applause than first-ball tosser Bob
Feller (78 miles per hour on the black _ not bad for a 79-year-old
righthander).
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch made himself a national joke Wednesday night when he
stood and argued with an umpire while Cleveland's winning run
scored from first base on a bunt in the 12th inning of a playoff
game at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first batter of last night's game. Naturally. There's
a baseball adage about the player who makes the exceptional play
that ends an inning always coming to bat to start the next inning.
It must work the same way when you are the central figure in a
hardball controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch got a second resounding ovation when he led off the
game. It was sheer sarcasm, enough to infuriate any proud
professional. And so he ripped a single to left on the second pitch
and came around to score on Bernie Williams's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the first, Knoblauch handled the first ball hit
by Kenny Lofton. It was as if the diamond god wanted him to shake
all the jitters in a single inning.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's nonplay is already part of baseball folklore. On the
controversial Travis Fryman 12th-inning bunt, Knoblauch elected to
stand at first base and argue with the umpire that there had been
interference on the throw. Meanwhile, Enrique Wilson staggered
around the bases and swam across home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch could not have known what was in store. He was in
total denial after the game, saying he would do the same thing
again if given the chance. He wanted to talk only about the
injustice of umpire Ted Hendry's noncall.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the avalanche. Before the Yankee charter touched down
in Cleveland, there were tabloid newspapers on the streets of New
York with headlines screaming, ``BLAUCH-HEAD.'' He was slaughterd
on the airwaves. The vaunted New York Times led its game account by
comparing Knoblauch with (gulp) Bill Buckner.
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. You know it's bad when they're dropping a Buckner on your
head.
</P>
<P>
   A contrite Knoblauch met with the national media at Thursday's
workout. He said, ``I screwed up.'' He apologized more times than
Bill Clinton. But there was no way to erase the damning video.
</P>
<P>
   The replay has been aired a thousand times. It never gets any
better for Knoblauch. There he is, standing on first base, arm
outstretched, yelling at Hendry while the ball dribbles toward
right field and Wilson flops around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   It is the cardinal sin of sports, something we teach our kids
every season, every year. You keep playing until the whistle blows,
until the clock stops, until somebody calls time out. Play now,
argue the call later.
</P>
<P>
   Little League coaches will never forget Knoblauch. They will
cite his play the same way DARE police officers talk about famous
rock and movie stars who throw away careers for drugs. (itals)This
guy was famous and had everything. See what happened to him? Don't
let it happen to you.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The Knoblauch gaffe is offensive for the same reason we hate to
see immature Chris Canty celebrating a tackle while the live
football sits on the ground next to him, begging to be scooped up.
Keep playing until the play is over. Argue and celebrate later.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee manager Joe Torre was compelled to hold a rare pregame
meeting in an effort to get his players' minds off the Game 2
finish. Knoblauch has to be hoping his teammates will get him off
the hook.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees go on to lose the series, Knoblauch no doubt will
take his place alongside Fred ``Bonehead'' Merkle, Mickey Owens,
and our own Buckner in Baseball's Hall of Shame. But if the Yanks
beat Cleveland, as they should, Knoblauch becomes merely a footnote
and a teaching tool for those who coach America's youth.

 Men's Wearhouse Drops Acquisition   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Men's Wearhouse yesterday said it has dropped plans to buy Moore's
Retail Group of Canada after a steep decline in the Fremont
discounter's stock price.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse, which operates 414 discount clothing stores,
said in August it would acquire the 112-store Canadian chain by
issuing 2.4 million new shares and assuming $57.4 million in
Moore's debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was valued at $130 million at the time. But Men's
Wearhouse shares have dropped by more than half from a high of
$36.88 in July to $16.13 yesterday, scuttling the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse shares tend to be volatile because the company
grows largely through acquisitions, a strategy that investors
consider risky, said an analyst who follows the stock but who
declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Men's Wearhouse, the nation's top menswear discounter,
rose $1.13 yesterday on news that the talks with Moore's had been
terminated.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst said he expects Moore's and Men's Wearhouse to
return to the bargaining table within a year or so. The combination
is attractive because it would give Men's Wearhouse its first
manufacturing capability and a large presence in Canada, the
analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, Neal Rosen, said executives had not
discussed the possibility of a future deal.
</P>
<P>
   Men's Wearhouse shares have also been hit by fears that an
economic downturn could dampen demand for men's suits. But the
analyst said Men's Wearhouse tends to do well during recessions,
stealing market share from higher priced department stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stock (decline) reflects something significantly worse
than reality,'' the analyst said.

MONTANA ON TOP OF ITS GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They are the University of Montana. In the world
of Division I-AA, that isn't just a mark of success, it's one of
supremacy. It's five straight playoff appearances, a national
championship in 1995 and 12 straight winning seasons. It's the
place to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to simulate the University of Montana,'' Cal
State Northridge coach Ron Ponciano said. ``So do we.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana wins. In the conference, on a national level and in the
postseason. But it's so much more.
</P>
<P>
   It's chartering a flight from Missoula, Mont., to Southern
California instead of flying commercially, a reward for averaging
17,988 fans per game last season. It's people in the malls wearing
nothing but maroon on football Saturdays, and bar-room talk solely
about Montana football.
</P>
<P>
   It's 500 or so fans making the trip from Big Sky country to CSUN
for today's crucial Big Sky Conference game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Nebraska (playing) for two years and it's just like a
miniature Nebraska,'' CSUN offensive coordinator Rob Phenicie said.
``Game day, it's great. You go out on the field and there's kind of
a roar and then you get to the line of scrimmage and (the noise)
just picks up. Then after the play it dies down a little bit and
you get back to the line and it picks up again. I'm sitting
upstairs saying, `Man, this is great.'''
</P>
<P>
   The transition from also-ran to Montana-type stature won't
happen with one win, but a nice possibility presents itself to No.
23 CSUN (3-1, 2-0 Big Sky) in No. 18 Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would a win entrench the Matadors atop the Big Sky
standings and turn heads nationally, it would leave the Grizzlies
(3-2, 1-1) needing a five-game winning streak to keep alive its
postseason hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the younger guys don't realize what the game is and
how important it is,'' CSUN senior receiver Drew Hill said.
``People will recognize us after we beat Montana. It's going to
symbolize our domination in the league and how dominant we can
become. It's bigger than the Eastern Washington game, bigger than
the Northern Arizona game.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the case 15 years ago. The only thing people knew
about Montana was its rugged beauty, its inspiring vastness and its
lack of a football power. Grizzlies were things you brought home as
a trophy, not the team you feared.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to 1986, Montana had boasted just eight winning seasons
since World War II. Then Washington-Grizzly Stadium opened on Oct.
18, 1986, with a 38-31 win against Idaho State. It took eight years
before Montana lost there, and a power was built. The Grizzlies
haven't had a losing season since.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the epitome of a I-AA program now,'' Ponciano said.
``There's no question they are, but it wasn't long ago when Montana
couldn't beat Montana State. Everybody looks at what they've got
because they've had success, so everyone looks and says, `What do
they do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium _ and the winning _ aided in the recruitment of
better players. Kids stay home and play football now instead of
going away, and the excitement from getting the community involved
in the construction of the stadium lured fans into the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often it's a lot easier to get to the top than to stay
there,'' third-year Montana coach Mick Dennehy said. ``It's been a
program that we've been proud of, worked hard in developing,
graduated kids and fortunately been at the top or near the top of
the league. I don't think there's any magical formula or recruiting
ingredient except recruiting the right athlete.''

   WASHINGTON _ This Sunday, on the 23rd anniversary of her

Bulgaria, making a visit that morning to the Faith, Hope and Love
Center, a shelter for homeless children in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons planned to celebrate their anniversary privately
Friday night, aides said. Clinton bought a gift for Mrs. Clinton on
a trip to Philadelphia last Friday, and on Friday Mrs. Clinton
brought home takeout ribs, steak and tacos from the president's
favorite restaurants in Little Rock, Ark.

   Joseph Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Mrs.
Clinton's trip was planned ``months ago.''

   ``He has a lot of foreign policy reading he wants to do,'' one
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, the president will deliver his weekly radio
address live, and it will probably be about the deadlocked budget

   White House officials said they were reluctant to inquire into
the Clintons' anniversary plans, saying that after an agonizing
year, the Clintons deserved some privacy. Clinton has said he has
been trying to repair damage done his family by his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first anniversary that the Clintons have been
apart since moving into the White House. A year ago, Clinton spent
six hours on their anniversary in the Oval Office complex, in part
to prepare for a trip to Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her Calvinism will let me work, but no golf,'' Clinton joked
with reporters as he walked back from the West Wing to the White
House residence.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Ms. Lewinsky met with Clinton in the small study off
the Oval Office for nearly an hour, to discuss efforts to find her
a job in New York, according to her testimony before the grand jury
here. The meeting was disclosed in the report to Congress by the
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that
her sexual relationship with Clinton ended months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton plans to depart on Saturday for a trip that will
take her to the Czech Republic as well as Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   In Sofia, she will attend a conference titled ``Women in the
21st Century,'' part of a project to encourage sustainable
development in Southeastern Europe. In Prague, she will attend
another conference, this one called ``Forum 2000,'' to discuss
globalization and the next millennium. She is scheduled to return
from Prague on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons were married on Oct. 11, 1975, in a simple ceremony
in their home in Fayetteville, Ark. They spent their honeymoon in
Acapulco, Mexico, with Mrs. Clinton's parents and brothers.

 &HT;    Aerospace forerunner Engle visits museum
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you didn't know him, you would never guess the
guy ambling casually through the Air Force Museum on Friday in a
plaid shirt, blue jeans and wide leather belt was one of America's
aerospace pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe H. Engle was acting like a guy who just likes airplanes. He
was as happy talking about his little Piper L-4 Cub as he was the
X-15 rocket plane he flew beyond the edge of space, or the space
shuttle Columbia he piloted completely by hand, from orbit to
landing _ something no other astronaut has done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like flying Cubs, space shuttles and everything I can get
into in between,'' the retired Air Force major general said with an
easy laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Engle was visiting the museum as a participant in the
``Gathering of Eagles'' symposium. Sponsored by the Air Force
Museum Foundation and the International Association of Eagles, the
event brought 14 legendary aviators to speak here Friday and today.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers ranged from World War II aces to astronauts such as
Engle and retired Air Force Gen. Thomas Stafford, whose Gemini and
Apollo flights included commanding the Apollo 10 moon-orbiting
mission.
</P>
<P>
   While both Engle and Stafford are retired from spaceflight, both
are also still deeply involved in America's space program. Stafford
heads an independent review and assessment team for the
International Space Station; Engle is his deputy.
</P>
<P>
   The space station is the next big event on NASA's schedule after
the upcoming space shuttle mission that will take John Glenn on his
second space flight. He became the first American to orbit the
Earth in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stafford, 68, and Engle, 65, support Glenn's flight. Both
think the aging research Glenn hopes to aid is a worthwhile effort.
But Stafford thinks one of the chief benefits will be the dramatic
demonstration ``that if you're over 40 and you stay in shape, you
can have a long, active life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gathering of Eagles has been an annual event since 1982 for
the Air Force's command and staff college at Maxwell Air Force Base
in Alabama, but this is its first year at the museum. Museum
officials hope to make it an annual event.
</P>
<P>
   Engle, a founding member of the event, said offering it at the
museum was ``an outstanding move. If it's done here, it can really
be a benefit to aviation . . . with all the core aviation history
and tradition here.''

 Newspapers' Web Readers Shanghaied   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Readers attempting to access a dozen major newspaper Web sites _
including the San Jose Mercury News and San Francisco Examiner _
did not get news, weather and sports this week. Instead, they got
the ramblings of a former Ku Klux Klan leader and ex-con.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The online deception _ which lasted throughout the week _ wasn't
the result of hacking, but of legally registering Web addresses
that resembled the newspapers' names. For example, the Philadelphia
Inquirer's Web site is at  &LR; www.phillynews.com/inquirer; &LR;  the false
site was at  &LR; www.philadelphiainquirer.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A shadowy Lake Tahoe man, who calls himself ``Ed Marlow'' and
claims to be a computer systems and Internet technician, said he
registered virtual addresses this month that include part or all of
the newspapers' names. He then redirected those addresses to
``Stormfront,'' a white nationalist site with links to other racist
pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe that all points of view should be accessible on
the Net, including those supporting the heritage and values of the
founding White (sic) majority in America,'' Marlow, 31, said in an
e-mail interview yesterday. ``I am not a supremacist.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the newspapers immediately vowed legal action to
stop the use of the bogus online addresses, the problem underscores
murky trademark-infringement rules for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is no law banning individuals or companies from securing
addresses affiliated with brand-name firms. The violated companies
have been forced to go to court to stop that practice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``This is not a First Amendment case. It's a
trademark-infringement case,'' said Mark Kipnis, general counsel
for the Chicago Sun-Times, another of the papers hit by ``Marlow.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On Monday, the paper was the first to discover the subterfuge.
It filed court papers on Wednesday, and obtained a temporary
restraining order Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a term for them _ parasites,'' said Doug Edwards,
online brand manager for the San Jose Mercury News. ``We have
referred the matter to our corporate attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner said it is also pursuing legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Other newspapers targeted by ``Marlow'' were the Albuquerque
Tribune, Arizona Republic, Atlanta Constitution, Cleveland Plain
Dealer, Edmonton Sun, London Daily Telegraph, &UR;  &LR; Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, Salt Lake Tribune and St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle was not affected.
</P>
<P>
   Don Black, who produces Stormfront, denied any involvement in
the incidents, but he said he knows ``Marlow.'' He said he received
a temporary injunction notice yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've requested that it be stopped,'' said the West Palm Beach,
Fla., resident. ``There's obviously a trademark issue involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Black, 45, is a former Ku Klux Klan leader who learned how to
use computers while serving time in a federal prison in Texas for
planning the military overthrow of the tiny Caribbean island of
Dominica. He created Stormfront, which preaches ``White Pride World
Wide,'' in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlow,'' who said he registered the newspaper names as ``a
test of Internet traffic,'' said he ceased use of the names as soon
as he was contacted by the newspapers' attorneys. ``I am compelled
to follow the laws of the court,'' he said in an e-mail interview.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a flurry of legal maneuvering by the newspapers, an
episode mimicking ``Stormfront'' could be repeated, legal experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a major problem for corporations who are trying to
protect trademarks,'' said Philip Sbarbaro, chief litigation
counsel for Network Solutions, the Herndon, Va., company that
registers the most popular Web addresses. ``Without a law, all a
company can do is file a trademark-infringement suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, an individual or company can quickly and easily buy the
two-year rights to any available online address for $70 at
 &LR; www.internic.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   As a result, companies are scrambling to register as many
Internet addresses with variations of their names as possible to
protect their trademarks online.
</P>
<P>
   NSI has a dispute policy that allows companies to challenge _
and remove _ Web sites that piggyback off their sites for
commercial gain. However, NSI does not impose a waiting period to
check out the commercial intent of Web registrants.
</P>
<P>
   The unpoliced dispensing of Web addresses has resulted in some
infamous sites masquerading as legitimate sites.
</P>
<P>
   An adult-oriented business called Whitehouse.com displays
pornographic images of President Clinton and Hillary Clinton. (The
official Oval Office Web address is  &LR; www.whitehouse.gov &LR; .) The
incident has driven U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., to draft
legislation that would prohibits private parties from using
government agency names for ``stealth'' commercial Web sites.

MADDUX THE MASTER TAKES THE MOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Why sing the praises of an understudy when the
featured artist has yet to take the stage? Before crowning San
Diego's Kevin Brown king of the postseason, let's check out the
performance of the man generally regarded as the best pitcher of
his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Padres came home with a 2-0 lead over the Braves
in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series following
Brown's three-hit, 11-strikeout, 3-0 masterpiece Thursday, the
chief topic of conversation here Friday revolved around Atlanta ace
Greg Maddux, who will start Saturday's survival test. Brown was
superb. But now comes The Master. And Maddux wants to retain that
eminence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pride,'' he said. ``You want to win. You always want to
win, even if it's April or May. I don't think anybody wants to be
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially not now, Maddux's favorite time of the year.
``Playoffs never get old, never,'' he said. ``It just doesn't. It's
better than Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a late-season slump that probably cost him an
unprecedented fifth Cy Young Award, Maddux racked up another
splendid season, going 18-9 with a 2.22 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tom) Glavine won 20 games this year,'' said San Diego hit man
Tony Gwynn, referring to Atlanta's Game 2 loser. ``The only
difference is that Maddux adds 7 more miles an hour to his
fastball. He can beat you with his movement and location. The
catcher sets up and he's going to hit the glove. You don't see that
a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're up, 2-0, in the series. But we're going to have to
concentrate just as hard against him as we did against (John)
Smoltz and Glavine. You know it's going to be tough. You know
you're not going to go out and score six or seven runs off him.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux faced the Padres once in the regular season, lasting six
innings in a 5-1 loss Aug. 12. That came during his late-season
malaise. But in winning the Division Series clincher against the
Cubs, 6-2, Saturday, he reestablished his credentials as a money
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I was back to my old self,'' said Maddux. ``But
I feel good about how I'm throwing now. For a while, I didn't
locate as well as I'd like, but I'm pleased at how I've been
throwing lately. It doesn't matter. What does is how I pitch on
Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux is a creature of rhythm and composure. Extremes _ either
high or low _ do not affect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt I was out of sync,'' he said of his slump, in
which he lost three of his last four starts and was 6-7 after the
All-Star break. ``But I do think over a short period of time you
can have two or three games that inflate things. They (the media)
make a big deal out of everything. You expect it. It's the norm. No
matter which way you pitch, it's magnified. That's just how it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres aren't looking at Maddux through a magnifying glass.
They see him as he is _ a stopper who could halt the momentum they
have gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming into these playoffs that we were going to face
the best staff in baseball,'' said manager Bruce Bochy. ``We feel
very fortunate to have won two games. But we still have to face
Maddux. We know for sure that Maddux pitched well against the Cubs
in the division playoffs. Looks like he's getting on track. Maddux
is throwing well now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this shows you how good the Atlanta Braves are _
Maddux in Game 3. We can't change anything. We have to keep going
in the direction that we're going. We've got to continue to pitch
the ball, play defense, and hopefully get a hit every now and
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn says he will do what he normally does against Maddux _ try
to get a good pitch and drive it someplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense is still sputtering, but who cares as long as we
keep winning ballgames?'' he said. ``Guys can hit .220, .185, and
so on. Nobody remembers that if you keep winning. I'm surprised we
had to wait till Game 3 before seeing Maddux. But it doesn't hurt.
With all these guys, you have to really battle. You've got to
really concentrate and pay attention. With Glavine, we did a real
good job and made him throw a lot of pitches. And with Maddux, it's
the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux will face Sterling Hitchcock, who conquered Houston's
Randy Johnson in his last outing, the Game 4 clincher of their
Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure on me,'' Hitchcock said. ``Remember, I'm
not supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody else is when Maddux takes the mound.

   Battling It Out on the Links Is All in a Day's, uh, Work
</P>
<P>
   General Electric's official line is that while John F. Welch
loves to talk about the company's success, he keeps his golf game
private. A similar message comes from Sun Microsystems about its
chairman, Scott G. McNealy.
</P>
<P>
   But put your ear to the fairway, and you will hear more than the
thwack of golf balls. The two chief executives apparently learned
from Golf Digest last May that they were among the nation's top
golfing CEOs _ Welch has a 3.8 handicap index and McNealy a
slightly better 3.2. They agreed to play in Nantucket, and Golf
World reported that Welch emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed for details, the folks at Sun suggest that patience is
in order, with an announcement likely to emerge soon. Might it be a
copy of the scorecard? Not likely. Seems a ``gimme'' that the two
men cut a business deal on the links.
</P>
<P>
   That probably left little time to talk about the Big Question:
Who will succeed Welch, who turns 65 in 2000? But Robert Slater,
who has just written his third book about the GE chief, is betting
on James McNerney, head of GE Aircraft Engines.
</P>
<P>
   Slater says Welch's personal choice would be Robert Wright, the
NBC boss, but he figures that the final decision ``will come down
to age'' and go to the younger McNerney.
</P>
<P>
   _ ADAM BRYANT &QL;

<P>

<P>
   Who was that bearded man trading quips with his fellow basses in
the Dallas Symphony Chorus last month at the Morton H. Meyerson
Family Weekend of Concerts in the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony
Center in Dallas? Why, none other than Morton H. Meyerson.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerson, after decades as Ross Perot's corporate right-hand man
(and left-hand man, too, while Perot went off chasing the
presidency), retired from the Perot Systems computer-services
company last year to pursue his passion for music.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, he went on a European tour with the Morris Beachy
Singers, a University of Texas alumni chorus. And the centerpiece
of the Web site for his 2M Companies (www.2m.com), a group of small
technology and real-estate ventures, is a page with audio clips of
performances by the Dallas Symphony and its chorus (Tchaikovsky),
and the university singing group (``Deep River'').
</P>
<P>
   Meyerson joins a cadre of business leaders adept with bows or
batons, including Norio Ohga, the Sony president and orchestral
conductor, and James Wolfensohn, the World Bank president and a
cellist.
</P>
<P>
   _ ALLEN R. MYERSON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Alums May Take the Hint
</P>
<P>
   Never one to shirk the limelight, Michael R. Bloomberg has
rounded off his gift-giving to Johns Hopkins University at an even
$100 million. Bloomberg, the colorful _ some say egotistical _
founder of Bloomberg LP, says he will add $45 million to the $55
million he contributed three years ago. That makes him the
``largest single donor by double'' to the Baltimore school, a
spokesman for Johns Hopkins said, adding that Bloomberg, head of
its $1.2 billion fund-raising drive, is ``putting his money where
his mouth is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg says most of the new money will go to undergraduate
financial aid. ``Even though the economy is softening and markets
go down, we still have to educate kids,'' said the author of an
autobiography entitled ``Bloomberg by Bloomberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he gave a similarly high-minded reason for his
original gift, but couldn't help adding that the donation generated
``great publicity for my company and the university.''

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All These Hard Feelings!
</P>
<P>
   Seth Flam's golden parachute isn't so golden after all. Flam got
a $4.8 million severance deal when he resigned in March from FPA
Medical Management Inc., which he founded and which filed for
bankruptcy protection last year.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed enough to allow him to enjoy the suburban San Diego
mansion he had just bought for $3 million. But the company now says
it terminated the package in July after paying only $255,000. And
doctors left with unpaid bills are going after even that pittance.
... Sylvester Stallone has come under a lot of heat from nearby
residents _ including Madonna _ for agreeing to sell his 12-acre
estate in Miami's Coconut Grove section to a hotel chain for $24.7
million. But the deal is contingent on rezoning of the neighborhood
for commercial use _ and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo says the chances
for that are ``slim to none.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallone, who bought the estate for $8.4 million in 1993,
retorts that Carollo ``has been getting reports tinged with
neighborhood hysteria.'' &QL;

   CARDINAL HEALTH ACQUIRING ALLEGIANCE FOR $4.5 BILLION
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale drug distributor Cardinal Health agreed to buy the
hospital supply company Allegiance for $4.5 billion in stock and
assume $890 million of its debt.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a rebound for Cardinal, which dropped its bid for
Bergen Brunswig after a federal judge ruled last summer that the
deal raised antitrust problems.
</P>
<P>
   HOSTILE BID SENDS AMP SHARES UP
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace and automotive parts maker Allied Signal plans to
proceed with its $9.7 billion hostile takeover bid for AMP despite
a federal judge's ruling Thursday that part of its purchase plan
was unlawful. Allied said it would appeal the ruling. Shares of AMP
have climbed to $41.3125 since the takeover was first announced on
Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   FUND'S LOSSES SAID TO CONTINUE
</P>
<P>
   The troubled hedge fund Long-Term Capital has suffered losses of
$200 million to $300 million in the two weeks since it was salvaged
by a Wall Street consortium. Such losses would amount to 3 percent
to 5 percent of the $3.6 billion rescue package arranged by 14
banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   NEW FORD LEADERS MAKING CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Nasser, who becomes chief executive of Ford Motor next
year, and William Clay Ford Jr., who becomes chairman, have
announced that 27 senior executives will retire or change jobs at
the end of the year. The most significant change is the creation of
a new position, chief of staff. A longtime ally of Ford, Peter
Pestillo, was named to that job.
</P>
<P>
   PLAN TO BOLSTER PATIENT POWER DIES
</P>
<P>
   Legislation to give patients more power in dealing with
health-insurance companies died in Congress, a casualty of heavy
lobbying by the insurance industry and of the sex scandal that has
enveloped President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT TRIAL DELAYED FOUR DAYS
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge delayed the start of Microsoft's trial on
antitrust charges until Oct. 19, and ordered the company to comply
with the Justice Department's request to examine Microsoft's
financial records.
</P>
<P>
   VOLKSWAGEN ENDING HIRING SPREE
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen said that it did not plan to add employees next year,
ending a four-year hiring spree that increased the company's
worldwide work force by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ENERGY-RICH KAZAKHSTAN THRIVING
</P>
<P>

NEW DETAILS ON WHEN STARR WAS TOLD OF CLINTON AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CLINTON-IMPEACH) 
(mk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sometime in early January, Paul Rosenzweig, a
lawyer working for Kenneth Starr, received a tip from a law school
classmate that President Clinton was having an affair with a White
House intern, lawyers familiar with the matter say.
</P>
<P>
   The phone call to Rosenzweig was placed by Jerome Marcus, a
Philadelphia lawyer who has done legal work that supported the
sexual misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Jones against the
president. The lawyers said the call was placed at least a week
before the office of Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, was
contacted by Linda Tripp, a Pentagon employee who secretly recorded
20 hours of conversations with Monica Lewinsky, the former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The early tip-off to Starr's office has been seized upon by
lawyers for Clinton, who say ``troubling questions'' have been
raised about connections between the Jones case and the Lewinsky
investigation, which led to an impeachment inquiry. They point to a
timetable that suggests that lawyers assisting Mrs. Jones in her
case had alerted Starr's prosecutors to the Lewinsky affair before
Mrs. Tripp contacted them on Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since its inception, Starr's involvement in the Lewinsky
matter has drawn criticism from supporters of Clinton, who argue
that it was an attempt to build a powerful criminal case from a
weak civil suit and therefore an abuse of the criminal justice
system. Starr's prosecutors have long contended that they did not
know Mrs. Tripp had ties to the Jones case, and have tried to
distance themselves from the civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenzweig and Marcus, both 38, were classmates at the
University of Chicago Law School, and both graduated in the
mid-1980s after serving as editors of the school's law review. They
are also both members of the Federalist Society, a conservative
legal organization whose events Starr has attended.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rosenzweig nor Marcus returned phone messages this week.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, also did not return calls
Friday. But he has previously described the tip as ``vague.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers say the early call is noteworthy because it
may have given Starr's deputies time to develop a strategy for
persuading the Justice Department to allow prosecutors to expand
the scope of their stalled Whitewater inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, Starr's lawyers pointed to the efforts of the
president's friend Vernon Jordan to find jobs for both Ms. Lewinsky
and the convicted former Justice Department official Webster
Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tripp also brought to Starr the so-called talking points,
in which Ms. Lewinsky instructed her to lie in the Jones case. (Ms.
Lewinsky testified months later that she had typed the notes
herself.)
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, the Justice Department referred the matter to a
three-judge panel, which immediately authorized an expansion of
Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers have complained about the connections between
Marcus and Richard Porter, a partner in Starr's old law firm,
Kirkland &AMP; Ellis of Chicago. Mrs. Tripp was eventually referred to
James Moody, a Washington lawyer who is also a member of the
Federalist Society.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly, the spokesman for Starr, has declined to identify the
lawyer in the independent counsel's office who received the call.
There is no mention of the early tip-off in the report Starr gave
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said on Thursday that she would
review a request by Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, to
release Starr's written request for expanded jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has attacked Kendall's letter for focusing on people
outside his office.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus and Porter worked with Lucianne Goldberg, a New York
literary agent, to help Mrs. Tripp alert Starr's office about the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldberg has adamantly denied statements made by Starr's
office that she herself had steered Mrs. Tripp to prosecutors last
January. She accused Starr's prosecutors of mischaracterizing her
role. ``I'm being hung out to dry here and I don't like it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, she acknowledged that she had spoken with both Marcus
and Porter in early January about how to help Mrs. Tripp contact
Starr. Ms. Goldberg has described Marcus as ``a cutout'' brought
into the matter to keep Porter's role obscured because of his close
ties to Starr.

CONGRESS EXTENDS DEADLINE ON STALLED SPENDING TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., La., Mass., Ohio, Wash.)   (See also CONGRESS-SPECIES, CONGRESS-REPUBS)  
(js) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Budget negotiations faltered Friday, prompting
Congress to delay until midnight Monday its deadline for passing a
spending bill to keep the government open.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders vowed they would not let the government shut
down. At the same time, many rank-and-file members of Congress,
suffering from impeachment fatigue and anxious to get home to
campaign for the Nov. 3 elections, fled Capitol Hill temporarily
Friday night in an acknowledgment that any resolution was in the
hands of Republican leaders and the White House. They are subject
to return at the call of their leaders to vote on a final package,
probably not before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the chairmen of the spending committees and Republican
leaders engaged in on-and-off negotiations with the White House.
The two sides met twice Friday and were working Friday night, but
little overt progress was made on the spending bills as the process
devolved into a political blame game, with each side trying to
control the message that goes out to voters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that Republicans were not providing
enough money for his education initiatives, including measures to
hire teachers and repair schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget is purely and simply a test of whether after nine
months of doing nothing, we are going to do the right thing about
our children's future,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, responded that he was astounded to see the president on
television complaining about Republicans when the White House had
failed to propose cuts in domestic spending to make up for the
billions of dollars that the president was seeking for his own
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were keenly aware that the president had
successfully blamed them for previous government shutdowns, in 1995
and 1996, and were determined Friday not to let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations stalled, Livingston asserted, ``There's not
going to be a shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were responding not only to the president but to
a prevailing sense on Capitol Hill that their leaders were giving
in to the administration's demands behind the scenes in order to
make a quick break from Washington and leave with the political
focus on the impending impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats appeared more eager to draw out the endgame and were
advancing the view that Republicans, in their haste to capitalize
on the president's woes in their re-election campaigns, were being
careless about the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cutting out on everything because they want to get out
of here,'' said Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass. ``The impeachment stuff
has been draining on the whole institution. It's been sucking all
the air out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., emerged from a closed-door meeting
of her colleagues saying she was ``disappointed that the president
has put us on the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But really, said Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, a member of the
Republican leadership, Republicans ``want to stay here and work,
work, work.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
put the message in plain English: ``We're not going to give them
the ability to say it's our fault.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But that is precisely the message that Clinton and Democratic
leaders tried to convey, portraying the Republicans as blocking
bills concerning health care, campaign finance and the minimum
wage, even though these measures are not directly related to the 13
must-pass spending bills that keep the government going.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of those bills have been signed into law. Four others
have been sent to the president, and he has vetoed one. The current
negotiations are over several contentious items in the remaining
seven bills, which are likely to be wrapped up into one big omnibus
bill and presented to the president next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate added to that bloated omnibus Friday by killing the
bill financing the Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's deadline extension is the second that Congress has
sought in two weeks. The first took Congress through Friday night,
even though the new fiscal year began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Friday, the House approved, 300-125, legislation
overhauling the bankruptcy code, but the legislation still faced
the threat of a veto from the White House and opposition from
Senate Democrats who said it failed to rein in abusive credit card
lending and marketing practices. Friday night, however, Democrats
withdrew a filibuster threat that would have killed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. said the Democrats had relented
after Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, told them he would not
pass the freestanding bill but instead try to include it in the
omnibus spending measure needed to end the congressional session.

LOSSES SAID TO CONTINUE AT TROUBLED HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital, the troubled hedge fund, has suffered losses
of $200 million to $300 million in the two weeks since it was
salvaged by a Wall Street consortium, a person involved with the
fund said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Such losses would amount to 3 percent to 5 percent of the $3.6
billion rescue package arranged by 14 banks and brokerage firms,
which acquired 90 percent of the fund in return. The partnership is
now known as Long-Term Capital Portfolio LP.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday evening, the fund had about $1.7 billion in cash
and about $1.3 billion in Treasury securities, this person said. In
addition, the fund has recently increased the backing it has put up
for some of its securities trades and has repaid a $500 million
bank loan from Chase Manhattan Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, based in Greenwich, Conn., was established in 1993 by
John Meriwether, a former vice chairman and bond trader at Salomon
Brothers, and a group of his Salomon colleagues. It suffered huge
losses this summer on large speculative positions in world bond
markets. The speculation was done with tens of billions of dollars
of borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   As Long-Term's capital started to dwindle rapidly, its leading
banks and brokerage firms gathered at hastily arranged meetings at
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to fashion a rescue that was
completed on Sept. 28. Long-Term Capital Management, the fund's
management company, continues to run the fund with oversight from
the group that rescued it.
</P>
<P>
   Since that rescue, the fund has been the subject of continual
rumors on Wall Street, where financiers have become increasingly
jittery over the gyrations in financial markets and the big losses
reported by many banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of such rumors, the group of financial firms that
recapitalized Long-Term Capital, through Oversight Partner I LLC, a
venture set up for that purpose, issued a statement Friday
restating its intention to have Long-Term remain a going concern.
It also said that it would concentrate on reducing the risks of the
huge Long-Term investment portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the closing on Sept. 28, nothing has occurred that
materially changes our goals and objectives for LTC and our view of
the sufficiency of the capital infusion,'' said Richard Torrenzano,
a spokesman for Oversight Partner. ``Speculation about current LTC
capital and liquidity levels is inaccurate, as both are
significantly higher than the numbers appearing in recent media
reports. The original positive net asset value level has not
changed materially since the closing on September 28.''
</P>
<P>
   The participants in Oversight Partner are Bankers Trust;
Barclays Bank; Chase Manhattan; Credit Suisse First Boston;
Deutsche Bank; Goldman, Sachs; Lehman Brothers Holdings; Merrill
Lynch; J.P. Morgan; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Paribas; Societe
Generale; Travelers Group and UBS.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   New reports about Long-Term Capital continue to trickle out. The
fund had 30 to 40 trading strategies in place, according to an
internal document, dated December 1996, from UBS, the huge Swiss
bank. The document was cited Friday in a report by the Reuters news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The fund, this report said, had eight strategic investors,
mostly government-owned banks in major financial markets. As of
December 1996, these strategic investors owned almost 31 percent of
the fund. Their participation, according to the report cited by
Reuters, gave Long-Term ``a window to see the structural changes
occurring in these markets to which the strategic investors
belong.''

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After seven fat years, the mutual fund industry has suffered a
drought. A community of sainted portfolio managers has fallen from
grace. And mutual fund investors may be thinking they have
descended into the inferno.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter, in short, was one in which investors and fund
managers alike were badly singed. Only 14 of 2,377 funds that
invest in a broad array of U.S. stocks made money, according to
Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in Chicago, with the
average domestic equity fund dropping 13 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
   Things were as bad or worse for investors who ventured overseas.
The average emerging-markets stock fund lost half its value over
the last year, and several have said they will liquidate their
portfolios and close down.
</P>
<P>
   Since midyear, one well-known mutual fund manager after another
_ from Michael P. DiCarlo of John Hancock Special Equities to Paul
Stephens of Robertson Stephens Contrarian _ has relinquished all or
part of his duties.
</P>
<P>
   The contraction in mutual fund cash flows and assets as stock
prices tumbled through the late summer and early fall is burning
off some of the bloat that had built up among fund companies. But
whether it has sculpted the industry into good-enough shape to
provide the majority of mutual fund shareholders with the one thing
they truly desire _ the investment returns and stability of assets
to provide for retirement or other financial goals _ is, as yet,
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The recent period of poor returns has brought to light flaws in
the industry's practice of being all things to all people _
providing an endless variety of investment strategies, share
classes and niche-filling funds. By slicing the fund bologna so
absurdly thin that it hardly serves as a snack, much less a
nutritious meal, mutual fund companies, in many cases, have left
people more confused than informed.
</P>
<P>
   A scan of the list of funds that performed the best over the
last 12 months, however, could impart a few basic facts _ and
expose a few myths _ about investing. And the lessons could serve
investors well over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best performers over this period of market turmoil,
for example, are funds that have the flexibility to add to or take
away from asset classes like bonds or cash as the portfolio manager
sees fit. Those managers generally are not bound to stay fully
invested all the time or to limit themselves to one type of stock,
and thereby to take risks that few sensible investors would take on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people get caught up with exotic portfolio theory,''
said Scott W. Schoelzel, manager of the Janus Twenty fund, which,
according to Morningstar, was the best-performing diversified stock
fund over the last 12 months, gaining 32.5 percent. ``But I think
I'm just like my shareholders. I'm 40 years old, I'm saving for
retirement and for my kids' college education, and I think about
how would I do that if I were investing on my own and not running a
fund.''
</P>
<P>
   He does it by owning 20 or 30 stocks rather than 150, to better
focus on his best ideas. And Schoelzel lets cash build up to 20
percent or so of the portfolio when he cannot find attractive
stocks to buy. He prefers to wait until bargains crop up. He might
even buy the occasional 30-year Treasury bond, as he did earlier
this year with about 3 percent of the fund's $9.3 billion in assets
when the yield topped 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's a very common-sensical approach,'' Schoelzel said.
``The key is to have balance _ not to own stocks of just one
particular sector, but to look at five or six areas that generally
offer the most dynamic prospects for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, investors have been throwing money at the
Janus Twenty fund, even as they turned tail and ran away from stock
funds as a whole in August. In that regard, investors abandoned the
mantra they have have chanted for the last three years _ ``Where
else is there to put money than in stocks?'' _ and pulled a net $11
billion out of equity funds. It was the first month in eight years
in which they withdrew more money than they invested.
</P>
<P>
   The cloud hanging over the fund business represents a startling
change from the environment at the end of the second quarter, when
a fourth consecutive year of 20-plus percent gains seemed likely
for equity investors. Through the first half of 1998, the average
general equity fund was up more than 11 percent. Bond funds, too,
had registered gains, averaging nearly 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But by losing more than 13 percent of its value in the third
quarter, the average American stock fund wiped out the previous two
quarters of gains and then some.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, with the markets marching steadily
upwards, the industry trend had been to push fund managers into
ever-narrower pigeonholes. Fund companies increasingly cracked the
asset-allocation whip, insisting that managers remain fully
invested. And the companies progressively chipped away at managers'
freedom to buy across a range of different securities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the losses that many investors will face when they open
their third-quarter statements later this month might have been
smaller if fund managers had been given a bit more slack in how
they managed their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   A fund manager who has some flexibility to decide when, as well
as in which securities, to invest might give a fund shareholder a
leg up in times of market upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have some extra cash around,'' said Wallace R.
Weitz, manager of the Weitz Value and Weitz Partners Value funds,
which have had as much as one-quarter of their assets in cash this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Weitz knows of what he speaks. He is the only manager with two
of his equity funds among the top 10 performers over the last four
quarters. (A third fund, Weitz Hickory, managed by Richard F.
Lawson, ranked No. 11.) Weitz says he likes the spare cash
``because I always think that tomorrow I'll find a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Resisting the urge to pay too much for what are otherwise good
companies and rigorously cutting back on holdings whose prices move
up too far, too fast are two of the hardest disciplines for a
portfolio manager to master. And doing so is subverted in the
current environment, as fund analysts and pension consultants
demand that managers remain fully invested.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcing that dogma probably hurt investors more than it helped
them recently, because it has caused the amount of nonequity
investments in most fund shareholders' portfolios to drift further
and further down. That left many investors in a vulnerable position
when the market turned down.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of overall mutual fund assets in bonds has fallen
over the last three-plus years to 17 percent of assets, from 31
percent at the beginning of 1995. Over the same stretch, stocks
have risen to 58 percent from 40 percent, while cash has remained
relatively constant at about 25 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, of course, fund companies have tried to
help investors know what is in their portfolios. But they have done
so both by increasing their disclosure and by creating an enormous
number of new, specialized funds, investing in specific niches.
</P>
<P>
   Such specialization _ from Malaysian bonds to North American
commercial real estate to stocks of companies working to solve the
year-2000 problem _ creates inevitable problems for the fund
industry, financial analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get concerned when a fund group goes into so many
areas at once, particularly when those areas are not linked to any
particular ability that the fund company has,'' said Kurt Cerulli,
a Boston fund consultant.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the case for much of the fund industry in the last
several years. In trying to establish the breadth of product line
needed to be considered for corporate 401(k) and other retirement
programs, fund families have added funds that invest in obscure
overseas markets, funds that specialize in various industries and
portfolios that spread assets across all types of financial
securities.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy also helps fund companies by increasing the chance
that at least one of their funds will land in the upper ranks of
the performance tables, drawing attention and new investors. But
rather than being seduced by such variety, an investor may be able
to improve performance by looking for a company that has funds in
just a few categories, and that performs admirably in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if a fund company doesn't have a deep expertise in a
particular area, it doesn't have any business offering a product to
the public in that area,'' Cerulli said. ``You may hire a manager
with expertise in that area, but if as a company you don't have
that depth, how do you tell when a manager is straying into areas
where he shouldn't be?''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Cerulli said, is that the most esoteric investment
areas also carry the most risk. So when a downturn comes, liquidity
dries up quickly, making losses worse.
</P>
<P>
   Cerulli said that if those more obscure types of funds do not
perform well, fund companies are right to shut them down.
``Everybody would be better served if they never put those funds
out there in the first place,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   As emerging markets have crumbled around the world, investors
have fled from many of those funds. In the last several weeks, as
their assets have dropped to levels that make the funds
unprofitable to operate, at least a half-dozen Asian and
emerging-market funds have announced plans to liquidate or be
merged into larger funds.
</P>
<P>
   A few fund managers also shuttled off the stage in the third
quarter, among them some managers who had been at or near the top
of their ranks _ for example, Michael DiCarlo, who guided John
Hancock Special Equities for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   During that stretch, DiCarlo had racked up a stellar performance
record; the fund was in the top quartile of its peer group in four
of five years from 1991 through 1995. In the latter year, he
steered the portfolio to a gain of better than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   He was so well regarded by his superiors, in fact, that when
DiCarlo decided to leave the firm in mid-1996 to start a hedge
fund, John Hancock not only let him continue managing the Special
Equities fund; it also took a stake in his new venture.
</P>
<P>
   But he managed a return of only about 4 percent for the fund in
1996, followed by a 5 percent gain last year. And after getting off
to a similarly poor start in the first half of this year, DiCarlo
stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   DiCarlo could not be reached for comment last week. When he
stepped down from the John Hancock fund, he said in a news release:
``The performance of the target universe of the fund has been
disappointing over the last two years, as has the fund's
performance. Still, I am very appreciative to have served on behalf
of all those involved with Special Equities fund.''
</P>
<P>
   And Paul Stephens, chief investment officer for the Robertson
Stephens mutual funds and manager of the high-profile Robertson
Stephens Contrarian fund, gave up some of his duties last month
after a similarly prolonged slide. While he remains at the fund, he
now shares managerial duties with two colleagues, Andrew P. Pilara
Jr. and Roderick R. Berry.
</P>
<P>
   The Contrarian fund aims to buy out-of-favor investments that
will perform well when the current favorites run cold; instead,
even the worst-performing general stock funds in this year's market
slide had to sprint to beat it to the bottom of the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   After one of the best performances among world stock funds in
1995 and 1996, the Contrarian fund lost 30 percent last year and 37
percent in the first nine months of 1998 _ leaving it with
cumulative losses of roughly 20 percent since the fund's inception
in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens did not return a phone call seeking comment. But Pilara
said that while the fund has not changed its strategy, the new
managers ``will give us a greater breadth of sectors and ideas''
from which to choose investments.
</P>
<P>
   That such dismal performances can last so long usually means
that more went against a manager than just his investment style
going out of favor. Something else also falters _ his
stock-picking, his expectation of which way interest rates will go
or the like.
</P>
<P>
   But out of such extended periods of dismal performance,
opportunities are born. It is hard to believe, for example, that
there are no hidden gems among small-cap stocks, which have far
underperformed the large stocks that have benefited from equity
investors' recent flight to quality.
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Coffelt, manager of Texas Capital Value and Growth,
certainly believes there are. The fund gained 45 percent last year,
but lost 32 percent in the third quarter, leaving it down 19
percent in the first nine months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the psychology shifts, the place to be will be in small
caps,'' Coffelt said. ``The valuations already are incredibly
compressed. Small caps are selling at 50 percent of the valuations
of large-cap stocks. I think we will be in a recession sometime in
the next five years, and maybe we already are. But at this stage I
think that small stocks have already largely discounted that.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the best opportunities might be in funds
investors have all but ignored in the last year.

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, Oct. 8,
about Citigroup's third-quarter results misstated the two chief
executives' plans for their work force. While they still plan to
eliminate several thousand jobs, as was announced on Sept. 17, they
said yesterday that they planned no further job cuts beyond that.

BLACK LABOR LEADERS, POLICY EXPERTS DISCUSS ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; African-American labor leaders and policy experts met at
Harvard University Friday to discuss ways to increase living
standards and wages among US workers who would be jeopardized if
the global economic crisis spreads to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by the Harvard Trade Union Project and the
Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, Friday's economic summit
brought together some 50 black union leaders who represent 16
million workers around the country. Also participating were
Harvard's &UR;  &LR;  Afro-American studies department and the university's &UR;  &LR; 
Institute of Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Labor leaders and policy experts discussed the economic
crisis that has gripped much of the world &UR;  &LR; , and then called for
the creation of a multiracial political coalition to address the
concerns of blue collar and middle class workers who would &UR;  &LR; be hurt
in an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a strange and precarious situation in the United
States,'' Bill Fletcher, education director at the AFL-CIO in
Washington, D.C., told participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian crisis has gotten worse and worse. We were told it
would be contained, but it has kept spreading like an ink stain on
a white shirt,'' Fletcher said. ``Now Brazil and other parts of
Latin America are in trouble. Capitalism is unraveling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Participants of the meeting applauded organized labor
for &UR;  &LR; successfully fending off &UR;  &LR;  fast-track trade &UR;  &LR; legislation that
would have expanded the president's ability to quickly negotiate
trade treaties. Labor has long maintained that fast track
legislation would have promoted global trade without adequate wage,
safety and environmental provisions. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   They also called for greater cooperation among white, Latino,
Asian, and African-American labor leaders as well as grass-roots
religious, community and political groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the government's actions and policies have exacerbated
rather than alleviated the economic stresses of ordinary
families,'' noted William Julius Wilson, the Malcolm Wiener
professor of social policy at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson criticized trade policies that he said ``encourage the
pursuit of cheap labor in the global market place; monetary
policies that artificially raise interest rates and thereby lower
employment rates; tax policies that favor the truly wealthy; and
military spending that cuts into revenues that could be used for
social programs.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged participants to consider ways to develop a multiracial
political coalition that would generate national debate on such
issues and prompt public officials to consider the impact of
certain policies on American families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not whether to trade,'' Wilson said. ``We all
know that trade is important for the overall health and growth of
the economy. The question is how to trade.''

HARRINGTON WOULD BE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE WITH VAUGHN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mo Vaughn wants to meet with John Harrington to talk about
his future with the Red Sox, the door is open.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, through an alleged friend, reportedly said this week
that he was disapointed to read that the Sox CEO intends to leave
the contract negotiations with the All-Star first baseman to
general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Red Sox do not care who makes the deal for them. If
Mo wants to do it in private with Harrington, fine. That's what
this reporter was told when he called Fenway Park Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mo has a big charity dinner next week in Boston. Harrington will
be there. Duquette will be there. If Mo can't dial Fenway Park for
some reason to make an appointment with Harrington, he can do it at
the dinner next week.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is not bashful about dealing with Vaughn. Last
offseason, he drove to Mo's house to discuss the future. The Sox
always assumed that Vaughn wanted one of his agents, Tom Reich, to
negotiate with Duquette. But although they prefer to have Duquette
negotiate, they are ready to do whatever it takes to re-sign
Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WBZ-TV, Channel 4, in Boston, which gave us the unsubstantiated
story that the Red Sox had a private detective trailing Vaughn last
year, now comes forward with a report that racist letters were
written to Vaughn. But the station offers no letters as proof. Mo
has been playing in Boston for eight years and this is the first
time he's gotten hate mail? Is he the only member of the
organization that gets this kind of mail? Is this supposed to mean
that Mo will opt to leave town because of the alleged hate mail?
How did Mo's parents get this hate mail? If they got it from Mo,
why would he show it to them? ... This gets my vote as the sports
story of the year. This is the tale Deion Sanders told CBS
recently: ``I attempted suicide, but God had his hands on me. I ran
the car off the cliff, and it was like a 40- or 30-foot drop. The
car went down and there wasn't a scratch on me or the car.''
Sanders said he was driving about ``65 or 75 miles per hour'' at
the time. No one asked if he had a rubber car. No one asked how he
and his car got off the cliff or if God caught it in midair.

   Patriots owner Bob Kraft said he didn't mean to be critical of
Packers general manager Ron Wolf when he knocked him last week in a
piece by Ron Borges. Kraft critcized Wolf for not getting more for
coach Mike Holmgren if and when he leaves the Packers at the end of
the year. Green Bay will reportedly be compensated with a
second-round draft pick from whoever lands Holmgren, if in fact he
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft pointed out that he got first-, second-, third-, and
fourth-round choices when Bill Parcells left for the Jets and said
Packer stockholders were being shortchanged by Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf was surprised by Kraft's comments. ``I read what he had to
say and I feel it is so ridiculous that I don't want to respond,''
he said. ``Our agreement with Mike Holmgren was made long before
Bob Kraft was in the National Football League.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Wolf, the deal on Holmgren's departure was made
when he arrived in Green Bay. At the time, the Packers had to give
the San Francisco 49ers a second-round draft choice as compensation
for Holmgren. It was written into his contract with the 49ers that
if he ever left, the team he went to would have to give
compensation. The Packers did so and put a similar clause in his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren signed with Green Bay in 1992. Kraft made his deal for
Parcells with the Jets in February 1997. Wolf therefore was
precluded from ever even attempting to make the kind of deal for
Holmgren that Kraft made with the Jets.

   Great news for University of Massachusetts basketball fans.
Athletic director Bob Marcum is close to wrapping up a
home-and-home series with Michigan. The Wolverines, usually one of
the best teams in the nation, would be a tremendous draw ... One
scout who watched the Dolphins lose to the Jets last week says Dan
Marino's problem is that he has no receivers. His quarterback
rating is just about the lowest, and ``the guys he is throwing to
get no separation from the defensive backs,'' said the scout. ``The
best guy he has is O.J. McDuffie, and he couldn't start on a lot of
teams in this league.'' Marino will be in Jacksonville Monday to
face the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Here is a scouting report on the Patriots' guests in Foxborough
Sunday, the Kansas City Chiefs, from a coach who faced them this
season:
</P>
<P>
   ``Great speed on defense. Play with high intensity. They are
small as defenses go but have a bunch of guys who can run to the
ball in a hurry. Derrick Thomas will be coming (on the pass rush)
off the corner all day. He always stays on the edge. He hasn't been
coming inside. Their two cornerbacks (Dale Carter and James Hasty)
might be as good as any pair in the league. They'll press the
receivers right off the line of scrimmage. Defensively, they are
very tough. If you can pound the ball at them on the ground, you
can score points. They want to put you in second-and-long,
third-and-long situations and just pass-rush from all over the
place. They bring a lot of speed when they are in that mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, they are just OK. Their running back (Donnell
Bennett) is really more of a fullback. The interior of their
offensive line, two guards and a center, is very good. Tackle is
their big question. New England's speed on the corner could give
those guys trouble. I think (quarterback Rich) Gannon is tougher to
play against. (Elvis) Grbac (who is supposed to start tomorrow) is
more of a pocket passer. They like to run play-action and bootleg
kind of stuff. They look to (Andre) Rison in the pass game first
and then back to the tight end, (Tony) Gonzalez. He can be
dangerous. He has good speed deep, better than most tight ends. And
they have a good kicking game in (punter Louie) Aguiar and
(placekicker Pete) Stoyanovich.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bruins GM Harry Sinden on why he thinks his team will be better
this season, even though most of the players are the same: ``A year
ago this time, our players didn't know if they could win. Some of
them didn't know how good they were personally. We showed last year
we could play with anyone in the league. Guys like (P.J.) Axelsson,
(Tim) Taylor, (Rob) DiMaio found out how good they could be. As a
group, all of them should play with the confidence of a winner, and
that's very important.'' ... Saints offensive tackle William Roaf
on why it is difficult to play against the Patriot defense: ``They
have such great speed to the outside and go so wide, when you go
out to block them, it opens up this big hole inside and one of
their defensive backs comes blitzing through. If you are not ready
for it, they are going to be after your quarterback all game.''

A QUANDARY OVER READING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I should be ashamed to admit this, but I never read Dickens by
flashlight under the covers as a child. My father never read
``Treasure Island'' aloud by the hearth. My mother never had to
tell me to get my nose out of a book and go out to play.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, my eyes were weak even under full fluorescent light,
we didn't have a hearth and I liked to play outside as long as it
wasn't raining.
</P>
<P>
   I make this confession because we are at it again, wringing our
well-intentioned hands, holding high-minded symposia to scope out
the reasons our children have abandoned books.
</P>
<P>
   The word is out _ once more. Our children do not read, will not
read. They have been seduced by violent video games and sexy music
videos. They have been dulled by escapist electronic entertainment.
They have been rendered robotic by television, computer games and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Disregard for the written word is nothing short of a crisis, say
some of the most literate minds in the nation. Hundreds of them,
including Maya Angelou and David McCullough, got together Friday at
the John F. Kennedy Library to examine what was described as an
epidemic of literary indifference among American children.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is plenty of statistical evidence to bolster
their claim. The Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development says
that children ages 9 to 14 spend more than 20 percent of their
waking hours watching TV but only 1 percent of their time reading.
The US Department of Education says that more than 40 percent of
our third graders read below grade level, that most boys will stop
reading for pleasure by the fifth grade and that most girls will
give up recreational reading two years after that.
</P>
<P>
   So, why can't I get worked up by this?
</P>
<P>
   It is not as though reading is the activity of choice among my
own children, ages 12, 10, and 7. Forced to compete with soccer,
Mario Kart and Beanie Babies, a good book is liable to lose. Forced
to choose between a visit to the public library and the local video
store, my back seat drivers will steer the Caravan toward
Blockbuster every time.
</P>
<P>
   It's just a guess, but perhaps what we need is fewer symposia
and more patience. We present our daughter with a favorite book
from our childhood and fret when she tosses ``The Secret Garden''
aside by chapter two. Isn't it possible she'll rediscover it on her
own next year? We give our son the book that changed our young life
and cringe when he pronounces ``A Wrinkle In Time'' too ``boring''
to finish. Isn't it likely he will develop his own literary taste?
</P>
<P>
   We tell our children that books are a joy, not a chore. Then we
require them to read for 20 minutes each night and shudder when
they set the timer on the stove to avoid inadvertently reading too
long.
</P>
<P>
   We want answers for why books do not hold the magic for them we
claim they held &UR;  &LR; for us, but how many of us romanticize our
pre-pubescent love for the printed page? Did we really love ``Silas
Marner'' that much? Didn't we just as often choose the movies over
the library on a Saturday afternoon?
</P>
<P>
   A love of books, like a love of music, is not foreclosed to a
child who takes her time to develop an attraction. If it were, the
Boston Public Library and Symphony Hall would both be dark. An
appreciation of literature is not inaccessible to the child whose
family income puts Barnes&AMP;Noble out of his reach. If it were,
Boston would not draw so many of its public high school
valedictorians from the ranks of this city's newest immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe our children don't read as much as we would like. Maybe we
didn't read as much as we remember.
</P>
<P>
   We are living in anti-intellectual times, in a culture that is
both superficial and ahistorical. At the behest of pop
psychologists, we have all spent at least one strained dinner hour
trying to explain Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky to our children.
But how many of us have taken the same opportunity to discuss
Richard Nixon and Andrew Johnson? Exactly how many of us have read
``Treasure Island'' aloud by the hearth?
</P>
<P>
   For eight hours Friday, a lot of good people got together on the
edge of the city to consider the intellectual future of our
children. Maybe I'm wrong not to be alarmed. Maybe what our
children need is yet another well-financed literacy campaign that
will convince them this time that reading really is fun.
</P>
<P>
   It was raw and damp at the Kennedy Library on Boston Harbor. The
kind of day that makes it hard for even the most earnest among us
to find the energy to solve the small problems, let alone the big
ones. The kind of day that makes you want to curl up with a good
book instead.

REDMOND SAYS HE'LL BE BACK IN '99  
 INSISTS HE WON'T LEAVE ASU FOR NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Versatile tailback J.R. Redmond said Thursday that he's ready to
take on another role: college senior.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State standout dismissed speculation that he will
leave school after his junior season to make himself eligible for
the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going anywhere,'' Redmond said. `I'll be here. I'm
just now starting to get a handle on football as far as learning
the game. And I'm just starting to get a handle on my schoolwork,
too. I need another year to get better at both.''
</P>
<P>
   If Redmond returns, it also might give ASU an opportunity to
restart his Heisman Trophy campaign. He was considered a legitimate
candidate before the season, but a slow start by him and the Sun
Devils have diminished his chances.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond has rushed for 556 yards and six touchdowns. After
totaling 136 yards and one touchdown in the Sun Devils' first two
games, he has had 419 yards and five in the past three.
</P>
<P>
   He had the best game of his career Saturday against Southern
California at the Los Angeles Coliseum, when he accumulated an ASU
record 350 all-purpose yards and a career-high 214 rushing yards.
He became the 12th man in ASU history to rush for 200 yards in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond's rushing average of 111 yards per game ranks second in
the Pac-10. His 207 all-purpose yards per game rank first in the
conference and fifth in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   He also plays safety, although he has played little on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still consider myself a defensive back first who's learning
how to play running back,'' he said recently. ``I think I have room
to become a better tailback. I'm really trying to be a student of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Most speculated that the lure of NFL money would prompt Redmond
to leave early. But the senior said completing his education is a
priority. He is majoring in English. &QL;

KIDNAP SUSPECT EYED IN GIRLS' SLAYINGS

<P>
   CLINTON, Mass. _ A man accused of trying to lure a young girl
into his car six weeks ago is under investigation for ties to the
murders of two children after police said he told them he was
nearby when Holly Piirainen and Sarah Pryor were abducted.
</P>
<P>
   John Robert Allen, 55, of Clinton was ordered to undergo a
psychia-tric evaluation last month after his arrest for attempted
kidnapping at a school bus stop in Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who has pleaded not guilty, allegedly offered $25 to a
12-year-old if she would ride with him to Connecticut, but he fled
after a parent approached him.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Allen told investigators he was in the area
when Piirainen disappeared in 1993 in Sturbridge, and when Pryor
vanished from Wayland in 1985, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is being investigated, and we are trying to be sure that
all avenues are being looked at,'' said the Sturbridge police
chief, Thomas Button. ``At this point, nothing has turned up that
would lead us in either direction _ that he is or isn't involved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Button said items seized from Allen's home and truck, and
the circumstances that led to his arrest, have prompted authorities
to consider him as a possible suspect in the other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities from Dudley, Webster, and Sturbridge met recently
with State Police investigators to review the case and present
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say (Allen) is not as strong a possibility as when we
first looked at him,'' Button said. ``But we haven't discontinued
the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Allen Sept. 2 after the 12-year-old girl and the
parent who helped chase him away identified him in photographs.
Police said they searched Allen's 1998 pickup and found a knife, a
camera, an instruction book on tying knots, a pornographic
magazine, two full bottles of alcohol, and a piece of paper with
the word ``blonde'' written on it.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Allen told the girl he ``was
looking for a `12- or 13-year-old blonde-headed girl named Molly'
and that Molly had a dimple like Marilyn Monroe.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they later discovered that Allen had been carrying a
46-inch length of rope that was burned at both ends. Authorities
said Allen told them ``he had used the rope as a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   In a search warrant affidavit dated Sept. 9, Michael P. Stevens,
a Dudley police investigator, said that ``throughout the interview
(with police) Mr. Allen provided spontaneous, unsolicited
statements regarding his whereabouts in relation to other
abductions, kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stated he was in the Sturbridge area `when that girl was
abducted, kidnapped, and murdered.' He went on to mention how he
also used to live in Sudbury, Mass., Route 117 near Wayland, Mass.,
when Sarah Pryor was abducted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the court papers supporting his request to search Allen's
Palmer Court home, Stevens said Allen ``appeared cognitive and was
well-spoken'' when he gave that statement.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's name does not appear on the state's sex-offender
registry, which traces criminal activity to 1981. However,
Stevens's affidavit says that Allen was the subject of a Peeping
Tom investigation in Boylston.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Allen was suspected of peering through holes in
ceiling tiles ``to watch persons in their apartment rooms in
various states of dress/undress,'' according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton neighbors said Allen once told two children in his
neighborhood that he was naked under his bathrobe and, in another
incident, once threatened to stab a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The items seized from Allen's home and shipped to the State
Police crime lab includ a blue comforter and a yellow pillow case;
trace samples from a shirt, a blanket, and the comforter; three
pairs of sneakers; and two pairs of gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley police confiscated three bags of children's clothing, a
pair of girl's panties, hair elastics, children's caps, three
ropes, and a strongbox with pictures of nude women.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Worcester County Jail and House of Correction,
where Allen is being held, identified his attorney as Jennifer
Ginsburg. She could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   State Police referred questions about Allen to Worcester
District Attorney John Conte and Middlesex District Attorney Thomas
F. Reilly. Both declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Piirainen, 10, disappeared Aug. 5, 1993, while looking at
puppies at a neighbor's house. Hunters found her remains two months
later in a secluded and wooded area of Brimfield. State Police in
Sturbridge maintain a tip line (508-347-8173) to receive
information about her case.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, forensic scientists determined that human
remains found in Wayland almost three years before were those of
Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old child disappeared in October 1985. Wayland and
State Police have tried to build a case against John R. Whirty, now
serving a life sentence after violating parole on a murder
conviction in Texas. Whirty, who was on parole when Pryor
disappeared, has denied involvement in the crime.

NABOKOV SON FILES SUIT TO BLOCK A RETOLD `LOLITA'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RALPH BLUMENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What if Lolita didn't die at the end? What if she kept a diary
and had her own story to tell?
</P>
<P>
   With that premise, a distaff version of Vladimir Nabokov's 1955
novel ``Lolita'' has set off a legal battle over copyright
infringement and the limits of artistic borrowing. The story about
a middle-aged professor's sexual obsession with a 12-year-old
nymphet, originally told from the man's perspective, is now
recounted by a vampish and disaffected girl.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Shakespeare, writers appropriated each other's
historical themes, plots and characters, refashioning them into new
works. At issue here, apparently for the first time, is whether a
work fresh enough to be still covered by copyright can be used as
extensively as ``Lolita'' has been.
</P>
<P>
   The new book, ``Lo's Diary,'' a first novel by Pia Pera, a
42-year-old Italian short-story writer, has been published in Italy
and the Netherlands. But with the licensing of English-language
rights in Britain and the United States, the Nabokov estate,
represented by the author's son, Dmitri, filed suit on Thursday in
federal court in Manhattan to block American publication by Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux next July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, in a word, a rip-off,'' according to court documents
filed by the estate's lawyer, Peter Skolnik, of Roseland, N.J. The
estate also said that Ms. Pera's ``inferior and amateurish
merchandise'' harms the reputation of Nabokov, who died in 1977,
and seeks to capitalize on his work, which has been translated into
at least 20 languages, sold 50 million copies and been made into
two movies.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Friedman, a Manhattan lawyer representing Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, said the way ``Lo's Diary'' grew out of ``Lolita'' fell
within ``fair use'' standards set by the U.S. Supreme Court, and
that Ms. Pera's novel was ``transformative,'' supplanting the
original work with ``a further purpose'' and ``new expression.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from her home in San Loren Giudice in Tuscany,
released through her publisher, Ms. Pera said: ```Lolita' belongs
not just to literature but to everyday language and contemporary
mythology. This suit makes one wonder whether new light can be cast
on our cultural heritage only after the term of copyright has
expired.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Nabokov had opened the door to her book by having
his narrator, Humbert Humbert, admit, ``I simply did not know a
thing about my darling's mind.'' Speaking of Lolita, Humbert also
says, ``Oh, that I were a lady writer who could have her pose naked
in a naked light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did,'' Ms. Pera said, ``was to accept Nabokov's
challenge, his implied invitation to a literary tennis match that,
it seems to me, has a long and well-established tradition behind
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jonathan Galassi, executive vice president and editor in chief
of Farrar, Straus, called Ms. Pera's book ``a dynamic and original
work of art which reacts to and comments on a provocative precursor
_ a time-honored tradition in Western literature from the classical
period on down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Nabokov, who divides his time between Switzerland and
Florida, was said by Skolnik to be in Sebring, Fla., racing cars
and not available for comment. Both Skolnik and Friedman said they
could think of no litigation that quite matched the issues in this
case.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of intellectual property through copyright was
written into the Constitution, but the terms have been amended over
the years. The copyright on ``Lolita'' runs 75 years from its first
publication by Olympia Press in France in 1955, until 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Nabokov's novel opens with a (fictional) literary editor, John
Ray Jr., explaining how he came to possess the ensuing memoir by
Humbert, who had died in custody awaiting trial. The memoir details
Humbert's passion for young girls, beginning with a delirious
youthful love for a doomed sweetheart. As a bachelor professor, he
boards with a lovelorn widow, Charlotte Haze, and her daughter,
Dolores, called Lolita. He marries Charlotte to pursue the girl
and, after Charlotte unmasks his secret and is killed in an
accident, Humbert enacts his erotic fantasies as Lolita's
stepfather, guardian and lover. Finally, Lolita is lured away by
another pedophile, whom Humbert murders in revenge. Lolita marries
someone else and dies in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lo's Diary,'' first published in 1995 in Italy, also begins
with the editor John Ray, but this time he is visited by a young
woman with her husband and son. She is Lolita, the former Dolores
Maze _ the real Humbert Guibert disguised her name as he did his
own, she relates _ and offers him her diary for publication. She
never died in childbirth as Guibert wrote. Nor did Guibert murder
her new seducer. The editor takes the diary, forgets about it,
rediscovers it later and has it published, while Humbert Guibert,
retired on the Riviera at 85, lives with a young mulatto wife and
plays tennis and correspondence chess.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pera's book fills in Lolita's life before she met Humbert,
relating the deaths of her father and young brother and her sexual
escapades. It also details the bitter Oedipal rivalry with her
mother, whom she describes with often scatological epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, perhaps, is that in this telling Lolita is a
blatant seductress. From the moment she sees Humbert, she covets
him. Calling him a guinea pig for her seduction technique, she
says, ``Possible variants: swing a foot back and forth, flutter
your eyelids, fan yourself, snap your fingers to the music, blow a
bubble then suck the gum slowly back into your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   After their first sexual encounter, she writes, ``Maybe he
hasn't yet realized what happened to him: that I seduced him.''
</P>
<P>
   Later she finds him a bore in bed, then abusive and hateful. She
takes her revenge with a fountain pen in a particularly graphic
way.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawyers for both sides said this case seemed to break
new legal ground, countless literary and dramatic creations have
drawn on earlier works in the public domain, from ``Ulysses''
(``The Odyssey'') to ``West Side Story'' (``Romeo and Juliet'') and
``Wide Sargasso Sea'' (``Jane Eyre'').
</P>
<P>
   Peter Carey, feeling that Dickens shortchanged the convict
Magwitch in ``Great Expectations,'' rewrote him as the hero of his
recent novel, ``Jack Maggs;'' Jane Smiley retold the King Lear
legend in ``A Thousand Acres;'' Philip Roth wrote Anne Frank into
``The Ghost Writer'' and John Updike, in ``S,'' retold Hester
Prynne's story from ``The Scarlet Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Updike said Friday, was that ``Hawthorne is not
under copyright.'' He said his sympathies lay with Nabokov. ``I
would be upset,'' he said. ``I think of my characters as mine. I
wouldn't want someone handling them with dirty fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, in its new catalog, Random House, publisher of
``Lolita,'' lists a forthcoming novel by Emily Prager, ``Roger
Fishbite,'' about a 13-year-old girl seduced by her mother's
husband. She is described as capturing ``the combined personalities
of Eloise and Lolita.''

FARM LABOR OPPOSES BILL ON IMPORTING MORE WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ore.)  (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As part of the last-minute lobbying battle before Congress
recesses, farm worker groups and Hispanic organizations are
fighting a bill that would let American farmers bring in tens of
thousands of foreign workers _ a move opponents say would hurt farm
worker wages and housing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by these organizations, the White House has threatened a
veto and is pressing Republican leaders in Congress to leave the
guest worker measure out of an omnibus appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   But growers' organizations are lobbying to preserve the measure,
asserting that a labor shortage has left many farmers without
enough workers for the harvest, causing fruit to rot in the fields
in several states. The growers contend that tougher immigration
enforcement has produced a shortage of workers, while farm worker
advocates argue that the overriding reason growers are having
trouble finding workers is that they pay poverty-level wages.
</P>
<P>
   Asserting that growers have concocted the notion of a labor
shortage, opponents assert that the bill will create a new bracero
program _ a 1950s program in which farmers brought workers from
Mexico to labor in near-peonage conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a monstrous proposal,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.
``At a time when a number of independent studies, including ones
that Congress commissioned, show that we have a large surplus of
farm workers whose pay is at the bottom of the American work force,
we are bringing in potentially unlimited numbers of foreign guest
workers to displace them. That is going to push wages down
further.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Senate approved a bipartisan amendment, introduced
by Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., that would allow
growers to bring in foreign workers if the growers could not obtain
sufficient workers within seven days through a government-run
registry.
</P>
<P>
   The House has not approved a guest worker bill, but Senate-House
conferees are debating whether to include the Wyden-Smith amendment
or a slimmed-down version in an overall appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is pressuring the conferees not to include any
guest worker provision. Administration officials and many
conservative Republicans fear that the bill will bring in hundreds
of thousands of immigrants who will refuse to return home once
their visas expire.
</P>
<P>
   John Fraser, acting administrator of the Department of Labor's
Wage and Hour Division, said the administration thinks ``this bill
will increase illegal immigration, it will reduce job opportunities
for legal U.S. farm workers, and it will undercut wages and working
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional negotiators said they might settle on a reduced
pilot program to admit a maximum of 100,000 guest farm workers
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyden-Smith amendment, which was approved without committee
hearings, differs from current law in that the growers would not
have to provide housing for the guest workers. Instead, growers
could provide a housing stipend.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate amendment would speed the process of obtaining
workers by no longer requiring growers to advertise for domestic
workers first or to receive government certification of a labor
shortage in their area.
</P>
<P>
   Growers assert that the existing law, under which 20,000 guest
workers were brought in last year, is too cumbersome. They add that
the proposed law would help insure a legal work force, noting that
about two-fifths of the nation's 2 million farm workers are here
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The current program ``is not workable for agriculture either in
time or in affordability,'' Smith said. ``So when no one uses it,
workers and employers are forced to operate in an illegal
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for farm workers point to a recent General Accounting
Office study showing that no farm worker shortage exists. They note
that the jobless rate in many California agricultural counties is
more than twice the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing's a scam,'' said Dolores Huerta, co-founder
of the United Farm Workers. ``There is no shortage of workers. In
some ways, this program would be even worse than the bracero
program. Back then, they had to guarantee workers housing and here
they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   She predicted that workers given housing stipends would often
not be able to find shelter because of a housing shortage in many
rural areas or would crowd 20 or 25 people into a house to save
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for them to simply stand there and say there is no
shortage,'' said Doug Kerr, general counsel for the Western Growers
Association, whose 3,200 members account for 90 percent of the
fresh fruits and vegetables produced in California. ``But if they
go into the Central Valley today, they'll see grapes and tree fruit
rotting in the field because we don't have enough workers to pick
them.''

PADRES HAVE CROWD, BUT BRAVES HAD MADDUX  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO, Calif. _ The San Diego Padres are expecting more than
60,000 fans at Qualcomm Stadium this weekend, a far cry from the
low turnouts at Turner Field in Atlanta, where there were at least
7,000 empty seats for both Game 1 and Game 2 of the National League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, who own a 2-0 lead over the Atlanta Braves, will
have the crowd _ and baseball history _ behind them for Games 3 and
4. Since the championship series went to a four-of-seven-game
series in 1985, no team that has lost the first two games at home
has rallied to win a trip to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it to be totally different,'' Tony Gwynn, the
eight-time batting champion, said Friday. ``I think our fans are
excited. It doesn't happen that often here. If it's anything like
it was here last weekend, you better get some earplugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was speaking about the division series, in which the
Padres eliminated the Houston Astros. But despite the disadvantage
of the crowd, the Braves still have one strong edge for Game 3 on
Saturday: Greg Maddux, the 18-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're up, 2-0, I'd imagine we won't be favored in
either game,'' San Diego General Manager Kevin Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux will be matched up with the left-hander Sterling
Hitchcock. In Sunday's Game 4, Atlanta's Denny Neagle will oppose
Joey Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Maddux going in Game 3?'' Towers said. ``He's one of the
best pitchers baseball has ever seen. We have to pitch with them if
we're going to have a chance to win. If either game is a slugfest,
we're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Padres, neither of the first two games in
Atlanta came close to resembling a shootout. San Diego won Game 1
by 3-2 in 10 innings on a Ken Caminiti home run. And then Kevin
Brown continued his uncanny mastery of Atlanta in Thursday's Game
2, as he tossed a three-hit shutout, struck out 11 and contributed
a pair of key singles in a 3-0 victory over Tom Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Braves have the best rotation in baseball, the
Padres have Brown, who has won his last six decisions against
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Braves can somehow scrap their way back into the
series, they will have to find a way to get past Brown _ who
defeated them twice in last fall's National League Championship
Series while pitching for the Florida Marlins _ for the first time
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down 3 games to 1 to the Cardinals in 1996, and we
came back,'' Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox said after his team had lost
the first two games of a championship series for the first time in
the 1990's. ``We have the type of pitching and I think we've got
the hitting _ once it gets going _ that we could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine said: ``It's not an enviable position to be in, down 0-2
going to the other ball park. But it wasn't too long ago that we
were up 2-0 in a World Series and wound up being swept. It can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, of course, was referring to 1996, when the Yankees
rallied from two home losses to win the Series in six games. For
history to pay the Braves' back, however, they must get some
production from the middle of their lineup. Chipper Jones (1 for
8), Andres Galarraga (0 for 8), Ryan Klesko (0 for 5) and Javy
Lopez (2 for 7) are a combined 3 for 28 (.107) with 0 runs batted
in in the first two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Gwynn cautioned, ``Even though we're up 2-0, sooner or
later we're going to have to bust out offensively ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though Maddux is just 3-5 with a 4.07 earned run
average in 9 championship series starts, busting out against him is
not the easiest thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole pitching staff believes that good pitching
will beat good hitting on any day of the week,'' Maddux said. ``I
don't think there are going to many differences for me pitching in
San Diego.''

GWYNN'S SPIRIT PREVAILS THROUGH THICK AND THIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The 1993 season was particularly hard on Tony Gwynn
and the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   They lost 101 games and finished with the worst record in the
major leagues. By the time the season was over they had dumped Fred
McGriff, Gary Sheffield, Greg Harris and Bruce Hurst in an effort
to save money.
</P>
<P>
   The future looked bleak. When the season was over, Charles Gwynn
sought out his son for a heart-to-heart chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said, `You need to get out of there,' '' Tony Gwynn
said. ```They're not trying to win, you've got to get out.' I tried
to convince him I was happy here, it was good for my family and I
didn't want to leave. He died two days after Thanksgiving. I never
did convince him.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't left yet, either. Eighteen years after being drafted
out of San Diego State University, Gwynn has become a cherished
institution in San Diego, having won eight batting titles while
enduring seven losing seasons, four last-places finishes and the
wrath of the players' association for refusing to test the
free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were those old brown uniforms the Padres used to
wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started watching the Padres when I was in college, paying
$1.50 to sit in the bleachers,'' Gwynn said. ``I used to sit there
and say, `Those've got to be the ugliest uniforms I've ever seen.'
Then I got drafted by the Padres and I said, `Oh no, now I've got
to wear that ugly uniform.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But everything I've done in the major leagues, I've done it
with the Padres, whether it's in a good uniform or bad. That means
a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling is mutual in San Diego, and when the Padres are
introduced at 3:15 p.m. today before their first National League
Championship Series home game since 1984, the loudest and longest
ovation will be reserved for Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got goose bumps when they gave him a standing ovation before
the Houston series,'' Padres pitcher Ed Vosberg said. ``They love
him there. They treat him like a king.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Padres president Larry Lucchino: ``The value of his loyalty
and identity is incalculable. We all need heroes, and San Diego has
a hero in Tony Gwynn. He's repaid the city for its adulation with
his commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn is hoping to repay that affection further by leading the
Padres back to the World Series for the first time since 1984.
There was a division title in 1996, but the Padres were knocked out
in the first round of the playoffs. Otherwise, it has been a lean
14 years with Gwynn's annual run at the batting title about all
there was to cheer about in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Gwynn had a long chat with Paul Molitor, who
bailed out after 15 long seasons in Milwaukee, signed as a free
agent with the Toronto Blue Jays in 1993 and played on a World
Series winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what it was like to play in a World Series?''
Gwynn said. ``How does it affect you? He said it was quite an
elation after they won and after a month goes by, you realize
that's what this game is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn wants to enjoy that same feeling with the Padres. They
enter today's game with a 2-0 best-of-seven series lead against the
Atlanta Braves. Gwynn is halfway there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long wait for him,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy
said. ``We'd like to get there for all of us, and especially Tony
Gwynn.''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much time left. Gwynn is 38 and has two years left
on his contract. San Diego's stadium issue also hangs in the air.
If voters don't approve a new stadium in a November referendum, the
possibility exists the team could move to Northern Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't going anywhere,'' said Gwynn, referring to his family
and not the Padres. ``They might move, but I won't be going with
them. That's the good thing about baseball, if you have some
success, you can dictate your own situation. That's a big plus.''
</P>
<P>
   That hints at retirement, but there is one other unfinished
piece of business, beyond getting back to the World Series. Gwynn
finished the season with 2,928 hits, leaving him 72 short of 3,000.
Barring injury, which has become a factor with Gwynn, he should
reach that mark easily next season.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, whose 5-foot-11, 220-pound pudgy body doesn't remotely
approach the prototypical athlete, remains one of the elite hitters
in the league, even if an Achilles' tendon injury and thumb injury
limited him to 127 games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Blub,'' as he calls himself, hit .321, which is a great
season by most standards, but it ended a streak of four consecutive
batting titles. It was 18 points below his career average of .339
and was the first time in six years he did not raise his career
average.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not close to being what I've been, I don't want to be
hanging on,'' Gwynn said. ``My goal is to play until 2000, and I
feel I can do that. I can't think of a year over the past 10 years
where I didn't have an injury, but that's not a big deal. They
linger, but you still play because I love to play.''

ALLIED SIGNAL TO PURSUE AMP DESPITE ADVERSE RULING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allied Signal Inc. said Friday that it would proceed with its
offer of $44.50 a share to buy 9 percent of the outstanding stock
of AMP Inc., indicating confidence that Allied's $9.7 billion
hostile takeover bid would be successful despite a federal judge's
ruling that part of its purchase plan was unlawful.
</P>
<P>
   AMP, in an effort to show shareholders that it could add value
to the company, said Friday that it would buy back up to 30 million
of its shares, or about 14 percent, for $55 a share.
</P>
<P>
   AMP investors reacted favorably to the latest twist in the
takeover battle. Shares of AMP, which is based in Harrisburg, Pa.,
rose $3.5625 on Friday, to $41.3125, and those of Allied Signal
increased $1.50, to $36.
</P>
<P>
   Allied, an aerospace and automotive parts maker based in
Morristown, N.J., said it was appealing the Thursday ruling by U.S.
District Judge James Giles. He ruled that it would be ``unlawful''
for the company to pursue a plan to have AMP shareholders, through
written consent, gain control from the board over AMP's shareholder
rights plan, which includes an anti-takeover provision, or poison
pill.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the ruling, the judge, who sits in the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania, said that the poison pill could remain in place
until it expired in November 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors viewed another portion of the judge's ruling,
which temporarily halted Allied's plan to name 17 additional
members to AMP's board, as a sign that Allied should offer a slate
of nominees without ties to Allied.
</P>
<P>
   The judge delayed the solicitation of written consents to elect
board nominees until Allied stated that ``its director nominees
have a fiduciary duty solely to AMP.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal said it expected to comply early next week with
the ruling. But it will offer the same nominees it originally
suggested: 14 current board members _ including the chief executive
of Allied, Lawrence Bossidy _ plus three other senior Allied
executives.
</P>
<P>
   AMP's $55 tender offer expires Nov. 20. In the meantime, if
Allied successfully complies with the judge's ruling, it can begin
after next Thursday to solicit written consents to have its
nominees elected to the AMP board.
</P>
<P>
   Several AMP shareholders said Friday that they hoped Allied's
persistence would prompt AMP executives to negotiate a friendly
offer for the company.

CIA SAID TO IGNORE CHARGES OF CONTRA DRUG DEALING IN '80S 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite requests for information from Congress, the
CIA repeatedly ignored or failed to investigate allegations of drug
trafficking by the anti-Sandinista rebels of Nicaragua in the
1980s, according to a newly declassified internal report.
</P>
<P>
   In a blunt and often critical report, the CIA's inspector
general determined that the agency ``did not inform Congress of all
allegations or information it received indicating that
contra-related organizations or individuals were involved in drug
trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1986, the subject of contra drug trafficking became
a focus for critics of the Reagan administration's policy toward
Nicaragua who charged that the CIA was shielding drug smugglers to
protect its anti-Communist covert action program in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   That year Congress imposed a fund cutoff for any contra group
that had members involved in drug trafficking. Despite that ban,
the CIA failed to tell Congress about allegations it had received
against at least eight individuals with contra ties.
</P>
<P>
   During the time the ban on funds was in effect, the CIA informed
Congress only about drug charges against two other contra-related
people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agency failed to tell other executive branch
agencies, including the Justice Department, about drug allegations
against 11 contra-related individuals or entities.
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes many active and retired CIA officers who
served in Central America as saying they either did not hear or did
not believe allegations of drug trafficking involving the contra
rebels, with whom they worked closely. It also makes clear that the
agency did little or nothing to investigate most of the drug
allegations that it heard about the contras and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1987, the acting director of central intelligence,
William Gates, wrote in a memorandum that it was ``absolutely
imperative that this agency and our operations in Central America
avoid any kind of involvement with individuals or companies that
are even suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA investigation that began almost a decade later, however,
found no evidence that the memorandum was distributed to anyone
other than Gates' deputy for operations, Clair George.
</P>
<P>
   The new study is the second volume of the CIA's internal
investigation prompted by a 1996 series of articles in The San Jose
Mercury-News, which claimed that a ``dark alliance'' between the
CIA, the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra
war with millions of dollars in profits from drug smuggling. The
series also alleged that this network was the first to introduce
crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles. The first volume of
the CIA inspector general's report, issued in January, dealt
primarily with the specific allegations raised by the Mercury-News
series and dismissed the newspaper's central findings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the second volume is the result of a broader inquiry into
long- unresolved questions about the contra program and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the inspector general's report found that the CIA had
received allegations of drug involvement by 58 contras or others
linked to the contra program. These included 14 pilots and two
others tied to the contra program's CIA-backed air transportation
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates that information linking the contras to
drugs began to emerge almost as soon as the contras came into
existence _ and before it became publicly known that the CIA was
supporting their effort to overthrow the Marxist-led government in
Managua.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1981, as a small group of rebels was being formed
from former soldiers in the National Guard of the deposed
Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, a CIA informant
reported that the leadership of the fledgling group had decided to
smuggle drugs to the United States to support its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, another report indicated that one prominent
leader of the group, Justiniano Perez, was a close friend of a
known trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's response also set something of a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``No information has been found to indicate any action to follow
up or corroborate the allegations,'' the report said. `` No
information has been found to indicate that the agency pursued any
action to follow up or corroborate the May 1982 FBI information
concerning Justiniano Perez's alleged close friendship with a
reputed drug trafficker named Paisa and Perez's alleged promise to
help Paisa later in return for financial assistance.''

TROJANS, BEARS FEELING DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If USC and California offer two accurate examples
of the West Coast offense, Bill Walsh will probably be wincing
somewhere today.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans enter the contest against Cal at the Coliseum ranked
last in the Pacific-10 Conference in passing. As for the Golden
Bears, they are slightly better: ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both West Coast offenses are struggling,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said in a major understatement.
</P>
<P>
   While both teams are foundering offensively, they are being
saved by their defenses, and that accounts for the fact the game
has retained some importance. The Trojans (4-1, 2-0) and Golden
Bears (3-1, 1-0) are among five teams sitting atop the conference
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Since USC has won 16 of the past 20 meetings and is a 12{-point
favorite today, common sense dictates the Trojans will continue
their winning ways against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett is probably more unsure of the offense today than
before the season. Tailback Chad Morton remains questionable with a
bruised back. Morton ran Friday afternoon but will wait until after
pregame warm-ups to decide if he will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do we play without Chad Morton? We don't know where we are
without Chad,'' Hackett said. ``Our flair (offensively) has been
the flair we had with Chad Morton.''
</P>
<P>
   Without him, Hackett has focused on the rivalry. He's a bit of
an expert, since he coached at Cal from 1972-75 and then went
directly to USC for five seasons (1976-80).
</P>
<P>
   ``Cal and USC have never had a love affair,'' Hackett said. ``As
a young coach at Cal, everything was based on whether you could
beat USC. Since then, Cal always looked at us as the premier
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett couldn't wait to tell the Trojans about comments earlier
this week that Cal players had criticized USC's tradition. It
didn't seem to evoke much of a response, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as our team, we have no room to talk. That's for high
school games,'' right guard Travis Claridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Morton's status and the rivalry, there's a little
something known as the conference race that matters dearly to both
teams. It's early enough in the season for each to remain
optimistic, but the loser will clearly be relegated to also-ran
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of teams could jump up with good fortune and good
health,'' Cal coach Tom Holmoe said. ``That's what we're trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Bears have won three games without their offense.
They have yet to rush for a touchdown this season and produced just
three points in their 24-14 victory over Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team being carried by its defense,'' Hackett said. ``I
guess you could say their strength vs. our weakness and our
strength vs. their weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Verle Sorgen, the Pacific-10 Conference's coordinator
of football officiating, faxed Hackett a letter Friday saying
Arizona State center Grey Ruegamer legally blocked USC defensive
tackle Marc Matock on the play Matock broke his ankle. ``It's
blindside and low, but it's from the side and it's legal,'' Sorgen
said. ``USC did (inquire) about it. It's a dangerous block, but it
was legal.'' Sorgen watched game tapes with sideline and end-zone
views before rendering his opinion. Hackett said earlier this week
that the play was legal, but USC wanted to get a rules
interpretation from Sorgen....
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was unsure Friday whether Matt Welch or Ken Bowen would
start at right tackle. Welch missed Wednesday's practice with a
sore shoulder but is OK. Both are expected to play....
</P>
<P>
   USC's No. 1-ranked water polo team will host No. 4 California
today at the Olympic Swim Stadium at 1 p.m.

GAY MAN SEVERELY BEATEN IN WYOMING; 2 MEN CHARGED  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add time element to graf 14)   By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ At first, the passing bicyclist thought the
crumpled form lashed to a ranch fence was a scarecrow. But when he
stopped, he found the burned, battered and nearly lifeless body of
Matthew Shepard, an openly gay college student who had been tied to
the fence 18 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the 22-year-old University of Wyoming student was in
a coma in critical condition. At Albany County courthouse here,
Russell Henderson, 21, and Aaron McKinney, 22, were arraigned on
charges of kidnapping, aggravated robbery and attempted
first-degree murder. Two women described as friends of the men,
Kristen Leann Price, 18, and Chastity Vera Pasley, 20, have been
charged as accessories after the fact to attempted first-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's friends said that he did not know his alleged
tormentors. Laramie police say the primary motive was robbery,
although court papers filed Friday indicate Shepard's homosexuality
may also have been a factor. Shepard's friends call the attack a
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very open about his sexuality,'' Tina LaBrie, an
anthropology student here, said of her friend. ``I admired him for
that because it is very courageous to be yourself even when others
disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before he was beaten, Shepard, a slight 5-foot,
2-inch man who wore braces on his teeth, had attended a meeting of
the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgendered Association, said Walter
Boulden, a friend of Shepard's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sitting at the bar, having a beer, when two men came up
and talked to him,'' Boulden, a 46-year-old university lecturer of
social work here, said today between tears. ``He indicated he was
gay, and they said they were gay, too.''
</P>

   ``Now, he is in a coma,'' continued Boulden, who visited his
friend at a hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., on Thursday. ``I don't
think anybody expects him to pull through.''

<P>
   Shepard, who spoke Arabic and German, studied at a boarding
school in Switzerland before moving back to the United States to
attend the University of Wyoming, the alma mater of his father, an
oil rig safety inspector in Saudi Arabia. Matthew Shepard was born
in Casper, the capital of Wyoming's oil belt, and spent much of his
youth there.
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks after returning to Wyoming and enrolling as a
freshman here, Shepard fell into a depression, said Ms. Labrie and
her husband, Phillip. Accustomed to life in Europe and Denver, this
foreign language student who wanted to become a diplomat found
himself living in this isolated city of 27,000 people. Set in a
treeless landscape defined by barbed wire fences, grazing cattle
and a busy freight railroad line, Laramie is a town where pickup
trucks outnumber sport utility vehicles, where fall entertainment
revolves around this Saturday's homecoming football game and the
start of the hunting season in the nearby Medicine Bow mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wyoming often bills itself as the ``equality state,''
in reference to its being the first state to give women the vote,
the state legislature has repeatedly voted down hate crime
legislation on the grounds that it would give homosexuals special
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wyoming is not really gay friendly,'' Marv Johnson, executive
director of the Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said from Cheyenne. ``The best way to characterize that is
by a comment a legislator made a few years back, when he likened
homosexuals to gay bulls as worthless and should be sent to the
packing plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard joined the campus gay association at the university
within days. One of his favorite haunts was the Fireside Bar, which
drew a mixed crowd of college students and rodeo cowboys, gays and
straights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely wasn't drunk when he came in,'' recalled the
bartender, Matt Galloway. ``He wasn't drunk when he went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Rerucha, the county attorney, charged in court documents
today that McKinney and Henderson posed as homosexuals and lured
Shepard out to McKinney's pickup truck just after midnight early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beating him inside the truck, the pair drove him one mile
southeast to an isolated part of a new rural subdivision, the
County Attorney's report charged. There, it said, the men tied
their captive to a post-and-rail fence and pistol-whipped him with
a .357 magnum ``while he begged for his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives said that Shepard also suffered burns on his body.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly beating the young man to death, Laramie Police
Commander David O'Malley said, the assailants stole his wallet and
shoes and left him tied to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   The police commander said that when his officers arrested the
two men on Thursday, they found in McKinney's pickup truck a .357
magnum pistol covered with blood and Shepard's shoes and credit
card. He said they found Shepard's wallet at McKinney's home.
</P>
<P>
   The police commander said that the two women helped the two men
dump their bloody clothing, and that they reported hearing the men
make anti-gay remarks. Ms. Pasley, a freshman art student at the
university, lived with Henderson. Ms. Price lived with McKinney.
The police did not say what the other three did for a living.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, friends and Laramie residents struggled to understand
the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard, some said, may have felt a false sense of confidence
because the local Gay Association completed plans on Tuesday night
for ``Gay Awareness Week 1998.'' The weeklong series of events
starts here Sunday with a local observance of ``National Coming Out
Day'' and a lecture on Monday by Leslea Newman, the author of
``Heather Has Two Mommies,'' a book about lesbian families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a homosexual in Laramie, I would hang low, very
low,'' said Carla Brown, manager of the Fireside. ``Openly gay
behavior is not only discouraged, it's dangerous.''

STARR FAULTS CLINTON AIDES ON CHARGE TO HIGH COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-IMPEACH)  
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The war of words between the Whitewater independent
counsel and the White House escalated again Friday when Kenneth
Starr accused one of President Clinton's lawyers of deceiving the
Supreme Court and wrongly accusing prosecutors of misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton filed a brief in the Supreme Court implying
that Starr misled a federal appeals court in June. The brief noted
that Starr had argued that impeachment was too remote an issue for
the judges to consider in deciding whether Bruce Lindsey, a deputy
White House counsel, could refuse to answer certain questions
because they were protected by the lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Three days after making that argument, Starr secretly filed a
motion with a different court asking for permission to make an
impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Starr issued a statement Friday evening that
declared that Neil Eggleston, Clinton's top lawyer on privilege
issues, ``has deceived the Supreme Court and the public by falsely
accusing this office of misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Eggleston is misrepresenting the facts,'' Starr said. ``In
the oral argument, the independent counsel said that because no
Articles of Impeachment were pending, it was `premature' for the
court to decide whether attorney-client privilege applies to
government attorneys in impeachment proceedings in the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also said he had noted in his argument to the appeals
court that the independent counsel's office had an obligation by
law to report evidence of impeachable offenses to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston replied Friday night that Starr's statement had failed
to address the issues raised in the White House's brief, namely
that Starr's office was busily preparing an impeachment referral
while telling the court that consideration of possible impeachment
was ``premature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Starr plainly conveyed to the Court of Appeals that the
White House's argument that the independent counsel was improperly
acting as a stalking horse for Congress in the impeachment process
was too remote and speculative for the court to consider,''
Eggleston said. ``In fact, only three days after that argument, he
informed the special division of his intent to submit a report to
Congress recommending the impeachment of the president.''

CARDINAL HEALTH TO ACQUIRE ALLEGIANCE HOSPITAL SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skirting antitrust concerns that derailed its attempt to acquire
a competing drug wholesaler in July, Cardinal Health Inc. announced
Friday that it would buy Allegiance Corp., a hospital supply
company, for $4.5 billion in stock and assume $890 million of its
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Allegiance makes surgical instruments, rubber gloves and other
operating room supplies. Cardinal already gets half of its $16.5
billion in annual revenues from hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Walter, chairman of Cardinal, which is based in Dublin,
Ohio, said the acquisition would generate $50 million from added
revenues and cost savings within two years. Joseph Damico,
president of Allegiance, said the payoff would come through sales
growth, not by shrinking their combined 2,500-member sales force.
</P>
<P>
   He said Allegiance's account managers would promote Cardinal
products, but Cardinal representatives would still make their own
sales. Allegiance is an offspring of American Hospital Supply Co.,
which Baxter Healthcare Corp. acquired in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific merger,'' said Ronald Nordmann, a partner at
Deerfield Management, a New York-based health care money management
firm. ``It makes Cardinal a one-stop shop.''
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of drug wholesalers like Cardinal and McKesson
Corp. rise and fall with the pharmaceutical industry, and ``the
drug companies are in the best shape they have ever been in,'' said
Leonard Yaffe, a health care analyst in San Francisco with
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, for their part, are under cost-cutting pressures from
managed care and government payers. But Damico said that demand for
medical-surgical products was rising with the aging of the
population. Allegiance sales were $4.4 billion in the year ending
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: Both companies have little exposure to overseas
economic or currency problems, Nordmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, each share of Allegiance stock would be
exchanged for .415 share of Cardinal stock. Based on Thursday's
closing price of Cardinal on the New York Stock Exchange, the
transaction was valued at $38.47 a share, a 67 percent premium on
the Allegiance share price.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Cardinal dropped $8.8125, or 9.5 percent, to $83.875,
and Allegiance gained $9.4375, or 22.5 percent, to close at
$32.4375, also on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said it was a rich price for Allegiance, which is
in a commodity business with annual sales growth of only 2 percent
to 4 percent. They said the company received a significant portion
of its $107 million in net income last year from a slide in the
value of the Malaysian ringgit currency. Allegiance makes medical
gloves in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a rebound for Cardinal, which dropped its $2.4
billion bid for Bergen Brunswig Corp., also a big drug wholesaler,
after a federal judge ruled in July that the deal raised antitrust
problems. McKesson's attempt to buy AmeriSource Health Corp. also
foundered on Federal Trade Commission objections.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal then bought R.P. Scherer Corp., which makes gelatin
drug capsules and other drug delivery products, for $2.2 billion in
stock and assumed debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became clear when the FTC blocked the mergers of the
pharmacy distributors that the second-best option would be to buy a
hospital supplier,'' said Vivian Wohl, a senior research analyst at
Merrill Lynch. She said McKesson, which bought General Medical
Inc., a hospital supplier, last year, recently jolted competitors
by winning the drug and supplies business of the big Columbia/HCA
Healthcare hospital chain.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse First Boston advised Allegiance on the deal.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Salomon Smith Barney unit of
Citigroup Inc. advised Cardinal.

CONGRESS WORKS ON TAX-CUT PLAN THAT MAY WIN BIPARTISAN SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the Republican plan for a big tax cut having
died without coming to a vote in the Senate, Congress scrambled
Friday to put together a far smaller tax package that could win
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   After giving up hope that the Senate would act on an $80
billion, five-year Republican tax cut plan passed last month by the
House, the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday hurriedly
considered and then passed, on a unanimous voice vote, a narrow
bill to address some of the tax issues that both parties consider
most pressing.
</P>
<P>
   The package would extend a series of expiring tax credits,
accelerate an existing plan to allow self-employed people to deduct
100 percent of their health-insurance premiums and provide a break
to farmers who are hard hit by a downturn in agricultural prices.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee's chairman, said he
hoped that the bill would sail through the House, be adopted by the
Senate and be signed into law by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's plan, which could be voted on by the full House
as soon as Saturday, would cost $5.1 billion over five years and
$9.2 billion over 10 years. Unlike the original House plan, which
called for the $80 billion tax cut to be paid for out of projected
budget surpluses, the package approved Friday would be paid for by
raising other taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Archer's plan quickly hit a roadblock when the Senate
Finance Committee decided to draft its own legislation, which
differs in several small but important respects from the House
version. With Congress racing to deal with a long list of issues
before adjourning next week for the midterm elections, the
measure's fate in the Senate remained uncertain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The end-of-session wrangling over small-bore and largely
technical tax issues was a long way from what Republicans had hoped
for throughout much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by projections that the federal budget surplus would
rise substantially in the coming years, they debated cutting taxes
by hundreds of billions of dollars before scaling back their
aspirations in the face of strong opposition from the president,
congressional Democrats and some moderates within their own party.
</P>
<P>
   Even the $80 billion five-year plan passed by the House, though,
ran afoul of Clinton's demand that Congress set aside any budget
surpluses until the nation settles on a plan to deal with the
Social Security system's looming financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, in particular, feared that supporting any
tax cut that relied on the budget surplus would lead Democrats to
accuse them of endangering Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans never formally declared the $80 billion
package dead, with Majority Leader Trent Lott hinting all week that
he might still schedule a vote. But most Republicans have
acknowledged for some time that the bill would never pass the
Senate, largely because the parliamentary rules under which the
legislation would be considered would require 60 votes for it to
succeed. Republicans hold 55 seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed by the Ways and Means Committee would extend,
to the end of next year, a research and development tax credit
strongly favored by business executives. The Senate Finance
Committee's version would extend the credit only until the middle
of next year, but would also extend a number of other credits not
addressed by the House bill.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate versions would pay for the tax
reductions they include largely by closing a loophole used by real
estate investment trusts.

EDITORIAL: VAN EYCK AND BRUEGEL AT THE MET 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   In the blue distance life goes on as usual, though the
foreground swells with scenes of excruciating woe and mild
acceptance. The postures are stylized, but the faces are uniquely
individual. The weight of the sacred world is balanced, sometimes
toppled, by the weight of the secular world, by the sight of
gardens and city markets, peasants and hunters, seen through the
windows of a room where an angel interrupts a handmaiden sitting in
a plain but exquisitely detailed interior.
</P>
<P>
   These images come from the Metropolitan Museum's remarkable
exhibition of early Netherlandish painting, ``From Van Eyck to
Bruegel,'' on view through Jan. 3. The exhibition spans the period
from 1430 to 1565, beginning with Jan van Eyck's paired paintings
of ``the Crucifixion'' and ``the Last Judgment'' and ending with
Pieter Bruegel the Elder's wholly secular work called ``The
Harvesters,'' two extremes within the continuum of 15th- and
16th-century Netherlandish painting.
</P>
<P>
   The surface of the earth, in Van Eyck's ``Last Judgment,'' has
been cracked open like an egg, giving way to a scene of torment
among the damned. The chaos is echoed by the crowd that gathers, in
the companion painting, at the scene of the Crucifixion. The view
is deep _ the moon rises behind mountains that seem miles beyond
the focal hilltop _ but the foreground has been tipped forward and
down, giving the viewer an intoxicating visual command. We look
beyond the natural horizon, out upon a world in which past and
present mingle, united by the clarity of Van Eyck's eye.
</P>
<P>
   In Bruegel's ``The Harvesters'' there is the same heightened
command of naturalistic detail, the same ability to capture the
roundness with which the world and its objects appear to us. Yet in
Bruegel the earth has none of the fragility it has in Van Eyck's
``Last Judgment.'' It is not a shell concealing the torment of lost
souls. The earth beneath Bruegel's fields of wheat, beneath the
eating and sleeping workers, has a truly planetary mass. The scene
spills outward to an economic landscape where, for the moment,
thoughts of another world have been set aside in the heat of the
day and in the haste of harvest, a landscape still contiguous, no
matter what has changed, with our own.

 EDITORIAL: MEDICARE HMOs  
 (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial on Saturday, Oct.
10: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The move by several big health maintenance organizations to end
their Medicare coverage in counties where they are losing money
should come as no surprise. In their headlong rush to capture part
of the huge Medicare market of 38 million Americans, many HMOs have
made inaccurate financial projections and now realize they cannot
provide comprehensive care at the cost they expected. Some 400,000
Medicare beneficiaries whose insurers are therefore cutting them
loose will now have to find another HMO or go into the traditional
fee-for-service Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care has now become a fact of life for more than 80
percent of Americans covered by private insurance. But it is still
quite new in the government-funded Medicare world where only 17
percent of beneficiaries are enrolled in HMOs and the rest are
still in fee-for-service Medicare. Industry shake-outs will
probably continue as more of the Medicare population moves into
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing theory among government policy makers is that
encouraging Medicare patients to enroll in managed-care plans will
save money in the long run. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act greatly
expanded the kinds of plans that could seek to enroll Medicare
beneficiaries in hopes that competition among private insurers
would attract more people into managed care.
</P>
<P>
   That shift is happening rapidly. Virtually all the HMOs offer
prescription drug benefits that traditional Medicare does not
cover. Most also charge enrollees much lower deductibles and
co-insurance costs than traditional Medicare does. These features
have been effective in drawing in the elderly, but they are also
expensive. Federal payments to HMOs do not take into account these
new benefits. Instead, the plans are paid a per-enrollee rate that
differs from county to county, based on past Medicare spending in
each geographic area. In counties where payment rates are high,
HMOs have made hefty profits. Where rates are lower, HMOs have a
harder time.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Oxford Health Plans, United Healthcare Corp. and
Aetna U.S. Healthcare, among others, to pull out of some less
profitable counties reflects that business reality. Yet in the vast
majority of counties where some plans are leaving, other HMOs are
staying and still others are seeking entrance. Only about 10
percent of the Medicare beneficiaries dropped by an HMO will be
left with no managed-care option, an indication that payment rates
in most counties are sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has urged expedited handling of applications
by health plans to enter counties without HMO options. Federal law
already gives people dropped from a Medicare HMO the right to buy
private insurance to fill gaps in traditional Medicare without
regard to their health condition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also directing the Department of Health and Human
Services to come up with legislation to prevent this kind of
insurance turmoil in the future. That will be difficult. Medicare
enrollees want added benefits like drug coverage, but some health
plans say they cannot offer those benefits without higher payments
from the government or the enrollees themselves. For the time
being, there is apparently enough slack in the system to pay for
the added benefits without substantially raising government
payments. The question is how long that slack will last, even under
managed care.

   The New York Times will say in an editorial on Saturday, Oct.
10: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of people abusing the bankruptcy law to stiff their
creditors is probably not very large, but the fact that there are
some who do it brings the law into disrepute. Just this week, the
actor Burt Reynolds had his bankruptcy plan approved. Creditors
will lose millions, but Reynolds will remain a millionaire, as did
Bowie Kuhn, the former baseball commissioner, some years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This page has been sympathetic to changing the law to prevent
such abuses. But the bill pushed by Republicans and passed by the
House is a parody of reform. It cracks down on credit card debtors
with inflexible new rules that could force many to keep paying the
card companies even if they cannot afford to do so. But it does
next to nothing about the loophole used by Messrs. Kuhn and
Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   The method they used was to own an expensive house in Florida, a
state that lets a bankrupt person keep a home _ no matter how
palatial the house or how vast the acreage. The Senate bill would
have made it impossible for states to let a bankrupt person keep
more than $100,000 equity in a home.
</P>
<P>
   The House, however, wanted no such restrictions, in part because
of lobbying by Republicans from Florida and Texas, which also has a
generous bankruptcy law. The conference committee _ in a decision
that was made by Republicans without any involvement by Democratic
members of the committee _ threw out the Senate provision and
instead simply said that states could let a bankrupt person retain
any house owned for at least two years prior to filing.
</P>
<P>
   A fair bill would attack the real abuses, while giving judges
flexibility to consider the circumstances of debtors. This bill
does neither. If it reaches his desk, President Clinton should veto
it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 10: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just days before heading to the United States for critical
negotiations with Palestinian leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu jolted the Middle East peace effort with the appointment
of Ariel Sharon as Israeli foreign minister. The most optimistic
reading is that Sharon, long an implacable foe of the Palestinians,
is prepared to make peace with them and then sell it to the
Israelis who are most opposed. Unfortunately, he is also capable of
wrecking the entire peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on whether Netanyahu can control his
strong-willed aide, a goal that has eluded other Israeli leaders.
Like a political typhoon, Sharon has roared across Israeli life for
better than three decades as a brilliant military commander, a
reckless defense minister and an ardent conservative, often leaving
destruction in his wake. He still bears the burden of his role in
the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Christian militiamen in
Lebanon in 1982. An Israeli inquiry found he was indirectly
responsible for the killings at the Sabra and Shatila refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   As a leader of the most conservative wing of the Likud party,
Sharon can help Netanyahu hold together his shaky Cabinet during
potentially decisive negotiations with Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader. That will be fine if Sharon is willing to play
a constructive role in the peace talks himself. But such behavior
is not likely to be the first impulse of a man who has famously
said he would never shake hands with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Since Netanyahu has designated Sharon as his chief negotiator,
the new foreign minister will soon have the opportunity to act more
responsibly. The first order of business when the two sides get
together next week outside Washington is to wrap up negotiations
over the further withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank
coupled with security guarantees from the Palestinians. Sharon can
show statesmanship by helping Netanyahu close this deal, even
though it is opposed by the Israeli settlers whose cause Sharon has
long championed.
</P>
<P>
   Success in these talks would clear the way for the last and most
difficult negotiations about a permanent settlement, including the
shape and status of a Palestinian state and the future of
Jerusalem. If Sharon ever hopes to overcome the shame of Sabra and
Shatila, he must become a force for peace in the Middle East.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Legislation to give patients more power in dealing
with health insurance companies died Friday, a casualty of heavy
lobbying by the insurance industry and of the sex scandal that has
enveloped President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters and opponents said similar legislation would be back
in 1999. But this year's struggle shows once again how difficult it
is to pass health care legislation affecting doctors, patients,
lawyers, insurers and employers of all sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Since the demise of Clinton's plan for universal health
insurance in 1994, he and his allies in Congress have tried to
achieve the same goal step by step. But even these proposals have
set off fierce fights about the proper role of government in
regulating one of the nation's biggest industries.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 50-47, the Senate Friday rejected a Democratic move
to take up a bill to define patients' rights and to regulate health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as Congress rushed to adjourn, cobbling a stopgap
plan to finance government operations in the fiscal year that began
on Oct. 1 and taking up a raft of other issues. Senior lawmakers
postponed the deadline for the stopgap plan from midnight Friday
until midnight Monday, saying they would work through the weekend
and negotiate with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill defining patients' rights was needed to
protect millions of Americans who have had problems with HMOs. They
asserted that conservative Republican senators like Trent Lott of
Mississippi and Don Nickles of Oklahoma never really wanted a bill,
and worked with insurers to sidetrack legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, who introduced their own bill to define
patients' rights in July, said Friday that Democrats had passed up
many opportunities for compromise because the Democrats wanted an
election issue more than they wanted a new law. Democratic
candidates are, in fact, campaigning on the issue. But some
Republican candidates are also promising to pass legislation
helping HMO patients.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said, ``Big money and powerful
special interests kept us from debating this issue in the United
States Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader, said, ``Passage
of real patient protections should have been the highest priority
of this session of Congress,'' but Republicans ``thwarted us at
every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Republican bill was narrower in scope than the
Democratic bill. The Democrats said their legislation would have
covered three times as many people as the Republican measure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Nickles, the assistant majority leader, said,
``The Democrats trashed our proposal and never tried to work with
us to come up with common elements that could become law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, the Senate majority leader, acknowledged that HMO patients
had ``some legitimate concerns and problems,'' and he added, ``I do
believe that we are going to address this next year.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed a bill to define patients' rights and regulate
HMOs in July. But in the Senate, Democrats and Republicans had such
profound disagreements that they could not even get such
legislation to the floor for debate.
</P>
<P>
   The measures considered this year, known as the Patient
Protection Act and the Patients' Bill of Rights Act, would have
guaranteed access to emergency care and medical specialists and
would have permitted patients to appeal the denial of care to an
independent panel of medical experts. The Democratic bills would
also have made it easier for patients to sue HMOs and recover
damages for the improper denial of care.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress sets uniform national standards for health
insurance, that would be a major departure from the practice of the
last half-century. Such insurance is regulated mainly by the
states. Standards vary widely, and federal law severely limits the
states' ability to regulate employee health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, the outlines of a potential compromise were
discernible in May. But Democrats were reluctant to compromise.
After months of haggling over procedural questions, Senate
Republicans eventually concluded that they did not have to deal
with the issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer pleas for congressional action were ultimately drowned
out in the debate over the possible impeachment of Clinton, and he
had no political leverage to force Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of HMOs, insurance companies and employers _ the
Health Benefits Coalition _ vehemently opposed new federal mandates
on health plans, saying such requirements would increase costs and
reduce the number of people with coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition began its lobbying and advertising campaign on
Jan. 21, the day of the first news reports about the president's
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton gave many speeches about HMO
legislation, but his fight for the legislation suffered as he
devoted more and more of his energy to fighting for the survival of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's summer recess, from July 31 to Aug. 31, was a
turning point. ``August was not about health care,'' said Suzanne
DeFrancis, vice president of Porter Novelli, an advertising and
public relations company that worked with the Health Benefits
Coalition. ``August was about Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted his affair with Ms. Lewinsky in a televised
speech on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who led the fight for a bill to give patients more
power in dealing with health insurers, said, ``To the extent that
the public was focused on the whole White House problem, it may
have emboldened the Republicans to shut us out of debate on HMO
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Danner, chairman of the Health Benefits Coalition, who is
also vice president of the National Federation of Independent
Business, said the coalition had spent ``a little over $2 million''
on lobbying and advertising against HMO bills. In addition, he
said, ``our member organizations have probably spent another $1
million on advertising, and that does not include the cost of staff
work and time spent on fax, phone calls, direct mail and tens of
thousands of action alerts.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Danner said the money was well spent. ``It's a good investment
for the next Congress,'' he said. ``This issue will definitely be
back, for two reasons. The number of uninsured people continues to
go up. And after several years of relatively flat premiums, we now
expect more significant increases in the cost of health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are expected to pick up seats in the House and the
Senate next month, so there may be more hostility to government
regulation in the next Congress. On the other hand, the whole issue
of regulating HMOs may be swept up in presidential politics if one
or more candidates stress the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Business Roundtable,
which represents 200 large companies, said the group had spent $1
million on its own radio and newspaper advertisements against HMO
legislation. The coalition and the Business Roundtable ran
advertising in 23 states, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Two House Republicans, Charlie Norwood of Georgia and Greg
Ganske of Iowa, continually prodded their party leaders to pass a
bill defining patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview this week, Norwood said: ``I am very
disappointed that the Senate has not moved a bill. Senators did not
act because they didn't have to. Their mind is on Clinton's
problems. You can't carry on a conversation up here for more than
one minute before impeachment comes up. The Senate put off the
health care issue, but it's not going away. I will butt my head
against this wall until we get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Rickard, senior vice president of Ryder System Inc., the
transportation service company, who coordinated the lobbying for
the Business Roundtable, said: ``This year started out with
tremendous momentum for a patients' bill of rights. There is a
strong probability that legislation would have passed in the
absence of our efforts to educate Congress and the public about the
costs of such mandates.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Taylor, chief lobbyist at the AFL-CIO, said: ``Senate
Republicans got away with an amazing tactic. They pulled
legislation from the floor whenever it appeared that Democrats
would offer patient protections as an amendment, and the
Republicans were afraid to bring up their own sham bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidates say frustration with HMOs still seems
to be running high outside Washington. A survey by the National
Journal found that campaign advertisements mentioning health
insurance far outnumbered those referring to the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put patients and doctors back in charge of medical
decisions, not managed care bureaucrats,'' Gail Riecken, the
Democratic candidate in Indiana's 8th Congressional District, says
in one commercial. In another, Shelley Berkley of Las Vegas tells
voters, ``I believe all of us should have the right to choose our
own doctor, see a specialist when we need one and know that medical
decisions are being made by doctors and patients, not accountants
and clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., who is running for re-election,
promises legislation to ``hold HMOs 100 percent accountable for
improper care.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said: ``Health care is not a Democrat
issue any more. We are not afraid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that some Republican candidates for the House, like
Ernest Fletcher in Kentucky, were promising to fight for HMO
legislation.

GREEN HAS EARLY WHITE CHRISTMAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ Josh Green jetted into a winter wonderland
Friday afternoon, Christmas Eve having arrived early in terms of
climate and circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   The weather outside was frightful, but for the Los Angeles
Kings' rookie right wing, the situation was delightful. A couple of
inches of snow sprinkled down on Edmonton, rolling out a white
carpet for the 20-year-old Green's NHL debut tonight in the Kings'
regular-season opener against the Oilers, the team he rooted for
growing up in Camrose, Alberta, about an hour away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember times that I sat up there and thought about
maybe being on that ice,'' Green said, referring to what once was
called the Northlands Coliseum and today is known as the Skyreach
Centre. ``Now that it's going to happen, it's really exciting for
me and my family. It's natural for a person to feel nervous, so I
just want to get that first shift under my belt, and hopefully it
gets easier from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his excitement came from the simple pursuit of about 30
tickets for friends and family. Players are allotted two; the
Kings' media-relations staff scrounged up the rest. All of this had
Kings coach Larry Robinson reminiscing about his own debut, more
than a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``January 8, 1973,'' said Robinson, a Hall of Famer, instantly
reciting when asked to recall the game _ the Canadiens against the
Minnesota North Stars at the old Montreal Forum. ``I was scared,
nervous, a little bit of both. Anxious. The first shift, I ran
somebody, I don't remember who it was. I sent him flying in the
corner and it got me going.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's a lot different for the kids now. They know a
little more what to expect. The fact that (Green) has played in a
number of exhibition games and this is not his first training camp
gives him a bit of an advantage, and the fact that he played last
year in the American Hockey League better prepares him for the
start of the year here.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, a second-round choice in the NHL draft two years ago,
scored 51 goals for two teams in the AHL last season. At 6-foot-4,
212 pounds, Green's job is to play physically, go into the corners,
stand in front of the net to screen opposing goalies and deflect
shots from the point.
</P>
<P>
   He did all those things during the exhibition season, collecting
three goals and four points in six games and beating out
19-year-old Olli Jokinen for a spot on the roster. He will begin
tonight's game on a line with Luc Robitaille and Yanic Perreault.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is try to go out there and keep it simple and try
to give the puck to Luc and Yanic as much as I can and try to go to
the net and use my size,'' Green said. ``I think things will work
out. Playing with those two guys, good things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged it might not be so simple, at least at the
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably will be running around with my head cut off,''
Green admitted. ``But I think once I get that first shift, I'll
feel a little more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, admiring the poise that belies Green's age, said he
isn't too concerned with jitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's the nervous type,'' Robinson said. ``He's
kind of quiet out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's playing so near to home that might lift his debut from
merely memorable to monumental for Green. His parents, Svend (``my
first coach'') and Carol, will be in the stands, and it will be
Green's first game at any level in the building so many of his
boyhood heroes once called home.
</P>
<P>
   Green said he and some childhood teammates did win a trip years
ago that earned them the chance to skate on the ice with such
Oilers icons as Mark Messier and Glenn Anderson. Tonight, however,
is a completely different occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it can be a distraction,'' Robinson said.
``Sometimes it can help, too. A lot of times, when you play in
front of your family it gives you a little bit of an emotional
lift, too. It gets your adrenaline going. Everybody reacts
differently to those situations. Some, it helps them, and some,
they try to do too much and make a lot of mistakes. But he's a
pretty focused kid. I don't think he should have too much of a
problem.''

A VILLAGE TILTS AT THE MEGAMALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ This wealthy village has long fancied its
main thoroughfare, Franklin Avenue, as the Fifth Avenue of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Long Island's first department store, Loeser's, opened here in
the 1930s. Seeking the lucrative local carriage trade, other
high-end retailers from Manhattan soon followed, like Best &AMP; Co.
and Peck &AMP; Peck. They sold luxury clothes, jewelry, furs and
crystal. Bridal shops abounded. In fact, Garden City owes its very
existence to the man who invented the department store.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Avenue later became home to branches of New York City's
toniest stores: Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Lord &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   As the rest of the island grew over the years, however, Franklin
Avenue peaked and gradually lost its luster.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Abraham &AMP; Straus, at the old Loeser's site,
shuttered its doors. Its building has stood vacant ever since. Soon
after, Bloomingdale's abandoned Franklin Avenue to embrace the
marble floors and synchronized fountains of the Roosevelt Field
shopping mall two miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Now Saks is taking its Fifth Avenue name to the great indoors.
Saks is preparing to leave Franklin Avenue for a new home at the
mall in the spring of 2000. On Friday, officials at the company's
headquarters in Birmingham, Ala., confirmed the plans, contingent
on a zoning approval from the town of Hempstead for the new site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is the kick in the pants the village needs'' to
forge ahead with the revitalizing of Franklin Avenue, said Bertram
Donley, who has been working on that goal as executive vice
president of the local Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Past efforts have not been a smashing success. The old
Bloomingdale's building was taken over by Sears, which hardly has
the same panache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who from Garden City is going to shop at Sears _ the
gardeners?'' said an office worker who did not give her name. Sears
draws sparse crowds and presents a less-than-elite image with a
hot-dog vendor cart at the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the former home of Martin's clothing store,
another Franklin Avenue storefront's name emblazoned on the windows
screams scaled-down: Pay/Half.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Avenue's problems stem from modern suburban retailing
trends that can be summed up in two words: Roosevelt Field. That
shopping mall, one of the biggest in the nation, is just two miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Since Roosevelt Field opened in 1956, the mall has grown from
its original cluster of outdoor stores to an enclosed three-level
complex with spacious atriums, food courts and valet parking.
</P>
<P>
   The mall has drained shoppers from the downtowns of nearby
villages. The ever-expanding mall now draws 10 million visitors a
year to its 250 stores, anchored by Macy's, J.C. Penney, Stern's,
Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom, with 2.4 million square feet of floor
space and parking for 11,000 cars. Sales per square foot there rank
third in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt Field's success has many other strip malls and stores
positioning themselves cheek-by-jowl to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   There is historical irony in Garden City's troubles in keeping
top-line stores. The founding father of this village in Nassau
County, one of the nation's first planned communities, was the
legendary retailer Alexander Stewart. He created the village in
1869 by buying 7,000 acres of open land. Under his concept, the
street grid was laid out and strict residential and commercial
zoning controls were imposed to keep the village attractive and
open. Stately colonial-style homes now line his namesake street,
Stewart Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart became the richest man in New York City by inventing the
department store concept. His Marble Place, replete with a domed
atrium and mahogany cabinets, opened at 280 Broadway near City Hall
in 1846. Henry James and Anthony Trollope sang its praises.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's foresighted successors in Garden City devised ample
off-street parking in the 1920s, which helped the village survive
for decades, Donley said. Other communities, failing to anticipate
the importance of the automobile, were unprepared for the onslaught
of malls ringed by large parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Avenue thrived. Russell Matthews, a developer on a
retail project here, said that Franklin Avenue was always ``known
for the finest stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Garden City's merchants and village officials would like to see
those glory days return. In fact, far from being beaten, they have
plans to turn Franklin Avenue into the Rodeo Drive of the East.
</P>
<P>
   As a contrast to the malls and department stores, the merchants
and officials want to create a main street ambiance with smaller
high-end specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of Franklin's buildings are entered from the
parking lots in the rear, planners say, the sidewalks in front
appear empty and uninviting from the street. So the plan calls for
slowing down traffic by adding curb-side parking and sprucing up
the front. The merchants also plan to create a business improvement
district.
</P>
<P>
   The first concrete sign of progress is the recent purchase of
the A. &AMP; S. store and adjoining sites and their renovation, now
under way, by Renaissance Development, a partnership of Albanese
Development and Castagna Realty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're redirecting our retail to the customers who find big
malls sterile, impersonal and overwhelming,'' said Matthews,
executive vice president of Albanese. The site will have a movie
theater, restaurants, Platypus (which sells home furnishings and
accessories) and the Imaginarium (which sells educational toys).
</P>
<P>
   Merchants and village officials are also counting on Franklin
Avenue's still strong commercial presence. The street is lined with
many major brokerage houses, banks, large office buildings and
corporate headquarters, including the Dale Carnegie Institute and
the Automobile Club of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that unlike the last decade of moving to malls and
discount shopping, there is a return to main street,'' said the
mayor of Garden City, Frank Tauches Jr. ``There is a commitment by
the developers, shop owners and the village for a renaissance of
Franklin Avenue.''

 &HT;    Tech task: Figuring out the Wolfpack
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thanks to wins over Florida State and Syracuse, North
Carolina State is ranked No. 23 but still sort of hard to figure.
Georgia Tech will try today at 3:30 at Carter-Finley Stadium, site
of those two huge Wolfpack wins.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State (3-1, 1-0) reinforced how good it can be with the win
over Syracuse, but outside of those two games the Wolfpack barely
showed up in a narrow win over Ohio and a loss to Baylor. Does the
apparent importance of the next game dictate which way N.C. State
will play? If that's the case, how does the Wolfpack feel about
Georgia Tech?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, this is the biggest game of the season (in terms of)
where we are and what we need to do,'' said N.C. State coach Mike
O'Cain, and that's what he told his team. ``We've got to take care
of business. That's not to say it's a game we should win. They're
as talented as we are. (But) we're at home. It's a game we need to
win. . . . We'll have other big games, but this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Baylor loss, O'Cain is figuring it got N.C. State to
this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure we'd have beaten Syracuse if we had beat
Baylor,'' O'Cain said. ``Any time you fall short of your
expectations, it slaps you in the face and brings you back to
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech (3-1, 2-0 ACC) got the same refocusing from its
season-opening loss to Boston College. Since then the Yellow
Jackets have been on a three-win roll. But this is Tech's first
true test of the season and the start of a very interesting stretch
of games. After N.C. State, there's Top 10 teams Virginia and
Florida State back-to-back.
</P>
<P>
   With a recent history of starting strong and stumbling, the
Yellow Jackets are eager to buck that trend and have homecoming
against Virginia with an undefeated ACC record and possibly a Top
25 ranking. They're trying to do it by concentrating only on the
Wolfpack, which is hard to do with a steady stream of Tech students
dropping by the Tech athletic association to pick up tickets for
Virginia and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``(If you look ahead) you start getting confident, cocky,'' Tech
receiver Mike Sheridan said. ``We're trying not to do that. We're
concentrating on the next game and doing what got us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither N.C. State nor Tech win with dominating defenses, so a
high-scoring game would not be a surprise. This will be a showdown
between two of the top offensive teams in the ACC and the top two
quarterbacks in N.C. State's Jamie Barnette and Tech's Joe
Hamilton. Then there's Wolfpack receiver Torry Holt, who has the
ability to dominate a game on offense and on special teams as a
return man.
</P>
<P>
   Tech has won three in a row against N.C. State, but not when so
much was expected of the Wolfpack and never with this much at stake
for both teams. The winner will be tied with Virginia (5-0, 3-0)
atop the ACC standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had their number,'' Hamilton said. ``I think they'll be
ready for us.

 &HT;    Other Hernandez gets chance to star
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ His brother dominated the postseason headlines last
year. Now it's Orlando Hernandez's chance to turn heads.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander gets his first start of October tonight against
the Indians. The Yankees need a big start from the Cuban, who
hasn't pitched in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, our guy makes as good an impact as Livan did,''
Yanks manager Joe Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Florida's Livan Hernandez who won the MVP in both the
league championship and World Series. Orlando faces Doc Gooden
today, and it just so happens the rookie has an affinity for the
Indians' veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Dwight Gooden because I was able to see him
pitch,'' said Hernandez through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Hernandez was fabulous in the regular season,
going 12-4 with a 3.13 ERA. He hasn't spoken to his brother
recently, but said, ``As everyone knows, I've played in big games
before in Cuba. Obviously, I haven't played in a game of this
magnitude in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Will the layoff effect Hernandez? ``No. Two weeks off are not a
justification for me having a bad game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lineup change
</P>
<P>
   Torre decided Friday night to bench Tim Raines and replace him
at DH with Chili Davis. Raines has been struggling, going 1-for-6
in the first two games with four strikeouts. Davis, who missed most
of the regular season with an ankle injury, is 1-for-1 in a
pinch-hitting appearance and certainly gives the lineup more power.
. . . Torre held a team meeting before the game, saying, ``With
everything that's been going on for the last day and a half, I just
wanted to make sure we go out there and think about (Friday)
instead of trying to make up for something that happened the other
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribe update
</P>
<P>
   While the Braves couldn't even come close to selling out their
first two league championship games, tickets here have been gone
for weeks and scalpers were getting as much as $350 for box seats
outside Jacobs Field. ... The Indians also moved around their
lineup Friday, starting Mark Whiten in left and moving David
Justice into the designated hitters hole. White is a former Brave
and has played for six different teams since 1995. ... The last
time Gooden pitched, in the divisional series against the Red Sox,
he lasted just two outs before being thrown out. Does that concern
manager Mike Hargrove? ``Doc is a professional and has worked very
hard to keep himself ready for whatever we've asked him to do.''
Said Gooden, ``That's over with. We got to the next level, which we
wanted to do and hopefully this time I will be out there a lot
longer.'' ... The AL has fined Yankees owner GS an undisclosed
amount after he made undispariging remarks about the umpires
following the loss in Game 2.

 &HT;    San Diego catches the fever
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Bruce Bochy drove to work and ran upon a traffic
snarl on Friars Road. ``I thought it was for the football,'' said
the Padres manager, meaning the game San Diego State was to play at
Qualcomm Stadium eight hours later. ``But then I thought, `This
can't all be for the Aztecs.' '' What Bochy discovered was that the
cars were there to support another team _ his.
</P>
<P>
   This is considered a laissez-faire city, where living the good
life outweighs getting geeked up over some ballgame. Two victories
in Atlanta changed all that. A hundred fans gathered outside
Qualcomm to greet the team when it returned home Friday. The time:
2:30 a.m. PDT. ``Those,'' said reliever Donne Wall, ``are some
diehard fans.''
</P>
<P>
   KFMB, the Padres' flagship station, pre-empted its regular
morning programming to go with baseball talk as hosted by Randy
Jones, who won a Cy Young award, and Mark Grant, whose claim to
fame is that, while briefly a Brave, he demonstrated how to do the
Tomahawk Chop in a photo sequence in this very newspaper. One bit
of repartee went thusly:
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``My mother has this thing she does whenever the Padres
get into a tight spot. She goes to the bathroom and listens to the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant: ``The bathroom?''
</P>
<P>
   Caller: ``It's not like she uses the bathroom. She just sits
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant: ``If it's a long inning, don't her legs get tired?''
</P>
<P>
   KFMB, 760 on your AM dial, likewise figured in the congestion
that made some Padre players late for their optional workout. The
station was giving away 1,000 envelopes outside the ballpark.
Couple the freebie-seekers with those who'd come to the stadium
looking to buy what tickets remained for Games 3, 4 and 5, and by
noon the Qualcomm parking lot looked like the staging area for the
world's largest road rally, a line of cars snaking halfway to
Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting an hour,'' said Dominic Oliveira. At the
moment, his truck was at least another half-hour from the KFMB
trailer. ``But they're giving away 1,000 tickets to the Padres
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said the radio station's Glenn Erath: ``He's wrong, but we're
glad he's here.'' In each of the 1,000 envelopes was some sort of
prize, but only four contained actual tickets to this NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres drew 2.5 million this season, the most in franchise
history but only seventh-best in a 14-team league. But, as Erath
said, ``It's a very good fair-weather town.'' Even in balmy San
Diego, the weather never gets better than when the home team is two
wins from the World Series. Said Bochy: ``People are excited.
They're talking baseball. That's great to see. There have been a
lot of lean years here.''
</P>
<P>
   So consuming is this outbreak of Friar Fever that the San Diego
Union-Tribune took a headlined jab Friday: ``Time to stick a
tomahawk in blase Atlanta?'' Seeking to head off any squabbling,
Bochy himself rose to the defense: ``On behalf of Atlanta, they're
here every year. It's an annual thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres haven't graced an NLCS since 1984, so this is new. It
is so new that the word mentioned most often on KFMB was ``sweep,''
even though the job is just half-done.

 &HT;    Braves not ready to give up season
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ As brave fronts go, this Braves front is fairly
credible, and certainly better than their collective backs, which
are now against the blue outfield wall of Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   These are dire straits for a group who, during two nightmarish
nights at the Ted, were hardly the sultans of swing. Yes, the
Braves have walked this high wire before. No, no team has ever won
the National League Championship Series after losing the first two
games at home. Yet Tom Glavine hardly sees another October
apocalypse in his immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're really looking beyond anything other than
we're down 2-0 in this series,'' Glavine said of the NLCS, which
resumes today at the Q when Greg Maddux meets San Diego's Sterling
Hitchcock in Game 3. ``I can't speak for everybody but I'm not
sitting here thinking, `Oh God, we're down 2-0, here goes another
postseason.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means is this series over. We're focusing on (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Focusing, and seeking inspiration from other postseason
predicaments. ``We've been on both sides of the coin,'' said
Glavine. ``We were down 3-1 and came back to win a series (the 1996
NLCS against the Cardinals, when the Braves won Game 5 in St.
Louis, then easily took 6 and 7 back home). Two short years ago, we
were up 2-0 and lost (the '96 World Series to the Yankees after
winning the first two games in the Bronx).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is certainly not the position we want to be in, but by no
means is this series over.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with three weekend pitching matchups that appear to favor
Atlanta: Maddux (18-9) against the left-hander Hitchcock (9-7);
then Denny Neagle (16-11) Sunday versus Joey Hamilton (13-13); and,
barring a Padres sweep, a Game 5 rematch of the John Smoltz-Andy
Ashby opener.
</P>
<P>
   That would return the series to Atlanta. That would also mean
the Braves would again confront Kevin Brown, whose three-hit, 3-0
shutout in Game 2 was his sixth straight win over Atlanta, third
straight in NLCS play.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do?,'' said the struggling shortstop
Walt Weiss. ``There's no secret. We've got to go out there and keep
competing until we run out of outs. We're definitely not doing
enough. What have we scored, two runs in two games? That's not
going to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had two outstanding pitching performances (Ashby gave
up just one run in eight innings in a 10-inning, 3-2 opening win
before Brown struck out 11 Thursday). When things are not going
right, individually you have to make adjustments and collectively
you see results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get some guys hitting,'' said second baseman
Keith Lockhart, ``and put something together.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially these guys: the Braves' 3-4-5-6 hitters. Chipper
Jones, Andres Galarraga, Ryan Klesko and Javy Lopez are in a
terrible, untimely funk. They're a combined 3-for-28 with eight
strikeouts, no homers and not a single RBI. This is in stark
contrast to the Padres, who surprised Houston in the Division
Series and have so far stunned Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they get guys in scoring position, they seem to turn it
up a notch,'' said Lockhart. ``They didn't get here by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's middle-of-the-order malaise is largely due to Brown
and Ashby, but also Weiss' struggles. After going 2-for-13 against
the Cubs in the NLDS sweep, Weiss is 0-for-8 in the NLCS and hasn't
reached base once. He struck out in his last two at-bats in an
0-for-5 Game 1, then took a called third in the first inning
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing anything right,'' said Weiss. ``My job is to get
on base and I haven't done it. The only thing to do is make
adjustments. I think I got away from my game plan a couple of
at-bats (Thursday). (On Wednesday), I had a called third.
(Thursday), my first at-bat (another K looking), I thought there
were some tough pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up getting out of my game plan, which I should never
do.''
</P>
<P>
   That game plan: ``Go deep in the count.'' Indeed, Weiss has
tapped out three times to first base, twice on the first pitch. In
Game 1, on an attempted suicide squeeze, he popped up the first
pitch into a rally-killing doubleplay.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has been magnified, and scrutinized. So have
Atlanta's mistakes afield: Galarraga's two errors on one play in
Game 1 that allowed the go-ahead run to score in the eighth inning;
Chipper Jones' mental mistake of holding the ball aloft, instead of
holding the tag on Ruben Rivera, who tagged up and slid into _ and
beyond _ third just before Galarraga's double gaffe; and not one
but two pickoff throws Lopez made to second in the ninth inning
Thursday. The second bounced into center and allowed Brown to
advance to third and later score the first of two cushioning runs
that inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what generally happens in the post-season,'' said
Glavine. ``There's one or two things that are huge in the outcome.
The ninth inning (Thursday), or even the sixth, a couple of
15-hoppers (singles through the infield) that Lock almost knocks
down. That's the post-season. You try to tell people that. A play
here, a play there. So far, that's how it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   And not gone unnoticed. ``In the post-season, everything is
broken down and analyzed,'' said Weiss. ``Just in a two-game span,
there's 10 million things to analyze and break down. In the regular
season, 90 per cent of that never gets noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the post-season, it not only gets noticed, but magnified
many-fold. ``In the post-season,'' said Weiss, ``it's almost like
four or five at-bats seem like 20, because they're analyzed so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   In the semi-final analysis, what's a Braves front to do? Don't
back down. ``You've got to win four games to end this series,''
said Weiss. ``They've still got to win two more games. I'm sure
they don't think it's going to be easy to beat us two more games.
We've got to win four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get some momentum,'' said Lockhart. ``With Doggie
pitching, we've got to get some hitters going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For us,'' said Klesko, ``the main goal is to beat up on 'em a
little bit, and get back to Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 6. In Atlanta.

 &HT;    Hitchcock's last start a turning point
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Greg Maddux remembers not only the game and the
batter but the exact pitch he threw when it all suddenly made
sense. Montreal. 1990. Delino DeShields. Fastball on the hands.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that he could not make it, Maddux put the ball just
where he wanted and induced a soft groundout, encouraging the young
pitcher so much that he contends he was a different player from
that moment.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Hitchcock may have made that same pitch this week. The
Atlanta Braves are hoping against it.
</P>
<P>
   In a series that has been all about pitching, Maddux faces
Hitchcock in tonight's Game 3 of the NLCS, trying to bail out a
postseason gone all wrong. Coming off the most consequential start
of his career, Hitchcock can deliver the San Diego Padres to the
World Series threshold. Unless Monday was some kind of fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure on me,'' Hitchcock said. ``I'm not
supposed to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock nailed down Game 4 of the League Division Series
against Houston Monday night, striking out 11 while allowing one
run on three hits before the Padres' bullpen took over in the
seventh. He has thrown a split-fingered fastball since high school,
but under the tutelage of Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart the
pitch has grown teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Astros, Hitchcock, 27, was demonic, flicking the
pitch out of the bottom of the strike zone as if on a bullwhip.
Against a free-swinging team like the Braves, the same pitch can
decide a game, if Hitchcock can duplicate it. That game may have
been a watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes out there against Randy Johnson and he knew he had to
pitch well,'' said San Diego manager Bruce Bochy. ``And he had
tremendous stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To get people out and give our team a chance to win is
basically all I can do,'' said Hitchcock. ``Get as deep in the game
as I can and keep us close.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux is expected to do more than that, and with the Braves'
offense dormant, he may have to. The Braves need one win to get off
the ropes and then another Sunday to fix the damage done in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's April or May, you're out there, you want to
win,'' said Maddux. ``I don't think anybody likes to be
embarrassed. We want to win. We don't feel like we have to win or
else. There's not that sense there. But I think for our own
satisfaction, for our fans, for our city, for our families, I think
those are the reasons we want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That, and bringing the NLCS back to Atlanta next week.

 &HT;    Free agent Brown hints he might not leave town
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Figuring to be one of the most coveted free agents
this off-season, Kevin Brown is hinting about a possible return to
San Diego. Money will be a major consideration, but after getting
burned by the breakup of the Florida Marlins, Brown also wants
assurances the team will remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   A possible snag to his return is the hiring in Colorado of Jim
Leyland, his former manager with the Marlins. The Rockies are
willing to up their $50 million payroll and Brown is among the
players they'll target this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious I've enjoyed this ballclub all year,''
Brown said of the Padres. ``It's been a great place for my family
and myself. All things being equal, yeah, I'd like to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question is whether Brown will come back on three
days rest and start Game 5 of the NLCS, if necessary. He did it in
Game 1 of the division series against Houston and struck out 16
Astros, returning four days later to start Game 3. If he were to
start Monday, there's the possibility he'd be available to work out
of the bullpen should the series go to a seventh game Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, probable Game 5 starter Andy Ashby had Atlanta
hitters off-balance in the NLCS opener and allowed but a run over
seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   It's not over yet
</P>
<P>
   Up 2-0 in the series and with a Qualcomm Stadium crowd of
65,000-plus expected this afternoon, the Padres aren't taking
anything for granted. Manager Bruce Bochy says his players are
``too intelligent'' to even think their tickets already have been
punched to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two games, you haven't done anything,'' Bochy said. ``It's
nice to win two games, but we still have to continue to play the
way we're playing right now. That's as good a club over there as
there is in the big leagues. Atlanta, you look at their defense and
offense. ... We can't relax.''
</P>
<P>
   With the warmer temperatures this afternoon in San Diego, Bochy
said there's a slight possibility left fielder Greg Vaughn
(strained quadriceps) could be back in the lineup. Bochy said
Vaughn has made a lot of progress since the injury in Game 1, and
he indicated a desire to play this afternoon, but Bochy is more
inclined to sit him another day.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner is ...
</P>
<P>
   When the topic of debate turns to the Cy Young Award, the
Braves-Padres series has the National League field virtually
blanketed. Atlanta left-hander Tom Glavine and San Diego closer
Trevor Hoffman rank as the favorites, followed by the Padres' Kevin
Brown and the Braves' Greg Maddux and John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   So who takes it? Cox likes Glavine. Padres manager Bochy favors
Hoffman, who converted 53 of 54 save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a closer is more fitted for MVP,'' Braves manager
Bobby Cox said. ``But whoever you pick, you can't go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   No three-and-out
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Braves have made a habit of waltzing through the
first round of the playoffs, Cox is among a growing number of
baseball people opposed to the best-of-five division series. Cox
and others would prefer a best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what went on with the Cubs, the Mets and the Giants
(playing for the NL wild card),'' he said. ``They deserve better
than five-game series. It's just not fair to play that long, and
have it end so quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends
</P>
<P>
   Cox on the change at first base from Fred McGriff to Andres
Galarraga: ``Mac was a quiet leader. Andres is more verbal.'' ...
The Padres are the 12th team to own a 2-0 lead in the NLCS, and no
club has come back to earn a World Series berth after losing the
first two games at home. ... Around the NL, the contention is
Atlanta pitchers benefit from a generous strike zone, particularly
offerings just off the plate by Glavine that are often called
strikes. Tony Gwynn has said he takes his hacks right away against
the Braves, because anything is liable to be called a strike. But
in the first two games, Atlanta pitchers have issued 13 walks,
including season highs by Glavine (six) and Smoltz (five).

 &HT;    Leyritz hopes for another delivery
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ He's the chunky guy with the shaved head. Hardly the
look of a big leaguer dubbed Mr. October Jr., but Jim Leyritz cares
less about appearance than being in the fray come postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And this afternoon, Leyritz gets his first full-time duty in the
NLCS, serving as the personal catcher for lefty Sterling Hitchcock
in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   That's bad news for the Braves after nemesis Kevin Brown
continued his mastery in Game 2, as Leyritz has his own storied
history against the locals. Leyritz is still remembered for his
game-tying, three-run homer off Mark Wohlers in Game 4 of the 1996
Word Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife replays it when I come home and I'm slumping,''
Leyritz said of his vintage moment with the New York Yankees. ``She
says: 'You know how to hit, you've done it before.' It's a moment.
It was nice to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 3 1/2-year old boy that watches my hitting tapes.
It's on in his room every now and then, and I catch a glimpse of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz staged more highlight clips in the NL division series
against the Houston Astros, homering to tie one game and winning
another. Yet with first baseman Wally Joyner's strained shoulder
well enough for him to play, Leyritz has had only two late-inning
at-bats in Game 1 of this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I said I was happy,'' Leyritz said of his
reduced role. ``I was disappointed. The bottom line is it's a
seven-game series and I'm going to catch Hitchcock. This one game
might make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   When Leyritz joined the Padres in a midseason trade from the
Boston Red Sox, Hitchcock asked that Leyritz catch him because
they'd worked together when both were Yankees. Hitchcock claims
it's a confidence thing.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, but what Leyritz does best is hit in the clutch. A
.269 career hitter, he's hit more than 10 home runs in a season
only three times in his eight-year career _ though making a name
for himself in the playoffs as a Yankee and now a Padre.
</P>
<P>
   ``His flair for the dramatic borders on unbelievable,'' said
Brown. ``He's the kind of guy who wants to be in those
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz says it dates back to his years in New York, learning to
cope under the daily spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always joked that I get paid for April and October,'' he
said. ``April, most of the guys are hurt out of spring training and
I get to play a little more, and I've had some success in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``And throughout my career, because I've never been an everyday
player, every game that I've been in has kind of been a World
Series for me. I had to perform if I wanted to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he's paid handsome dividends for the Padres.

 &HT;    New rules for testing considered
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ NASCAR officials are considering new testing
rules for 1999 that will make it more difficult for multi-car teams
to gain an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Under NASCAR's proposal, which is likely to be approved, each
manufacturer will be given four or five test sessions similar to
the GM and Ford tests held prior to each season.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules and test dates could be announced as early as the
end of October to allow teams to begin making plans for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in whatever we do is to try and establish more
control in knowing who goes where and when and with whom,'' said
Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations. ``The whole thing
with the testing policy is economics.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR will likely have inspectors present at the sanctioned
tests to police which teams participate.
</P>
<P>
   Secure at last
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach Jr. no longer has to wonder where his next ride
will come from in 1999. The veteran Winston Cup driver will drive
the Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet, which has been piloted by a
succession of drivers since Ricky Craven was released in
mid-August. Dallenbach has been at the wheel for 11 races this
year, including the last eight as a fill-in. He's posted three top
10 finishes in those 11 events. ``I really appreciate John
(Hendrick) and everybody at Budweiser for giving me this
opportunity,'' Dallenbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Number 500
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Winston 500 will be the 500th start for Geoff Bodine,
becoming only the 19th driver in NASCAR history to reach that
milestone. ``It's something I'm very proud of,'' said Bodine, whose
first career victory came at Martinsville in 1984. ``They really
don't mean anything. ... They're just reminders of who we are and
what we are and what we've gone through. The world doesn't stop
when they happen, and certainly the world won't stop this weekend
at Talladega for my 500th start.''
</P>
<P>
   In memory of
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-year-old Thad Coleman of Greenville, S.C., starts 27th in
today's ARCA Bondo Hyde series with one objective _ to honor his
son Chad Coleman. Coleman died Aug. 28th from injuries he suffered
after hitting the wall head-on at Atlanta Motor Speedway Aug. 28.
``I'm racing here in memory of my son,'' said Coleman, who hasn't
raced since 1992. ``I'm sure he would want me to drive it.''

 &HT;    `Banzai run' for Schrader
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Server
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ With most projections leaning in the direction
of the Labonte Brothers, Terry and Bobby, it was Ken Schrader who
stole the show and won the pole for Sunday's Winston 500.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader put his name in the Talladega record book with a lap of
196.153 mph and his first pole of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our restrictor plate program has always been good,'' said
Schrader, who is riding a seven-year winless streak. ``Our problem
is finishing. We were wrecked at Daytona (in the 125s) and wrecked
here in the spring. I haven't won in forever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Schrader's fourth top 10 start in the last seven races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be a good lap,'' he said. ``We never
made a full-fledged banzai run in practice, never put all that tape
on it and do all those other things. But, we're really happy with
it. It's a brand new car, and we might have something for the big
boys this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The big boys are Jeff Gordon and Mark Martin, who have their
eyes on the ultimate prize, the Winston Cup championship. Their
qualifying runs produced almost identical results. Gordon took the
sixth spot with a lap of 194.154 mph and Martin eighth in 194.058.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend we wanted to start a little closer to the front
and see if we can stay there,'' said Gordon, referring to last
week's 26th start at Charlotte. ``Come Sunday, it's going to be a
whole lot of drafting out there, and the guy who drafts the best is
going to win the thing. I think one of the guys going for the
million is going to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's viewpoint is anything is better here than one year ago
when he qualified 38th and had to take a provisional start and
finished 23rd, eight laps down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to then, I feel like we sat on the pole today,''
Martin said. ``I gotta take my hat off to these guys (in the shop).
I didn't think it was going to be that good.''

JUDGE TELLS BRAWLEY TO PAY $185,000 FOR DEFAMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARMEL, N.Y. _ The judge who presided over nine months of often
contentious testimony in the Tawana Brawley slander suit issued his
final decision in the case Friday, ruling that Miss Brawley
herself, the central, elusive character in this drawn-out
melodrama, must pay $185,000 in damages for defaming Steven
Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, S. Barrett Hickman of state Supreme Court, said in a
harshly worded decision that Miss Brawley could well have been
fined much more because she was the person most responsible for
falsely accusing Pagones of rape and because she had ``literally
thumbed her nose'' at the court by refusing to testify about the
accusations she first made 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But based on his sense that she was a woman ``caught up in her
own fiction'' who might have been manipulated by her family and her
advisers _ the Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox _
the judge said he had decided to temper the fine.
</P>
<P>
   The three advisers, who repeatedly accused Pagones of assaulting
Miss Brawley, have already been found liable for $345,000 in
damages, with Mason assigned the largest share: $185,000. Miss
Brawley was fined separately because she had been found in default
years ago for failing to appear at an earlier phase of the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear when _ or if _ Pagones will see the money he has
been awarded. Maddox and Sharpton have already appealed the
judgments, and Mason's lawyer filed an appeal on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who had positioned himself as Miss Brawley's closest
adviser, said late Friday afternoon that he had not spoken to her
about the judge's decision, but that he believed she would never be
forced to pay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Miss Brawley, a black teen-ager living in Wappingers
Falls, N.Y., said she had been abducted and raped over four days by
a gang of white men, some of them law enforcement officers, who
afterward smeared her with dog feces and dumped her in a garbage
bag. Miss Brawley, who was 15 at the time, later accused Pagones of
being one of her attackers. But an extensive grand jury
investigation found that Miss Brawley had not been raped or
attacked and that she might have created her condition herself.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his decision, which he issued from his chambers here in
Putnam County, Hickman observed, ``It is probable that in the
history of this state, never has a teen-ager turned the
prosecutorial and judicial systems literally upside down with such
false claims.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickman said he was appalled that Miss Brawley had agreed to
attend a rally in Brooklyn last December to repeat her charges, but
would not come to the defamation trial in Poughkeepsie to testify
under oath. Noting that just this summer she had received an award
in Brooklyn and continued to claim that a crime had been committed,
Hickman wrote, ``It is indeed a sad day when one receives an award
for seeking to perpetuate lies and falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones, who is now contemplating job offers after spending the
last year in court, said the judge's decision was morally
satisfying _ if monetarily thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased with the message that the judge conveyed,''
he said. ``It was long overdue.'' But, he added, ``I was hoping the
punitive damages would be a little higher.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones pledged that he would see to it that Miss Brawley and
her advisers were forced to pay the judgments against them. ``I
don't know if it'll be $5 a week, but I'm going to pursue that
judgment,'' he said. ``There's going to be consequences for the
damage that they did.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they had throughout most of the civil case, Miss
Brawley's former advisers scoffed at Pagones' concept of victory
and at Hickman's sense of law.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton appeared, if anything, to be buoyed by the judge's
assertion that Miss Brawley had been the one most responsible for
the false charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just strengthens our appeal _ because we said we believed
Tawana Brawley,'' Sharpton said.

POLICE JUDGE URGES FIRING OF OFFICER OVER RACIST FLOAT IN PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Police Department judge has ruled that a New York
City police officer who admitted riding on a racist float during a
Labor Day parade in Queens should be fired, according to the
decision, which has not been made public. Police Commissioner
Howard Safir, who would not confirm the details of the judge's
ruling, said he would weigh the recommendation, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Safir previously stated that the officer, Joseph Locurto, should
be dismissed for wearing blackface and an Afro wig in the parade.
Noting that Locurto's participation was not disputed during the
departmental trial, he added that ``racial, ethnic or gender
discrimination is not something I am tolerant of, and somebody
exercising their First Amendment right is different from whether
they should stay in uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   The float, called ``Black to the Future,'' appeared in a parade
in the Broad Channel section of Queens and included the police
officer, two city firefighters and others wearing blackface. Some
revelers tossed watermelon and fried chicken to spectators and one
man re-enacted the dragging death of a black man in Texas in June.
</P>
<P>
   Safir must decide whether to fire the officer before Monday if
he wants to take action before Locurto, a four-year veteran, is
automatically reinstated with pay after his monthlong suspension.
But Safir said Friday that he would not rush his deliberations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I am operating under no deadline,'' he said. ``I am operating
under how long it takes me to make a decision.'' He could still
dismiss the officer after an automatic reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Locurto, 30, was suspended from his post at the 104th Precinct
in Queens on Sept. 11. Two city firefighters who rode on the float
have also been suspended and are awaiting a decision by Fire
Commissioner Thomas Von Essen on their fate. It is expected next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations about the float in the Broad Channel parade came a
day after a youth rally in Harlem ended with a disturbance between
participants and police, and highlighted what some black leaders
said was official disinterest in countering racism in the
department. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Safir both quickly made
public statements saying that such overt acts of bigotry would not
be tolerated by city employees, and they promised to fire any city
employee who participated.
</P>
<P>
   But if dismissed, Locurto would be the first police officer
since 1991 to face such a severe penalty for partaking in racially
offensive speech or expression. And during Locurto's hearing before
the deputy commissioner of trials, Rae Koshetz, his lawyers pointed
out that during that time, there had been several administrative
cases against officers who had not only directed ethnic slurs at
suspects but had done so while also beating them.
</P>
<P>
   These officers were not fired. Instead, the presiding Police
Department judge imposed a term of suspension or a forfeiture of a
few vacation days, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Locurto's lawyers, who included Norman Siegel, the executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, also portrayed
their client's actions as protected speech similar to that at a
political rally.
</P>
<P>
   But in ruling against the officer, Judge Koshetz said that
Locurto's case was different from others that had come before the
court because it had been a public display of racism, noting in her
opinion that no other cases had ``involved a degrading portrayal of
African-Americans as a group and mocked a racist dragging death in
a parade watched by up to a thousand people in a neighborhood''
where the defendant was known as a policeman.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she did not believe he had intended to make
social commentary when he got up on the float in blackface and
wearing an Afro wig. Instead, she said, the officer was merely
trying to have a good time and possibly win a prize for the
funniest float.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that this float was designed to mimic and mock a racial
group for the amusement of the participants and spectators,'' she
wrote, calling his claim of public-spirited speech both
disingenuous and self-serving.

AT A WAL-MART, A RUSH TO WIN TURNS INTO A CRUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One minute before 8 p.m. on Thursday, 9-year-old Melissa Morgan
was sitting on the floor of a Wal-Mart in Brick, N.J., crowded
together with 200 other keyed-up children, waiting to scramble for
balloons with prizes inside.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, she was sprawled on her face as adults
trampled on her and the other youngsters, desperately grabbing for
balloons. Like the dozens of other children hurt, she emerged
scratched and bruised, but without serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were going crazy,'' Melissa said. ``I was squished and
thrown down. Somebody stepped on my foot, and I couldn't get up. It
was like being in a movie _ a really bad movie. It was really
scary; there was blood all over the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was supposed to promote the store's toy department and
raise money for the Children's Specialized Hospital in nearby
Mountainside. About 300 adults and children were charged $2 each to
take part.
</P>
<P>
   Children ages 3 to 12 were directed to a small, roped-off area
of floor near the front of the store, said Jason Shepherd, a Brick
police officer. Parents and teen-agers surrounded the area.
Tarpaulins holding the 500 balloons _ each with a slip of paper
redeemable for a prize _ were suspended above the crowd of
children.
</P>
<P>
   At the signal, children were supposed to pop balloons with their
hands. The prizes were discounts on toys, gift certificates and a
two-minute buying spree in the toy department.
</P>
<P>
   As the balloons fell, ``older children, then parents, were
pushing to get to them,'' said Lt. Douglas Kinney of the Brick
Police Department. ``It touched off a little stampede kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was over quickly, said Shepherd. When he arrived, 10
minutes after the kickoff signal, he said the melee had ended.
Parents were trying to comfort sobbing children, or hauling them
out of the store, or snapping at employees.
</P>
<P>
   Forty children with scratches, bruises and minor head injuries
were treated and released at local hospitals, said Joni Schultz, a
spokeswoman for the Medical Center of Ocean County. First-aid
workers who set up medical stations at the Wal-Mart treated dozens
more children who were kicked, clawed and trampled.
</P>
<P>
   One 3-year-old girl was briefly knocked unconscious. She was
released from Brick Hospital after a CAT scan showed that she was
not injured, Ms. Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   Starla Weiss, who took four children, said that ``parents were
in there popping balloons,'' and children were shoved into ``one
big pile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers were screaming `My son! My daughter!''' she said, as
they hunted for their children. One ``heroic'' woman, she said,
``was literally pulling children out, one by one, picking them up''
and leading them to safety.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Weiss' 3-year-old son, Dylan, ``had claw marks on his
shoulders and arms,'' she said. His brother Zachary, 5, was
scratched and sobbing because he did not win a prize.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. issued a statement Friday saying that it
regretted the injuries and was grateful none were serious. Store
managers said they would try to contact all the customers who left
their names with store employees.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Morgan, Melissa's mother, said a manager called and
offered her toy coupons. Wal-Mart has also offered to refund the $2
admission fee. But Friday afternoon, most customers wanted the
money to go to the children's hospital, said Joseph Herron, the
manager of the Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Brick child had a fine time despite the incident.
Danielle Luttenberger, 10, won the grand prize: the 2-minute
shopping spree. But when she and her mother arrived at the store
Friday morning, they were told of a change. She was given one
shopping cart and allowed to take as long as she pleased to fill
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances,'' said an employee who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, ``we thought it would be better not to
force her to rush.''

CORRUPTION INVESTIGATION OF NEW YORK CITY LABOR UNIONS IS WIDENED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney on Friday broadened
his investigation into possible corruption in the municipal labor
unions, demanding financial documents from 40 locals of District
Council 37, the umbrella group that represents 120,000 city
workers.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest move, the district attorney, Robert Morgenthau,
has now subpoenaed records from all 56 locals of District Council
37 as part of a broad investigation into allegations of kickbacks,
embezzlement and election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who have seen some of the new subpoenas said that they
were part of an inquiry into possible kickbacks and that they
demanded documents about the locals' dealings with a caterer, a
bakery, several travel agencies and other businesses. An official
at the parent union of District 37, the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal Employees, said union leaders had been
told to expect indictments of officials at several union locals in
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Officials who have seen Friday's subpoenas said they also sought
information about the union locals' purchase of thousands of
turkeys that were given to union members for Christmas dinners.
Officials at several union locals said their predecessors had paid
$44 for each turkey when similar turkeys normally sell for half
that at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hill, executive director of District Council 37, said:
``D.C. 37 is cooperating fully and completely. The locals are doing
the same. There appears to be nothing new in what is being
requested. This is just an expansion to other locals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill acknowledged that the district attorney's office previously
subpoenaed District Council 37 itself to examine its books.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rosenthal, the new president of a local representing 2,400
city drivers, said he had provided the district attorney with
information about large payments that his predecessor had made to
Gee Whiz, a caterer near the district council's headquarters in
lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After Rosenthal was elected in July, he discovered a series of
canceled checks left in his desk that his predecessors had written
to Gee Whiz.
</P>
<P>
   Those checks, he said, were for four union meetings held in
April, May and June 1995 and were for $12,390, $10,000, $11,050 and
$12,000. Rosenthal said that fewer than 50 people attended several
of the meetings. The backs of the canceled checks show that they
were endorsed and deposited not by Gee Whiz but by various
entities, including a food company, a seafood company and a meat
company.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered the phone at Gee Whiz and gave his name as
Peter Peterson acknowledged that several locals had contracted for
food from his company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent it with us,'' said Peterson, who said he was the
manager. He denied that any money was kicked back to union
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has been a major embarrassment to District
Council 37 and Hill, a close ally of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
widely considered one of the city's most powerful labor leaders.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Morgenthau's latest move comes after a union judicial panel
expelled Charles Hughes, the longtime president of the local
representing 22,000 school cafeteria aides and crossing guards. The
panel found that he had illegally received $1.7 million from the
union, including $685,000 in fraudulent overtime expenses and
$329,000 to pay his family's credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rosenthal has brought to the district attorney's
attention a $81,990 payment that his predecessor made to a travel
agent in Suffolk County for a 1993 Christmas party held at
Leonard's of Great Neck, N.Y. And members of the local representing
City University workers have asked Hill to investigate how $192,000
disappeared from their union's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said the union was seeking to function normally despite the
mushrooming investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to take care of the business of this council,
providing services, making sure our members are protected, that
they get their salary increases and benefits,'' he said. ``We are
confident that at the end of the day this council will be standing
as strong as it has ever been.''

GALAXY MUST SURVIVE CLASH OF STYLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In the most beguiling matchup on the road to
Major League Soccer's championship, the Los Angeles Galaxy and its
strike-at-any-time attack faces a most difficult challenge: how to
solve the maze constructed by the Chicago Fire's defense while
remaining true to its beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will give it a go at the Rose Bowl, where the
best-of-three Western Conference series kicks off tonight with a
battle of styles and wits and of philosophies that is as much chess
match as soccer game.
</P>
<P>
   It's MLS' most potent attack against its toughest defense, the
high-flying ``showtime'' of the Galaxy's Cobi Jones against the
hard-nosed workmanship of the Fire's Lubos Kubik and Chris Armas.
Whichever is employed most skillfully, with fewer breakdowns, will
find a place in MLS Cup '98.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough when everybody's behind the ball and everybody
is matched up man to man,'' said Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano,
whose attack found the going rough against Chicago during the
regular season, splitting four very tight encounters with the Fire.
``They defend as a priority and we attack as a priority.... It's a
matter of tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play our game. We have to make sure we're patient
and we have to make sure that we are constantly trying to break
them.''
</P>
<P>
   To do both, simultaneously, is the puzzle confronting L.A. It
wants to play its freewheeling style that requires space and
movement against a Fire squad that will attempt to limit both, then
counter the Galaxy's aggressiveness with an opportunistic offense
led by playmaker Peter Nowak.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a test of patience,'' said Galaxy defender Robin
Fraser. ``We need to pick and choose the moments we throw
everything into attack and we need to wait for the right
opportunity.... We need to play well. We need to execute. Chicago
is a very organized team and they're not going to give you
anything, so everything we do we need to do sharply, we need to do
crisply.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of the bottom line. The team that executes better
is going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The key could be how well Armas, the former Galaxy midfielder
responsible for marking opponents' playmakers, can shut down
Mauricio Cienfuegos, who had five assists in L.A.'s first-round
sweep of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see (that) week in and week out with Cien,'' said Fraser of
the tactic. ``But Chris is the best at it.''

LONG-TERM CAPITAL: A CASE OF MARKETS OVER MINDS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 11) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Calif., Mass.)   (af)  
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ and PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bond traders nicknamed Long-Term Capital Management ``Salomon
North,'' a reference to the many partners in the Greenwich, Conn.,
hedge fund who were veterans of Salomon Brothers. But a more apt
choice might have been ``MIT South.''
</P>
<P>
   The people _ and the mathematical ``rocket science'' _ at the
core of the elite hedge fund had strong ties to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and the working atmosphere was far closer
to the studied tranquillity of academia than to a frenetic trading
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Even the setting in wealthy, quiet Greenwich was chosen to
contrast with the gray skyscrapers and crowded, narrow streets of
Manhattan's financial district. The partners, many of whom had
mined those financial canyons for tens of millions of dollars,
traded suits and ties for polo shirts and chinos, preferring to
relieve stress with a game of pool or a fishing break.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was collegial, recalled Peter van Rijssen, a recent
college graduate who spent a pleasant three months as a $17-an-hour
temp at Long-Term Capital in the summer of 1996. ``Everyone was
extremely friendly, from the boss on down,'' he said. ``It was very
calm and ordered.''
</P>
<P>
   That order was shattered last month as Long-Term Capital ran out
of money and was deemed too big to fail without disrupting the
global financial markets, leading to an emergency $3.6 billion
capital infusion by a consortium of brokerage firms and banks
organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   As the winds of turmoil strip away some of the firm's secrecy, a
portrait emerges of a group of highly analytical, extremely
rational former academics who believed they had created a
mathematical trading model to withstand the sharpest gyrations of
the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, their lack of trading instincts and their
adherence to numerical models _ which showed that their bets would
eventually pay off _ kept them from understanding the gravity of
their situation until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   So certain were they of the firm's infallibility that they kept
virtually all their money in the fund, treating it as a checking
account, and borrowed money to increase their personal stakes in
it. Some expected to attain riches that would put them on a par
with the wealthiest dynasties in America.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 16 partners, Lawrence E. Hilibrand, an MIT graduate
who earned $23 million at Salomon in 1990, borrowed $24 million
last year to increase his investment in the fund. Now Hilibrand,
his partners and many of firm's 180 employees are scrambling to
avoid financial ruin and anguishing over the damage they have
inflicted to themselves and their investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wealth has been knocked down to zero in many cases,'' said
a person involved with the firm. ``But most of us came from
backgrounds of academics and teaching, and it wasn't too long ago
that we didn't have much.'' Of course, many of them have long
become accustomed to the trappings of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   The partners at Long-Term Capital have laid low, generally
declining requests for interviews. ``They have always been
extraordinarily secretive and didn't want to be in any
publication,'' said Antoine Bernheim, who could not even get enough
information to include Long-Term Capital in his annual hedge fund
directory. But several people involved with the firm agreed to
speak on condition that their names be withheld.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Meriwether, a pioneer in betting on fluctuations in bond
prices, a strategy known as bond arbitrage, recruited many of the
finest minds in finance, most from his former firm, Salomon
Brothers, to create Long-Term Capital in 1993. They shared an
intellectual approach to the world of trading, one that flowed from
their backgrounds in academia and their doctorates in finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are among the best and the brightest,'' said
William A. McIntosh, a former Salomon partner and a former
colleague of many Long-Term Capital principals.
</P>
<P>
   The partners ``tried not to react to things too quickly,'' said
one person involved since the early days. ``We have tried to study
things very carefully. We have tried to do it very slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy was well suited to the good times but would come
back to haunt the partners when market volatility outstripped their
ability to react.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fund's original partners were two academics who had
spent time at MIT and who would later share a Nobel Prize, Myron S.
Scholes of Stanford University and Robert C. Merton of Harvard
University, whose groundbreaking work in 1973 had turned risk
management into a science and opened up Wall Street to the era of
``rocket scientists,'' the mathematics and physics whizzes who
trade according to formulas instead of hunches.
</P>
<P>
   Scholes, whose Greenwich house overlooks Indian Harbor on a
private road, played a key role in soliciting money for the
original fund, according to one fund investor. ``At the
presentation, he was just the brightest guy I'd ever heard,'' the
investor said. ``It was a collection of uniquely intelligent men.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket scientists included Eric R. Rosenfeld, a former
professor at the Harvard Business School who had been a managing
director at Salomon, and Gregory D. Hawkins, another former Salomon
managing director and a former finance professor at the University
of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hilibrand, Rosenfeld and Hawkins did graduate work at MIT
when Merton was on the faculty there. Scholes did his pioneering
work while a junior faculty member at MIT. David W. Mullins Jr.,
who left the No. 2 spot at the Federal Reserve Board to join the
venture, received his doctorate from MIT at the same time Scholes
was teaching there.
</P>
<P>
   Later, two others with MIT connections joined Long-Term Capital:
David M. Modest, who had moved to Berkeley as a finance professor
after graduating from MIT, and Chi-Fu Huang, an expert on creating
models for swap contracts, financial instruments designed to take
advantage of currency, bond and other price differences.
</P>
<P>
   Success came fast. The firm, which is organized as a limited
partnership with a minimum investment of $10 million, began trading
in February 1994 and produced a net return of 20 percent that year,
43 percent in 1995 and 41 percent in 1996. In the first three
years, investors more than doubled their money, far better than
they would have done in a typical American stock fund. The fees
that the firm charged investors were hefty, too _ a 2 percent
management fee and a 25 percent annual ``incentive'' fee, both well
above those of other firms _ but no one was complaining.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with attracting money from wealthy individuals and
institutions, the partners contributed about $150 million of their
own money to the investment pool and then treated the fund like a
private bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some months they would withdraw $10,000, and when they had a
big purchase, they would take out more,'' said one person involved
with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some purchases were big, indeed, befitting risk takers who were
reaping big rewards. Some of the partners had bought into a golf
course in Ireland. Others began to learn about wine and developed a
taste for $100-a-bottle Burgundies, like Gevrey-Chambertin.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether, a top earner on Wall Street for 15 years, already
owned a 67-acre estate in Westchester County, N.Y. But even after
earning $23 million in 1990 at Salomon Brothers, Hilibrand and his
family remained in a $1 million colonial on about an acre in
Scarsdale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, though, he and his wife, Deborah, paid $2.1 million for
a 15-acre lot in a gated development in northwest Greenwich and
began to build a $4 million home, according to records on file with
the town's division of buildings. Construction is nearly completed,
and the builder said recently that no one had told him to stop
work.
</P>
<P>
   Hilibrand shuns interviews and refused to have his photograph
taken when he was a managing director at Salomon. Friends describe
him as a political libertarian and say he is obsessed with his
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Hilibrand is one of at least four Long-Term Capital partners who
took out personal loans, secured by their shares in the firm, to
increase their investments in the portfolio, according to people
involved in the transactions. His loans are the largest, at $24
million.
</P>
<P>
   Hans U. Hufschmid, who received $18 million in compensation from
Salomon in 1993, according to a former firm official, also borrowed
heavily. People involved with the firm said Hufschmid, a
foreign-exchange expert who works out of the firm's London office,
had borrowed $14.6 million to increase his fund equity.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hilibrand and Hufschmid are negotiating with creditors from
Credit Lyonnais and other banks to reschedule their debts and to
persuade lenders to take a claim on future earnings, say bankers
and others involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably too soon to say whether anyone will be pushed
into personal bankruptcy. ``If banks require them to pay it today,
they can't pay it,'' said one person involved in the firm's
finances. ``Their assets must stay in the fund. They also have
other liquid things in their names. I believe everything can be
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the fabulous wealth has evaporated, and some
partners may lose everything they have accumulated in recent years,
from mansions to wine cellars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people have to sell their homes, it's not the end of the
world,'' said the person involved in the finances.
</P>
<P>
   Scholes may have at least some money outside the fund. After he
and Merton shared the $1 million for the Nobel economics prize in
1997, Scholes told a reporter that he would not be investing his
portion in the hedge fund. ``I thought about that,'' he told
Institutional Investor magazine. ``But I think it's in bad taste.''
</P>
<P>
   For some lower-level employees, the collapse of the firm means
more than just lost wealth. A couple of days after the Sept. 23
bailout, a trader entered the office of one partner and began to
weep. He said he feared that he would have to cancel his wedding
because he had been wiped out, said a person who witnessed the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   The partners' decision to hang on to their market positions even
as their capital evaporated and markets turned against them was
completely in tune with their ``take it slow'' character. Trouble
became apparent in May, when the portfolio lost 6.5 percent. In
June, it lost 10 percent, leaving it down 5 percent for the first
half of 1998, its first period in the red, according to people
involved with the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The cataclysm came on Aug. 17, when Russia devalued its currency
and halted payments on its debt, sending bond prices down almost
across-the-board. Only United States Treasury securities were
spared as investors decided safety was everything.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every big investment house and bank that trades bonds
took a hit, but Long-Term Capital was devastated because its
positions were spread across the globe and it had invested as much
as $100 billion in borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, the portfolio was down 44 percent for the
month and 52 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   After failed attempts to raise more money, the partners agreed
to a rescue in late September by the consortium of 14 brokerage
firms and banks. In exchange for an infusion of $3.6 billion in
capital, the equity of the investors, including the partners and
employees, was reduced to 10 percent and tight restrictions were
set on their ability to withdraw funds.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Long-Term Capital, rescued by its nervous
creditors, has narrowly avoided a meltdown, and its partners with
big debts, like Hilibrand and Hufschmid, seem sanguine about
avoiding bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Things could still get worse _ if the financial markets eat away
at the fund's capital and the rescue falls apart _ but the bulk of
the risk has been shifted from Greenwich back to Wall Street, no
small bit of rocket science itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an old axiom in the restructuring business: If you're
going to fail, then fail very big,'' said Thomas Maloney, a partner
at Cleary Gottlieb Steen &AMP; Hamilton. That way, he explained, your
creditors have to bail you out.

COMMENTARY: HEAVENS, NO, THEY WON'T GO 
</HEADLINE>
   (About New York)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rev. Donald Moore and his brethren gather nightly
for meals in the dining room of the West Side Jesuit Community.
Under the steady gaze of icons depicting saints and martyrs, they
also share camaraderie and conversation about the ups and downs of
their days as professors, counselors, chaplains and writers. The
routine has endured for 29 years with bonds as intense as any
family's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are striving for what the Jesuits term a union of minds and
hearts,'' said Moore, who teaches theology at Fordham University.
``We are striving to be, quote, friends in the Lord, unquote. And
we're succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   They've had less success being friends with their landlord.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oct. 1, the 23 Jesuits who live in 16 rent-stabilized
apartments at 220 West 98th Street have essentially been squatters.
Their landlord will not renew their leases and has told them to
move or face eviction, even though some of them have been there
since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The leases are in the name of the New York Province of the
Society of Jesus, the religious order's local governing body, whose
address the landlord listed as Fordham University. The landlord's
lawyer concluded that because the West Side apartments were not the
Province's primary residence, the leases were no longer valid.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a Jesuitical distinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to tell me where we really live,'' said the Rev.
Daniel Berrigan, the poet-priest and pacifist who has lived in the
building for 23 years. ``It seems to me the quality of human life,
and our efforts on behalf of people, is being subjugated to this
lust for money. To him, we're just an integer at the end of a
dollar sign. He can get more money than we're offering. It's just
ripping people apart to get the bucks rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jesuits, who originally housed seminarians and teachers in
the building, now pay a lump sum of about $15,000 a month for the
apartments, which range from studios to three-bedrooms. They said
they arrived in the building as a welcome presence, moving into
apartments that had gone vacant while the neighborhood declined and
crime went up.
</P>
<P>
   They considered themselves a stabilizing force. Now, young
professionals with children and exotic dogs share the elevator with
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We arrived as desirables in an undesirable neighborhood,''
said the Rev. Jack McSherry. ``We have evolved into being
undesirables in a very desirable neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the landlord tried unsuccessfully to end the
Jesuits' tenancy by claiming that they were a monastery.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Furtzaig, the landlord's lawyer, said eviction
proceedings would soon begin. He cited a 1994 ruling by the
appellate division of state supreme court that allowed a landlord
to terminate leases that Lenox Hill Hospital had on 15 apartments
for employees.
</P>
<P>
   The decision held that the apartments were not being occupied by
the primary tenant, the hospital. Allowing the hospital to renew
the leases could have resulted in the hospital's depriving the
owner of his property rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lease of this sort would be a perpetual undertaking if it
was protected under the rent stabilization law,'' Furtzaig said.
</P>
<P>
   Legalities aside, you have to wonder if the landlord knows what
kind of tangle lies ahead. In the name of social justice, some of
these Jesuits will break the law before they break into a sweat.
Father Berrigan, 77, once burned draft files with homemade napalm.
The Rev. John Dear recently spent a year in jail with Berrigan's
brother Philip after attacking an F-15 bomber with a hammer to
protest militarism.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Berrigan has enlisted Ramsey Clark, the former
United States attorney general, to help with their case. (They also
have a tenant-rights lawyer leading the charge.) They have invited
the landlord to a communal dinner to put, as they said, a human
face on the adversaries. The landlord declined, but they still
include him in their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   They want to preserve their community because it sustains them
in their individual work. And while they might consider moving _ as
a group _ they don't know where else they can find enough
apartments at the right price and place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through this can only be to our advantage,'' Berrigan
said. ``We're getting a taste of what poor people face all the
time. It's good for us. Though it's not easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, he said, it is time to move or be moved. How about
protest?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have any ideas?'' he asked. ``You know what Phil and
others have done. They go to the homes of judges who have done them
ill and raise a fuss. That'll be our last resort. We won't say
whose home.''

JUDGE ALLOWS DETAINEES TO SUE INS OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., Calif.)  (af)  
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a decision that could change the way asylum seekers are
treated in immigration detention centers, a federal judge in New
Jersey has ruled that immigration officials can be sued for
violating the human rights of detainees at a center in Elizabeth,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Senior Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise of U.S.
District Court in Newark, N.J., is the first major decision in a
lawsuit filed last year on behalf of 19 asylum seekers who were
held at the detention center in 1995, when a violent uprising led
to the temporary closing of the center and a review of the way the
Immigration and Naturalization Service handled detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The Elizabeth center was reopened 20 months ago and, until now,
has been held up as a model. But last week, about 94 of the 268
detainees at the center began a hunger strike to demand more food
and fewer telephone charges, and to be released to their friends
and relatives while a judge determines their immigration status.
The strike ended Wednesday after INS officials promised to look
into their grievances.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, another hunger strike began at a detention center in
Jamaica, N.Y., when 96 detainees refused to eat breakfast. By
Friday, 18 people were still refusing food, and 10 doctors and
nurses were monitoring the health of detainees around the clock,
said Alen Atkinson, a spokesman with the immigration service's
district office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision, issued Oct. 1 but disclosed by the
detainees' lawyers Wednesday night, is unlikely to help the
strikers because the ruling is narrow: it applies only to the 19
detainees who filed the suit alleging that they had suffered
physical and psychological abuse at the hands of untrained and
poorly supervised staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Six of them were granted political asylum and now live in the
United States; two are still in detention in Pennsylvania, and the
others were deported to their countries, where they remain in
hiding, said Penny Venetis, the lawyer who filed the suit last year
on behalf of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its narrowness, Ms. Venetis said, the ruling marks the
first time that international human rights law has been applied to
government employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ruled that the Esmor Correction Corp., the
company that was running the detention center under contract with
the INS, could be sued on the same grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel V. Gsovski, the lawyer for the corporation and some of
its officers, said he could not comment beyond stressing that the
judge had not yet ruled on culpability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just an evaluation on his part of what body of law, in
addition to U.S. law, can be used in the case,'' Gsovski said.
``The facts of the case have not changed, and we expect to prevail
in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the immigration service also played down the
significance of the judge's decision and instead claimed victory
because, while the judge had ruled that international law could be
applied to government employees, he had also ruled that the same
law could not be used against the agency itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Venetis and other immigration lawyers, who for years
have complained about the detention of asylum seekers and the
conditions in which they are sometimes held, said the decision
offered hope to hundreds of refugees who each year seek asylum in
the United States only to find themselves behind bars while judges
determine their fate. There are now about 800 asylum seekers in
detention throughout the country, Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when they are here, they are not protected by U.S. law,
because they are not legally here; it's like they haven't reached
our shores, even though they are in New Jersey,'' said Ms. Venetis,
director of the Rutgers Constitutional Litigation Clinic. ``This
decision says that now they can find remedy through international
law.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision, binding only in New Jersey, could have a wider
impact if federal judges in other states use it as precedent when
considering their own cases, Ms. Venetis said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling comes at a time when two internationally
recognized human rights organizations, Human Rights Watch and
Amnesty International, have released highly critical reports of the
way the United States government deals with asylum seekers, and
just weeks after the immigration subcommittee of the Senate
Judiciary Committee held a hearing to examine the INS's detention
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1, 1997, when a new law took effect, the immigration
service has detained all asylum seekers upon arrival. Those found
to have a ``credible fear'' of persecution in their homeland can be
freed, or paroled, but only for ``urgent humanitarian reasons or
significant public benefit.'' Because Congress never defined those
terms, the INS has allowed its 33 district directors to exercise
their discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Acer, a senior coordinator of the asylum program at the
Lawyers Committee for Human Rights who testified at the
congressional hearing, criticized the New York district's record of
parole. Of the 70 asylum seekers her agency has monitored, only one
was released following the agency's own parole criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York district has failed to release many of our
clients, despite the fact that they're eligible for parole,'' she
said. ``Many of these clients are survivors of torture, and were
ultimately granted asylum by immigration judges.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Amnesty International report, released Tuesday, states that
detention of asylum seekers is in itself a human rights violation.
``Asylum seekers are not criminals,'' the report says, calling on
the United States to detain refugees only when there is no other
recourse and their behavior makes it necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Paul L. Hoffman, chairman of the board of Amnesty International
USA and a civil rights lawyer in Los Angeles, said the judge's
ruling on the New Jersey detention center ``puts some real teeth
into what we have been arguing.'' Hoffman, who used the same
international principles in 1992 to sue Ferdinand E. Marcos, former
president of the Philippines, said the ruling would also make it
easier to hold federal government officials to the same standards
used for abusive government officials outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment is a
violation of international law, no matter where it takes place,''
Hoffman said. ``As more international attention is paid to this
issue, it will be impossible for the government not to start paying
attention.''

RANTS BY STEINBRENNER EARN A FINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The American League announced shortly before the
start of Game 3 Friday night that it had fined George Steinbrenner,
the New York Yankees' principal owner, an undisclosed amount for
``inappropriate comments'' about the umpiring in Game 2 of the
league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Steinbrenner told a crowd of reporters that
Ted Hendry, the plate umpire in the game, was known to be among the
worst umpires in the league, adding that it was ``too bad this
great game had to be decided by a call like that.'' Hendry did not
call interference on a play at first base in the 12th inning of
Game 2; as play continued, the Indians scored the lead run and went
on to win, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre was also critical of Hendry's
umpiring, on balls and strikes calls and on the play at first base,
and Torre, too, might have been fined. But the AL does not
acknowledge or announce fines of on-field personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was generally not in a good mood Wednesday. USA
Today founder Allen Neuharth was quoted in The St. Paul Pioneer
Press as saying that he was in Steinbrenner's private box when
Chuck Knoblauch did not pick up the ball on the disputed bunt play
and that the Yankee owner ranted angrily after the play was
botched. The newspaper quoted Neuharth as saying that he mentioned
to Steinbrenner that he was flying to Minnesota on Thursday, and
Steinbrenner responded by saying he should take Knoblauch with him.
Steinbrenner could not be immediately reached for comment Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's game, Steinbrenner made a point of going to
Knoblauch and telling him to keep his chin up, something the second
baseman said he appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   A Message From Torre
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre held a brief team meeting before Game 3, delivering a
simple and short message that he had been thinking about since his
Yankees lost Game 2 in such a bizarre fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to make sure we go out there and think about
tonight instead of trying to make up for something that happened
the other day,'' Torre said. ``Everything is so consumed with the
umpires, Chuck Knoblauch, and you just can't do anything about
that. Whatever the results were the other day, whoever messed up,
it's over with, and we can't do a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I think managers' meetings are for him, for the
manager. Just so you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden's Game 4 Outlook
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden of Cleveland said Friday that starting the fourth
game of the AL Championship Series is what matters to him, not that
he is pitching against his former team. The Yankees declined to
pick up Gooden's $3 million option for 1999, allowing him to sign
with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you take the mound, they're just another ball club,''
Gooden said about Saturday night's game. ``You might not believe
that, but that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gooden claimed that George Steinbrenner talked to him
about returning this season and that there would have been an
opportunity for him to come back. Even though Gooden said he felt
``it was time to move on,'' the Yankees obviously made that
decision for him by not exercising the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still felt I had a lot to give to that ball club,'' Gooden
said. ``Joe Torre thought differently, which you have to respect;

TO BE THE BEST, STARS MUST BEAT THE BEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can it be hockey season again already?
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only last week that the Stars trudged off the ice
in Detroit, pondering what went wrong and how they would ever stop
it.
</P>
<P>
   It seems like only last week that their ears stopped ringing
from the Joe Louis Arena din that they left behind. Red Wings fans,
the best in hockey, seem to love beating a bunch of
Eddie-Come-Latelies like the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue. While they're out raking leaves and
preparing for hockey season, we're still wearing shorts and
watching TV reports about Mike Modano's backswing. They drive
American cars; we don't even eat American food. They have a higher
per capita rate of guys named Vinny; the Stars' average fan is
named Todd.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that Wings fans don't have anymore: the best team
in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm reading the national hockey magazines and the horoscopes
correctly, that honor now falls to the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cup that comes with it. But like the signs at the
theme parks say _ hold your arm out here _ you must be this good to
ride the roller coaster to the Stanley Cup Finals. And the Stars,
at last, are big enough.
</P>
<P>
   The ride begins tonight, when the best goaltender in the world,
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, pays a timely visit. If the Stars, as
advertised, have solved their modest scoring deficiencies of a year
ago, Hasek will stamp their passports.
</P>
<P>
   A better test would figure to come a few weeks from now when Joe
Nieuwendyk makes his anticipated return to the ice. Injuries, those
good fans in Detroit will tell you, are an unrelenting part of
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Stars' case, losing Nieuwendyk 20 minutes into the
first round of the playoffs was a death blow. It robbed the Stars
of their scoring depth and, instead of strangling foes with
mismatches, it allowed opponents to concentrate on Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Since you brought it up _ that thug Bryan Marchment comes to
town with the San Jose Sharks in two weeks. Where are the Vinnys
when the Stars need them?
</P>
<P>
   It was Marchment, of course, who escorted Nieuwendyk's knee into
the boards at Reunion Arena and might well have changed the course
of the 1997-98 playoffs. But all's well that ends well for Stars
fans. Without Marchment, there might not be a Brett Hull.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stars to make good on all those magazine covers, Hull
will have to have a productive, democratic and, yes, somewhat
unusual season.
</P>
<P>
   Note to coach Ken Hitchcock, heretofore known as Colonel Hitch:
You want Hull to play ``what?''
</P>
<P>
   Hull has played with talented linemates before (See Gretzky,
Wayne). Hull has been asked to play defense before (See Keenan,
Mike). And Hull has never won a Stanley Cup before.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where Colonel Hitch comes in. If he can convince
players like Modano, Nieuwendyk and Pat Verbeek to be ``defensively
responsible'' _ ``suck the offense right out of them,'' as veteran
Craig Ludwig calls it _ maybe Hitch plus peer pressure can make a
happy camper out of Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, simply having Hull on the ice with Modano and Jere
Lehtinen will present daunting matchup problems for most teams. The
Stars' power play prowess also figures to take a quantum leap.
</P>
<P>
   The other new piece to the puzzle is Brent Severyn, the
anti-Marchment. His added contribution may end up being more
noticed than even Hull's.
</P>
<P>
   When appropriately bristled, the Stars can now send out a line
that includes Severyn, last year's playoff hero Brian Skrudland and
Grant Marshall. They should get the ``energy level'' flowing again,
as Hitchcock likes to term it.
</P>
<P>
   Does it add up to the _ trumpets and choir, please _ best team
in hockey?
</P>
<P>
   As defenseman and team captain Derian Hatcher said yesterday, in
signing a new four-year contract, ``This is a great organization
and definitely one of the best in hockey, if not ``the'' best.''
</P>
<P>
   It is. But again, there is no cup that comes with that.
</P>
<P>
   The road to the rainbow still will have to go through Joe Louis
Arena at some point. The king will have to be dethroned before
there's a new king.
</P>
<P>
   It starts tonight with the world's best goalie in town. Hockey
season already?
</P>
<P>
   It's about time.

COLUMBIA CAMPUS SHAKEN BY SUICIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A senior on the dean's list leapt to her death from a
20th-floor window. A troubled engineering student, taking a
semester off, hanged himself in his home on Long Island. A student
at a popular fraternity stabbed himself twice in the chest and
barely survived.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last three weeks, two students at Columbia
University have taken their own lives, and a third tried to. And
while college officials do not believe there is any connection, the
rapid-fire spate of tragedies has shaken the campus, dominated
discussions and the college newspaper and led administrators to
arrange intensive counseling sessions for grieving students.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts say suicide is the second leading cause of
death among college students nationwide, after accidents, Columbia
officials say only one student committed suicide in this decade
before this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a huge shock to a lot of people,'' said Sam
McConnell, a junior from Salt Lake City who had studied last
semester in Paris with Shirley Yoon, the student who jumped to her
death. ``Every week you look in the paper and you see another one.
It's really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have launched a ``massive and extensive
reaction'' to try to comfort grieving students and quell fears that
the suicides may have been linked, said Virgil Renzulli, a
spokesman for the university.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 23, after Ms. Yoon's suicide, officials organized an
emergency meeting in which the resident assistants of her dormitory
were instructed how to help other students cope with the shock and
grief they were experiencing. Counselors also organized two
meetings at the East Campus dormitory where the suicide took place.
The campus Counseling Center opened for extended hours for anyone
who wanted to talk about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ms. Yoon's parents wanted her buried as soon as possible
in accordance with Korean custom, administrators quickly circulated
a telephone message inviting students to Ms. Yoon's memorial
service, where members of a Christian a capella group Ms. Yoon had
belonged to sang two of her favorite hymns.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, the engineering student, Darren Pascual, was
found dead in his parents' home on Long Island. Pascual, 19, had
sent an e-mail to two close friends the night before, detailing his
frustrations. One friend, Hamilton Hayashi, a sophomore, said that
Pascual's message mentioned suicidal thoughts, but in a way that
made Hayashi believe the danger had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Some students, including Hayashi, complained that administrators
did not show the same sensitivity after Pascual's death as they did
for Ms. Yoon. No phone message was circulated, and Hayashi said no
special counseling was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Perez, a sophomore, contended in a letter to The Columbia
Daily Spectator, the student newspaper, that ``the administration
handled the suicide death of Darren Pascual very poorly.'' College
officials denied any insensitivity, saying only that Pascual's
death was handled differently because it occurred off campus.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, even students who did not know Ms.
Yoon or Pascual found themselves frequently discussing the
suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early Sunday morning, paramedics were called to the Beta
Theta Pi house at 550 W. 114th St. Another student, Eric Peel, 22,
had stabbed himself twice in the chest, according to police and The
Columbia Spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Peel entered the hospital in critical condition, but his
condition stabilized overnight. A university spokesman said Peel
has since been released from the hospital and is taking a leave of
absence from the university.
</P>
<P>
   After a traumatic three weeks, students are eager for the
regular rhythms of school to return. James Landrito, a junior who
saw Ms. Yoon's body lying outside his window, said, ``I don't know
if there's something weird going on, or if it's just these isolated
incidents, but I just hope it doesn't happen anymore.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It began one morning 12 years ago, when Matthew, then 24, could
barely crawl out of bed. He persevered at podiatry school in
Chicago for six months while becoming increasingly nervous and
agitated. Finally, he saw a psychiatrist. The diagnosis was chronic
depression, and the doctor wrote a prescription for an
antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Such medications _ Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil are the most widely
used _ have truly been wonder drugs, becoming as much a staple of
daily life as Big Macs or Tylenol as they have helped lift the
gloom from the lives of many of the nearly 18 million Americans who
the National Institute of Mental Health says are affected each year
by depression.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not work for everyone. Matthew, who spoke on the
condition that his last name not be used, is one of about 3.6
million depressed people who doctors say get no help from existing
medications.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $15,000 of his own money on doctor fees and
medication to learn only that lithium is white, Depakote orange and
Prozac yellow and pale green, Matthew, now a medical technician in
Ocean Township, N.J., wonders if he will ever find a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that optimistic that a company can develop a drug that
can help me,'' he said, ``but I'm willing to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   He may not have to wait long. Sometime in the next five years _
perhaps as soon as 2001 _ Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s patents on Prozac will
expire, and Lilly and a half-dozen other giant pharmaceutical
companies are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in the hope
of developing the drug that supplants Prozac as the market leader.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of antidepressants, meanwhile, are expected to reach $8
billion in the United States at about the time Lilly loses its
exclusive rights to Prozac. So, ``there clearly is a lot at stake
here,'' said Bruce L. Downey, the chief executive of Barr
Laboratories, a drug maker involved in a legal fight with Lilly
over the right to produce a generic version of Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Barr's fight with Lilly _ but in a comment that
could refer to the whole, bruising race _ he added, ``I can
guarantee you that in this battle, no stone will be left
unthrown.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not guaranteed that the Next Big Thing in
antidepressants will be a boon for the industry _ or even much help
for people like Matthew. Many industry analysts say they expect
that any new brand-name best seller will be a drug that is no more
effective than Prozac, but simply has fewer side effects. Moreover,
the introduction of generic Prozac may lead cost-cutting managed
health care companies to require doctors to prescribe it rather
than the more expensive antidepressants under development.
</P>
<P>
   Either of those scenarios would fall short of the hopes of many
doctors. To satisfy them, the ultimate antidepressant would work
immediately in every patient, have no side effects and allow
patients to follow simple dosage regimens. It could also be given
to manic-depressives without causing a manic episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are used to taking Tylenol and feeling better shortly
thereafter, not weeks later,'' said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, director
of the National Institute of Mental Health. ``If someone is
suicidal, you may not have weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear which, if any, of the drugs under development will
be Hyman's aspirin for depression. Some drug makers are taking
entirely new approaches to combating depression; the entries from
Novartis, Warner-Lambert and Pfizer are so young they have yet to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, drugs from giant companies are akin to children of
blue-blood families: they tend to succeed even when they are
mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   The market is certainly enormous; this year, sales of
antidepressants in the United States are expected to hit $6.3
billion, according to IMS Health, a health care consulting firm.
Depression costs American businesses $23 billion a year in lost
work time and productivity, according to the National Foundation
for Depressive Illness, making it one of the nation's most
expensive ailments.
</P>
<P>
   It is also one of the most painful. People who cannot be helped
by medication are often forced to live with insomnia, fatigue and a
pervasive feeling of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly's corporate headquarters in Indianapolis is on the front
lines of the antidepressant battle. Walk into just about any
meeting room there, and one is likely to find executives scratching
their heads over how to survive ``Year X'' _ when Prozac loses its
patent protections.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly when that will happen is unclear, because the separate
patents on the drug's chemical makeup and how it works with a
chemical in the brain expire three years apart, beginning in 2001.
Barr Laboratories has applied to the Food and Drug Administration
to make a generic Prozac, and Lilly has sued, contending patent
infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Such legal battles can last for years _ particularly when a
product as valuable as Prozac is at stake. Seldom has one brand
been so central to a company's success. This year, Prozac will
contribute nearly 30 percent of Lilly's estimated $10 billion in
worldwide sales, making it one of the best-selling drugs ever.
</P>
<P>
   To replace the revenue that will be lost once Prozac's patents
expire, Lilly plans to introduce several new drugs, including two
antidepressants and a compound that would relieve the complications
of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of strategies in place to prosper in Year X,''
said Sidney Taurel, Lilly's chief executive. ``The worst scenario
that I'm expecting is for earnings gains to fall into the single
digits during Year X and then climb back to double digits the year
after.''
</P>
<P>
   If the company falls short, however, investors may want a word
with Taurel. Many analysts contend that the race to supplant Prozac
should never have begun. Instead, they say, LIlly should have
maintained its stranglehold by developing a replacement for Prozac
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several pharmaceutical companies have had a problem replacing
the drug that made them famous,'' said Neil Sweig, a
pharmaceuticals analyst with Southeast Research Partners, a
research firm. ``It's a hard thing to do. One thing in Lilly's
favor, though, is that none of the antidepressants that have come
out recently are better than Prozac. This is a fight that is just
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lilly shareholders, the big question is how soon Year X will
arrive. Sweig forecasts that Lilly earnings will rise to $2.958
billion in 2000, up nearly 70 percent, excluding extraordinary
charges, from last year's levels. If Prozac has no generic
competition in 2001, he says, Lilly's earnings will increase 16
percent in 2001 and 15 percent more in 2002.

TOLEDO GETS WISH BUT COULD REGRET IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ When Arizona quarterback Ortege Jenkins vaulted
past Washington last Saturday with one of the most dramatic plays
in Pac-10 history, there was joy in Westlake Village.
</P>
<P>
   One of the community's most prominent residents, UCLA coach Bob
Toledo, was rooting for Arizona. Toledo, it seems, is a sucker for
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping Arizona would win,'' Toledo said. ``I
wanted to get to this point. I love the excitement. I love the big
games.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got one.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 UCLA and No. 10 Arizona collide tonight in Arizona
Stadium, marking the first time in seven years a conference game
has featured two top-10 teams. Rarely are stakes higher in early
October. The winner stays within range of the Fiesta Bowl and takes
a massive stride toward the Rose Bowl _ especially if it's Arizona
(5-0), which has its toughest games at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could run the table after this,'' UCLA quarterback Cade
McNown said. ``The road to the Rose Bowl or an undefeated season
runs through Tucson.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-suffering Wildcats watchers _ Arizona is the only
conference team which has never played in the Rose Bowl postseason
_ are calling tonight's game the biggest sporting event in Tucson
history not named the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 36 hours after Jenkins' improbable vault, Arizona
sold 5,839 game tickets, a single-day record. Game-related stories
have run on the front pages of both local papers, next to reports
on the stock market and impeachment proceedings. A massive
billboard on Interstate 10, perhaps the best advertising space in
town, bellows: ``Bring on the Bruins.'' Screen savers on corporate
office computers read, ``UCLA sucks.''
</P>
<P>
   For this week, at least, Tucson is a football town.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest game of the year, maybe in school
history,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's school-record winning streak, now at 13 games, is in
unprecedented jeopardy. The Bruins (3-0) are without their big-play
receiver (Freddie Mitchell), their starting tailback (Jermaine
Lewis) and their best defensive lineman (Kenyon Coleman). McNown is
slightly off his game. The defense has just three senior starters
and a slew of injuries at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a defining game for both teams, definitely for us,'' said
Bruins receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, a Tucson native. ``Our
competition has been mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the Bruins have not played well in Arizona
Stadium. Actually, that's not quite true. They've been awful _
outplayed, outcoached, often laughed out of town. They've lost four
consecutive games in Tucson by a combined 134-51, and in several
instances weren't beaten so much as beaten up. Rushing yards tell
no lies and the Wildcats have outrushed UCLA by 1,064-227.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, we haven't matched their physicalness,'' said
longtime Bruins assistant Bob Field.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Wildcats made a game-week switch to the power-I
formation, rushed for 480 yards and handed UCLA its worst loss in
10 years, 42-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats literally broke UCLA in 1992, fracturing Arnold
Ale's leg and cracking Sean LaChapelle's ribs. Trailing 23-0, the
Bruins kicked an 18-yard field goal with a minute remaining to
preserve their 243-game scoring streak, an NCAA record.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA avoided embarrassment in 1994 and '96, losing by 10 and 18
points, respectively. The '96 meeting was especially tough, with
Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister _ son of ex-Bruin James
McAlister and a former recruit _ returning a kickoff 100 yards to
secure the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical thing is to come out early _ we don't have to
dominate, but we have to play sound, smart football and not get in
a hole in an atmosphere like that,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister's back this week after a one-game, NCAA-imposed
suspension for accepting an improper $14,000 loan from a Texas
bank. He and linebacker Marcus Bell lead a defense that compensates
for its lack of size with speed and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these Wildcats better than past versions is their
playmakers: receivers Jeremy McDaniel and Dennis Northcutt,
tailback Trung Canidate, and quarterbacks Ortege Jenkins and Keith
Smith, the Newbury Park native.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, Smith and Jenkins have better numbers than McNown, and
they are just as dangerous with their feet as their arms.
Containing the quarterbacks _ along with limiting turnovers and
controlling the tempo with its rushing game _ are UCLA's
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best Arizona team I've seen in a long
time,'' Toledo said. ``In the past, they had really good defense.
But you knew if you scored a couple or three touchdowns, you had a
chance to win. That's changed. They have a really good offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Which bring us to the moral of this story: Be careful what you
wish for.

 UNDATED: in 2002.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if generics are able to eat away 50 percent of Prozac's
sales, Sweig says Lilly's earnings will be flat in 2001 before
falling about 15 percent a year later.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Prozac in 1988 ushered in a new class of
drugs that were much more effective and had fewer side effects than
older antidepressants like Elavil and Tofranil. The new drugs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, bolster
serotonin, a brain chemical believed to be deficient in some
depressed people.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs they largely displaced, a class called tricyclics, had
operated by bolstering the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine
in the brain but sometimes caused severe side effects.
</P>
<P>
   No one, including Lilly's top executives, could have predicted
Prozac's effect on the world. In less than 10 years, it played a
huge role in making depression a socially acceptable illness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, only 130.7 million prescriptions were written in the
United States for psychotherapeutics, which include antidepressants
and antipsychotic and anti-anxiety drugs. Prozac, or fluoxetine
hydrochloride, had 1.45 million of the total, according to IMS
Health. By last year, the category had expanded to 232.6 million
prescriptions, with Prozac contributing 9.88 million.
</P>
<P>
   With that success, it appears, it was easy for Lilly to get
complacent. ``It is a valid criticism that we have a gap in our
pipeline,'' said Dr. August M. Watanabe, executive vice president
for science and technology at Lilly. ``But the reason we call
Prozac's expiration Year X is because we are not certain when it
is. And we may have plenty of time to develop new drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilly has several options to protect Prozac's market, but none
are easy. Industry analysts have long expected the company to
license a new version of Prozac from Sepracor Inc., a specialty
pharmaceutical company in Marlborough, Mass., known for improving
existing drugs largely by eliminating their side effects. Such a
deal, analysts say, could secure Lilly's franchise, minimizing any
potential loss of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly's chief executive, Taurel, declined to discuss the
likelihood of an agreement with Sepracor, and Sepracor officials
also declined, perhaps because no alliance is in the offing. Last
week, David P. Southwell, Sepracor's chief financial officer, said
the company was pondering several options for its purified form of
Prozac. Sepracor itself might market the drug, for example, or
license it to one of Lilly's rivals, including Schering-Plough or
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 65 salespeople now,'' Southwell said. ``We didn't have
any two months ago. When we looked at the revenue stream _ we try
to get royalties from our products instead of taking cash up front
_ we discovered we'd make more money selling it with this little
sales force than if we licensed it to another company. But we are
studying several possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem for Lilly is Barr's challenge on the
Prozac patents. If Barr is successful, it will be allowed to sell a
generic version of the drug exclusively for six months before other
competitors can crowd in. Downey expects generic Prozac to take 75
percent of the brand's sales _ about $2.25 billion _ in those first
six months on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Taurel dismissed the notion that Lilly could lose Prozac's
patents before 2003. But if he thought he might lose to Barr in
court, he probably could afford to buy himself a little leeway.
Because Barr is relatively tiny, with only $377 million in annual
sales, analysts have long speculated that Lilly could settle the
dispute, giving Barr a cash payment of $50 million or so and the
right to make generic Prozac sometime before 2003, but not as soon
as if Barr had prevailed in court.
</P>
<P>
   However, a settlement appears unlikely. Downey, who spent 25
years as a trial lawyer, said on Friday: ``My goal is to win and
launch. If there is a settlement, that will be up to the other
side.'' Taurel declined to comment on any of these possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Any deal-making that sustains Prozac's hold on the marketplace
could leave many psychiatrists dissatisfied. Although doctors
generally agree that SSRIs are the best antidepressants yet, they
have complaints about every drug in the category _ Prozac in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   Paxil, by SmithKline Beecham; Zoloft, Pfizer's entry in the
category, and Celexa, a new SSRI by Warner-Lambert and Forest
Laboratories, can take as long as five weeks to take full effect.
Prozac can, too _ but it takes as long as four weeks to wash out of
a patient's bloodstream after use is discontinued, meaning that
doctors must wait that long before prescribing another drug. Prozac
can also cause anxiety at first use.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, all four drugs, which together control about 96
percent of the American antidepressant market, can cause sexual
dysfunction. Adding to that misery, SSRIs have no therapeutic
effect in 20 percent of all cases and cannot be safely mixed with
several other commonly used medications.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac ``has not always been effective with people on either end
of the scale, the ones who are barely impaired and those who are
very ill,'' said Dr. Donald Klein, director of research at the New
York State Psychiatric Institute. ``But Prozac is very effective
with people in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Few drug makers can afford to stumble in the race for a new
best-selling antidepressant. Investors have come to expect
quarterly earnings gains of 20 percent or higher from the big
pharmaceutical companies, leaving little room to write off hundreds
of millions of dollars in research and development costs for a drug
that does not work.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such losses, drug companies typically try to develop
multiple uses for a single compound. The trailblazer is this regard
was Glaxo Wellcome's antidepressant Wellbutrin, which last year
also began sales as Zyban, a smoking-cessation medication.
</P>
<P>
   With Prozac coming off patent, Lilly has learned to play this
game, too. One of its two new antidepressants is also under
development as a treatment for incontinence, an ailment that
appears to be medically unrelated. The drug, duloxetine, is
expected to be released in 2001 as an anti-incontinence pill and a
year later as an antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Some Lilly rivals say that the plans for duloxetine are a sign
of desperation _ that it is a lackluster antidepressant being
trotted out to market only because the company lacked a more
formidable replacement for Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly officials acknowledge that they took another look at
duloxetine because of the approach of Year X, but they say the
later, more accurate tests proved the drug a more effective
antidepressant than had been originally believed.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly says it also hopes that duloxetine will take effect more
quickly than Prozac. But it is unlikely to be as popular. Watanabe
described duloxetine as similar to Effexor, the new antidepressant
of American Home Products. Yet, Effexor has earned less than 4
percent of the national antidepressant market since its
introduction in 1993.

 UNDATED: in 1993.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem, doctors say, is that when patients are satisfied
with an antidepressant they often refuse to switch, even to
something that is better.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly's other new antidepressant is a combination of Prozac and
Zyprexa, its enormously successful antipsychotic drug. In a pilot
study of 30 people who had been treated unsuccessfully with two
antidepressants, one group received Prozac, another was given a
placebo and a third group was given the Prozac-Zyprexa combination.
The group receiving the combination had a sharply higher response,
Lilly discovered, than those who had been given Prozac alone or a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   But the FDA gives closer scrutiny to any combination of drugs
because of possible interactions, so combining Zyprexa with Prozac
could invite regulatory delay.
</P>
<P>
   Two other drugs under development appear to offer more hope of
being the kind of compound desired by both market analysts and
doctors. Merck and Novartis are among the companies working on one
of them, which would introduce a completely new class of
antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of raising levels of certain chemicals in the brain, as
the SSRIs and other antidepressants do, this type of drug blocks
receptors of a chemical, known as Substance P, that is believed to
affect depression. Scientists discovered that by blocking the
Substance P receptors, they might treat everything from migranes to
anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In the initial phases of trials on humans, Merck's drug has
shown promising results. In a recent six-week study, 213 people
with moderate to severe depression were given the Substance P
blocker, a placebo or Paxil. Merck's drug reduced depression as
effectively as Paxil, without many of the side effects _ notably
sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a novel way of treating depression, but we are still in
the early days of the program,'' said Dr. Scott Reines, vice
president for clinical research at Merck. ``It's too early to tell
if it will work with severely depressed people. And there's no way
we can say when it will be coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   The other contender appears to be Sepracor's new purified Prozac
compound, even though some doctors are skeptical about its
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The drug has two enormous advantages: It will always be known as
improved Prozac, regardless of which company sells it. And it has a
better chance of approval by the FDA, given that the original
version of Prozac has been safely administered to millions of
patients in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it will be have a quicker wash-out and
substantially less drug-to-drug interaction,'' Southwell, the
Sepracor official, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company that develops the next big antidepressant
must be able to sell it. Sepracor's sales force of 65 is hardly
competition for Lilly's troop of 2,400.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the FDA is permitting direct-to-consumer advertisements
of prescription drugs, any major pharmaceutical company could drum
up a market for a new antidepressant with a big advertising
campaign. Sepracor lacks the deep pockets for that, but Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and Schering-Plough, with which Sepracor may reach a
licensing deal, are both shrewd television marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Schering used television ads to build a market for its Claritin
antihistamine, which is expected to have $3 billion in sales this
year, with 58 percent of the American antihistamine market. Johnson
&AMP; Johnson is one of the best known and respected consumer brands in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, by contrast, with far less background in consumer
marketing, ran its first television ads on depression two months
ago. But Taurel says he is ready to take more risks and may
advertise more ot its wares where appropriate, to prop up Lilly's
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are watching the corporate dogfight with amusement.
Lilly had no clue that Prozac would be such an enormous success,
and the owner of the next giant antidepressant will probably not
instantly grasp the full value of its test-tube contents, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may never know where the next antidepressant may come
from,'' Hyman said. ``So don't be so leery of a drug that is an
antidepressant now when it was originally created to treat
something else. One of the first antidepressants, iproniazid, was
originally invented to treat tuberculosis.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Plenty of sound and fury emanated from the stock
market this week. What does it signify? In one of the more
tumultuous weeks on record, the Dow Jones industrial average ended
at 7,899.52, up just 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of a move on the week. But investors stomached enormous
swings. On Thursday, the Dow fell 274 points before clawing its way
back. It jumped 167.61 points on Friday, or 2.17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Does the end-of-the-week about-face represent a real turning
point? Or is it just another sucker's rally?
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, highly intelligent market observers who
will argue that the gloom has just begun, while others say the
worst is over. The truth, of course, is unknowable. But after a
volatile week, tallying the good news and the bad may be in order.
</P>
<P>
   What is hurting the stock market? The big fear, though not news,
is that corporate profits will disappoint or even plunge later this
year and in 1999. Since earnings drive stock prices, this is a
grave concern. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index is trading at
approximately 23 times earnings, well down from its peak of 28, but
still high historically.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other key props have recently been kicked out from
under the stock market. A big one: support from foreign buyers.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the dollar was strong against foreign currencies,
United States stocks looked attractive to foreign investors. They
poured $116.1 billion into equities in the first three months of
1998; in the second quarter, they bought only $55.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the dollar in free fall, foreigners are almost
certainly fleeing American markets. Japanese investors in both
stocks and bonds, for example, are big losers, thanks to their
strengthening currency.
</P>
<P>
   Since Aug. 21, when the 30-year Treasury bond began its big move
up, the dollar has lost 19 percent against the yen, more than
wiping out the roughly 9 percent a bondholder would have made in
the period. In those months, the Dow lost 7.5 percent. With the
dollar down 9 percent against the mark, German investors are also
hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the downturn in stocks are the beginnings
of what may be a severe credit contraction. The titanic borrowings
of hedge funds are only just beginning to be unwound.
</P>
<P>
   As these and other speculators _ including individual investors
who are heavily leveraged in their stock holdings _ are forced to
come up with more cash as collateral, they will be forced to sell
positions in which they may have profits. This could knock down
big-name stocks that are still up for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the positives. Investors are no longer eager to buy
whenever stocks drop. Ridding the market of complacency is good.
</P>
<P>
   Other excesses are getting flushed out of the system. Hedge
funds _ this bull market's version of the investors in 1929 who
borrowed to buy stocks at 10 cents on the dollar _ are being
clipped. They have been a destabilizing force in the markets;
eliminating some will be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The weaker dollar has benefits, too. It will help make the
exports of American companies more affordable overseas, possibly
bolstering corporate profits. A strong Japanese yen, meanwhile,
will forestall the potential for another deadly round of currency
devaluations in the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   If the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond continues to
strengthen against shorter-term notes, as it did at the end of the
week, that could aid the market, too.
</P>
<P>
   Banks now can lend at rates that are considerably higher than
their borrowing costs. Since banks have led the market both up and
down this year, a turnaround there will have an upbeat effect over
all.
</P>
<P>
   Economic gloom and doom on mass-market magazine covers is
another good sign. When these folks discover a bull or bear market,
the trend is usually about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McClellan, editor of the McClellan Market Report in
Lakewood, Wash., finds today's market strikingly similar to that of
1988-91. Stock prices, he says, are ``in the neighborhood'' of a
bottom. He also says that since 1940, stocks have typically hit
their depths around midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means, of course, that we are out of the woods.
Indeed, at week's end, the average New York Stock Exchange stock
was down 40 percent from the July peak; the average NASDAQ stock
was down 55 percent. Yet favorite stocks like Dell Computer,
Microsoft and Intel were still well off their lows. This suggests
some downside ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bear markets usually end with a thunder clap, on a day of
panic selling and investor exhaustion. Such a day has not yet
happened. When it does, hello bulls.

</P>
<P>
   The annual income-tax deadline _ the real one _ is at hand. On
Thursday, a few million citizens will have to file 1997 returns,
their six-month free ride at an end.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, the Internal Revenue Service publicizes a taxpayer's
right to apply for a four-month extension past April 15, a request
rarely denied. Some 7 million took advantage of the provision this
year, up from 6.4 million in 1997 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Not as well known is that these late filers can just as easily
get another two months, until Oct. 15. The IRS has no estimate of
the number who did that this year, but there were 2.3 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   For many of the late filers, the extension amounts to a free
loan from Uncle Sam, as long as they have paid at least 90 percent
of their taxes in withholding or installments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, if you've paid 90 percent of your tax liability,
there's no penalty or interest'' due on the remainder paid by Oct.
15, said Terry Lemons, an IRS spokesman. &QL;

building some strongly materialistic desires.
</P>
<P>
   Yankelovich Partners, working for the Phoenix Home Life Mutual
Insurance Co., interviewed 1,262 students aged 12 to 21 in
households with at least one parent earning $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 57 percent expect to be wealthier than
their parents, up from 52 percent in a 1996 survey. Moreover, only
18 percent expect that they will have to work harder than their
parents to achieve that wealth.
</P>
<P>
   On average, college students in the survey expect an annual
starting salary of $36,000, up from $32,000 in 1997; 18 percent
expect $50,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   As for money and the comforts it can secure, 35 percent agreed
that ``being able to buy what you want'' is a very important
objective in adulthood, up from 31 percent in 1996; 15 percent said
the same about ``having a million dollars,'' up from 11 percent;
and 8 percent said it of ``owning an expensive car,'' up from 5
percent. Not all impulses were focused on the self: 41 percent said
that ``giving money to charity'' is very important, up from 36
percent two years ago.

CIA SAID TO IGNORE CHARGES OF CONTRA DRUG DEALING IN '80S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects name of CIA director to ROBERT, not William, in 8th graf;
adds 3 grafs to end with details of information ignored by CIA.)  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite requests for information from Congress, the
CIA repeatedly ignored or failed to investigate allegations of drug
trafficking by the anti-Sandinista rebels of Nicaragua in the
1980s, according to a newly declassified internal report.
</P>
<P>
   In a blunt and often critical report, the CIA's inspector
general determined that the agency ``did not inform Congress of all
allegations or information it received indicating that
contra-related organizations or individuals were involved in drug
trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1986, the subject of contra drug trafficking became
a focus for critics of the Reagan administration's policy toward
Nicaragua who charged that the CIA was shielding drug smugglers to
protect its anti-Communist covert action program in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   That year Congress imposed a fund cutoff for any contra group
that had members involved in drug trafficking. Despite that ban,
the CIA failed to tell Congress about allegations it had received
against at least eight individuals with contra ties.
</P>
<P>
   During the time the ban on funds was in effect, the CIA informed
Congress only about drug charges against two other contra-related
people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the agency failed to tell other executive branch
agencies, including the Justice Department, about drug allegations
against 11 contra-related individuals or entities.
</P>
<P>
   The report quotes many active and retired CIA officers who
served in Central America as saying they either did not hear or did
not believe allegations of drug trafficking involving the contra
rebels, with whom they worked closely. It also makes clear that the
agency did little or nothing to investigate most of the drug
allegations that it heard about the contras and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1987, the acting director of central intelligence,
Robert Gates, wrote in a memorandum that it was ``absolutely
imperative that this agency and our operations in Central America
avoid any kind of involvement with individuals or companies that
are even suspected of involvement in narcotics trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   The CIA investigation that began almost a decade later, however,
found no evidence that the memorandum was distributed to anyone
other than Gates' deputy for operations, Clair George.
</P>
<P>
   The new study is the second volume of the CIA's internal
investigation prompted by a 1996 series of articles in The San Jose
Mercury-News, which claimed that a ``dark alliance'' between the
CIA, the contras and drug traffickers had helped finance the contra
war with millions of dollars in profits from drug smuggling. The
series also alleged that this network was the first to introduce
crack cocaine into South Central Los Angeles. The first volume of
the CIA inspector general's report, issued in January, dealt
primarily with the specific allegations raised by the Mercury-News
series and dismissed the newspaper's central findings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the second volume is the result of a broader inquiry into
long- unresolved questions about the contra program and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the inspector general's report found that the CIA had
received allegations of drug involvement by 58 contras or others
linked to the contra program. These included 14 pilots and two
others tied to the contra program's CIA-backed air transportation
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The report indicates that information linking the contras to
drugs began to emerge almost as soon as the contras came into
existence _ and before it became publicly known that the CIA was
supporting their effort to overthrow the Marxist-led government in
Managua.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1981, as a small group of rebels was being formed
from former soldiers in the National Guard of the deposed
Nicaraguan dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, a CIA informant
reported that the leadership of the fledgling group had decided to
smuggle drugs to the United States to support its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months later, another report indicated that one prominent
leader of the group, Justiniano Perez, was a close friend of a
known trafficker.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's response also set something of a pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``No information has been found to indicate any action to follow
up or corroborate the allegations,'' the report said. ``
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it said, it found no information that the CIA
followed up on FBI information about the Perez matter.
</P>
<P>
   The omissions of information were often glaring.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, for example, Alan Fiers, then chief of the CIA's
Central American task force dealing with the contras, responded to
questions raised by Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., about specific contra
members and contra-related companies. According to the report,
Fiers responded to Kerry's questions about a contra logistics
coordinator named Felipe Vidal by providing a sheet of information
about his convictions for illegal possession of firearms in the
1970s, but without any mention of Vidal's arrests and conviction
for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that in at least six instances, the CIA knew
about allegations regarding individuals or organizations but that
knowledge did not deter it from continuing to employ them. In some
other cases, the agency decided the allegations were not
substantiated.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AGSENATE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Tuesday approved a $56 billion agricultural spending
bill by a vote of 55-43. The bill, which was vetoed by President
Clinton on Wednesday, would have provided funding for agriculture
and rural development programs and the Food and Drug
Administration. The measure included a Republican plan to send $4.1
billion in emergency aid to farmers suffering from low commodity
prices and severe weather. Supporters said the bill would provide
necessary funding for farmers without negating the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Act, which eliminated crop subsidies. Opponents, including
Clinton, said the bill does not sufficiently address the dire
situation of farmers. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: HOUSING
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Thursday approved, 96-1, a $70 billion public housing
and veterans benefits spending bill. The bill would allow families
with incomes of up to $40,000 a year to be eligible for public
housing support. Supporters said the bill would expand
opportunities for families to get housing, as well as sufficiently
fund veterans' programs. No senator spoke in opposition. A ``yes''
vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday voted 96-2 to impose a three-year
moratorium that would prohibit local governments from taxing the
Internet until a national plan on cyber-taxation can be developed.
Supporters said the moratorium would protect the burgeoning
electronic commerce industry from being squashed under layers of
tax regulations. No members rose in opposition to the bill. A
``yes'' vote favors the Internet tax bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AGHOUSE
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Oct. 2, the House approved a $56 billion agricultural
spending bill by a vote of 333-53. The bill, which was vetoed by
President Clinton on Wednesday, would have provided funding for
agriculture and rural development programs and the Food and Drug
Administration. The measure included a Republican plan to send $4.1
billion in emergency aid to farmers suffering from low commodity
prices and severe weather. Supporters said the bill would provide
necessary funding for farmers without negating the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Act, which eliminated crop subsidies. Opponents, including
Clinton, said the bill does not sufficiently address the dire
situations of farmers. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: CIA
</P>
<P>
   The House Wednesday approved, 337-83, an intelligence
authorization bill for a classified amount. The measure would fund
the Central Intelligence Agency and other intelligence activities.
It would also name the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., after
former President George Bush, a former CIA director. Supporters
said there is a need for continued intelligence surveillance in the
post-Cold War era, especially considering the significant
downsizing of the military. Opponents said the bill changes the
legal grounds for wire-tapping in a way that violates privacy
rights. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: TREASURY
</P>
<P>
   The House Wednesday approved, 290-137, a $13.4 billion measure
that would fund the Treasury Department, the U.S. Postal Service,
the Executive Office of the President and other agencies.
Supporters called the bill a solid measure and a necessary
compromise. Opponents said the measure was weakened by the removal
of four controversial provisions that would have given green cards
to 40,000 Haitian refugees, set standards for federal child care
facilities, required term limits of the top two officials at the
Federal Election Commission and extended federal government
employee's health benefits to cover prescription birth control. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: DEMIMPEACH
</P>
<P>
   The House Thursday rejected, 198-236, a Democratic proposal to
end the impeachment inquiry of President Clinton by December 31,
unless Congress voted to extend it. The measure also would have
limited the investigation's scope to the current referral, or any
subsequent referrals, from the independent counsel's office.
Supporters of the proposal said it is in the best interest of the
country to bring a quick resolution to the review and also argued
that the broad Republican proposal could become an unending fishing
expedition. Opponents said seeking out the truth should not be
limited by the time or scope of the investigation. A ``yes'' vote
favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: IMPEACH
</P>
<P>
   The House Thursday approved, 258-176, a resolution to begin an
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton. Thirty-one Democrats and
227 Republicans voted to approve an open-ended investigation.
Supporters of the probe said the president was not above the law
and should be held accountable if he lied under oath in either the
Paula Jones civil deposition or before a grand jury. Democratic
opponents had argued for quick resolution to the probe with a
deadline of December 31. Opponents also said the president's
behavior was immoral, but not impeachable. A ``yes'' vote favors
the inquiry.

TUCSON IN THROES OF FOOTBALL FRENZY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ With Tucson in the grip of football fever,
something like this was bound to happen.
</P>
<P>
   A University of Arizona student, one Kimberly Ann Bissel,
waiting in line with hundreds of fans Monday morning to buy tickets
for tonight's game against UCLA, fainted in the heat and conked her
head on a cactus.
</P>
<P>
   I don't make 'em up. This desert drama was reported by the
Arizona Daily Star newspaper alongside a photograph of the
prostrate Kimberly and the unbowed cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, for suffering the pain of a cactus needle in the ear,
Kimberly got her tickets, thanks to some neighbors in line who
brought them to her at the hospital. So now she can be one of
57,803 fans at Arizona Stadium for the game between the
third-ranked Bruins and the 10th-ranked Wildcats, Arizona's first
sellout in two years.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's a big game for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are their national-championship hopes and their Rose
Bowl hopes. It's their first Top 10 vs. Top 10 matchup since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   To be just as sure, it's an even bigger game for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are their national-championship hopes (unlike UCLA,
they've never won) and their Rose Bowl hopes (unlike UCLA, they've
never gone). It would be their 10th straight victory, the longest
winning streak in Arizona history.
</P>
<P>
   All that, plus the wonderment created by quarterback Ortege
Jenkins' head-over-heels vault to the winning touchdown with four
seconds left in last Saturday's road game against 20th-ranked
Washington, caused a ticket-buying frenzy that saw an
Arizona-record 5,839 sold on Monday alone.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred customers were in line when the McKale Center
ticket windows opened at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's also ``Family Weekend'' on campus, so the town is packed,
all the hotel rooms and rental cars for miles around are spoken
for, and ``it's pretty jacked up around here,'' an athletic
department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   On top of which, somebody in the sports information office had
the idea of asking all the fans to wear red to the game, copying
the Phoenix Coyotes' ``whiteouts'' and Arizona basketball's
``red-outs.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins expect this to be something like the trip to
Houston last month, they're in for a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the biggest game of the year, maybe in the history
of the school,'' Jenkins said this week.
</P>
<P>
   And so the biggest reason to worry for UCLA, which would win the
game on paper, is that the big crowd and the atmosphere will
inspire the Wildcats to play over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans are right on top of you. They're loud behind their
Wildcats,'' said UCLA receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, a Tucson native.
``The town will be hyped. It's a smaller town. It's a college town.
The whole town backs the team.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand, you have to know about Tucson, beyond the killer
cactus. It's a true college town, its population of 350,000 making
it one of the nation's biggest cities to have a university but no
professional sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of place where the head football coach writes a
weekly column in the local newspaper and donates his fee to the
Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of place where the paper reports with unabashed
pride that Sports Illustrated is staffing Saturday's game. Now,
!ital!that's!off! exciting, like the week the truck from Fort Knox
went through Mayberry.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the kind of place where the sports information director
is only too happy to give an out-of-town reporter he hasn't met the
home telephone number of the head football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, just from our conference perspective, it's a very
important game,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is 5-0 overall and 2-0 in the Pacific-10. (UCLA is 3-0
and 1-0.) After this, the Wildcats face one more top-25 opponent,
15th-ranked Oregon on Oct.31, and that's at home.
</P>
<P>
   If they win tonight, the hard part is over. So this is
make-or-break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the people are excited, but our players have done a
great job of keeping their nose to the grindstone,'' Tomey said.
``It's exciting for us, but it's also sobering, because we know
we're playing the best team we'll see all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our crowd is great and will be great, but I think our
players would be up for the game if they were playing in the
Safeway parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the school with the most at stake might be neither
UCLA nor Arizona but Miami, which probably is rooting for the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA wins tonight, it will have its Top 10 scalp, a big step
toward a national title, and little incentive to reschedule the
game that was canceled because of Hurricane Georges. If UCLA loses
tonight, it might agree to make up that game in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There, the fans are safe from cactus but should look out for
falling coconuts.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Budget negotiations faltered Friday, prompting
Congress to delay until midnight Monday its deadline for passing a
spending bill to keep the government open.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders vowed they would not let the government shut
down. At the same time, many rank-and-file members of Congress,
suffering from impeachment fatigue and anxious to get home to
campaign for the Nov. 3 elections, fled Capitol Hill temporarily
Friday night in an acknowledgment that any resolution was in the
hands of Republican leaders and the White House. They are subject
to return at the call of their leaders to vote on a final package,
probably not before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the chairmen of the spending committees and Republican
leaders engaged in on-and-off negotiations with the White House.
The two sides met twice Friday and were working Friday night, but
little overt progress was made on the spending bills as the process
devolved into a political blame game, with each side trying to
control the message that goes out to voters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said that Republicans were not providing
enough money for his education initiatives, including measures to
hire teachers and repair schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This budget is purely and simply a test of whether after nine
months of doing nothing, we are going to do the right thing about
our children's future,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, responded that he was astounded to see the president on
television complaining about Republicans when the White House had
failed to propose cuts in domestic spending to make up for the
billions of dollars that the president was seeking for his own
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were keenly aware that the president had
successfully blamed them for previous government shutdowns, in 1995
and 1996, and were determined Friday not to let that happen again.
</P>
<P>
   As the negotiations stalled, Livingston asserted, ``There's not
going to be a shutdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were responding not only to the president but to
a prevailing sense on Capitol Hill that their leaders were giving
in to the administration's demands behind the scenes in order to
make a quick break from Washington and leave with the political
focus on the impending impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats appeared more eager to draw out the endgame and were
advancing the view that Republicans, in their haste to capitalize
on the president's woes in their re-election campaigns, were being
careless about the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're cutting out on everything because they want to get out
of here,'' said Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass. ``The impeachment stuff
has been draining on the whole institution. It's been sucking all
the air out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., emerged from a closed-door meeting
of her colleagues saying she was ``disappointed that the president
has put us on the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   But really, said Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, a member of the
Republican leadership, Republicans ``want to stay here and work,
work, work.''
</P>
<P>
   A top Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
put the message in plain English: ``We're not going to give them
the ability to say it's our fault.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But that is precisely the message that Clinton and Democratic
leaders tried to convey, portraying the Republicans as blocking
bills concerning health care, campaign finance and the minimum
wage, even though these measures are not directly related to the 13
must-pass spending bills that keep the government going.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of those bills have been signed into law. Four others
have been sent to the president, and he has vetoed one. The current
negotiations are over several contentious items in the remaining
seven bills, which are likely to be wrapped up into one big omnibus
bill and presented to the president next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate added to that bloated omnibus Friday by killing the
bill financing the Treasury Department and U.S. Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and Republicans continued to work on a
compromise that would provide the International Monetary Fund with
$18 billion to replenish accounts depleted by economic bailouts in
Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's deadline extension, which Clinton signed Friday night,
is the second that Congress has sought in two weeks. The first took
Congress through Friday night, even though the new fiscal year
began Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Friday, the House approved, 300-125, legislation
overhauling the bankruptcy code, but the legislation still faced
the threat of a veto from the White House and opposition from
Senate Democrats who said it failed to rein in abusive credit card
lending and marketing practices. Friday night, however, Democrats
withdrew a filibuster threat that would have killed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. said the Democrats had relented
after Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, told them he would not
pass the freestanding bill but instead try to include it in the
omnibus spending measure needed to end the congressional session.

   MARYLAND VS. CLEMSON
</P>
<P>
   When, where: Today, noon, Memorial Stadium, Clemson, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Clemson leads 24-20-2.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Maryland 2-3, 0-2 ACC; Clemson 1-4, 0-3 ACC.
</P>
<P>
   Game notes: The Tigers, who celebrate homecoming, have won nine
of the last 10 meetings in the series, while Maryland last won in
Death Valley in 1985. . . . Both seek their first conference wins.
. . . Clemson has lost just two homecoming games in the last 27
years. . . . Clemson's Antwan Edwards is fifth in the nation in
kickoff returns, averaging 37 yards per attempt. . . . All of
Maryland's losses have been to Top 20 teams: Florida State,
Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH VS. NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   When, where: Today, 1:30 p.m., Kenan Stadium, Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Tied 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Pittsburgh 2-2; North Carolina 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   Game notes: The Tar Heels, who finally won a game last week
against Clemson, play their last non-conference game. . . .
Although sixth in the ACC in total offense, freshman QB Ron Curry
was replaced last week by ailing senior Oscar Davenport, who guided
UNC's comeback victory. . . . Once the pride of its defense, the
Tar Heel secondary currently ranks last against the pass in the
ACC, giving up an average of 144 yards per game, and has just two
interceptions. . . . UNC's chief offensive problem is rushing,
which is dead last in the ACC at 94.5 yards.

</P>
<P>
   When, where: Today, 3:30 p.m., Orange Bowl, Miami

</P>
<P>
   Records: Florida State 4-1; Miami 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Game notes: The Seminoles have won their last four, while Miami
is coming off an unexpected off-week following the postponement of
a scheduled home game with UCLA due to Hurricane Georges. . . .
Last year in Tallahassee, FSU romped to a 47-0 win, its third
straight over the Hurricanes. The Seminoles have won those games by
an average of 29.7 points. . . . FSU committed nine turnovers in
its first two games but has turned the ball over just twice in its
last three outings. . . . The Seminoles were limited to just one
touchdown and five field goals in a 24-10 win at Maryland last
week.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE VS. WAKE FOREST
</P>
<P>
   When, where: Today, 6:30 p.m., Groves Stadium, Winston-Salem,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Duke leads 51-25-2.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Duke 2-3, 0-3 ACC; Wake Forest 2-2, 1-0 ACC.
</P>
<P>
   Game notes: The Deacons are coming off a loss last week to
Division I-AA Appalachian State, while the Blue Devils absorbed a
record 21st consecutive ACC loss at Georgia Tech. . . . Wake has
beaten Duke each of the last two years. . . . Wake's passing
offense ranks (236 yards a game) only behind that of N.C. State and
Florida State in the ACC, but the Deacons are last in third down
conversions, making just 24 of 63 opportunities.

 &HT;    On deck for NLCS Game 3
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   -- When: 4:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   -- Where: Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   -- Radio/TV: Channel 5, WSB 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   -- Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (18-9, 2.22 ERA;
18-9, 2.72 lifetime vs. Padres) vs. LHP Sterling Hitchcock (9-7,
3.93; 0-1, 5.65 lifetime vs. Braves.)
</P>
<P>
   -- Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 272-216 and
won its eighth straight season series 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   -- Past meetings: The Braves were 1-2 at Qualcomm Stadium this
season, the first losing record the club has accumulated there
since going 4-5 in 1991. Since the Padres joined the league,
Atlanta has a 130-115 record in San Diego, going 36-30 the past 10
years. In the Braves' only visit to Qualcomm this season, the
Padres beat Denny Neagle and Maddux on successive nights (Aug.
11-12), Maddux losing 5-1 to Andy Ashby. Tom Glavine averted the
sweep Aug. 13 in a 5-0 victory over Mark Langston. Atlanta managed
to outscore the Padres 33-29 and out-homer San Diego 11-6 over the
season. All the Padres' victories came against Atlanta starters.
</P>
<P>
   -- Padres leaders: Avg. _ Tony Gwynn (.321); HR _ Greg Vaughn
(50); RBI _ Vaughn (119); SB _ Quilvio Veras (24). W _Kevin Brown
(18); ERA _ Trevor Hoffman (1.48). Saves _ Hoffman (53). Strikeouts
_ Brown (257).
</P>
<P>
   -- Maddux update: Maddux is working on six days rest, having
last pitched in last Saturday's LDS-clinching game in Chicago. He
beat the Cubs 6-2, allowing both runs on seven hits while striking
out four. Maddux has a 2.51 ERA on the road, the second-lowest in
the league after Glavine (1.78). If he is vulnerable, it has been
early. Opponents have hit .290 against hit in the first inning but
the average tapers from there all the way down to .202 after the
seventh. Maddux's groundball/flyball ratio (3.25) was the best in
the majors this season. Expect the Padres to challenge him on the
bases. Everyone else does. Maddux allowed 28 stolen bases this
year, second-most in the league.
</P>
<P>
   -- Hitchcock update: He is a streak pitcher and after beating
Houston last Sunday to clinch the LDS, he appears to be on an
upward streak (six innings, three hits, one run, 11 strikeouts).
Hitchcock finished the year with only two wins in his last seven
starts. He tied the Padres club record for strikeouts Aug. 29, when
he fanned 15 against Montreal, testimony to how effective his
split-finger fastball can be. He is a far better pitcher at
Qualcomm, where he went 6-2 with a 2.68 ERA, nearly 2 1/2 runs
lower than his season rate. He drew no decision in his only start
against the Braves this year, but deserved better at Turner Field
May 9. He left the game with a 3-0 lead after the sixth, only to
have the Padres bullpen give up six runs in the last three innings
in a 6-4 Atlanta win.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who's hot: Gerald Williams, who gets his first NLCS start, is
2-for-6 against Hitchcock with four walks. Chipper Jones and Andruw
Jones are a combined 7-for-15 against him with four RBIs. Tony
Gwynn owns Maddux, as he does the Braves' top three starters, with
a .455 career average. Padres pinch-hitter John Vander Wal has
faced Maddux only once but homered off him in April when he was
still playing in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   -- Who's not: Andres Galarraga may have picked the wrong pitcher
for breaking out of his postseason slump. He is 1-for-7 lifetime
against Hitchcock, which is slightly better than Walt Weiss
(0-for-5). Padres center fielder Chuck Finley has a .197 career
average against Maddux. Wally Joyner is hitting just .190 but he
will be on the bench tonight in place of Jim Leyritz, who has never
faced Maddux.

 &HT;    Much is worth watching today
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's on Saturdays like this that your faithful
prognosticator becomes torn. Like all who love college football, he
wants to be in a football stadium somewhere soaking up the local
color. But one look at today's schedule makes him long for the
couch and the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   There is just too much good college football going on today to
confine one to a single locale: Two great showdowns in the SEC . .
. two more in the Big 12 . . . a late game between two Pac-10
powers . . . it's days like this that keep sports bars in business.
</P>
<P>
   We've gone 17-3 two straight weeks. Here's trying to keep the
streak going.
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Tennessee (4-0) at No. 7 Georgia (4-0), 3:30 p.m. (CBS):
This game took a decided turn when UT running back Jamal Lewis was
lost with a knee injury. Expect QB Tee Martin to play his best game
of the season. But Georgia has a hot quarterback in Quincy Carter
and the desire to end a seven-game losing streak to the Vols.
Georgia 28, Tennessee 24.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (3-1) at No. 23 N.C. State (3-1), 3:30 p.m.
(Channel 2): N.C. State has beaten a No. 2 (Florida State) and No.
11 (Syracuse) at home and lost on the road to Baylor. Georgia Tech
has beaten three bad teams but is improving. Quarterback Joe
Hamilton is having another superb season, leading the ACC and
ranking ninth nationally in passing efficiency. The Jackets are
capable of winning if they can control the ball and keep the
Wolfpack offense of the field. Georgia Tech 21, N.C. State 17.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 LSU (3-1) at No. 6 Florida (4-1), 7 p.m. (ESPN): Jesse
Palmer will start at quarterback for the Gators, but he won't stay
there unless he can cure Florida's red zone blues. The Gators have
only 10 touchdowns in 22 trips inside the 20. LSU, it turns out, is
overrated, especially on defense. Florida 42, LSU 20.
</P>
<P>
   No. 5 Kansas State (4-0) at No. 14 Colorado (5-0), 7 p.m. (FX):
After playing a bunch of cupcakes, Kansas State finds out if it's
for real. The Wildcats will be stronger at running back with Frank
Murphy reinstated after a flap with the NCAA. Colorado is
undefeated but has had to squeak by some average teams. Kansas
State 31, Colorado 21.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Nebraska (5-0) at No. 18 Texas A&AMP;M (4-1), 3:30 p.m.: The
Cornhuskers were flat last week against Oklahoma State and it
nearly cost them. Now they must go back on the road with a
banged-up Bobby Newcombe at quarterback. But the Texas A&AMP;M offense,
as always, is woefully predictable. That won't cut it against the
Huskers. Nebraska 35, Texas A&AMP;M 17.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 UCLA (3-0) at No. 10 Arizona (5-0), 10 p.m. (Fox SS): The
winner becomes the favorite in the Pac-10. Arizona won a thriller
last week against Washington and is becoming a darkhorse for the
national title. Since UCLA didn't play at Miami because of
Hurricane Georges, we're still not sure how good the Bruins are.
Arizona is deserving of this week's Upset Special. Arizona 17, UCLA
14.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Florida State (4-1) at Miami (3-1), 3:30 p.m.: This used
to be the best game in college football but Miami is trying to
rebuild from NCAA sanctions. Florida State has more talented
players but had better not struggle on offense and give the 'Canes
some hope. Miami would dearly love to atone for last year's 47-0
embarrassment in Tallahassee. Florida State 24, Miami 14.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn (1-3) at Miss. State (3-1), 12:30 p.m. (WXIA): With a
trip to Florida looming next week, it would behoove Auburn to find
a way to win. But no amount of coaching and motivation can overcome
the fact that Auburn is using too many young players on offense.
Miss. State 14, Auburn 7.
</P>
<P>
   -- THE REST
</P>
<P>
   SEC _ Alabama 28, Ole Miss 17; Vanderbilt 10, Western Michigan
7; Arkansas 31, Memphis 10; Kentucky 35, South Carolina 20.
</P>
<P>
   ACC _ Clemson 21, Maryland 17; North Carolina 17, Pittsburgh 10;
Wake Forest 28, Duke 20.
</P>
<P>
   Top 25 _ No. 1 Ohio State 45, Illinois 14; Purdue 24, No. 12
Wisconsin 23; No. 13 Penn State 28, Minnesota 10; Arizona State 17,
No. 22 Notre Dame 14.
</P>
<P>
   Last week: 17-3
</P>
<P>
   Season's record: 70-27 (72.2)

 &HT;    Fans flock to see game with Tennessee
 &HT;    By Plott Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ To paraphrase Larry Munson, this town is rocking.
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles filled with football fans began to flood the city
Friday as road work on Atlanta Highway further congested traffic.
On U.S. 441, an armada of campers and RVs streamed into Clarke
County, then circled the Stegeman Coliseum parking lot, waiting to
pounce on the first-come, first-served spots that opened to
football fans at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As members of the national media arrived in droves, the
40-person staff of ESPN's ``College Game Day'' prepared to make the
University of Georgia and Sanford Stadium the focus of the college
football world. The College Game Day crew of Chris Fowler, Lee
Corso and Kirk Herbstreit began broadcasting Friday night from the
Tate Student Center behind the stadium. It's the first time the
national cable network has broadcast its popular all-day show from
Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Today's game against the Tennessee Volunteers is the biggest in
years for the Bulldogs. It's been sold out since March, but that
hasn't stopped people from trying, even flooding the Georgia ticket
office with calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been here 16 years and the only thing that comes close
is the year Florida played here (1995),'' said Freddy Jones,
Georgia's assistant athletics director for ticket operations.
``It's been unbelievable. Everyone wants tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants them, but no one's getting any from the Georgia
ticket office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say 90 percent of the calls we get are from people who
already have tickets but want one for a friend or relative,'' Jones
said. ``Businesses call. Some elected officials. They know the
situation. I guess they feel they have to make that one last try.
The fact is, there are none.''
</P>
<P>
   None, that is, unless you're willing to deal with street
capitalism, where opportunists welcome the inquiries of the
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   Some are ``letting'' their tickets go for as little as $75 each,
while some are bringing as much as $150, a downtown barber said
Friday. Some say the value per ticket is even higher.
</P>
<P>
   On campus Thursday afternoon, junior Brian Williby, a
21-year-old from Savannah, said there's ``no way I would sell my
ticket. But I know two students who sold theirs for $80 each.''
Williby said the two had a commitment out of town this weekend;
otherwise they'd be at the game.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tate Student Center, handwritten posters offered student
tickets at ``best offer.'' Some were willling to trade their
Tennessee tickets for Florida tickets. Buying tickets from any
source other than the UGA ticket office has its caveats. There are
some who probably remember all too well buying counterfeit tickets
to last year's Auburn game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say to anyone that if you buy from anyone other than us,
you are taking a chance,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Georgia officials have pretty much undercut
counterfeit tickets, although it's possible someone may still try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hologram on this year's ticket that is darn near
impossible to duplicate. The 'Georgia' on the ticket is a hologram.
We've tried to copy it three different ways and we couldn't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who enters the gate with a student ticket will be asked
to show a student ID. And after a theft of some 60 student tickets
Thursday, potential buyers should look closely. A bicyclist
snatched the tickets from a window at the Coliseum ticket office.
The tickets, reportedly for section 311, were to be picked up by
students who bought season ticket coupons at the beginning of the
season. Coupons must be redeemed for tickets before each game.
</P>
<P>
   The game has also attracted nationwide interest from several
media outlets. CBS will televise the game live; its crew of 75 hit
town earlier this week. More than 200 magazine and newspaper
reporters, including writers from Sports Illustrated, USA Today,
The New York Times, New York Post and New York Daily News, the
Washington Post, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles
Times, also will cover the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game is also expected to provide a financial windfall for
area businessess and restaurants, many of which are planning to
bring in extra staff members to accommodate the rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game where business booms,'' said Jamie
Lofton, owner of three Locos pubs in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown at the upscale Harry Bissett's New Orleans Cafe &AMP;
Oyster Bar, the excitement was building.
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened in1986 and the only thing that compares to this
would be the year Florida came here (in 1995). It's going to be
crazy here,'' said manager Jim White. ``You'd be surprised how many
people will come here hoping to get a ticket and how many people
will come here just to be in Athens for this game. They'll sit in a
bar and watch it on television.''

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The Yankees, who rolled through the regular season
in record fashion and the first round of the American League
playoffs in a three-game sweep, suddenly find themselves reeling
and in jeopardy of losing their place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte was rocked for four home runs Friday night _ three
in one four-batter sequence in the fifth inning _ as the Cleveland
Indians rolled to a 6-1 victory that put the Yankees behind, 2
games to 1, in the best-of-seven AL Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome hit two of Cleveland's four home runs, as the Yankees
principal owner George Steinbrenner looked on sullenly, his chin in
his palm.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees desperately in need of a victory that would
even the series, Orlando Hernandez, the Cuban defector who is at
the end of his rookie season in the major leagues, will start Game
4 for the Yankees Saturday night against Dwight Gooden, the former
Met and Yankee who has never won a postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees seemed in command all season, finishing the year
with an American League record 114 victories. They stifled Texas in
the division series, sweeping the Rangers, holding them to only one
run.
</P>
<P>
   But the three consecutive victories against Texas and the five
runs the Yankees scored in the first inning of Game 1 of this
series masked a larger problem: Joe Torre's team has stopped
hitting. The Yankees had five runs and six hits in the first inning
of the series opener on Tuesday; in the 29 innings since, they have
a total of four runs and 16 hits. They went 4-for-7 with runners in
scoring position in the first inning of Game 1, and have gone only
2-for-21 in Games 2 and 3.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Cleveland's Bartolo Colon Friday night, the Yankees had
an advantageous situation: Colon had command only of his fastball.
But they managed only four hits, and after Chuck Knoblauch and
Bernie Williams each hit singles to provide a first-inning run, the
Yankees had only two hits and hit into three double plays.
</P>
<P>
   They would have had to score a bushel of runs, however, to
counter the horrid outing by Pettitte, who reverted to his form of
August and September that made Torre wonder if he would use
Pettitte as a starter in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The phone in the visitors' dugout at Jacobs Field is in the
opposite end from where the manager and coaches usually sit. When
calls are made to the bullpen, the pitching coach must get up and
walk the length of the visitors' dugout to reach the phone. Mel
Stottlemyre made this march repeatedly Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte fell behind seven of the first 10 batters he faced,
throwing ball one with his first pitch, and when he did stick the
ball over the plate, the Indians took full, destructive swings and
crushed the ball. Cleveland had runners at first and second with
two out in the first inning and Travis Fryman drove a line drive to
left _ directly at Shane Spencer, for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Thome launched a 421-foot home run leading off the second
inning, however, and Mark Whiten ripped a double down the left
field line. Stottlemyre made his first trek to the bullpen phone;
Hideki Irabu began warming up. Enrique Wilson bounced a single
through the Yankees' drawn-in infield, scoring Whiten to make it
2-1. Pettitte barely got through the inning with Cleveland leading
by only a run.
</P>
<P>
   But Pettitte was like a dazed fighter at that point, waiting to
be knocked out, completely vulnerable. For Torre and Stottlemyre,
every out Pettitte recorded must have seemed like a miracle.
Somehow, Pettitte got through the third and fourth innings, using a
roundhouse curveball. They needed only to get him through the fifth
with the score close, and then Torre could give the ball to Ramiro
Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte retired the first two hitters in the fifth inning. Just
one more out, one more out.
</P>
<P>
   With the count 0-1 on Manny Ramirez, Pettitte threw a fastball
low and away, a good pitch, and Ramirez reached out and slammed the
ball to right. Pettitte's head jerked as he watched the flight of
the ball _ and watched it carry into the Yankees' bullpen in right
field. Pettitte's body lurched in anger, as if he'd taken a fist in
the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   And he fell apart quickly. He walked Travis Fryman on a 3-2
pitch and Thome lifted a long drive that landed on the top of the
right field wall, and over, before Whiten, a former Yankee,
provided the coup de grace _ a tremendous 416-foot drive that fell
among the standing room only crowd far beyond the left field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte turned and dropped his head, devastated by the beating.
He had never allowed four home runs in one game before.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Torre emerged from the dugout to replace Pettitte, with the
score 6-1, David Wells and David Cone, two of Pettitte's brethren,
got up and walked into the runway, not wanting to see his
departure. Talking softly to himself, Pettitte walked off the
field, sat in the dugout, pulled on a jacket and got a cup of
water.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza warmed up and Pettitte stared onto the field, looking
straight ahead, his sightline frozen. Other Yankees approached him
and tapped him on the leg or the side _ Hang in there, man _ and
Pettitte never reacted, his eyes never moved. He didn't seem to
blink. Pettitte is extremely harsh in his self- indictments, and by
the look of him, he was staring ahead at a sleepless night or two.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Shane Spencer was in Joe Torre's lineup for Game 3, in left
field, and Chili Davis made his first start as the designated
hitter, batting sixth. Tim Raines was not in the starting lineup,
Torre said, simply because he is not swinging well right now ...
The Indians have not officially announced their Game 5 starter, but
it appears that Chad Ogea will start in place of Jaret Wright, who
now shifts to the bullpen. The Yankees knocked out Wright in only
two-thirds of an inning in Game 1 and Ogea pitched well in relief.

STEPHEN PEARLMAN, 63, ACTOR IN MOVIES, TV AND THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stephen Pearlman, a versatile character actor in
theater, film and television, died Sept. 30 at his home in
Manhattan. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his wife, Stefanie Solow Glennon.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, with a bellowing voice, Pearlman had a face that stirred
recognition on the street, though he was enough of an Everyman to
be often mistaken for a car salesman or store clerk, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brooklyn and reared in Jersey City, N.J., Pearlman made
his living solely as an actor after his graduation from Dartmouth
College in 1954, where he acted in campus productions while
majoring in philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   He studied with Stella Adler and then worked for more than 40
years in genres ranging from the classics, in the American
Shakespeare Festival, to contemporary comedy, as an original member
of the Second City troupe in Chicago with Barbara Harris and Alan
Arkin.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 Pearlman made his New York stage debut in ``The
Threepenny Opera'' at the Theater de Lys in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   His off-Broadway credits also included Milton Erskine's ``Time
of the Key''; Arthur Miller's ``American Clock,'' in which he
played three characters, and ``A Shayna Maidel,'' of which he was
especially proud, having perfected a Yiddish accent for his role.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared on Broadway in the original productions of
``Barefoot in the Park,'' ``Children of a Lesser God'' and ``Six
Degrees of Separation,'' in which he played a Manhattan doctor who
gives his apartment keys to a young man posing as Sidney Poitier's
son.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a leading role in ``La Strada,'' Lionel Bart's 1969
musical starring Bernadette Peters and based on the movie by
Fellini.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman's film credits included ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``Die
Hard With a Vengeance,'' ``The First Wives Club'' and ``Quiz
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   On television, he was a guest star in episodes of ``Seinfeld''
and ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman's most recent role was that of a Hasidic rabbi in
Darren Aronofsky's ``Pi,'' an independent film that won the
dramatic direction award at the Sundance Festival this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two stepdaughters,
Leah Glennon of Brooklyn and Hope Glennon of San Francisco; his
mother, Ruth W. Pearlman of Jersey City, and two grandchildren.

FLYERS' VANBIESBROUCK THWARTS RANGERS IN OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Low-scoring hockey need not be boring. The New York
Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers demonstrated that Friday night
at Madison Square Garden in their energetic season opener. The pace
was brisk, the hitting hard, the chances plentiful around the nets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show was entertaining for the loud capacity crowd,
the result was unsatisfying for the home fans as the Flyers headed
home with a 1-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia got a power-play goal from Alexandre Daigle and a
shutout from goalie John Vanbiesbrouck, a former Ranger, who
stopped 20 shots. The Rangers had other shots at Philadelphia's
net, but they were blocked by Vanbiesbrouck's teammates, often a
sign of a cohesive team.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, Stanley Cup finalists in 1997, were ousted in the
first round of last season's playoffs and hope to return to loftier
status in the Atlantic Division, the Eastern Conference and the
National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers came close to evening the score with three seconds
remaining, after they had pulled goalie Mike Richter for an extra
attacker. Esa Tikkanen, uncovered next to the Philadelphia net,
fanned on a shot attempt and then broke his stick over the net in
frustration just before the buzzer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also complained on the play because Philadelphia's
Eric Lindros sent the stick of New York's John MacLean down the ice
after MacLean lost his grip on it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Muckler took over last February as coach of the Blue
Shirts, but this was the debut of the new system that he hopes to
install in his first full season. His players put pressure on the
puck, even though two of his centers were really left wings who
were assigned to check Lindros. Muckler also got bursts of energy
from his fourth line of Harry York, Darren Langdon and Mike Knuble.
</P>
<P>
   Not in uniform was Manny Malhotra, the Rangers' rookie center
who was drafted in the first round last June and signed his first
contract this week. Although Muckler said he wanted ``to give the
veterans a chance,'' there was a practical reason for not starting
the promising 18-year-old Malhotra against a team like the Flyers
on opening night at home: Flyers coach Roger Neilson might have put
Lindros, the big center, against the Ranger rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, who is talented and powerful, might have initiated
Malhotra with skill and physical intimidation, resulting in a
setback to his confidence. Better to let Malhotra make his debut
against a lesser team, under less pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Checking Lindros for many shifts was Adam Graves, normally a
center who was moved to the middle this time. Also assigned to Big
88 was Niklas Sundstrom, a left wing last season who will probably
be the Rangers' second-line center, unless the Rangers make a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the Philadelphia debut of Vanbiesbrouck, the
veteran goalie who was signed as a free agent from the Florida
Panthers. In the Ranger net was Richter, who used to share time
with Vanbiesbrouck when both were Rangers earlier in the decade. In
the first two periods, Richter was the busier goalie, stopping 20
of 21 shots. Vanbiesbrouck stopped all 11 that reached him in the
first 40 minutes and the Flyers held a 1-0 lead going into the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Daigle, who scored the game's only goal, was acquired last
season from Ottawa in a trade. After Richter stopped an earlier
shot, the puck bounced high into the air, like a pop fly in
baseball. When it landed in front of the net, it set off a scramble
that included Philadelphia's Dave Babych knocking over Ranger
defenseman Jeff Beukeboom in the crease. With Beukeboom, Richter
and Brian Leetch tangled, Daigle found the loose puck and put it
over the line at 5 minutes 45 seconds of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   It was Philadelphia's fifth consecutive power play, and most of
them were legitimate. The Rangers could have got worse treatment
from the referee, Bill McCreary, when Ulf Samuelsson punched
Philadelphia defenseman Petr Svoboda in the face late in the first
period, drawing blood and instigating a brief fight. Although
Samuelsson could have been given a 10-minute misconduct or a game
misconduct, the referee gave him only two extra minutes for
roughing.
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers visit Montreal on Saturday night for their
second game, they will play a depleted team. The Canadiens signed
their best defenseman, VLADIMIR MALAKHOV, to a two-year contract
Friday. Unsigned for Montreal are the forwards MARTIN RUCINSKY and
BRIAN SAVAGE. Defenseman PATRICE BRISEBOIS has back spasms, and
defenseman STEPHANE QUINTAL has a sinus infection.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rangers officially signed ESA TIKKANEN, who came to
training camp on a free-agent tryout.
</P>
<P>
   _ KEVIN STEVENS, the Ranger left wing, has been put on waivers,
but that does not mean he is changing teams. Anyone claiming him
would have to pick up his salary of almost $3 million for this
season and next season. JOHN ROSASCO, spokesman for the Rangers,
said Stevens' waiver period lasts through Monday. Stevens played a
robust style, initiating many collisions, one of them injuring
Philadelphia's CHRIS THERIEN.
</P>
<P>
   _ . SCOTT FRASER, a Ranger right wing, missed Friday night's
game with a concussion he sustained in an exhibition game last
Saturday.

WASHINGTON ON DEFENSIVE AS UTAH STATE COMES TO TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Wondame Davis' first serious fling in college
football had ended, he was virtually breathless in describing it to
Randy Hart, the University of Washington defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played like 37 plays,'' Hart says, ``and he said it seemed
like 10 minutes. He says, `Coach, I was getting the signal ... and
they were snapping the ball already!'''
</P>
<P>
   Which only goes to show you: Time flies ... and so does Arizona
quarterback Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not one of the game's best-ever clutch efforts _
Jenkins' loop-de-loop into the end zone with four seconds left to
play _ has departed their psyches, the Husky defenders must get
back on the field Saturday against Utah State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got that much sleep this week, thinking back on
it,'' said linebacker Marques Hairston, one of the Huskies Jenkins
left on the ground when he went airborne for Arizona's winning
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see that play again. I've seen it too many
times already.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona dramatically changed the landscape around the Huskies.
It snatched away the bonus Washington (2-2) had gained with the
stirring upset at Arizona State; it removed quarterback Brock Huard
and cornerback Jermaine Smith from the lineup for 2-3 weeks apiece,
to be replaced Saturday by Marques Tuiasosopo and Davis, who will
make his first college start.
</P>
<P>
   It robbed the Huskies of a burst of momentum off the Nebraska
mess, it refocused attention on the place-kicking follies, and it
got people to wondering why Washington has defended well at times
and hardly at all at others.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Arizona didn't have much impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``By no means are we happy,'' Hart said, referring to the
defense. ``But there are reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies rank 83rd among 112 Division 1-A teams in total
defense. Nebraska can do that to you; play the Huskers, and you're
liable to spend the rest of the year trying to recoup a respectable
defensive ranking.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three weeks, it could be difficult to judge
Washington's defensive progress. After Utah State (1-4), the
Huskies host Cal and Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   While Cal and OSU have swatched together winning records, all
three Husky opponents have authored some miserable offense. Oregon
State is 87th nationally in total offense, Utah State is 90th and
Cal is 109th. If there ever were a time for the Husky defense to
get well, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw us play against BYU, you know we can play better,''
said Hairston. ``If you saw us during spring, or two-a-days, you
know we can play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart and his cohorts have done a lot of head-scratching over the
defensive inconsistencies, and the consensus is that they have less
to do with mental breakdowns and blown coverages than they do
physical misplays.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches wear out listeners with the bromide ``We've got to make
plays.'' But that describes the Huskies, and no play is more
symbolic than Jenkins' leap.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Washington has played effective defense. The Huskies
stopped Arizona State just enough in the second half to give the
offense a chance to win, and they stuffed BYU, holding the Cougars
to 204 net yards.
</P>
<P>
   But on too many occasions, they didn't shed blocks against
Nebraska. Against Arizona, they allowed only five second-half first
downs until the final Wildcat possession _ and then five on that
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive depth is young and the Huskies simply miss too
many tackles. On Trung Canidate's 37-yard touchdown run last week,
Washington shifted Lester Towns to his right over the tight end,
Arizona walled off pursuit, sent Canidate up the middle and he shed
free safety Brendan Jones' attempted tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties are also taking a toll. After committing only 10 in
the first two games, Washington has 22 in the last two, many by
younger players who aren't yet distinguishing between valor and
discretion. Sophomore end Jeremiah Pharms decked the quarterback
after a whistle last week and Davis, who admits being a little
wired when he replaced Smith, was flagged for a personal foul on a
sideline tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little bit overwhelming for me,'' Davis says. ``I
didn't realize it (Smith's knee injury) was going to happen that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Offense, meanwhile, has been a struggle for Utah State, a
three-touchdown underdog to the Huskies. Quarterback Riley Jensen
is completing only 47 percent of his passes and the Aggies have
only 374 yards rushing in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Defense is a different story. Utah State ranks 16th nationally
and allows only 2.1 yards per rush, so even with the versatile
Tuiasosopo starting Saturday, offense could be at a premium for
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Says Utah State defensive line coach Mike Tuiasosopo, the cousin
of Marques' father Manu, ``He brings some things to the table, in
terms of preparation, that we don't get with the other kid
(Huard).''
</P>
<P>
   This is the replacement game for the Miami date (originally
Sept. 12) that the Huskies dropped to lighten a tough schedule. The
Aggies don't plan on allowing it to be a walkover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess somebody wrote that this is the `Goodwill Games,'''
Mike Tuiasosopo said. ``So there's a little bit of,
Wow-what-a-slap-in-the-face. We're doing some very good things.
Quite honestly, our team is starting to come together.''

HERNANDEZ IS OUT TO STOP THE INDIANS COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Armed with a video camera he recently purchased,
Orlando Hernandez walked through the Tower City Mall here Friday,
taping sights and sounds within a symbol of capitalism, for the
benefit of his two young daughters living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, a Cuban defector, hopes, as well, that he has good
reason to send them videotape of his Game 4 start Saturday against
the Cleveland Indians and Dwight Gooden, the pitcher from whom
Hernandez adapted his high leg kick a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen days have passed since Hernandez last pitched _ he
threw five innings against Tampa Bay on Sept. 25 _ and he has told
coach Jose Cardenal that when he takes the mound Saturday, he will
be pitching in the coldest conditions he has ever faced, with
temperatures expected to be in the 40s. But Hernandez scoffed at
the idea that the required adjustments will be difficult for him,
recalling his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was pitching with the Cuban national team,'' Hernandez
said through an interpreter, Leonardo Astacio, ``we played in Italy
and Ireland, and other countries in Europe, and it was pretty cold.
I'm not sure what the temperatures were, but it was pretty cold.
And we all pretty much know my story _ I've been through some cold
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that the cold on the field,'' he continued with a
smile, ``will affect my pitching tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and Cardenal spoke about how the pitcher must adapt to
the cold. Hernandez plans to have much of his body rubbed down with
liniment to get ``as warm as possible.'' Hernandez will pitch
wearing a long-sleeved undershirt, and if he works up a sweat on
the mound, Cardenal said, Hernandez intends to return to the
clubhouse between innings, rather than sit in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has been trying to adapt to the colder weather since
he arrived in Florida in spring training. The weather in Tampa was
unusually frigid last March, and in his first days with the team
Hernandez would sometimes sit in front of his locker in a golf
shirt and Bermuda shorts, arms folded tightly, legs crossed. Asked
why he just didn't buy some warmer clothes, Hernandez said: ``I've
got to adjust to the cold. I'm going to be living here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre believes that Hernandez is capable of
adjusting, to the cold and to the fact that he has not pitched in
so long. But the first innings could be very critical for
Hernandez, Torre said, because the right-hander relies on finesse;
according to a scouting service, fastballs comprised only 60
percent of his pitches, an extremely low ratio. Hernandez needs to
have touch and feel and command of his pitches, his slider,
curveball and changeup. ``You really don't know what to expect,''
Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez may need an inning or two to re-acquaint himself with
the mound, with the feel of his breaking pitches or his changeup,
meaning that he could be vulnerable immediately.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone pitches like Hernandez in many respects, throwing
from multiple arm angles, relying on his slider, changing speeds.
He believes that pitchers of their ilk tend to adapt to change more
quickly, because they are always changing. ``Those type of guys are
more conditioned to coming back after long lay-offs,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez pitched twice against the Indians this season,
throwing effectively on June 18, allowing seven hits and two runs
in seven and two-thirds innings in a no-decision, before getting
hit hard on July 13. That day, he gave up nine hits, including two
home runs, four runs, and two walks in six and two-thirds innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Hernandez pitched almost exclusively to the
outside half of the strike zone, and the Indians hitters
essentially leaned over the plate and drove line drives to the
opposite field. Three weeks later, Hernandez began making a
successful adjustment, throwing more inside fastballs. Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove said before Friday night's game that the
Indians did not expect that Hernandez would be any different since
the last time they saw him; if that was the case, then they would
be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   As Hernandez developed as a pitcher in Cuba in the 1980s, he saw
a videotape of Gooden pitching for the New York Mets, saw how
Gooden drew his front leg very high and held his hands close to his
body before launching himself toward home plate. Hernandez tried
this and liked it; at the time, he often brushed his left ear with
his knee. (His leg kick is slightly lower now.)
</P>
<P>
   Gooden grinned when asked about how Hernandez emulates him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has good stuff and any time you see a pitcher at this level
and any time they analyze you, it makes you feel good,'' Gooden
said. ``I'm too old now to get my leg up that high.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that make you feel old?
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel old,'' Gooden said, grinning again, ``but
he's probably my age, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   _ SHANE SPENCER was in JOE TORRE's lineup for Game 3, in left
field, and CHILI DAVIS was to make his first start as the
designated hitter, batting sixth. TIM RAINES was not in the
starting lineup, Torre said, simply because he is not swinging
well.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Indians have not made an official decision on their
starting pitcher for Game 5.

WASHINGTON STATE TAKES ON ROLE OF PAC-10 TRAFFIC COP 
</HEADLINE>

   PULLMAN, Wash. _ The detour sign isn't visible along State Route
195 just yet, but Washington State coach Mike Price hopes to start
redirecting Pac-10 traffic Saturday when the Cougars host unbeaten
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road to the Rose Bowl still goes through Pullman,'' Price
declared. ``Anyone who wants to go to the Rose Bowl has to come in
here and beat the Cougs, otherwise they may not go.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true, at least Saturday for the Ducks, followed by USC.
</P>
<P>
   With two straight Pac-10 losses to Cal and UCLA, the Cougars are
out of contention to repeat as conference champions. WSU is hoping
to avoid becoming the first Pac-10 team since UCLA in 1943 to go
from first to last in back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a little dim for us, but if Oregon wants to go to the
Rose Bowl, they've got to come in here and beat us,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Diverting the Ducks, however, is going to take a formidable road
block.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is averaging 50.2 points and 542 yards per game. The
Ducks are coming off a bye week after thrashing Stanford 63-28 in
their conference opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``This offense that we're facing might be the best in the
country,'' Price said. ``Right now (Akili Smith) is the hottest
quarterback in the country that I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, riding a newly created Heisman Trophy campaign, is
leading the nation in passing efficiency (193.1), and junior
tailback Reuben Droughns ranks sixth nationally in rushing,
averaging 145 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Price's other chore after affixing the Pac-10 detour sign is to
get his team up after an emotionally draining loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt a lot of urgency and intensity before that game last
week. We were probably as emotionally and intellectually ready as
in any game we have played this season. Our guys were jacked before
the game,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Cougars, UCLA already proved the road to
the Rose Bowl begins and ends at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   SECONDARY THOUGHTS: The WSU secondary, with Lamont Thompson
leading the Pac-10 in interceptions (4), faces another test similar
to the one posed by UCLA's Cade McNown last week: a quarterback in
Smith who can escape from the pocket and break defenses down.
McNown also had a Heisman campaign of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Smith comes into the game leading the Pac-10 in passing
efficiency. But the Cougars are second in the conference and ninth
in the nation in defending against the pass, holding quarterbacks
to an average 88.8 rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our secondary is playing about as good as you can play,''
Price said. ``I don't know if we've had a better secondary at
Washington State than the one have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   SIRMON'S SUB: When Oregon's all-conference linebacker Peter
Sirmon went down two weeks ago with a season-ending shoulder
injury, it was considered a major setback. But his replacement,
senior Chris Vandiver, had 19 tackles in his first start, against
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different not having him out there,'' Vandiver said of
Sirmon. ``It takes a lot of pressure off us when he is there and
you can look around and there's big Peter.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Vandiver's numbers against Stanford, Price sighed: ``I'm
so happy for them. That's just what we need.''
</P>
<P>
   COIN FLIP: Heads or tails, Price already has his mind made up if
the Cougars win the coin toss: ``We're taking the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Price hopes his offense can control the game, avoid turnovers
and keep Smith off the field. The Cougars fell behind early to UCLA
and never recovered, just like Michigan State did in losing 48-14
to Oregon to start this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Michigan State, they just killed them early,'' Price
said of the Ducks. ``Obviously, that happened to us last week and I
don't want it to happen this week.''
