Greenspan Upbeat About Economy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave an upbeat assessment
of the economy's current performance Thursday, noting that next month it will
become the longest expansion in U.S. history. However, Greenspan also repeated
worries that the Federal Reserve must be alert to the growing imbalances between
continued strong consumer demand, bolstered by Americans' soaring stock
portfolios, and the dwindling supply of available workers. In addition to
concerns about rising inflation pressures, Greenspan also repeated concerns he
has expressed in the past that the huge runup in stock prices could without
warning reverse itself.

Clinton Backs Investment Incentives
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- With a booming stock market and robust economy, President
Clinton said Thursday that Americans "have a moral obligation" to bring
prosperity to the nation's neediest urban and rural areas. Two weeks before his
State of the Union address, Clinton opened an election-year drive to win
congressional approval of $5 billion worth of tax incentives over 10 years to
encourage investment in depressed areas under a program he calls "New Markets."
"Economic opportunity should be the birthright of every American," Clinton said.

Cuban Boy's Dad Shows Anger

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an interview Thursday night with ABC's "Nightline,"
the father of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez said he feels like "breaking the neck"
of politicians fighting his son's return to Cuba. Repeating previous statements
that he has no intention of coming to Miami to pick up the boy, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez told ABC's "Nightline" that Elian's U.S. relatives don't "have any
feelings." The interview was conducted as Attorney General Janet Reno sought the
return of the 6-year-old child, even while the custody case headed to federal
court.

Bush Campaigning for Bush
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATLANTIC, Iowa (AP) -- Former President Bush campaigned for his son the
front-runner on Thursday, telling Iowa Republicans that George W. learned at his
side and would "be excellent at doing what I tried to do" to unite Americans at
home and allies abroad. It was the former president's first vote-hunting mission
of the 2000 presidential campaign. While helping the son, Bush said, "I will
have nothing bad to say against any of the people that he is campaigning against
right now."

Convicted Killer, 13, Sentenced
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- One of the youngest murderers in U.S. history -- a
boy who shot a stranger at age 11 -- was spared life in prison today and sent
away to a juvenile detention center until he turns 21. Judge Eugene Moore said
that the tough 1997 Michigan law that allowed Nathaniel Abraham to be prosecuted
as an adult is "fundamentally flawed" and that the boy has a chance of being
rehabilitated. Nathaniel did not speak at the hearing.

Va. Executes Man Who Killed at 17
</SUBHEAD>

	   JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A man who killed his 70-year-old neighbor during a
robbery when he was a teen-ager was executed Thursday by lethal injection. Steve
Edward Roach, 23, was the second man executed in Virginia this week for a murder
committed at age 17. Roach wrote that he was "unable to grasp, even to his last
breath, why we kill people to teach other people that killing is wrong." On
Monday, Douglas Christopher Thomas, 26, was executed for shooting his
girlfriend's parents in 1990 when he was 17.

	   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Loren Woods scored a career-high 25 points and blocked
a school-record 10 shots Thursday night as No. 2 Arizona survived an unexpected
scare from Washington State 80-75. The Wildcats (14-2, 3-0 Pac-10) beat the
Cougars for the 29th consecutive time, the longest current streak of any
opponents in the same conference in major college basketball. Michael Wright
added 18 points for Arizona. Mike Bush scored 18 points for Washington State.

<HEADLINE> Jazz 93, Heat 83  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Bryon Russell scored 19 points and newly acquired
forward Armen Gilliam showed why Utah wanted him as the Jazz beat the Miami Heat
93-83 on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Malone scored 18 points, Jeff Hornacek had 17, Olden Polynice and
Howard Eisley each had 11. Gilliam, signed as a free agent last week, scored
nine of his 10 points in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   John Stockton had 13 assists and survived a painful jab to his left eye. He
caught Anthony Carter's outstretched finger while driving the lane in the third
quarter. After sitting six minutes, Stockton returned to start the fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   Alonzo Mourning led the Heat with 27 points, Voshon Lenard added 25 and
Jamal Mashburn had 11, but Miami went flat at the end, scoring only five points
in the last six minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilliam hit back-to-back baskets over Mourning early in the fourth quarter,
helping the Jazz extend a 74-65 lead after three periods.
</P>
<P>
	   The next time Gilliam shot, Mourning swatted the ball several rows into the
stands, and it sparked the Heat to a 7-0 run. Two free throws by Mashburn pulled
Miami within 78-74 with 8:10 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilliam hit a free throw and Malone added an 18-foot jumper, but the Heat
rallied with driving baskets by Lenard and Mashburn, pulling within 81-78 with
six minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gilliam, who played 23 minutes, added a 16-foot jumper and Eisley made a
huge defensive stop, stuffing a 3-point attempt by Miami's Dan Majerle with 4:42
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't help the Heat when Mashburn fouled out 11 seconds later. The Jazz
scored the next six points and never looked back.
</P>
<P>
	   Hornacek, Eisley and rookie Quincy Lewis combined to limit Majerle to six
points two nights after he scored 33 on 9-of-10 shooting from 3-point range in a
victory at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
	   As for Stockton, the injury wasn't as serious as it initially seemed.
</P>
<P>
	   He was diagnosed with a scrape. After holding an icepack to his face while
sitting the last six minutes of the third quarter, Stockton was cheered when he
returned to start the fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   On the play when he was hurt, Stockton lost the ball and fell to the
baseline, where he stayed while the Heat ran offense at the other end.
</P>
<P>
	   P.J. Brown hit a jumper to tie it at 57 with 5:56 to play, ending live
action and allowing Utah trainer Mike Shimensky to race onto the floor. Stockton
winced as he walked to the bench, and fans booed when the replay was shown.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
    By JORDAN LITE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Back when many people thought AIDS was a gay white
man's disease, three black men came to Dr. Robert Scott and told him that they
could not bear to confide in their pastors about their infections.
</P>
<P>
	   "Each one told me, 'Whatever you do, don't tell my pastor,"' Scott recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said, 'Something is wrong. Do I have to be both doctor and minister
too?"'
</P>
<P>
	   So Scott rounded up their pastors, who ministered at some of the East Bay's
largest black Baptist churches. "What have you said or not said that makes
people fearful of talking to you?" he asked them.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a question being asked more and more at black churches, as the latest
statistics show blacks are not benefiting as much as other groups from a slowing
of the AIDS death rate.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to new drug treatments, AIDS deaths nationwide dropped 65 percent
between 1995 and 1998, but only 55 percent for blacks. While blacks represent
just 13 percent of the U.S. population, they comprise 49 percent of AIDS deaths
-- 8,316 people last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
	   Since most blacks have some connection to a church, it's vital that black
churches take an active role in HIV prevention, said Pernessa Seele, founder of
The Balm in Gilead, a New York nonprofit that teaches ministers how to do AIDS
education.
</P>
<P>
	   "In our community, the church, the pulpit, is the loudest voice that we
have," Seele said. "Historically, if you want to organize around anything, you
go to the church. With AIDS devastating our community we must use that vehicle
which we know."
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't always this way. Homosexuality, sex outside of marriage and
intravenous drug use are sins churchgoers learn to hate. In many cases, they
learned to hate the sinners as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was always reinforced that being gay was a bad thing, it was a sin. If
it was talked about, it was in a negative sense," said Derek Lassiter, 34, a gay
black man who is HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been welcomed at Glide Memorial Methodist Church in San Francisco,
where gays, drug abusers and the homeless are equally embraced, and where
advocates hand out condoms and HIV testing is available. But he says this is an
anomaly.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the black community, everyone has had a church experience; it never
leaves you," he said. "But then you start remembering how you were not
accepted."
</P>
<P>
	   Most churches do not offer the extensive AIDS programs of Glide or Allen
Temple Baptist Church in Oakland, where the 5,500-member congregation holds
monthly meetings to recruit volunteers to act as buddies to people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   This month, Allen Temple opened 25 low-cost housing units in Oakland for
disabled patients. The church also runs an AIDS case management center, and
reaches out to other black churches that may not be talking about AIDS at all.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a Christian physician it was clear to me ... the church is a diverse
reflection of our whole society," said Scott, who heads the AIDS ministry at
Allen Temple and has 400 HIV-positive patients among his 2,000 clients in
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people who got this disease are drug users. Some were prostitutes.
Some got it because they are gay," he said. "As a church we're having to
confront a whole population of people who are marginalized. We certainly don't
want to push aside and marginalize people of our own race."
</P>
<P>
	   Money is starting to embrace the community, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the Congressional Black Caucus successfully lobbied President Clinton
to authorize $156 million to fight AIDS among blacks and Hispanics in 1998, the
AIDS National Interfaith Network, a clearinghouse for religious organizations
conducting HIV education and support, has seen many more inquiries from church
leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The funds allowed the CDC to expand its church-based initiative, inflating
an annual budget of $100,000 to $2 million. In October, the CDC also allotted
$39 million to prevent AIDS in minority communities -- up 50 percent over last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Clearly as the epidemic continues to spread -- and particularly in
communities of color -- I think religious leaders in faith communities realize
the role they can play and they want to play that role increasingly," said Dr.
Helene Gayle, who directs the CDC's center for prevention of HIV, sexually
transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
	   That would help clients of AIDS case manager Kenneth Hall, who set up the
outreach group Ark of Refuge at Allen Temple four years ago. "Seventy-five
percent are real leery about committing themselves spiritually anywhere if they
haven't outed themselves to the pastor or the congregation about their
diagnosis," Hall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Support for AIDS programs is evolving.
</P>
<P>
	   "The church was part of the problem because no one was saying anything and
it was moving through the church," said the Rev. Theo Frazier of Church of the
Pentecost in San Francisco, who emphasizes abstinence when he discusses AIDS
with congregants.
</P>
<P>
	   But as people got sick and began dying, he said, "we had to talk about it."

<HEADLINE> Joel Steinberg denied parole again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Parole officials said Joel Steinberg showed little
remorse for his role in the 1987 death of his adopted daughter as they denied
his release.
<P>
	   The former Manhattan lawyer underwent his third parole hearing Tuesday at
Southport state prison near Elmira, where he is serving 8 1/3 to 25 years for
first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Steinberg was found unconscious in Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment and died later at a nearby hospital. The 6-year-old girl's death - and
the jarring courtroom appearance of his companion Hedda Nussbaum, a victim of
Steinberg's beatings - focused national attention on domestic abuse and review
procedures for prospective adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the Division of Parole on Thursday said the nature of
Steinberg's crime and his failure to quickly seek medical help for Lisa were
main factors in denial of parole.
</P>
<P>
	   "During your interview with this panel you minimized your responsibility and
role in this criminal behavior, only acknowledging that you should have sought
medical help sooner," according to the parole decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Parole officials credited Steinberg, 58, for taking part in prison programs
and counseling, but said those factors were outweighed by the "severity of your
criminal behavior and limited signs of remorse."
</P>
<P>
	   Transcripts of Tuesday's parole hearing will not be released for several
weeks. Steinberg told a parole panel in 1998 that he never abused Lisa and had a
"loving relationship" with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinberg has been denied parole twice before, in January 1996 and January
1998. But a state Supreme Court justice in November 1999 threw out the results
of the 1998 hearing, citing concerns that the board in that case may have been
unduly influenced by public opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing this week, for legal purposes, is considered his second hearing.
Under a legal quirk related to that, even though the board determined Steinberg
is not eligible for a parole hearing again for two years, that two-year "hold"
is retroactive to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinberg is scheduled to appear again before the parole board early next
month.

<HEADLINE> McCain wants Bush to intercede in New York ballot fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Complaining about "Stalinist politics," John McCain
says Gov. George W. Bush should tell top New York Republicans to halt their
attempts to knock McCain off the state's presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   Lawyers working for the New York GOP, which is backing Bush's candidacy,
have challenged McCain's petitions to qualify for the March 7 primary ballot in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Look, the Berlin Wall came down. Let's not have the kind of Stalinist
politics that the state of New York and the Republican Party have been
practicing," McCain said Thursday in Concord, N.H. "Let us be on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   Calling himself a "legitimate candidate," McCain said, "don't try to use the
muscle of the New York Republican Party and its apparatchiks to knock us off the
ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush indicated he wasn't about to help McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   After a speech in Portsmouth, N.H., the Texas governor said, "it's important
for all of us to play by the same rules." Bush defended the complex New York
requirements as "a process to encourage grassroots participation."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said a decision on whether to pursue such
challenges was up to New York party leaders and a top lawyer for New York's
Republican hierarchy said the petition challenge effort was going ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do what we feel is right," lawyer Jeffrey Buley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Bush candidacy has the backing of Gov. George Pataki and
state GOP Chairman William Powers, as well as most of the state's top
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of New York's demanding ballot access rules, only Bush, McCain and
millionaire publisher Steve Forbes are contesting the New York primary.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush and Forbes filed petitions seemingly qualifying themselves for
the GOP primary ballot in all of the state's 31 congressional districts, the
McCain camp has conceded its petitions are probably only adequate to qualify for
the ballot in 25 or 26 of the state's 31 districts.
</P>
<P>
	   That could leave McCain on the GOP ballot in only part of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said his review of the McCain petitions indicates McCain lacks
sufficient signatures from party members in at least six of the state's
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said lawyers are also checking the other McCain petitions to make sure
those signing them are really registered to vote, are enrolled Republicans and
live in the congressional district where they signed the petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the Bush supporters in New York filed general objections
with the state Board of Elections to the McCain petitions. They have until
Tuesday to follow that up with specific objections that would then be ruled on
by the state board.
</P>
<P>
	   The board plans to certify the primary ballot Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also filed a federal lawsuit seeking to place his convention
delegate slates on the ballot in all of the state's 31 congressional districts.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Buying Hughes Satellite Unit  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. is leaving the aerospace
industry with a $3.75 billion deal to sell its satellite manufacturing business
and related operations to the Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale announced Thursday provides a big boost to Boeing's growing space
business. At the same time, Hughes, the company that once built airplanes and
government spy satellites, will be free to focus on potentially more lucrative
ventures in satellite-to-home TV, wireless Internet and other commercial
ventures.
</P>
<P>
	   "These strategic moves accelerate the transformation of Hughes into a highly
focused entertainment and data information services and distribution company,"
said Michael T. Smith, chairman and CEO of Hughes.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal makes Boeing a dominant player in the commercial satellite
industry, which is now led by Hughes with about 40 percent of the market, and
will lift revenues and earnings from Boeing's space and communications
operations about 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hughes operations being acquired were believed to have generated sales
of $2.3 billion during 1999, Boeing said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing also will be able to write off $500 million of the buying price
through a new tax regulation that allows the deduction of goodwill, Boeing chief
financial officer Debbie Hopkins said. The write-off effectively will reduce the
price to $3.25 billion, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes has a backlog of 36 satellites on order worth an estimated $4
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Boeing intends to be No. 1 in space. This acquisition is a significant step
forward in executing our goal of becoming the industry leader in integrated,
space-based information and communications," said Phil Condit, Boeing chairman
and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Hughes' space and communications unit, Boeing gets Hughes'
Electron Dynamics and Spectrolab, which make satellite components. The three
businesses have a combined work force of about 9,000 employees, primarily in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition will not lead to substantial layoffs, said Jim Albaugh,
president of Boeing's space and communications unit. A small number of jobs may
be eliminated where operations overlap, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts found little to criticize in the deal, which meshes Hughes'
expertise in satellite hardware with Boeing's Delta and SeaLaunch rocket
programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes will use proceeds from the sale to pay down debt, expand DirecTV, the
satellite-to-home TV service, and develop Spaceway, a wireless broadband system
that will target the Internet and other communications systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Spaceway is expected to go into operation in North America in 2003 at a cost
to Hughes of $1.4 billion. The system will be marketed to home users and
businesses, which would be able to transmit data directly to other Spaceway
users. Smith said he expects businesses to use the service to order parts and
supplies and manage distribution networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Both ventures promise to make Hughes, already the leader in wireless TV
services, a key player in the rapidly meshing fields of entertainment, the
Internet and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
	   "Broadband communications, Internet access is really the wave of the future,
and Hughes is in a position to move into that really quickly," said Marco
Caceres, an analyst with Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes was founded as Hughes Aircraft in 1932 by Howard Hughes. During World
War II, the company built the Spruce Goose, a wooden transport military plant
that never flew except for a brief test run over Long Beach harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   After the war, Hughes branched out into defense electronics. The company
began to move into commercial ventures, such as DirecTV, after the Cold War
ended.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes executives said in the past they wanted to keep their commercial
satellite operations as a complement to DirecTV, which has more than 8 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
	   That was before Hughes ran through billions of dollars promoting DirecTV,
buying up its competitors and developing Spaceway, said Paul Nisbet, an analyst
with JSA Research.

<HEADLINE> Consultants' bill: $108,000 to help SUNY 'find' King  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - How much does it cost to find a qualified person to
run the State University of New York?
<P>
	   About $27,000 a block, apparently.
</P>
<P>
	   That's what a Los Angeles consulting firm wants - $108,667 in all - for
helping SUNY run a national search to find its new chancellor, documents
obtained by The Associated Press show.
</P>
<P>
	   That search ended with last month's hiring of former Pataki state Budget
Director Robert King, who worked four blocks away from SUNY's central
administration building the entire time.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a payment to management firm Korn/Ferry International makes no sense,
especially when SUNY already is having money problems, Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman of Onondaga County said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that Bob King has always had the inside track for this job and
such a huge payment to an outside consultant is outrageous," Bragman said. "As
far as I know ... I think there was only one other candidate besides Bob King. I
question if a national search was necessary to identify a candidate from within
our state government who works just a few blocks away."
</P>
<P>
	   "It should have only taken a quarter, one call," said Assemblyman Alexander
Grannis, D-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY system is controlled by Gov. George Pataki through his appointments
to the SUNY Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
	   A trustees' search committee unanimously recommended King - a former
prosecutor, colleague of Pataki's in the Legislature and bureaucrat in Pataki's
administration - to be chancellor over Stanley Koplick, chancellor of the
Massachusetts state university system.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplick died Jan. 3, two days after King officially started as SUNY
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   King's hiring in December culminated a long search which began in January
1999 when former SUNY Chancellor John Ryan said he wanted to retire. Korn/Ferry
was hired in July.
</P>
<P>
	   SUNY spokesman Jon Sorensen said King was not preordained to be chancellor
because of his relationship with the Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "He went through the process like everyone else," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen also said Korn/Ferry deserves its money because it did a true
national search.
</P>
<P>
	   "They put together quite a long roster of people, many of whom were
interviewed and explored," he said. "They presented a list of traditional and
nontraditional candidates and it's wrong to accuse these people of not working
hard because they did. They earned their money with a lot of time and the result
of this search turned out well."
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen said six candidates were interviewed for the chancellor's job.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said the complaints by Bragman, a Democrat,
about the Korn/Ferry search are "just partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Korn/Ferry hasn't been paid yet because state Comptroller H. Carl McCall has
yet to approve the firm's contract with SUNY.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have the contract, it's under review and we have questions we have asked
the state university," McCall spokesman Dennis Tompkins said. "We have some
procedural and some substantive questions."
</P>
<P>
	   Tompkins would not say what questions the comptroller, who is also a
Democrat, has about the contract. SUNY cannot pay Korn/Ferry until the
comptroller approves the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Sorensen said one question that SUNY is refusing to answer is who the other
four finalists for chancellor were. "We insured our finalists privacy because
they have jobs in higher education that could be jeopardized," he said. "We find
it highly irregular and inappropriate. We made commitments to these finalists."
</P>
<P>
	   A call to Korn/Ferry's offices in New York City was not immediately returned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The university system's teaching hospitals have to transfer $116 million of
their state government funds to the SUNY system every year because of a
legislative mandate. However, it is unlikely the hospitals will be able to come
up with the money this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The teaching hospitals in Stony Brook, Syracuse and Brooklyn were only able
to transfer $39 million last year and had to borrow the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Democrats have complained about the university system hiring
high-priced consultants while it has this money problem. For example, SUNY is
paying nationally-recognized health care consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers
$1.1 million to investigate SUNY's teaching hospital finances and recommend ways
to make the hospitals fiscally viable.

<HEADLINE> Hughes Sale Marks End of Era  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN ANTCZAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Howard Hughes' behemoth Spruce Goose was taken apart and
hauled off. His private airstrip is being turned into a masterplanned community.
Now the last of the eccentric billionaire's flying legacy will be absorbed by an
aerospace giant.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale of Hughes Electronic Corp.'s satellite-building unit to Boeing Co.
leaves the Hughes brand on entertainment and communication services but none
directly involved in the making of flying machines that obsessed the lanky
oil-industry heir from Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the last vestige of aerospace within the company," Michael T.
Smith, chairman and CEO of Hughes Electronics, said Thursday. "But I think if
you go back and look at Howard Hughes' original roots, he was in the
entertainment business."
</P>
<P>
	   The sale also further blurs the aerospace lineage of Southern California,
where names like Douglas, Lockheed, Martin, McDonnell, Northrop, Ryan and Hughes
were identified with dynamic individuals but now are fading into a fog of
corporate hyphenations.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, who died at age 70 in 1976, was more dynamic than most -- chasing
aviation speed records and Hollywood actresses, surviving airplane wrecks and
failed romances, building a giant wooden seaplane that flew only once, creating
a company that orbited the world's first geosynchronous communications
satellite.
</P>
<P>
	   He launched himself in Los Angeles as a producer and came up with films as
bad as "The Conquerer," starring John Wayne as Genghis Khan, and as good as
"Scarface." He engineered a brassiere for Jane Russell, became one of the
nation's biggest defense contractors and endowed the Howard Hughes Medical
Institute with vast wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   Underlying it all was a fascination with flight, funded initially by wealth
from Hughes Tool Co., the oil-drill manufacturing business he inherited from his
father at age 19.
</P>
<P>
	   Flying a modified Boeing P-12 airplane, Hughes set a speed record of 186 mph
in 1934, then built his own plane, the H-1, and set a new record of 352 mph in
1935.
</P>
<P>
	   He followed with a 1936 transcontinental record flight of nine hours, 21
minutes in a Northrop Gamma, then set a new mark a year later with a seven-hour,
28-minute flight in the modified H-1. New York gave him a ticker tape parade in
1938 when he and four crewmen flew around the world in a Lockheed Model 14 in
less than four days.
</P>
<P>
	   During World War II his Hughes Aircraft Co. worked on designs for a
fighter-bomber that led to development of a photo-reconnaisance plane. But
Hughes was gravely injured in the crash of a prototype in Beverly Hills in 1946.
Only one other was built.
</P>
<P>
	   The next year Hughes made what would become his most memorable flight at the
controls of his HK-1, a 200-ton seaplane dubbed the Spruce Goose by observers.
</P>
<P>
	   Built at Hughes' airfield on the coast near Playa del Rey, the eight-engine
transport with a 320-foot wingspan was made of wood due to wartime metal
shortages.
</P>
<P>
	   Under pressure from Congress to show progress, Hughes flew it for a mile
across Long Beach Harbor, rising no higher than 70 feet. It never flew again.
</P>
<P>
	   Stored away in carefully preserved condition for years in a huge harbor
hangar, the plane became symbolic of the reclusiveness that shrouded Hughes'
later life.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, who had dropped out of public view for years, died of kidney disease
while being flown from Acapulco, Mexico, to a U.S. hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spruce Goose -- actually made of birch -- eventually became a tourist
attraction but after 12 lackluster years on display under a dome, it was
disassembled and barged to Oregon in 1992. Ground was finally broken this year
for a museum at McMinnville.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes' old airfield, once boasting a 9,300-foot runway, is now being
developed as Playa Vista, a community with thousands of housing and business
sites. The original plan included a studio for DreamWorks SKG, which has since
pulled out.

<HEADLINE> Joel Steinberg denied parole again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Parole officials said Joel Steinberg showed little
remorse for his role in the 1987 death of his adopted daughter as they denied
his release.
<P>
	   The former Manhattan lawyer underwent his third parole hearing Tuesday at
Southport state prison near Elmira, where he is serving 8 1/3 to 25 years for
first-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa Steinberg was found unconscious in Steinberg's Greenwich Village
apartment and died later at a nearby hospital. The 6-year-old girl's death - and
the jarring courtroom appearance of his companion Hedda Nussbaum, a victim of
Steinberg's beatings - focused national attention on domestic abuse and review
procedures for prospective adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the Division of Parole on Thursday said the nature of
Steinberg's crime and his failure to quickly seek medical help for Lisa were
main factors in denial of parole.
</P>
<P>
	   "During your interview with this panel you minimized your responsibility and
role in this criminal behavior, only acknowledging that you should have sought
medical help sooner," according to the parole decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Parole officials credited Steinberg, 58, for taking part in prison programs
and counseling, but said those factors were outweighed by the "severity of your
criminal behavior and limited signs of remorse."
</P>
<P>
	   Transcripts of Tuesday's parole hearing will not be released for several
weeks. Steinberg told a parole panel in 1998 that he never abused Lisa and had a
"loving relationship" with her.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinberg has been denied parole twice before, in January 1996 and January
1998. But a state Supreme Court justice in November 1999 threw out the results
of the 1998 hearing, citing concerns that the board in that case may have been
unduly influenced by public opinion.
</P>
<P>
	   The hearing this week, for legal purposes, is considered his second hearing.
Under a legal quirk related to that, even though the board determined Steinberg
is not eligible for a parole hearing again for two years, that two-year "hold"
is retroactive to January 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Steinberg is scheduled to appear again before the parole board early next
month.

<HEADLINE> Last temporary sales tax exemption begins Saturday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) - Retailers across New York are ready for a
week-long rush of business that rivals Christmas and back-to-school sales as the
state's last temporary sales tax exemption begins Saturday.
<P>
	   "It's amazing how many people come down that week," said Linda Tolokonsky,
owner of Rudnick's, a time-frozen clothing shop that has been in her family
since 1909.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a chaotic week," she said. "It's very, very busy."
</P>
<P>
	   The tax-free weeks on the sale of clothing and shoes up to $500 per item are
aimed at jump-starting retail sales and keeping New Yorkers home to shop instead
of at malls strategically placed just over the state lines in Massachusetts, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen many of our customers go to Lee, Mass.," Tolokonsky said. "Now
they stay in the state of New York to spend."
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, which is about seven miles from the New York line, is home to a new
complex of factory outlet stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Tolokonsky's son works across the border at a popular shoe and boot outlet
in Vermont. She said, "Our tax-free weeks have a devastating effect on them."
</P>
<P>
	   The weeks also help open pocketbooks during what have been traditional lulls
in retail spending. Retailers say they help move winter inventories and prompt
the cashing in of holiday gift certificates.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty cities and 58 of 62 counties will also drop their local sales taxes
for the state's seventh tax-free week, resulting in a 7 percent to 8 percent tax
break.
</P>
<P>
	   Proponents estimate the week will save consumers $25 million or more before
taxes return Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Carey of the state Department of Taxation and Finance emphasized the
sales tax break applies only to clothing and footwear - what he called
necessities - rather than luxury items.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Thomas Libous, R-Binghamton, represents one of the border areas
where business operators have long sought an end to the sales tax. After 12
years in office, the idea that he said wasn't thought possible by most during
his initial campaign has flourished in Broome County along the Pennsylvania
border.
</P>
<P>
	   "In 1988, the Southern Tier was losing business to Pennsylvania because of
our sales tax," Libous said. "So the sales tax became a hot issue. The merchants
are really excited about it."
</P>
<P>
	   The state will permanently drop its 4 percent tax beginning March 1 for
clothing and shoes costing less than $110.
</P>
<P>
	   Most counties and cities, however, won't follow the state's lead and
permanently give up the local sales taxes on March 1. Most argue they simply
can't afford to go without the millions in revenue their portion of the sales
tax provides.
</P>
<P>
	   They include rural Schoharie County, which depends on sales tax revenue to
avoid higher property taxes, and Orange County, which relies on growing sales
tax revenue thanks to huge shopping centers like the Galleria Mall in Wallkill
and the Woodbury Common factory outlet in Monroe.
</P>
<P>
	   But lopping off the sales tax is more than a matter of dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a symbolic value," said Matthew Maguire of the state Business
Council. "Historically, New York state taxation was above and beyond other
states. Now you're telling the world we're trying to do something about that.
And that has a value."
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley Lounsbury of the Retail Council of New York State said previous
tax-free weeks have been "incredibly successful."
</P>
<P>
	   Nassau, Putnam and Columbia counties will not participate in the tax-free
week. Westchester County will not charge a local sales tax except the cities of
Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, White Plains and Yonkers. The city of Rome, in
Oneida County, will charge only a local sales tax.

<HEADLINE> McCain wants Bush to intercede in New York ballot fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Complaining about "Stalinist politics," John McCain
says Gov. George W. Bush should tell top New York Republicans to halt their
attempts to knock McCain off the state's presidential primary ballot.
<P>
	   Lawyers working for the New York GOP, which is backing Bush's candidacy,
have challenged McCain's petitions to qualify for the March 7 primary ballot in
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Look, the Berlin Wall came down. Let's not have the kind of Stalinist
politics that the state of New York and the Republican Party have been
practicing," McCain said Thursday in Concord, N.H. "Let us be on the ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   Calling himself a "legitimate candidate," McCain said, "don't try to use the
muscle of the New York Republican Party and its apparatchiks to knock us off the
ballot."
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush indicated he wasn't about to help McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   After a speech in Portsmouth, N.H., the Texas governor said, "it's important
for all of us to play by the same rules." Bush defended the complex New York
requirements as "a process to encourage grassroots participation."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said a decision on whether to pursue such
challenges was up to New York party leaders and a top lawyer for New York's
Republican hierarchy said the petition challenge effort was going ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do what we feel is right," lawyer Jeffrey Buley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Bush candidacy has the backing of Gov. George Pataki and
state GOP Chairman William Powers, as well as most of the state's top
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of New York's demanding ballot access rules, only Bush, McCain and
millionaire publisher Steve Forbes are contesting the New York primary.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush and Forbes filed petitions seemingly qualifying themselves for
the GOP primary ballot in all of the state's 31 congressional districts, the
McCain camp has conceded its petitions are probably only adequate to qualify for
the ballot in 25 or 26 of the state's 31 districts.
</P>
<P>
	   That could leave McCain on the GOP ballot in only part of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said his review of the McCain petitions indicates McCain lacks
sufficient signatures from party members in at least six of the state's
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Buley said lawyers are also checking the other McCain petitions to make sure
those signing them are really registered to vote, are enrolled Republicans and
live in the congressional district where they signed the petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, the Bush supporters in New York filed general objections
with the state Board of Elections to the McCain petitions. They have until
Tuesday to follow that up with specific objections that would then be ruled on
by the state board.
</P>
<P>
	   The board plans to certify the primary ballot Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has also filed a federal lawsuit seeking to place his convention
delegate slates on the ballot in all of the state's 31 congressional districts.

<HEADLINE> Consultants' bill: $108,000 to help SUNY 'find' King  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - How much does it cost to find a qualified person to
run the State University of New York?
<P>
	   About $27,000 a block, apparently.
</P>
<P>
	   That's what a Los Angeles consulting firm wants - $108,667 in all - for
helping SUNY run a national search to find its new chancellor, documents
obtained by The Associated Press show.
</P>
<P>
	   That search ended with last month's hiring of former Pataki state Budget
Director Robert King, who worked four blocks away from SUNY's central
administration building the entire time.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a payment to management firm Korn/Ferry International makes no sense,
especially when SUNY already is having money problems, Assembly Majority Leader
Michael Bragman of Onondaga County said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all know that Bob King has always had the inside track for this job and
such a huge payment to an outside consultant is outrageous," Bragman said. "As
far as I know ... I think there was only one other candidate besides Bob King. I
question if a national search was necessary to identify a candidate from within
our state government who works just a few blocks away."
</P>
<P>
	   "It should have only taken a quarter, one call," said Assemblyman Alexander
Grannis, D-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY system is controlled by Gov. George Pataki through his appointments
to the SUNY Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
	   A trustees' search committee unanimously recommended King - a former
prosecutor, colleague of Pataki's in the Legislature and bureaucrat in Pataki's
administration - to be chancellor over Stanley Koplick, chancellor of the
Massachusetts state university system.
</P>
<P>
	   Koplick died Jan. 3, two days after King officially started as SUNY
chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   King's hiring in December culminated a long search which began in January
1999 when former SUNY Chancellor John Ryan said he wanted to retire. Korn/Ferry
was hired in July.
</P>
<P>
	   SUNY spokesman Jon Sorensen said King was not preordained to be chancellor

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Speaks Out With Anger  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flashing anger at those responsible for keeping his son
in Miami, the father of Elian Gonzalez said Thursday he feels like ``breaking
the neck'' of politicians fighting the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Repeating previous statements that he has no intention of coming to Miami to
pick up the boy, Juan Miguel Gonzalez told ABC's ``Nightline'' that Elian's U.S.
relatives don't ``have any feelings.''
</P>
<P>
	   The interview was conducted as Attorney General Janet Reno sought the return
of the 6-year-old child, even while the custody case headed to federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue is a father who wants his son home and grandparents who want
their grandson home and these are bonds that should be honored,'' Reno told her
weekly news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez asked whether, if he went to Miami, his son would be handed over.
``No,'' he said, answering his own question. ``Miami Cubans would just entangle
me in their political games.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in Spanish, with a simultaneous translation, the father grew angry
when he was asked about a news report that he didn't work anymore, didn't live
in his own home and was under psychiatric treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   He called the report ``a lie,'' and added: ``Perhaps I might be a little bit
crazy because I would feel like breaking the neck of all those SOBs'' opposing
Elian's return. He cited ``the politicians in Miami and those who ... have
behaved in a manner that is contrary to what our relatives should have done.''
</P>
<P>
	   At another point, Gonzalez said he ``what I would like to do is go down
there with a rifle.'' Told by interviewer Chris Wallace the remark was
inflammatory, the father responded: ``Isn't it inflammatory what they are doing
with my son?''
</P>
<P>
	   An attorney for Elian's Florida relatives, who are caring for him now, said
they would go to federal court next week to challenge the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's ruling that he must be returned to his father in Cuba
</P>
<P>
	   The INS, meanwhile, rejected a second asylum petition filed this week on
behalf of Elian by his Florida relatives. Justice Department spokeswoman Carole
Florman said that only the boy's father could represent his son before the
agency. Ms. Florman said the new petition contained ``no new information.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube in the Atlantic off Florida on
Thanksgiving. His mother and others fleeing Cuba with him had drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno voiced concern about the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My hope is that people will look at this little boy and get him into a
situation where he can live a normal life without television cameras and the
world in his face,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do you remember when you were 6? There were some days I wanted to run away
from home and there were other days when I wanted my mommy so bad I couldn't
stand it. ... I certainly think the experience of most people is that a
6-year-old is too young to speak for himself.''
</P>
<P>
	   To allow time for a federal court challenge, Reno said Wednesday the INS
indefinitely would extend its Friday deadline for turning the boy over. She
brushed aside a state court ruling delaying the boy's return and said any
challenge to the INS would have to come in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   She explained Thursday that the boy's status is an immigration matter,
solely in the jurisdiction of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that the people involved in this situation care about the little
boy and want to do what's right by him and I think they have also indicated a
faith in the legal process. Let's let that happen,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reno refused to spell out precisely the department's options.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice officials, requesting anonymity, said they could go to federal court
on their own for a ruling that the state court order does not overrule the INS
decision or for an enforcement order to carry out the INS decision. But they
said they wanted to choose the least provocative course, and, though they would
not say so directly, that course appeared to be waiting to respond to any
federal court action filed by the Florida relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Spencer Eig, attorney for the boy's Florida relatives, said they would ask a
federal court for relief next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government should have respected the temporary protective order of the
Florida family court, as it was based on preventing imminent and irreparable
harm to the child,'' Eig said. ``Now we will take the case to a court they
cannot ignore.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro appeared at a rally in Havana on Thursday as
his countrymen kept up their pressure for the boy's return. He did not address
the demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Treatments Law Upheld  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- The Washington Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a
state law requiring health insurance companies to cover such alternative medical
services as chiropractic care, naturopathy and massage therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   The court's unanimous decision ended four years of legal challenges and
cleared the way for consumers to get comprehensive health care from any licensed
provider in Washington, Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Choice of provider is the biggest single issue in health care," Senn said
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Health insurers have been fighting the law since its approval in 1996,
saying it will only result in higher costs for carriers, and ultimately,
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The law requires insurance policies to provide coverage for treatments and
services by every category of licensed health care providers in Washington,
including acupuncturists, chiropractors and certified dietitians, according to
the insurance commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Supreme Court last year declined to hear an appeal challenging the
law.

<TEXT>
<P>
    KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Outfielder Johnny Damon and the Kansas City Royals
agreed Thursday night to a $4 million, one-year contract as the team avoided
avoided arbitration with one of its most popular players.
</P>
<P>
	   Damon, 26, hit .307 with 14 home runs, 39 doubles, 36 stolen bases and 77

</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Damon also was the league's hardest batter to strike out --
just once in every 13.2 at bats.
</P>
<P>
	   Damon has hit .283 in four seasons with the Royals, with 49 home runs, 368
runs, 264 RBIs and 110 stolen bases. He can earn a $100,000 bonus for appearing

<HEADLINE> Dennis Conner Out of America's Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- America True ended Dennis Conner's America's
Cup challenge Friday when it beat Stars and Stripes by 1 minute, 32 seconds in
light wind in the last race of the semifinal series.
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes needed to beat America True to force a sailoff on Saturday
with Prada, which it trailed by a point in the standings. Both boats finished
with 7-3 records in the 10-race semifinals, but Stars and Stripes had a point
deducted for using an illegal rudder in a previous race.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne, which clinched a challenger finals spot two days ago and finished
the semifinals with an 8-2 record, will face Prada in a best-of-9 finals series
beginning Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
	The winner will face Team New Zealand for the America's Cup beginning Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second victory in 10 stars for America True, which moved up to
fifth place from last in the standings. Le Defi Francais, also with a 2-8
record, finished last among the six boats in the semifinals after having half a
point deducted for causing a collision with Stars and Stripes in a previous
race.
</P>
<P>
	Japanese syndicate Nippon finished fourth with a 4-6 record.
</P>
<P>
	Stars and Stripes and America True were the only boats on the Hauraki Gulf on
Friday, sailing a match delayed after the French boat careered into the side of
Conner's boat. Stars and Stripes needed two days for repairs.
</P>
<P>
	Light wind of 7-9 knots hampered Stars and Stripes' chances of winning the race
Friday, with the boat configured for its best performance in stronger air.
</P>
<P>
	America True helmsman John Cutler had the stronger start in the race, and
picked up a favorable wind shift on the first beat for a 90-second lead after
the first of six legs. Stars and Stripes never recovered.
</P>
<P>
	Prada on Thursday night lodged a protest against Team Dennis Conner alleging
the syndicate was using sails originally designed by the Young America team, and
calling for points to be stripped from their tally. It was not clear whether the
Italians would continue with the protest.

<HEADLINE> Gore presents N.J. farmer to rap Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SLOAN, Iowa (AP) - Vice President Al Gore paid for a New Jersey farmer
to stand beside him in Iowa Thursday and give witness that Bill Bradley
neglected agriculture during 18 years in the Senate. "I doubt if, today, he
understands the difference between corn and soybeans," farmer Roy Etsch said.
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, campaigned among New Hampshire business leaders and, in
a newspaper interview, offered new criticism on the old question of whether Gore
was guilty of race-baiting in his 1988 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The day's rat-a-tat fueled an increasingly noisy and negative contest for
the Democratic presidential nomination and its first two rounds of voting in
Iowa, on Jan. 24, and in New Hampshire, on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   His motorcade stirring a storm of dust, Gore ventured down dirt roads to a
farm house outside Sioux City to meet with 150 farmers and show off his know-how
on the complexities of hog packing and commodity pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't have to have a Ph.D. in farm economy to understand this," Gore
said in an apparent swipe at Bradley, the Princeton basketball star and Oxford
scholar.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left the more direct criticism to Etsch, helpfully spelling his name so
reporters in the back of the barn could be sure to get the man's indictment of
his former senator.
</P>
<P>
	   The Middlesex County farmer described Bradley as ignorant of agricultural
policy and unresponsive to the New Jersey farmers he represented for three
Senate terms. "I would call him up and everything else," Etsch said. "I heard
nothing."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, whose campaign paid for Etsch to fly here from his Monroe Township
home, promised to "raise Cain until we fix this farm economy."
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tom Harkin also stood beside Gore in the freezing-cold barn and
assailed Bradley's record on farm policy. The senator, especially popular among
Democrats in Iowa's farming communities, also stars in a new Gore TV ad meant to
underscore that Bradley voted against an amendment that included aid for farmers
hit by 1993 floods.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who trails Gore in Iowa polls by 20 points or more, has conceded he
started the presidential race knowing little about farm policy, but he says he's
learned plenty in 31 visits to Iowa this past year.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with The Associated Press, Bradley said the
farmers' downturn came during the Clinton-Gore watch and he tossed a
long-distance question back at Gore: "Where were you? Where were you when this
was all happening?"
</P>
<P>
	   Separately, in a published discussion with The Boston Herald, Bradley said
Gore had introduced the issue of escaped murderer Willie Horton in the 1988
Democratic primary campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
	   Horton, a black man who committed rape while on furlough, became a symbol of
racially divisive campaigning during the Dukakis-Bush general election race
later that year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Gore introduced him into the lexicon," Bradley said. "It bothers me a great
deal. ... I wouldn't have used Willie Horton."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore could have found other examples if he wanted to show that Dukakis was
soft on crime, Bradley said. "The racial dimension to that - there were probably
a lot of other people who fit into that category."
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign, which is bringing Dukakis to Iowa next week to campaign
for Gore, immediately put reporters in contact with the former Massachusetts
governor and marshaled a denunciation from House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unfair to attack Gore in this way because it just isn't true," Dukakis
told the AP in a telephone interview from California.
</P>
<P>
	   When Gore questioned him about the prison furlough program during a 1988
debate, Gore did not name Willie Horton and "there certainly was no suggestion
on the racial side," Dukakis said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There weren't any pictures of Willie Horton as there was in the Bush attack
ads" that aired during the general election fight with then-Vice President
George Bush, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Estrich, campaign manager for Dukakis in 1988, said it didn't matter
whether Gore used Horton's name because "he had become the symbol of the
furlough problem well in advance" of that April 1988 debate.
</P>
<P>
	   "In political terms, it's fair to say the Willie Horton issue was the
furlough issue and the furlough issue was the Willie Horton issue. And, it had
such racial overtones and was so divisive, frankly we were surprised when he
raised it in the debate," Estrich said Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement that Gore aides handed out as the vice president campaigned
later Thursday in Nashua, N.H., Gephardt said Bradley's statement "unfairly
smears" Gore.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Said Wary Over Japan Economy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency said Friday that
Group of Seven nations are worried about whether or not Japan can continue
government spending to bolster its weak economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think each country is concerned whether or not Japan's active fiscal
policy will reach a breaking point," said Taichi Sakaiya when asked at a regular
press conference about the upcoming G7 meeting in Tokyo on Jan. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakaiya said the government aimed first to establish positive economic
growth and a sound economy and then to restore the nation's fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakaiya said consumer sentiment is improving, despite indications that it
may be flagging.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a survey by Nippon Research Institute, an EPA affiliate,
consumer sentiment deteriorated in December compared with two months earlier, as
people grew more concerned about future economic conditions, employment and
income.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute said Thursday its overall index of consumer anxiety stood at
136 in December, up from 131 in October, marking the first time sentiment had
worsened in eight months.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakaiya said the poor bonuses paid out in December were likely behind the
worsening consumer mood.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Penguins 3  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Brian Rolston recorded his fifth game-winning goal of the
season to lift the Colorado Avalanche past the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Sakic had four assists and Peter Forsberg added three for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Roy had 25 saves for his 428th career victory. He trails only Terry
Sawchuk (447) and Jacques Plante (434) on the NHL's career list.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins, who got 18 saves from Tom Barrasso, rallied from a 3-1 deficit
on goals by Matthew Barnaby and Tyler Wright early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Rolston's goal, however, kept the Avalanche unbeaten in their last seven
home games (6-0-1). After Forsberg kept the puck at the blue line with his
skate, Rolston unloaded a shot from the left circle at 14:28 of the third period
between Barrasso's legs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche, particularly defenseman Adam Foote, kept Pittsburgh's
prolific Jaromir Jagr in check throughout most of the game. Jagr, the NHL's
leading scorer with 72 points, managed only an assist on Barnaby's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In a free-wheeling game that was typical of two of the best skating teams in
the NHL, Colorado's Dave Reid scored just 55 seconds into the first period, from
the right circle on a pass from Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
	   The assist enabled Forsberg to equal his career-best points streak of 10
games.
</P>
<P>
	   At 11:03, the Penguins tied it when German Titov carried the puck along the
left boards and jammed in a rebound of his own wraparound attempt to the left of
Roy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche lost forward Adam Deadmarsh to a knee injury in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado withstood some early Pittsburgh power plays in the second period,
including the Penguins' 5-on-3 advantage for 1:05, and then scored twice late in
the period.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 4-on-4 situation, Sandis Ozolinsh scored from the slot at 15:02. With
Jagr and Darius Kasparaitis both in the penalty box moments later, Colorado
capitalized on the 5-on-3 advantage as Milan Hejduk beat Barrasso from the left
circle at 16:16 for his 21st goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnaby took a long pass from Jagr and made it 3-2 at 4:42 of the third
period. Just 1:05 later, Wright tipped in a rebound of Michal Rozsival's shot
for the tie.

<HEADLINE> Pedro Gets Cy Young Award at Dinner  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez was back in Boston on Thursday to tell
snowbound Red Sox fans just what they needed to hear.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we keep playing the way we have, all we need is for the Yankees to slide
just a little bit more and we're going to catch them," he said at the Boston
chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America's annual awards dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   "I hope that we can go a little bit further," said Martinez, who was
presented with the AL Cy Young Award by his brother, Red Sox teammate Ramon
Martinez. "And, if we can, we're going to the World Series."
</P>
<P>
	   Martinez won the pitcher's triple crown, leading the AL with a 23-4 record,
2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts en route to his second Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
	   He rescued the Red Sox from elimination in Game 5 of their first-round
playoff series against Cleveland, coming out of the bullpen with six hitless
innings as Boston advanced to play the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   In the championship series, he beat Roger Clemens to hand New York its only
loss in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Martinez thinks the Red Sox are poised to improve, he can't promise
that he will produce the same results.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never dreamed of having a year like that," he said. "I just hope they
don't expect me to be the same way."
</P>
<P>
	   Martinez also received the Thomas A. Yawkey memorial award as the Red Sox
MVP. Also receiving awards were AL Manager of the Year Jimy Williams and Marlins
third baseman Mike Lowell, who survived testicular cancer and was given the Tony
Conigliaro Award for overcoming adversity.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Mondor, the owner of the Red Sox Triple-A affiliate in Pawtucket, R.I.,
won the Judge Emil Fuchs Memorial Award for long and meritorious service to
baseball. The award is named for the former owner of the Boston Braves.
</P>
<P>
	   Also:
</P>
<P>
	   --Reds general manager Jim Bowden, who built a winner in Cincinnati despite
the 20th largest payroll in baseball, received the executive of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra got a special achievement award for leading
the AL with a .357 average.
</P>
<P>
	   --Catcher Jason Varitek got the Jackie Jensen award for hustle and grit.
</P>
<P>
	   --Outfielder Trot Nixon and first baseman Brian Daubach shared the Harry
Agganis award as Red Sox co-rookies of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Derek Lowe was voted Red Sox reliever of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Red Sox vice president Mike Port was given the Tommy McCarthy memorial
good guy award.
</P>
<P>
	   --Pawtucket third baseman Wilton Veras was selected Boston's minor league
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Recently retired Boston Herald sports writer Joe Giuliotti was given the
Dave O'Hara award for service to the Boston BBWAA chapter.
</P>
<P>
	   --Outfielder Fred Lynn won the former Red Sox player award to commemorate
the 25th anniversary of the 1975 season, when he won both the AL MVP and Rookie
of the Year awards.
</P>
<P>
	   --Houston first baseman Jeff Bagwell was voted the New England player of the
year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Former Boston third baseman Wade Boggs got a special achievement award for
reaching the 3,000-hit plateau with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, new Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett, acquired in a trade with
Houston, said he wouldn't rule out signing a long-term deal with Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not saying I'm going to boogie after a year. I would be a fool to say
that," he said. "I weigh everything."

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Deadline on Bid Looms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The war of words between telecom giants Vodafone
AirTouch PLC and Mannesmann AG has escalated with full-page newspaper ads,
billboard campaigns and television spots, ahead of a deadline for Mannesmann's
response to the hostile takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
	   German-based Mannesmann was to release its official defense documents today,
outlining its argument against the takeover by British-based Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies have inundated stockholders with appeals to either support or
reject the buyout offer. Mannesmann shareholders have until Feb. 7 to accept the
all-stock, $127 billion bid from Vodafone, the world's No. 1 mobile phone
company.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Thursday, an influential shareholder consultancy dealt Mannesmann a
last-minute blow when it weighed in on the side of Vodafone, saying Mannesmann
shareholders should support a merger because "clear strategic benefits outweigh
any risk factors."
</P>
<P>
	   Institutional Shareholder Services, a Maryland-based shareholder adviser,
has about 500 institutional clients in the United States. A spokesman said its
clients are a "significant" number of U.S. Mannesmann and Vodafone shareholders,
but declined to give exact figures.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of Mannesmann shares are held outside Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The news came as Mannesmann stepped up its battle to woo shareholders by
buying full page ads in The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times and the
German business daily Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann said last week it expects to spend nearly $200 million defending
itself against Vodafone, pouring that money into the ads and a series of
international roadshows by chairman Klaus Esser and other top company officials
to meet with investors and analysts.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone has also thrown its money around, launching ads that beckon, "The
future is global. It will take a global company with global resources and global
vision to make it happen. That's what we offer Mannesmann shareholders."

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 4, Penguins 3  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Brian Rolston recorded his fifth game-winning goal of the
season to lift the Colorado Avalanche past the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg each had three assists for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Roy had 25 saves for his 428th career victory. He trails only Terry
Sawchuk (447) and Jacques Plante (434) on the NHL's career list.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins, who got 18 saves from Tom Barrasso, rallied from a 3-1 deficit
on goals by Matthew Barnaby and Tyler Wright early in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   Rolston's goal, however, kept the Avalanche unbeaten in their last seven
home games (6-0-1). After Forsberg kept the puck at the blue line with his
skate, Rolston unloaded a shot from the left circle at 14:28 of the third period
between Barrasso's legs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche, particularly defenseman Adam Foote, kept Pittsburgh's
prolific Jaromir Jagr in check throughout most of the game. Jagr, the NHL's
leading scorer with 72 points, managed only an assist on Barnaby's goal.
</P>
<P>
	   In a free-wheeling game that was typical of two of the best skating teams in
the NHL, Colorado's Dave Reid scored just 55 seconds into the first period, from
the right circle on a pass from Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
	   The assist enabled Forsberg to equal his career-best points streak of 10
games.
</P>
<P>
	   At 11:03, the Penguins tied it when German Titov carried the puck along the
left boards and jammed in a rebound of his own wraparound attempt to the left of
Roy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche lost forward Adam Deadmarsh to a knee injury in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado withstood some early Pittsburgh power plays in the second period,
including the Penguins' 5-on-3 advantage for 1:05, and then scored twice late in
the period.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 4-on-4 situation, Sandis Ozolinsh scored from the slot at 15:02. With
Jagr and Darius Kasparaitis both in the penalty box moments later, Colorado
capitalized on the 5-on-3 advantage as Milan Hejduk beat Barrasso from the left
circle at 16:16 for his 21st goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnaby took a long pass from Jagr and made it 3-2 at 4:42 of the third
period. Just 1:05 later, Wright tipped in a rebound of Michal Rozsival's shot
for the tie.

Greenspan: Imbalances Could Derail Economy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans, enjoying the most prosperous times in a
generation, have fueled a remarkable economic boom, but there are dangers that
growing imbalances could derail the economic expansion, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Thursday. Greenspan noted that next month it will become the
longest expansion in U.S. history, surpassing the 106 months of uninterrupted
growth in the 1960s. However, Greenspan also repeated worries that the Federal
Reserve must be alert to the growing imbalances between continued strong
consumer demand, bolstered by Americans' soaring stock portfolios, and the
dwindling supply of available workers, given that unemployment is now at a
30-year low.

that he has no intention of coming to Miami to pick up the boy, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez told ABC's "Nightline" that Elian's U.S. relatives don't "have any
feelings." The interview was conducted as Attorney General Janet Reno sought the
return of the 6-year-old child, even while the custody case headed to federal
court.

Venezuela-Bound US Ship Coming Home

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon on Thursday ordered home a U.S. troop ship

said he did not want American soldiers in his country. A second shipload of U.S.
soldiers and equipment already held back at a North Carolina port while
Washington sought to clarify President Hugo Chavez's comments will not deploy,
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said. Chavez's government requested the aid in late
December, and the USS Tortuga had left for Venezuela with bulldozers, tractors
and engineering equipment.

State of the Union address, Clinton opened an election-year drive to win
congressional approval of $5 billion worth of tax incentives over 10 years to
encourage investment in depressed areas under a program he calls "New Markets."
"Economic opportunity should be the birthright of every American," Clinton said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Rebels on Thursday renewed a three-month humanitarian
cease-fire in war-torn areas of southern Sudan. The new cease-fire will take
effect Saturday when the current one expires, the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army said in a statement. The SPLA was renewing the cease-fire due to
the "prevailing hunger induced by the combination of war and natural causes such
as alternating drought and floods," the statement said. Rebels in the
predominantly Christian and animist south want increased autonomy and
development in their region.

<HEADLINE> Kings 107, Spurs 103  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Chris Webber had 34 points and 19 rebounds
Thursday night as the Sacramento Kings rallied in the fourth quarter for a
107-103 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber ignited the rally, scoring 10 straight points for the Kings in one
stretch. Sacramento won its third straight game and became only the second team
this year to score over 100 points against the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite going over four minutes without a field goal in the fourth quarter,
the Kings maintained a slim lead after coming back from a 12-point deficit
midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber made an acrobatic basket off a drive and followed with a jumper over
Tim Duncan, putting the Kings ahead 101-96 with 2:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan had 33 points and 20 rebounds for San Antonio, which had a three-game
win streak snapped. David Robinson had 17 points and Avery Johnson added 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Williams scored 22 points for Sacramento and Nick Anderson had 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Predrag Stojakovic opened the fourth quarter with two 3-pointers and a
jumper. The Kings made six of their first seven shots, including a jumper by
Webber, to go ahead 95-90 with 8:05 left.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the Duncan show in the first half. The 7-foot forward scored 20
points and had 12 rebounds, helping San Antonio take a 61-54 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite three fouls, Robinson had 11 first-half points and Terry Porter came
off the bench for 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber had 14 points and eight rebounds in the opening half and Williams
added 13 points for Sacramento, which shot 39 percent.

<HEADLINE> In annual address, Giuliani announces new initiatives, tax cuts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In what may have been his final state of the city
address, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani focused on tried-and-true issues like crime and
welfare reduction, but also threw in a few curves.
<P>
	   In his 99-minute speech at City Hall on Thursday, he promised to sell the
Board of Education building, seize the cars of reckless drivers and cut taxes by
$2 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani - expected to run for the U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham
Clinton - also said that his seventh annual address might be his last, and
devoted much of his speech to topics he never tires of discussing: His
administration's success in expanding the economy and cutting crime and welfare
rates.
</P>
<P>
	   Standing in front of a huge color photograph of the New Year's celebration
at Times Square two weeks ago, Giuliani called the event the high point of his
six years in office.
</P>
<P>
	   "This represents the culmination of all the work I've done, all the work
we've done," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor's most provocative remarks, however, were about education - an
issue for which he has been criticized in the past for spending too little money
and for hounding successive school chancellors out of office.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, he continued his years-long verbal assault on the Board of
Education, saying the structure of the system guarantees failure because
administrators are more focused on preserving jobs than on educating children.
The solution, he said, is widespread privatization of the school system.
</P>
<P>
	   But acknowledging that he lacks the power to overhaul the bureaucracy
himself, Giuliani said the city will instead sell the board's Brooklyn
headquarters, and in return, give the board a much smaller facility in order to
force it to reduce the size of its bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Seriously, we're going to sell it," he said. "The system doesn't work. It
hasn't worked in a long time, and it's about time we moved on to a more
accountable system."
</P>
<P>
	   It is unclear how serious the mayor is because the Board of Education, which
would have to approve such a move, is highly unlikely to do so. Last year,
Giuliani called for the board to be "blown up."
</P>
<P>
	   As an example of the sorry state of the city's schools, Giuliani said the
reading scores of students had actually dropped last year after they had
completed remedial summer school courses. He called on summer school classes
this year to be privatized.
</P>
<P>
	   "They can't do the job," he said, before shouting in what appeared to be
theatrical anger. "It's a tragedy. It's a tragedy ... It isn't a joke, it isn't
politics. You only get one chance to educate a child."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman from the Board of Education did not immediately return a call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a new crime initiative, Giuliani said the city would embark on a program
next week to seize the vehicles of reckless drivers. The program is a follow-up
to the city's policy of taking the vehicles of drunk drivers. Among the
misdemeanor charges under which a person's car could be taken are illegal lane
changes and speeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani also proposed $2 billion in tax cuts, including eliminating the
commercial rent tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Among his other plans, Giuliani said he would create a new home ownership
program; seek to build a state-of-the-art DNA laboratory to test the genetic
data of criminal suspects; push for they city to host the Olympics in 2012 with
a new stadium on the West Side as the centerpiece; create a new park along the
East River; and rename homeless shelters "New Start Centers."
</P>
<P>
	   After the talk, Public Advocate Mark Green, who often serves as Giuliani's
chief foil, said he liked much of the speech - with the exception of the mayor's
ignoring the promise of the city's Internet firms and the mayor's "scape-goating
of teachers."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone was also critical.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor made it clear that when it comes to education, the needs of our
children and teachers are an afterthought," he said.

<HEADLINE> SC Johnson Pulls Dust-mite Products  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- Two new dust-mite control products are being recalled
because of reports that the fragrance caused physical reactions in some people.
</P>
<P>
	   SC Johnson of Racine said Thursday it was advising retail stores across the
country to remove AllerCare Dust Mite Carpet Powder and AllerCare Dust Mite
Allergen Spray from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   Company spokeswoman Cynthia Georgeson said less than 0.5 percent of people
who used the products reported problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately, the company could not separate these highly sensitive
consumers, who should not use these products, from the general allergy-suffering
public for whom the products were designed,'' the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   The most common reactions were runny noses and watery eyes and some throat
irritation, Georgeson said. Other reported breathing problems among asthma
sufferers and a burning sensation on the skin.
</P>
<P>
	   AllerCare products were introduced last fall after nearly 10 years of
investigation and development. It was the company's first entirely new line of
home cleaning products since the stain remover Shout was introduced in 1975.

<HEADLINE> NY Gallery Exhibits Lynching Photos  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Once upon a time in America, mobs dragged people out of
jails or off the streets and hanged them from the nearest tree. Sometimes they
burned them alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, often as not, members of the mob lined up to be photographed with the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of these sobering pictures-- some of them turned into postcards that
were occasionally used as warnings -- have been put on public display today at a
Manhattan gallery.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clear to me that this is a piece of history that demands an audience,"
said Andrew Roth, co-owner of the Roth Horowitz Gallery.
</P>
<P>
	   There are photos of corpses of young black men hanging from branches,
telephone poles and, in one case, a bridge. There is a shot of a man being
incinerated and another of "the half-burned head of James" on a pole.
</P>
<P>
	   The material was gathered over the past decade by James Allen, a
Georgia-based dealer in antiques and memorabilia, and are now part of the
Allen-Littlefield Collection at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Picture after picture shows people gathered around the dangling bodies --
some likely perpetrators of the crime, others simply curious bystanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The amateurish snapshots reveal a sameness about southern racist mobs and
western posses carrying out vigilante justice -- rawboned, angular-faced men
wearing hats. In some, small children watch the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims are overwhelmingly black.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People reported
3,436 people lynched between 1889 and 1922. One photo in the collection is dated
1960.
</P>
<P>
	   During the peak years, most victims were black men accused of offenses
ranging from murder and rape to not stepping off the sidewalk to let a white
person pass. It was not a strictly Southern practice, and whether in Gadsden,
Alabama, Duluth, Minn., or the "Hanging Tree" in Helena, Mont., someone with a
camera was there.
</P>
<P>
	   Many photos were turned into souvenir postcards, some colorized and
inscribed with such notations as "Down in Old Kentucky," or "Negro who shot J.H.
Rogers at Ten Mile, Miss., 5-21-19."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one series of photos, from a double lynching in Okeman, Okla., in
1911, was copyrighted by the photographer.
</P>
<P>
	   The postcards with one-cent stamps could be sent legally through the mail
until about 1908, when they were banned. "I bought this in Hopkinsville for 15
cents. It's not on sale openly (the law forbids it)," an anonymous correspondent
wrote on the back of one postcard.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the exhibit's most chilling entry is a 1921 pamphlet issued by the
National Association of Colored People. It reproduced the Jan. 26 and 27 front
pages of the Memphis (Tenn.) Press that provided an account of a white mob
seizing a black youth from a jail in Georgia and transporting him to Arkansas,
where he was burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper duly reported how the kidnappers stopped off in Memphis and were
seen "laughing and talking" in the lobby of the Hotel Peabody, and how police
guarded the roads but did nothing to interfere -- more than a decade before the
FBI won the power to take charge of interstate crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Questions," Roth said when asked what people should take away from the
exhibit. "Questions about our culture, our history, our times.
</P>
<P>
	   "People aren't being lynched today, that we know about, but there certainly
are references ... that we hear on the news, morning noon and night, that
connect back to this history."

<HEADLINE> War Tribunal To Rule on Six Croats  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- In passing judgment on six Croats accused of
attacking a village some of them once called home, the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal has had to grapple with one of the central questions of the Balkan
conflict: how friendly neighbors became blood enemies.
</P>
<P>
	   In its largest trial yet, the U.N. tribunal was expected to decide today
whether the defendants are guilty of taking part in a killing spree in the
central Bosnian village of Ahmici.
</P>
<P>
	   The six stand accused of belonging to bands of armed Croatians who descended
on the central Bosnian village and killed at least 103 Muslims, including 33
women and children, on a spring day in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Entire families were gunned down, scores of houses were torched, and two
mosques were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the defendants were rank-and-file militiamen, some had grown up in
Ahmici and lived alongside those they are accused of assaulting.
</P>
<P>
	   After 16 months of hearings and testimony from 158 witnesses in the trial,
the tribunal was to pass verdicts on brothers Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic; their
cousin, Vlatko Kupreskic; and Vladimir Santic, Drago Josipovic and Dragan Papic.
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, the men
face up to life in prison in one of several European countries that have offered
to incarcerate Balkan war criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. court has handed down eight convictions since its establishment in
1993. Seven of those convictions are under appeal, and only one convict has
served out his term in Norway.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial is the tribunal's largest in terms of the number of defendants,
but is just one of five in a series known as the ``Lasva River Valley
Indictment.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the indictment, Bosnian Croat militia conducted ``a highly
coordinated military operation'' to empty the area around the valley of Muslim
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial of Gen. Timohir Blaskic, commander of Croatian forces in the area,
finished last July, but no date has been announced for a verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   Muslim villager Sakib Ahmic testified that he had watched the Kupreskic
brothers ``grow up into decent people'' until the fighting broke out in the
village.
</P>
<P>
	   On April 16, 1993, the Kupreskics broke into Ahmic's home and murdered his
son Naser and daughter-in-law Zehrudina, as well as their children Elvis, 4, and
Sejad, 3, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahmic said he was forced to watch the horror unfold, and suffered severe
burns when the attackers set fire to the home and fled.
</P>
<P>
	   Norwegian anthropologist Tone Bringa, who spent eight years studying
interethnic relations in rural Bosnia, was called as an expert witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the war, she said, Muslim Bosnians and their Roman Catholic Croat
neighbors had been ``aware of their religious differences, but were tolerant
towards them.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, propaganda by nationalist leaders and reports of violence elsewhere
in the former Yugoslav republic sparked fear and suspicion, she told the court
in July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As Yugoslavia disintegrated, and the national ideology took over, the
understanding of neighbors of different faith underwent a gradual change,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate case, an appeals court begins hearing today the case of
Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic. In the tribunal's longest running case, dating back to
April 1995, Tadic is accused of murder, torture and rape in an ethnic purge by
Serb forces in northwest Bosnia in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Heads for Georgia  </HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS MEIXLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- As Russia tries to batter Chechen rebels into
submission, Turkey and other countries in the region are looking to each other
for support against what they see as an increasingly assertive Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel flies to Georgia today for two days of
meetings with his Georgian and Azerbaijani counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit is expected to focus on Russia's war in Chechnya and plans to
build a pipeline that would bring oil from the Caspian Sea to Turkey, bypassing
Russia. Russia sees the pipeline as a way of cutting its influence in the region
and has opposed the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Both Georgia and Azerbaijan are extremely concerned about destabilization
by Moscow,'' said Alan Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Azerbaijan and Georgia both look at Turkey as their strongest supporter in
the region,'' he said. ``They don't see Turkey as a pound-for-pound match for
Russia, but they see it as the most powerful ally that they have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has military agreements with both countries and since the fall of the
Soviet Union has been vying with Russia for influence in Central Asia and the
Caucasus, regions where Turks and Russians have competed for centuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turkey is acting as a big brother,'' Makovsky said. But he quickly added
that ``Turkey is not going to do something that is unnecessarily provocative
toward Russia.''

	   Although Georgia is a largely Christian country, many people in

Georgia and Chechnya. Azerbaijan is a Turkic Muslim nation like Turkey and
Azeris speak a language that is easily understood by Turks.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in Chechnya has heightened tensions between Moscow and the Caucasus
nations. Russia has accused Georgia -- the only foreign country to border the
breakaway republic -- of harboring Chechen militants, a charge that Georgia
denies. Azerbaijan fears that instability in the Caucasus could spill over to
its territory.

<HEADLINE> China Military Official Said Jailed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A high-ranking Chinese Air Force official has been sentenced
to 17 years in prison on charges he played a key role in the banned Falun Gong
meditation movement, a rights group said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu Changxin, 74, a former professor at the Air Force Command Institute, was
tried in secret Jan. 6 by the Air Force Military Court, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu, who held a cabinet minister-level rank, was convicted of using a cult to
undermine the law, the center said in a statement faxed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Ministry of Defense refused to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu was accused of being a power behind the scenes and helping Falun Gong
founder Li Hongzhi to publish and sell the group's materials, the Information
Center said.
</P>
<P>
	   Li lives in exile in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Yu joined Li's movement in 1992, the year it started in China, the group
said. Li attracted millions of Chinese across the country with his teachings,
which borrowed from Buddhism, Taoism and qigong, a Chinese practice of
meditation and exercise meant to harness unseen forces to improve health.
</P>
<P>
	   The government banned Falun Gong in July, alarmed by its organizational
ability and large following, which Li says includes many Communist Party
members.
</P>
<P>
	   The Information Center estimated 5,000 Falun Gong followers have been sent
without trial to labor camps and about 300 others face trial.
</P>
<P>
	   In the biggest trial of organizers so far, four people were sentenced Dec.
26 to up to 18 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Colorful Candidates in Finnish Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTI HUUHTANEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finns, accustomed to timid campaigns and
undemonstrative politicians, now have colorful candidates to choose from in this
week's presidential elections, but few prominent political issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the seven candidates are women -- including the speaker of
parliament, who has openly written about making love on a waterbed; the foreign
minister, who refuses to join the church or marry her longtime boyfriend; and a
former defense minister and U.N. peace envoy who claims she only knows dirty
jokes that cannot be repeated in public.
</P>
<P>
	   Finland has never had a female president.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading male contender is a 45-year-old ex-prime minister, dubbed the
``Kennedy of Finland'' by local media for his dapper style. Against Finnish
custom, he has included in the campaign his four children and a stylish wife,
Kirsti.
</P>
<P>
	   Finns will go to the polls to choose a president Sunday for only the second
time since the Nordic country gained independence from Russia in 1917.
Previously, voters cast ballots for an electoral college which chose the
president, in a process marred by political bargaining.
</P>
<P>
	   President Martti Ahtisaari dominated the first election in 1994. But he is
not seeking a second term and this year's election is marked by a lack of
issues, though not enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirty-two percent of the 4.2 million electorate have already cast their
ballots in a week of advance voting at post offices, foreshadowing a high
turnout for the actual poll Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unlikely that any of the contenders will get the required majority of
50 percent in Sunday's election, which means that a runoff will be held on Feb.
6 between the two with the most votes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Finnish head of state is responsible for foreign relations and security
policy but seldom takes part in domestic politics -- which is left to the prime
minister and parliament. A new constitution that comes into force in March,
further reduces the president's role.
</P>
<P>
	   That leads many Finns to see the post as purely ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
	   Elisabeth Rehn, 64, the first female defense minister of a Western country,
who led opinion polls in the early stages of the race, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president provides moral leadership outside day-to-day politics. That
is most important,'' said Rehn, who was narrowly defeated by Ahtisaari in the
1994 vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Rehn, who promised that if elected she would learn cleaner jokes, appears to
have lost her early lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent opinion polls have put Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen and former
prime minister Esko Aho of the opposition Center Party solidly ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen, 56, of the Social Democrat party, has said that she will not join
the Evangelical Lutheran Church in a country where 85 percent of the population
belongs to the church.
</P>
<P>
	   Lagging behind in the polls is Heidi Hautala, 44, of the Green Party and
member of the European Parliament who founded Finland's leading vegetarian
restaurant in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Other male candidates include Risto Kuisma -- a former hard-drinking, tough
union boss who now is active in the temperance movement -- and Ilkka Hakalehto,
a solitary historian who opposes Finland's membership in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The election campaign has been short on issues. Relations with neighboring
Russia have become warmer with the 1991 Soviet collapse, Finland joined the
European Union in 1995 and there is a consensus among politicians on the
country's policy of neutrality, which includes close cooperation with NATO
without joining the alliance.
</P>
<P>
	   But for some, the issues are not an issue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came to see her entertain. She's such a great personality,'' said Irmeli
Rinne, a teacher, who watched as Finland's first female speaker of parliament,
Riitta Uosukainen, flung her arms around in non-Finnish style while talking to a
captive audience in a shopping mall.

<HEADLINE> Blues 3, Kings 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Scott Young scored the go-ahead goal on a power play as
the St. Louis Blues beat the Los Angeles Kings 3-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamal Mayers and Lubos Bartecko jump-started St. Louis with goals less than
1 1/2 minutes apart late in the first period as the Blues extended their
unbeaten streak to eight games with their fourth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues improved to 27-11-6 and, coupled with Detroit's 5-3 loss to
Chicago, have a league-leading 60 points -- one more than the Red Wings and the
idle New Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryan Smolinski recorded his first multiple-goal game with the Kings, who
have won only twice in their last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Murray, who set up Los Angeles' first goal, left the game in the first
period with a bruised chest after taking a heavy check against the boards by
Tyson Nash. X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
	   Kings defenseman Sean O'Donnell was serving an interference penalty when the
Blues regained the lead with 13:25 to play. Al MacInnis got a cross-ice pass
from Chris Pronger at the right point and sent a shot toward the net that grazed
Young's stick and dribbled between Stephane Fiset's pads. Young's goal was his
14th.
</P>
<P>
	   Smolinski's 12th goal of the season tied the score with 29 seconds left in
the second period. Garry Galley got the puck from Jaroslav Modry as he came out
of the penalty box and sent Ziggy Palffy into the St. Louis zone on a two-on-one
with Smolinski against Pronger. Smolinski's 10-foot wrist shot from the left of
the net found room between Roman Turek's glove and the post.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues, who obtained two-time 50-goal scorer Stephane Richer hours
earlier in a trade with Tampa Bay to bolster their offense, managed only three
shots in the first period -- and just one through the first 17 minutes and 22
seconds. But they escaped with a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayers won a foot race with rookie Jere Karalahti for a loose puck deep in
the Kings' zone and beat Fiset between the pads on the Blues' next shot to tie
the score 1-1. Moments later, Bartecko was credited with his 10th goal when
Pavol Demitra's slap shot from the top of the right circle ricocheted off
Bartecko's stick and the leg of Kings defenseman Rob Blake.
</P>
<P>
	   Smolinski opened the scoring at 3:36 of the first period with his 15th goal.
Luc Robitaille crossed the St. Louis blue line with the puck and fed it in the
middle to Murray, who pulled the puck back as Scott Pellerin whizzed past him
and took a 40-foot wrist shot that deflected off Smolinski and into the top
right corner past Turek's stick hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Turek made 24 saves while stretching his unbeaten streak to seven games
(6-0-1). The Blues, who own the league's third-best road record at 12-6-2, have
won 10 of their last 14 games away from Kiel Center.

<HEADLINE> Rockets 108, Warriors 100  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Cuttino Mobley scored 14 of his 23 points in the
fourth quarter and the Houston Rockets held off the Golden State Warriors
108-100 Thursday night for their first road win in more than a month.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Francis added 19 points, Shandon Anderson had 17 and Walt Williams and
Kenny Thomas 13 apiece for the Rockets, who snapped a seven-game road losing
streak that began in Philadelphia on Dec. 8 in what turned out to be Charles
Barkley's last game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warriors lost their 11th straight, matching a season-high. Golden State
also lost 11 in a row from Nov. 17 to Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Garry St. Jean remained winless in eight games since taking over Dec. 27 for
the fired P.J. Carlesimo.
</P>
<P>
	   Mookie Blayloock scored 25 points to lead the Warriors. Jason Caffey added
24 points and Antawn Jamison had 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Adfter being down by five heading into the fourth quarter, the Warriors
pulled to 94-92 on Caffey's spinning layup with 3:45 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Rockets made the key plays down the stretch, outscoring the Warriors
14-8 over the last 3:26.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis and Thomas each converted three-point plays to ignite the finishing
flurry and Mobley twice blew past defenders for layups.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams finished a fast break with a layup and Bill Curley, signed by
Houston earlier in the day, rebounded a missed free throw and put it in for
another basket as part of Houston's 8-2 burst over the last two minutes of the
third period to move in front 80-75.
</P>
<P>
	   Moments after Blaylock converted a three-point play, Bryce Drew hit a
3-pointer as time expired in the first half, tying it at 53-all.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State broke away from a 13-all tie with 9-0 run capped by Jamison's
offensive rebound and dunk, but the Rockets scored 10 of the next 12 points,
pulling to 24-23 at the end of the first quarter on successive 3-pointers by
Williams and Mobley.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal attends college dedication in his honor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Cardinal John O'Connor has turned down many offers to
have buildings and institutions named for him. But when the College of New
Rochelle asked to dedicate a new building in his honor, he decided to accept.
<P>
	   "There is no way I could resist such a kind offer," O'Connor said in a
letter read by Bishop Patrick Sheridan at a dedication ceremony Thursday.
"Education has been one of my key concerns since coming to New York."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor's spirits were up and his voice was strong when he spoke during the
dedication of the college's South Bronx campus. But he sat throughout the
ceremony, walked with a cane and asked someone else to blow out the candles on a
cake honoring his 80th birthday, which is Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal had a brain tumor removed in August and has curtailed his
public schedule in recent months. Because cardinals lose their power to vote for
a new pope when they turn 80, it is believed the Vatican will replace him in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
	   But College of New Rochelle President Stephen Sweeney asserted that the
dedication of the building in his name was not "connected with his health
challenges or his age, which the cardinal reminds us will surely be acknowledged
by the pope sooner rather than later. Rather ours is a genuine esteem and
admiration for the cardinal."
</P>
<P>
	   He said O'Connor provides "the example of a man of faith whose devotion to
the sacredness of life at all stages, to the poor, to racial harmony, to
religious tolerance and ecumenism and to justice is legendary."
</P>
<P>
	   As he left the newly renovated building in the Morrisania section of the
Bronx, O'Connor told reporters: "I came from a relatively poor family of a bunch
of kids in Philadelphia. I never dreamed that anything of this sort would
happen, that I would be given the honor of having my name attached to any
college or any university. I'm deeply grateful."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked his thoughts on turning 80, he said: "I'm getting old." As for his
birthday wish, he said: "To live among you New Yorkers for the next 100 years."
</P>
<P>
	   The College of New Rochelle was founded in 1904 by the Ursuline Order of
nuns and was the first Catholic college for women in New York State. The co-ed
campus named for the cardinal, the School of New Resources, is in Morrisania.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Heads for Georgia  </HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS MEIXLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- As Russia tries to batter Chechen rebels into
submission, Turkey and other countries in the region are looking to each other
for support against what they see as an increasingly assertive Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish President Suleyman Demirel flies to Georgia today for two days of
meetings with his Georgian and Azerbaijani counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   The summit is expected to focus on Russia's war in Chechnya and plans to
build a pipeline that would bring oil from the Caspian Sea to Turkey, bypassing
Russia. Russia sees the pipeline as a way of cutting its influence in the region
and has opposed the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Both Georgia and Azerbaijan are extremely concerned about destabilization
by Moscow,'' said Alan Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Azerbaijan and Georgia both look at Turkey as their strongest supporter in
the region,'' he said. ``They don't see Turkey as a pound-for-pound match for
Russia, but they see it as the most powerful ally that they have.''
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has military agreements with both countries and since the fall of the
Soviet Union has been vying with Russia for influence in Central Asia and the
Caucasus, regions where Turks and Russians have competed for centuries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turkey is acting as a big brother,'' Makovsky said. But he quickly added
that ``Turkey is not going to do something that is unnecessarily provocative
toward Russia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ties between Turkey and Georgia and Azerbaijan are strong.

<HEADLINE> Populist Becomes Guatemala President  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA WIDES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Alfonso Portillo, a populist lawyer who won elections
with an overwhelming majority, becomes the first Guatemalan president in nearly
40 years to take office during peacetime.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo, who is sworn in today, won 68 percent of the vote in a December
run-off election, more than any other presidential candidate has received in the
last 50 years. But analysts are uncertain what direction will be taken by
Portillo, a former Marxist who became a protege of former military dictator
Efrain Rios Montt.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps because of those paradoxical ties, he has created one of the
broadest-based coalitions in the Central American country's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo was once a leftist critic of Rios Montt and other military leaders
accused by human rights groups of overseeing the massacre of thousands of
Indians during a scorched-earth policy against leftist rebels in the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   He later joined Rios Montt's party. Because Guatemala's constitution bars
former coup leaders from running for the presidency, the party turned to
Portillo in place of Rios Montt, who instead was elected to lead the country's
legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will work in separate spheres,'' Portillo said recently. ``I will focus
on the executive. Rios Montt will focus on the legislative. We will respect each
other's differences of opinions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many predict a clash when Portillo eventually displays independence of Rios
Montt on major issues. But the president-elect tends to shrug that aside.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are going to be problems between the general and Alfonso Portillo,
like there are problems between all party militants,'' Portillo told a local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo has promised to honor the 1996 peace accords signed between the
government and leftist guerrillas and to focus on human rights. In recent days,
his criticism of the state's past human rights abuses has increased.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want a professional army that understands that it has done much damage
by involving itself in matters that it shouldn't,'' Portillo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his administration will include several human rights activists who
have strongly criticized Rios Montt, notably Indian leader Otilia Lux Coti as
his minister of culture and sports. Coti coordinated the national Commission for
Historical Clarity mandated by the peace accords. It concluded that genocidal
acts occurred under Rios Montt's mandate.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo may be able to distance himself only so far. Political analyst
Edelberto Torres-Riva has warned that ``power could absorb and neutralize''
human rights activists in the administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Moreover, Rios Montt's supporters are a majority in the new congress and
Portillo has already named attorney Gabriel Orellana, another Rios Montt ally,
as foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Report: 4 More Cops Relieved of Duty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Four more police officers who worked in the Rampart
division have been relieved of duty and prosecutors expect more convictions
tainted by misconduct to be overturned, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers were relieved of duty last week, the Times reported, citing
anonymous sources. That means 20 officers have been relieved of duty, suspended
without pay, fired, or who have resigned as a result of the worst police
corruption scandal to hit the city in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven criminal convictions have been overturned and four inmates have been
released from prison as a result of the scandal in which officers are said to
have framed people for crimes they didn't commit, lied in court to obtain
convictions and in some cases shot innocent people.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said more than 40 more convictions may be overturned as they
continue their review of potentially tainted cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafael Perez, the former officer who broke the scandal open, was named in a

<HEADLINE> Philly Loses Only 5-Star Restaurant  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BROWN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- You can stay at some of the oldest hotels in the
nation, see a Broadway-style show or take a horse-drawn carriage ride through
the neighborhood where the Declaration of Independence was signed.
</P>
<P>
	   But as of this week, the country's fifth-largest city has no five-star
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   Le Bec-Fin, which had received the Mobil Travel Guide's top ranking for two
decades, rated four stars in the guide's 2000 edition released this week. No
other city restaurant has received five stars from Mobil.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think so much of (Mobil's) decision that I ate there last night. As far
as we're concerned, that's a matter of somebody's bad taste,'' Philadelphia
attorney Paul Rosen said. ``I think it's five star. If there was a sixth, I'd
give it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Only 18 restaurants in North America earned five stars in 2000, including
two newcomers in Las Vegas. New York City has four of the restaurants, Atlanta
has two and nine other communities each have one.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's next to impossible to get five stars,'' said Mark Jacobson, program
manager of the Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil Travel Guide. ``At a five-star property,
the guests should expect from the time they make the reservation to the time
they arrive to the time they pay the bill, to have the most unbelievable and
memorable experience possible.''
</P>
<P>
	   Le Bec-Fin had received five stars from Mobil since 1979, when it was one of
the only fine dining restaurants in Philadelphia. It still is the most expensive
in the city, with an average meal topping $200 per person.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm stunned. I'm speechless. I do not understand where they are looking,''
Le Bec-Fin chef George Perrier said Thursday. ``Did they see the silver? The
glasses? The presentation of the soup?''
</P>
<P>
	   Le Bec-Fin still has No. 1 status in the city's Zagats Restaurant Guide and
has a five-diamonds rating from the other primary U.S. restaurant-rating group,
AAA.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mobil's decision hits particularly hard since Le Bec-Fin and its French
chef have been a source of pride in a city more often linked with cheesesteaks
and a slow-witted boxer than fine food.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will work to get it back next year,'' said Perrier, who is known for
dazzling David Letterman and Rosie O'Donnell by opening a bottle of champagne
with a saber.

<HEADLINE> Hog Producers Hope for Better Year  </HEADLINE>
    By JESSICA FARGEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- For the first time in more than 18 months Nebraska pork
producers have something to smile about.
</P>
<P>
	   A recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report shows that hog inventories
are down 4 percent, which has helped improve prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Fewer hogs plus a strong economy and rejuvenated Asian export markets have
contributed to the largest upswing in hog prices in at least 18 months, said
Dillon Feuz, an agriculture economist with the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's looking like prices in 2000 will finally be above break even for most
of Nebraska's producers," Feuz said. "Those prices probably won't be enough to
recapture all the losses toward the end of 1998, but it will be positive."
</P>
<P>
	   In Nebraska, the average price per pound of pork has jumped from about 18
cents a year ago to around 37 cents now, said Steve Cady, executive director of
the state Pork Producers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Pork prices hit a record low in December 1998 because of an excess of hogs,
which cut into prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Most producers are close to breaking even, but they aren't into the clear
yet, said Creston Pork Producer Stan Rosendahl.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still have a concern of whether the market is going to get good enough
to allow producers to pay back lost equity," said Rosendahl, president of the
Nebraska Pork Producers Association.
</P>
<P>
	   He estimates that producers lost about 40 percent of their net worth in the
last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosendahl was one of many producers to cut down his operation in order to
get by.
</P>
<P>
	   Madison Pork Producer Merlin Oswald said he didn't have to scale back his
operation, but even with prices per hundredweight about $7 higher in 1999 than
1998, he is apprehensive about celebrating.
</P>
<P>
	   "That sure doesn't generate the types of profits that would be needed to
look at recapitalization or even to weigh what the future of the industry is,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   --------
</P>
<P>
	   MARSHFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- Jane Livingston doesn't think the 50 llamas she
breeds are exotic and she hopes the state government agrees.
</P>
<P>
	   Livingston supports a Missouri bill that would reclassify llamas from
"exotic animals" to livestock, making them cheaper to raise and more attractive
as alternative stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "Here's another industry a farmer could possibly use," Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the Missouri Farm Bureau is putting its considerable clout behind the
llama legislation, which would affect some 125 llama farmers in Missouri as well
as those who keep llamas as a hobby.
</P>
<P>
	   If the bill passes, llama owners wouldn't have to pay taxes based on the
value of an individual llama, but on the same basis used for cattle and other
livestock.
</P>
<P>
	   Livingston, who helps organize llama shows at the Ozark Empire Fair, said
there are about 150,000 llamas in the United States, about 5,000 of which are in
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   An increasing number of southwest Missourians keep llamas on small farms or
in larger herds, said Gary Naylor, a livestock specialist.
</P>
<P>
	   Naylor said farmers sell the wool and the llamas are considered good guard
animals because they scream when upset and are tough enough to kill dogs.

<HEADLINE> 9 Hurt as Chile Candidates Campaign  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Running neck and neck, Chile's two presidential
candidates campaigned up to the last legal minute as election-related clashes
left at least nine people injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Right-wing Joaquin Lavin and socialist Ricardo Lagos made their final
appeals today, visiting provincial areas where they have fared poorly in the
past and calling upon their followers to remain calm and avoid violence ahead of
Sunday's runoff vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's not spoil a beautiful campaign with stupid things,'' Lavin said in
the northern city of Antofagasta.
</P>
<P>
	   But police reported nine people wounded, two of them seriously, in a clash
among campaign workers in the Santiago Maipu neighborhood of Santiago. Nine
others were detained.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said both groups blamed each other for the violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I call you to remain calm, to await the vote in peace and tranquility,''
said Lagos in Valdivia, in southern Chile.
</P>
<P>
	   The candidates seemed dedicated to attracting voters to a race that appears
to remain very tight by promising more jobs, less crime and improved health
services.
</P>
<P>
	   The final hours of the campaign were shadowed by Gen. Augusto Pinochet and
Britain's announcement Tuesday that doctors have found the 84-year-old former
Chilean dictator too ill to stand trial for human rights abuses allegedly
committed during his regime. Spain has been trying to extradite him on those
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement that Pinochet may be sent back to Chile soon caused a
political commotion but the candidates and analysts said the impact on the vote
would be minimal, if any. Lavin and Lagos supported an eventual trial of
Pinochet in Chile, which human rights groups are demanding.
</P>
<P>
	   Average citizens didn't seem distracted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Pinochet is not a candidate,'' said Luis Zuniga, who sells fruits at a
stand in downtown Santiago. ``Things are different now.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lagos spent his final campaign day in Chile's southern farming belt, while
Lavin was in the mining region in the north.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first vote in December, the two emerged from the pack in a virtual
draw: Lagos with 47.9 of the vote to Lavin's 47.5 percent. The winner of the
run-off will succeed Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat constitutionally barred
from re-election.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin is the strongest right-wing candidate in decades and the first one
with a real chance of winning the presidency. Lagos would be the first leftist
president since Salvador Allende, the Marxist toppled by Pinochet in a bloody
1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Health will no longer depend on the wallets of parents,'' Lagos said. ``We
will make the economy grow by six percent this year, creating more jobs.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They have ruled for ten years, two terms,'' Lavin said, referring to the
coalition supporting Lagos. ``Give me the chance now.''
</P>
<P>
	   The race appears so close that Mori, the polling company that took the only
nationwide opinion poll, would not name winner. It said the sample ``showed a
tie,'' with Lagos ahead by less than one percent point.
</P>
<P>
	   That difference is statistically irrelevant in a sample with a margin or
error of 3 percent, said Mori director Marta Lagos, who is not related to the
socialist candidate.

<HEADLINE> Electronic Tax Credit Proposed  </HEADLINE>
   By CURT ANDERSON AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To entice more Americans to abandon postage stamps for
computers, President Clinton is proposing a tax credit up to $10 for people who
file their income tax returns electronically.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good for them. It's good for the IRS. It's good for the system,''
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said Thursday in announcing the proposed
credit at a conference on modernizing the nation's tax collector.
</P>
<P>
	   The president will ask Congress in his fiscal 2001 budget to approve a $10
credit for people who file returns electronically, either on their home
computers or through a tax professional. For people who use the IRS telephone
filing system called Telefile, the credit would be $5.
</P>
<P>
	   If the credit had been in place in 1999, it would have cost the government
about $264.5 million, according to congressional estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Using money as an incentive marks a departure from the Internal Revenue
Service campaign that is selling e-filing as more accurate, as a quicker route
to a refund -- an average of 20 days instead of 40 -- and as the only way to get
a specific confirmation that the return was received by the government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With anything that involves changing people's habits, you need a little
push,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti. ``It's really designed to
accelerate what was happening anyway.''
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, electronic tax filing has grown dramatically over the past few
years, including a 19 percent increase last year. About 34 million returns -- a
little over one in four -- will be filed by computer or telephone this year, up
from 29.3 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But the pace is not swift enough to meet a goal set by Congress in the 1998
IRS reform law for 80 percent e-filing by 2007. Indeed, the most recent IRS
projection is for about half of all returns to be e-filed by that date.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is, to be sure, more that needs to be done,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people remain reluctant to put their sensitive tax data on line, while
others fear they could be more easily targeted for an audit if they file
electronically -- a fear the IRS says is unfounded. Many people, however, won't
file electronically because the fees are usually many times the cost of a
33-cent postage stamp.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed tax credit would eliminate the cost factor, said Bob
Weinberger, government relations vice president at H&AMP;R Block Inc., the nation's
largest tax preparer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are comfortable doing it a certain way,'' he said. ``This is likely
to push a lot of people across the line who might have been saying, 'What's in
it for me?'''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee, poked fun at the proposal and added that it leaves out millions of
people who still file paper returns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's next -- a tax credit for good penmanship?'' said the Texas
Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossotti also told the conference Thursday that improved technology --
including more electronic filing -- is critical to improving the IRS's ability
to respond to taxpayer problems and questions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our purpose is not to move some imaginary pendulum back or forth a few
degrees,'' Rossotti said. ``Our purpose is to improve the entire way the IRS
works.''
</P>
<P>
	   As part of its modernization effort, the IRS is remaking its structure into
four operating divisions: one each for individual taxpayers, large businesses,
small businesses and tax-exempt organizations. The new structure is expected to
be in place by October.
</P>
<P>
	   John Dalrymple, who will head the new Wage and Investment Division that
includes the vast majority of taxpayers, said the IRS hopes within five years to
be able to communicate directly with taxpayers via secure e-mail. That would
allow completely paperless filing with PIN numbers in place of physical
signatures and provide tax refunds within two days, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to position ourselves to make full use of the Internet,''
Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said the president would ask Congress for a substantial increase in
the IRS budget for fiscal 2001 to continue an ongoing replacement of the
agency's antiquated, tape-driven taxpayer computer records and to prevent any
further reduction in employees. The job cutbacks are frequently cited as one
reason -- along with fallout from the IRS reform law -- that the agency is doing
fewer audits and enforcement actions.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns About Imbalances  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing new
worries that the soaring stock market could lead to an overheated U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Private economists said Greenspan's new concerns make them more convinced
that the central bank will boost interest rates for a fourth time since last
June when they meet Feb. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to the Economic Club of New York on Thursday night, Greenspan
linked his worries about the high-flying stock market to the surge in consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan noted that many economists estimate that fully one-fourth of
annual economic growth since 1996 -- about 1 percentage point of the 4 percent
growth rate -- has come from the "wealth effect" of consumers spending more
because of their rising investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan said that this added consumer demand is taxing the economy's
resources and if not moderated could lead to rising inflation because of tight
labor markets and stretched production capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is this imbalance between growth of supply and growth of demand that
contains the potential seeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that
could undermine the current expansion," Greenspan told his audience of top
economists and Wall Street professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, Greenspan moderated his inflation worries by noting
that at present the economy has been able to grow at a strong rate without
pushing prices higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not only is the expansion reaching record length, but it is doing so with
far stronger-than-expected economic growth," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, private economists said Greenspan's worries about inflation problems
down the road left little doubt in their minds that the central bank will raise
rates again in February.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan continues to be worried that consumer spending and demand are
greater than potential supply," said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston
&AMP; Co., who was in the audience for Greenspan's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones said he expected the Fed will follow up its February rate increase
with at least one more quarter-point boost in the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge on overnight loans, probably at the March meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jones said Wall Street investors who came to the speech fearing that
Greenspan would sound an even more hawkish note on inflation were likely to be
relieved that he balanced his inflation worries with extensive praise for how
well the economy is doing at present.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said while economists 10 years from now undoubtedly will have a
clearer picture of the new forces at work in the economy, such as rising
productivity, the Fed can't wait that long to make its decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regrettably, we at the Federal Reserve do not have the luxury of awaiting a
better set of insights," Greenspan said. "Indeed, our goal, in responding to the
complexity of current economic forces, is to extend the expansion by containing
its imbalances and avoiding the very recession that would complete a business
cycle."
</P>
<P>
	   During a question and answer session following his speech, Greenspan said
the central bank would release before its February meeting a set of guidelines
intended to help financial markets better interpret the Fed's new policy of
revealing changes in its so-called directive. The directive is intended to
signal the future course of interest rates but so far has left markets confused.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that when economists look back from the year 2010 on the
current period, they may well conclude "at the turn of the millennium, the
American economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation
which propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits and stock prices
at a pace not seen in generations, if ever."
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan, who has worried at various times about over-exuberance on
Wall Street, suggested that the 2010 review might conclude alternatively that "a
good deal of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many
euphoric speculative bubbles that have dotted human history."

<HEADLINE> No. 3 Stanford 73, Oregon St. 45  </HEADLINE>
    By LANDON HALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- For an overpowering 12-minute stretch, Stanford
played like a team that liked being No. 1 and wants to get that feeling back.
</P>
<P>
	   Casey Jacobsen scored 16 points and David Moseley added 15 as the
third-ranked Cardinal used a 29-2 run to cruise by Oregon State 73-45 Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our game plan changes game to game, but the number one thing that the coach
puts on the drawing boards at the top is defense," said Jacobsen, who helped
Stanford hold the Beavers to 28 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford (13-1, 2-1 Pac-10) started slowly, but began to pull away with a
17-2 run over the final seven minutes of the first half. The Cardinal stepped up
the intensity in the first 4 1/2 minutes of the second half with a 12-0 burst to
take a 41-18 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The margin of victory was the biggest ever in Corvallis for Stanford, which
leads the nation in field goal defense at 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Needless to say, this was a huge win for us," Stanford coach Mike
Montgomery said. "This was a game we really needed to have, any way you look at
it."
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford not only was angry at losing the No. 1 ranking after a 68-65 loss
to Arizona last weekend, it was returning to the scene of one of its most bitter
disappointments of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beavers upset then-No. 6 Stanford 59-45 at Gill Coliseum in the season
finale last March 6. The defeat might have cost Stanford a No. 1 seed in the
NCAA tournament, and the team wound up being upset by tournament darling Gonzaga
in the second round.
</P>
<P>
	   Clifton Jones scored 10 points to lead the Beavers (8-5, 0-2), who endured
their worst loss since an 87-54 defeat at Stanford on Feb. 13, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   "As the game wears on and you're not making your shots, your defensive
energy drops," Oregon State coach Eddie Payne said. "Stanford is a very good
team; they withstood our early surge -- the emotion and energy."
</P>
<P>
	   Coming off the loss, the Cardinal maybe had too much emotion early in the
game, turning the ball over 10 times in the first half. Despite a height
disadvantage, the Beavers played tough defense, forcing Stanford into some bad
shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford trailed 16-12 with 7:20 left in the half before taking control. A
3-pointer by Moseley broke a 16-all tie, and two straight baskets by Jarron
Collins made it 24-16. After a dunk by Jones, Moseley scored five straight
points to make it 29-18 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had to come out there and set a precedent for our team, as far as
intensity," Moseley said. "I hit a few, and everyone else got confident. It was
just rolling from there."
</P>
<P>
	   Jacobsen scored seven points during Stanford's 12-0 run to start the second
half, but Ryan Mendez topped him. Mendez, scoreless in the first half, hit four
straight shots, including consecutive 3-pointers, to make it 58-28.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford's Mark Madsen, in his fifth game back after missing seven weeks
with a pulled right hamstring, had eight points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The margin was Stanford's largest ever in 34 games in Corvallis.
</P>
<P>
	   Oregon State, second in the Pac-10 in 3-pointers at just over seven per
game, finished 3-of-21 from long range.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Jackson, Oregon State's heralded freshman from tiny Knappa, Ore., had
a miserable performance in his first big Pac-10 game. He was 2-of-14 from the
field and scored seven points, well below his team-leading 16.7 average.
</P>
<P>
	   Deaundra Tanner, leading the conference in 3-point shooting at 52 percent,
was 0-for-5 and finished with three points.
</P>
<P>
	   Beavers center Jason Heide played with his broken right hand wrapped in
tape, but it was an injured right ankle that knocked him out of the game. He
dived for a loose ball just over three minutes into the game. He returned but
was ineffective, and the school said he's doubtful for Saturday's game against
California.

Microsoft CEO Takes Hard Line on Antitrust Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- New Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer wasted no
time in describing his position on the company's federal antitrust woes. "I
think it would be absolutely reckless and irresponsible for anyone to try to
break up this company," Ballmer said Thursday. Microsoft is being sued by the
U.S. Department of Justice and 19 state attorneys general for alleged antitrust
violations, such as squeezing Netscape Communications Corp. out of the Web
software market and forcing such companies as America Online Inc. and IBM to use
its software instead of its competitors'. In its defense, Microsoft has said
that the industry is constantly evolving, and that its past actions did not
damage its competitors.

Greenspan: Imbalances Could Derail Economy

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans, enjoying the most prosperous times in a
generation, have fueled a remarkable economic boom, but there are dangers that
growing imbalances could derail the economic expansion, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan said Thursday. Greenspan noted that next month it will become the
longest expansion in U.S. history. However, Greenspan also repeated worries that
the Federal Reserve must be alert to the growing imbalances between continued
strong consumer demand, bolstered by Americans' soaring stock portfolios, and
the dwindling supply of available workers, given that unemployment is now at a
30-year low.

technique has so far produced only one living rhesus monkey, a female named
Tetra, but Professor Gerald Schatten said that four more twinned infants are on
the way. Schatten said the goal is to produce identical monkeys that could be

<HEADLINE> Pedro Martinez Gets Cy Young Award  </HEADLINE>
    By JIMMY GOLEN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Pedro Martinez can't keep a good thing to himself.
</P>
<P>
	   When he won the NL Cy Young Award two years ago with the Montreal Expos, he
accepted it on behalf of his countryman Juan Marichal, the first pitching star
from the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   And when Martinez picked up his 1999 AL Cy Young plaque at the Boston
Baseball Writers Association dinner on Thursday night, he gave credit to his
brother and teammate Ramon, who was the presenter.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even though I am the one with the trophy, I want you to know the trophy has
more of you than me," Pedro Martinez said, "because you are the one who taught
me how to play the game."
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1999 -- and many other years -- no one played quite like Pedro.
</P>
<P>
	   Martinez won the pitchers' triple crown, leading the AL with a 23-4 record,
2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts en route to his second Cy Young Award.
</P>
<P>
	   He rescued the Red Sox from elimination in Game 5 of their first-round
playoff series against Cleveland, coming out of the bullpen with six hitless
innings as Boston advanced to play the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
	   In the championship series, he beat Roger Clemens to hand New York its only
loss in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Martinez thinks the Red Sox are poised to improve, he can't promise
that he will produce the same results.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never dreamed of having a year like that," he said. "I just hope they
don't expect me to be the same way."
</P>
<P>
	   Martinez also received the Thomas A. Yawkey memorial award as the Red Sox
MVP. Also receiving awards were AL Manager of the Year Jimy Williams and Marlins
third baseman Mike Lowell, who survived testicular cancer and was given the Tony
Conigliaro Award for overcoming adversity.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Mondor, the owner of the Red Sox Triple-A affiliate in Pawtucket, R.I.,
won the Judge Emil Fuchs Memorial Award for long and meritorious service to
baseball. The award is named for the former owner of the Boston Braves.
</P>
<P>
	   Also:
</P>
<P>
	   --Reds general manager Jim Bowden, who built a winner in Cincinnati despite
the 20th largest payroll in baseball, received the executive of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra got a special achievement award for leading
the AL with a .357 average.
</P>
<P>
	   --Catcher Jason Varitek got the Jackie Jensen award for hustle and grit.
</P>
<P>
	   --Outfielder Trot Nixon and first baseman Brian Daubach shared the Harry
Agganis award as Red Sox co-rookies of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Derek Lowe was voted Red Sox reliever of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Red Sox vice president Mike Port was given the Tommy McCarthy memorial
good guy award.
</P>
<P>
	   --Pawtucket third baseman Wilton Veras was selected Boston's minor league
player of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Recently retired Boston Herald sports writer Joe Giuliotti was given the
Dave O'Hara award for service to the Boston BBWAA chapter.
</P>
<P>
	   --Outfielder Fred Lynn won the former Red Sox player award to commemorate
the 25th anniversary of the 1975 season, when he won both the AL MVP and Rookie
of the Year awards.
</P>
<P>
	   --Houston first baseman Jeff Bagwell was voted the New England player of the
year.
</P>
<P>
	   --Former Boston third baseman Wade Boggs got a special achievement award for
reaching the 3,000-hit plateau with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Thursday, new Red Sox outfielder Carl Everett, acquired in a trade with
Houston, said he wouldn't rule out signing a long-term deal with Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not saying I'm going to boogie after a year. I would be a fool to say
that," he said. "I weigh everything."

<HEADLINE> Aaron Says View of Rocker Softens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- On Day 2 of the campaign to reform his image, John Rocker
might have found an unlikely ally -- Hank Aaron.
</P>
<P>
	   The home run king, sharply critical of Rocker's derogatory comments towards
minorities, homosexuals and foreigners, softened that stance after a meeting
with the Atlanta Braves reliever on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a very, very good conversation," said Aaron, who is black. "I didn't
feel this way before. ... But I was well pleased with the way John presented
himself."
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting at Aaron's car dealership in suburban Atlanta also included
former U.N. ambassador and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young.
</P>
<P>
	   "He is a good pitcher, but he has got to learn to be a celebrity," Young
said. "I tend to identify with kids who get themselves in this predicament. I
think they need support more than criticism."
</P>
<P>
	   Once again, however, the local NAACP chapter called for the Braves to
release Rocker, who had 38 saves in his first full season as the closer -- one
short of the franchise record held by Mark Wohlers.
</P>
<P>
	   "By doing nothing, the Braves organization seems to say to the world that
Rocker's remarks and actions are OK," said R.L. White Jr., president of the
NAACP's Atlanta chapter. "We can't help but wonder whether John Rocker speaks
for many of his kind within the Braves organization who may have simply had the
better judgment not to express their feelings openly."
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker issued a brief written apology following the December publication of
his inflammatory remarks in Sports Illustrated, then dropped out of sight until
a Wednesday interview with ESPN in Rocker's hometown of Macon.
</P>
<P>
	   He admitted that his comments made him look like "a complete jerk," but
denied being a racist and apologized for the uproar he has caused.
</P>
<P>
	   Young, a black civil rights leader, arranged Thursday's meeting at the
request of Macon Mayor Jack Ellis, who also is black.
</P>
<P>
	   The day began with a stop at Young's home. Young then accompanied Rocker to
Aaron's dealership for a meeting that lasted more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron conceded that he was not impressed with Rocker's apology on ESPN, but
had a change of heart after sitting down with the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think John has some ideas about talking to some of his teammates and
doing some of the things he needs to do to gain their confidence once again,"
Aaron said. "Since I've had this conversation with John, I feel a lot better
about what he said and how he felt."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Aaron believes the pitcher faces an uphill battle to gain acceptance
from his teammates, and Young said he is concerned about the fan reaction to
Rocker's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think John Rocker has got a hard way to go," Young said. "Every ballpark
he goes to, people are going to push him. Once you lose your temper, people say,
'If we can get him riled up, he won't be able to pitch."'
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker, who declined to speak with reporters Thursday, told ESPN that his
derogatory comments were an angry response to the treatment he received in New
York during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Mets fans spit in his face and poured beer on him while the Braves
were en route to a thrilling victory in the National League championship series.
He also claimed that Yankees fans threw batteries at him while Atlanta was being
swept in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   Young said the pitcher should take a page from Aaron's behavior during his
pursuit of Babe Ruth's home run record. Aaron endured massive media attention
and hate-filled comments from racist fans on the way to breaking Ruth's mark
with his 715th homer in 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no better example of how to deal with adversity than Henry Aaron,"
Young said. "I never heard him complain. I never heard him grumble. He kept his
focus on playing ball despite all the pressure around him. That's what John
Rocker has got to learn to do."
</P>
<P>
	   But the NAACP's Atlanta chapter demanded Rocker's release in letters to team
owner Ted Turner, president Stan Kasten, general manager John Schuerholz and
manager Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
	   The organization sent a similar letter to baseball commissioner Bud Selig,
who last week ordered psychiatric testing for Rocker before deciding whether to
take any action.
</P>
<P>
	   White accused the Braves of hiding behind major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is our feeling that the Braves' non-action is solely because of money
and greed, since John Rocker is their No. 1 closer," White said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schuerholz and Kasten declined comment Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Selig Wants Ability To Fine $2M  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The baseball commissioner could be a lot more powerful a
week from now.
</P>
<P>
	   Bud Selig could fine teams up to $2 million instead of $250,000, and could
order increased revenue sharing under rule changes he hopes owners will approve
when they meet in Phoenix, The Associated Press has learned.
</P>
<P>
	   The changes, which could lead to a confrontation with some large-market
teams, are contained in amendments to the Major League Agreement scheduled for a
vote Jan. 19-20, part of an overhaul that will eliminate the American and
National leagues as legal entities.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's restoring authority back to the commissioner's office, which should
not have been taken away in the first place," former commissioner Peter
Ueberroth said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "If those things are approved, I think it will be a dramatic improvement for
the game," Ueberroth said. "It gives Bud the power to attack the problems, the
most important of which is the economic imbalance."
</P>
<P>
	   While there was no announcement, the proposed changes were revealed to the
AP by two high-ranking baseball officials who spoke on the condition they not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that anything that increases the power of the commissioner in this
circumstance is a good thing," former commissioner Fay Vincent said. "I think
it's a compliment to Bud."
</P>
<P>
	   In January 1994, owners weakened the commissioner's power to act in the best
interests of baseball by prohibiting that authority on any matter subject to a
vote by teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, some teams have ignored the commissioner's office, especially
Selig's directive to consider more minorities for executive and manager
openings.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the changes Selig is proposing could give him broad power to order
more revenue sharing, saying he would "without limitation" have the right to
ensure "there is an appropriate level of long-term competitive balance among the
clubs."
</P>
<P>
	   Some teams might argue that language doesn't specifically give the
commissioner unilateral power on revenue sharing, which could lead to a fight,
but courts have generally upheld the commissioner's broad authority to act under
the "best interests" clause.
</P>
<P>
	   While revenue sharing has increased markedly since the latest plan started
in 1996, there is concern among owners and fans about a lack of competitive
balance, especially with the New York Yankees winning three of the last four
World Series.
</P>
<P>
	   The eight playoff teams were among the 10 top spenders last year. Since the
end of the 1994-95 strike, just one team not among the top half by payroll has
advanced to the postseason: the 1997 Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
	   While the small markets want more competition, many large-market owners,
including the Yankees' George Steinbrenner, question whether they should give up
more revenue.
</P>
<P>
	   "My sense is, in the end, most everybody will do what they think is best for
the game and not their selfish proprietary interest," said Colorado Rockies
owner Jerry McMorris, whose team is among the revenue leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional changes proposed would give the commissioner power to modify
teams' TV territories and to control their Internet activities.
</P>
<P>
	   Selig and Bob DuPuy, baseball's chief legal counsel, didn't return telephone
calls seeking comment. The players association might argue that it has the right
to approve any revenue sharing changes because the current arrangement is
included in its labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   "It sounds to me like the net of this is that Buddy has succeeded in gaining
more power," said former commissioner Bowie Kuhn, whose maximum fining power was
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "The more power you give the commissioner, the better off the game is going
to be," Kuhn said, "and that is not merely a sentimental comment. I was
concerned about the changes in 1994 because it diminished the power. This sounds
like it's going the other way. This is the way it ought to go."
</P>
<P>
	   NBA commissioner David Stern can fine teams up to $5 million, and NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman up to $1 million. NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue can
fine teams up to $500,000 in most instances and up to $2 million for salary-cap
violations.
</P>
<P>
	   "The majority of us want to be sure the commissioner has appropriate
authority to deal with his responsibilities," said McMorris, who in 1997-98
headed the commissioner search committee. "Clearly, when we were doing the
commissioner search, there were candidates who were concerned whether they had
enough authority to do the job. We now definitely have a different landscape
without two league presidents being in the picture."

<HEADLINE> Americans Seem Like the Visitors  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN PETERS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- When the U.S. soccer team takes the field for its
exhibition game against Iran, expect the predominant flag waving from the stands
to be green, white and red, not red, white and blue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Welcome to Southern California," U.S. coach Bruce Arena said, shaking his
head and smiling.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans seem like the visitors when they play Mexico and other Latin
teams in heavily Hispanic Southern California, although they were cheered during
their 1994 World Cup upset of Colombia at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are also as many as 600,000 Iranian-Americans living in and around
Los Angeles, and for many of them, Sunday's game at the Rose Bowl will be their
first chance to see Iran's national team, which is playing its first three games
in the United States this month.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have many relatives flying in from San Francisco, Texas, New Mexico, and
Washington, D.C.," said Ali Ghalambor, a native of Iran who came to the United
States in 1984. "We are very excited about it. I went to games in Iran and have
watched the team on TV, but this is my first chance to see them in many years."
</P>
<P>
	   Ghalambor is taking his 7-year-old son, Moji.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sure it will be something for him to remember," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. midfielder Claudio Reyna said he and his teammates are accustomed to
fan opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been around it so many times, so I'm used to it and I think everybody
knows it's going to be like that again," Reyna said. "In California, where you
have so many ethnic people from different countries, when their national team
comes to play, they'll travel for 10 hours for a game because it's their only
chance to watch them play."
</P>
<P>
	   Goalkeeper Tony Meola, the starter at the 1990 and '94 World Cups, thinks
the U.S. team still will have lots of support.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been lucky with our fans the last five or six years, as far as
pro-American crowds," he said. "It might be a pro-Iranian crowd. I'm sure any
part of the Iranian population here would want to see their national team. I'm
certain there's a lot of pride in the people that are from Iran and living in
America."
</P>
<P>
	   A crowd of about 50,000 is expected at the Rose Bowl for a rematch of the
1998 World Cup game, when Iran shocked the United States 2-1 at Lyon, France.
The Americans then lost to Yugoslavia and finished last in the 32-nation field.
</P>
<P>
	   Not all those cheering for Iran will be doing it in that country's language,
and some in the crowd are likely to have the flags of both nations painted on
their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of them will be American-born Iranians, like my kids," Reza Ghalambor
said. "Most of them don't even speak Farsi."
</P>
<P>
	   Whether they're yelling in Farsi or English, Reyna thinks the crowd will be
lively.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes a great atmosphere. It's good for us and it makes the game fun on
the field when you have fans that are into it," he said. "And they are going to
be into it."
</P>
<P>
	   Reyna hopes that spirit will rub off on American fans.
</P>

hopefully it makes people here realize how important soccer is in other
countries," he said.

<P>
	   Arena wishes soccer moms and pops would pack their kids into minivans and
head to Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
	   "California has one of the biggest youth soccer populations in the country
and we'd love to have some of their support," he said. "The time has come that
our country has to get behind our national team if we're going to be successful.
Sunday would be a nice day to get some of those people out."

<HEADLINE> Skater Kwan Busy As College Freshman  </HEADLINE>
By SALVATORE ZANCA-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYON, France (AP) -- As a college freshman, Michelle Kwan is getting around and
earning lots of money.
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago she was in Japan. This week, it's France. And she has earned more
than $100,000 in prize money since October.
</P>
<P>
	Yet she is still missing something. An Olympic gold medal in 2002 would fill
the void nicely.
</P>
<P>
	Maria Butyrskaya of Russia beat Kwan for the world title last March. Kwan gets
another chance against Butyrskaya in the International Skating Union Grand Prix
Final starting today.
</P>
<P>
	The final brings together the top point scorers in the four events from a
six-meet series between October and December. The final is worth more than
$700,000, $50,000 going to the event winners.
</P>
<P>
	At the world competition in Helsinki, Finland, Kwan was ailing with the flu and
made some technical mistakes that allowed Butyrskaya, at 27, to become the
oldest woman to take an individual world title. Russian skaters took all four
world titles.
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Kwan has beaten Butyrskaya three times in pro-am open competitions,
where the technical rules are less stringent.
</P>
<P>
	Now Kwan has a chance to beat the Russian under ISU regulations, allowing a
more triple jumps than the lucrative, but less demanding, pro-am events.
</P>
<P>
	The women's event between the past and present world champions highlights the
competition that ends with a unique head-to-head duel. The men's, pairs and ice
dance are also being contested.
</P>
<P>
	After the long and short programs, the top four skaters go against each other
Saturday in a super final, executing different programs.
</P>
<P>
	Kwan was world champion in 1996 and 1998 and the Olympic silver medalist in
Nagano, is trying to balance competition and classes this year.
</P>
<P>
	In between courses at UCLA, she won Skate America, Skate Canada and three
pro-ams, including one two weeks ago in Japan, and earned well over $100,000 in
official prize money.
</P>
<P>
	The men's event lost some of its luster when two-time world and European
champion Alexei Yagudin withdrew because of foot problems. According to his
coach, Tatiana Tarasova, his boot split in training in Moscow on Monday, and
Yagudin slightly stretched a tendon in his foot.
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Federation asked for a medical release and replaced him with
another Russian, Alexander Abt.
</P>
<P>
	Without Yagudin, who won three of the Grand Prix events, the favorite is now
Yevgeny Plushchenko, who won the other three and beat Yagudin for the Russian
title.
</P>
<P>
	American hopes are on Tim Goebel, who became the first skater to do three quads
in a program at Skate America, where he was second to Yagudin.
</P>
<P>
	Goebel appears ready for another historic feat. In practice, he did a
quad-triple-triple combination, outperforming Plushchenko, whose best was a
quad-triple-double combination.
</P>
<P>
	Pairs competition has reigning world champions Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze trying to rebound from a relatively poor autumn.
</P>
<P>
	Russian teammates Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov have won three events this
fall.
</P>
<P>
	In ice dance competition, France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat are
favorites in their hometown. World champions Angelika Krylova, suffering from a
back injury, and Oleg Ovsiannikov of Russia are not competing this season.

<HEADLINE> American Cup a Tuneup for Sydney  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	When four-time U.S. national gymnastics champion John Roethlisberger won the
1995 and 1996 American Cups, he took more than another shiny new trophy home
with him.
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Olympics were approaching fast, and beating an international field
gave his confidence a huge boost. Roethlisberger didn't win a medal in Atlanta,
but his seventh-place finish in the all-around was the best for an American
since 1984, when Peter Vidmar won silver.
</P>
<P>
	``Winning the American Cup definitely gave me the confidence to know I could
compete and certainly the respect of other athletes,'' Roethlisberger said.
``This is an Olympic year, and it's important to do well in these international
competitions.
</P>
<P>
	``Looking at the boost it's given me in the past, I'm hoping it will give me
another boost this year.''
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Roethlisberger might get two boosts. To commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the American Cup, now sponsored by Visa, USA Gymnastics expanded
the event into a three-meet grand prix.
</P>
<P>
	The Visa American Cup Series begins tonight in Las Vegas with the RCA
Gymnastics Challenge. Eight men and eight women from the United States, China,
Russia, Romania, Cuba, Bulgaria and Australia will compete in an all-around
format. The top three international finishers and the top American -- for both
men and women -- will move on to the American Cup on Feb. 26 in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	Eight more finalists will advance from the Aussie Hair Care Gymnastics
Invitational, which will be held Jan. 29 in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	``The Visa American Cup Series provides an excellent opportunity for our
athletes to compete at the highest level, which is extremely crucial for Olympic
Games preparation,'' said Bob Colarossi, president of USA Gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
	``It also serves as a visible platform for us to celebrate the history of the
event.''
</P>
<P>
	And what a history it has. Nadia Comaneci was a young, little known gymnast
from Romania when she won the first American Cup in 1975. The next year, she was
the darling of the Montreal Olympics with the first perfect 10 -- a feat she
duplicated six more times.
</P>
<P>
	Eight years later, Bela Karolyi brought another young gymnast.
</P>
<P>
	``I took an unknown young girl, but a very exciting performer. And that was
Mary Lou,'' Karolyi said. ``That was one of the greatest memories of my life.
Gosh, that was fantastic. Walking in with that unknown, young gymnast, one who
really had no previous track record that would indicate she'd be so exciting
during the competition.
</P>
<P>
	``Winning the American Cup opened her door, which came the year later.''
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, at the Los Angeles Olympics, Mary Lou Retton became the first -- and
still only -- U.S. woman to win the all-around.
</P>
<P>
	And Comaneci and Retton aren't the only stars to win the American Cup. Over the
last 25 years, many of the biggest names in gymnastics have won the title.
Vidmar. Shannon Miller. Kim Zmeskal. Kerri Strug. Bart Conner. Kurt Thomas.
Vitaly Scherbo.
</P>
<P>
	``Winning the American Cup was ... always prestigious,'' Karolyi said. ``It's
very, very valuable experience and opens doors to later great performances.''
</P>
<P>
	There's some national pride involved, too, Roethlisberger said. U.S. men have
won the American Cup all but seven times since the competition began in 1975. An
American woman has won it 19 times, though Julianne McNamara and Zoya
Grantcharova of Bulgaria shared the title in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	The Americans don't want to lose the trophy -- especially in an Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
	``The American Cup is our meet,'' Roethlisberger said. ``We don't want anyone
taking our cup over the border.''

<HEADLINE> President Says Economy Is on Track  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While noting a bit ruefully that he may not be personally
sharing the full fruits of America's current economic boom, President Clinton
spent a day among Wall Street titans and said he sees no reason the good times
can't roll awhile longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton beamed Thursday evening as he gazed over the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange -- probably the most potent symbol of the robust economy Clinton
claims significant credit for fostering.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm superstitious,'' Clinton admitted to a sushi-nibbling crowd gathered
on the trading floor, and he doesn't want to jinx the market's remarkable rise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't ever comment on it, except that I like the way it looks,'' Clinton
said to applause.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, at 3,241 when Clinton took office in 1993,
has soared beyond the 11,500 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   During several appearances in New York, Clinton did comment extensively on
the turnaround in the American economy since he took office seven years ago,
exulting in the nation's good fortune but also appealing for help spreading
wealth to ``the people and places left behind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the day was spent alongside the Rev. Jesse Jackson in an attempt to
round up corporate and Wall Street support for programs that help low-income and
minority entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
	   One corporate leader who has signed on to help Jackson, Citigroup Chairman
Sanford Weill, startled the president with an unorthodox greeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to thank you for my net worth,'' Weill declared, saying Citigroup's
stock had climbed from $5 a share when Clinton took office to $55 now.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, deeply in debt with legal bills, replied, ``I'm glad one of us made
money out of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assets held for the Clintons in a blind trust have presumably grown along
with the stock market. But the president's position makes it effectively
impossible for him to play the market the way many middle-class people,
including some of Clinton's own aides, have recently done to great success.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton may have another chance. He will be out of office in a year, and
could then set about making money in the stock market and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Clinton said the fundamentals of the economy are sound, and
there are no immediate fears of a boom-killing surge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll just see how long it'll go,'' Clinton said during an interview on
the financial network CNBC.
</P>
<P>
	   After noting that next month will mark the nation's longest stretch of
sustained economic growth ever, Clinton added:
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's never been anything like this before. The truth is no one knows
for sure what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   But in a speech Thursday to the Economic Club of New York , the chairman of
the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said he was somewhat worried the strong
stock market could overheat the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is this imbalance between growth of supply and growth of demand that
contains the potential seeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that
could undermine the current expansion,'' Greenspan told his audience of top
economists and Wall Street professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also raised an estimated $250,000 for Democratic candidates at a
party on New York's Upper East Side that featured longtime Democratic donors,
some newly wealthy entrepreneurs and stock market wizards, and model Christie
Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
	   Now a New Yorker himself, Clinton then retired to his new house in suburban
Westchester County.

<HEADLINE> Sec'y Council Tackles Refugee Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States is rekindling an old debate at the
United Nations over the definition of a refugee, arguing that anyone who flees
fighting should be granted the same protection and care.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations, for a variety of political and financial reasons,
distinguishes between refugees who have crossed borders to escape conflicts and
those who leave their homes but remain in their countries.
</P>
<P>
	   These so-called ``internally displaced people'' often fall through the care
cracks and receive less international aid than refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday at the request of the United States, the Security Council held
an open debate on the issue, which has grown more contentious in recent years as
the number of internally displaced surpasses the number of refugees across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem is not only the increased financial strain of dealing with
millions of displaced people. Many governments are also resistant to
international intervention in what they insist are domestic problems.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations estimates there are between 14 million and 15 million
refugees worldwide. Another 20 million to 25 million are internally displaced
people, or IDPs -- half of them in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These are people. And to a person who has been driven from his or her own
home by conflict, there is no difference between being a refugee or an IDP in
terms of what happened to them,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke told the
council.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're equally victims, but they're treated differently.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees was created 50 years ago
specifically to care for and protect refugees. At the time, Cold War conflicts
fueled mass population shifts across borders.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, however, most conflicts are internal and the population shifts occur
within individual countries.
</P>
<P>
	   UNHCR's mandate and resources -- already stretched thin caring for refugees
-- enable it to care for only about 5 million of the world's internally
displaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, governments may be unwilling for political reasons to accept
international assistance, as is the case in Myanmar, Turkey and Algeria, Roberta
Cohen, a guest scholar at The Brookings Institution, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
	   In these cases, the government may consider the civilians to be part of the
conflict and, citing its sovereignty, deny them international aid.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, told council members
that urgent action must be taken in Central Africa in particular ``to compensate
for the lack of protection mechanisms for internally displaced people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke went a step further, however, calling for the United Nations to
``erode if not erase'' the distinction between refugees and internally displaced
and put responsibility for both under a single agency.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I recognize that the distinction raises complex legal issues of
international sovereignty,'' Holbrooke said. ``But let us remember that
individual lives are at stake.''
</P>
<P>
	   China's U.N. ambassador Qin Huasun alluded to those legal issues, saying
international aid should be given only ``on the basis of respect of sovereignty,
territorial integrity and noninterference into internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
	   China consistently stresses the rights of countries to manage their affairs
internally, fearing international intervention in Tibet and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada's deputy U.N. Ambassador, Michel Duval, however, said such arguments
didn't hold up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where countries cannot or do not want to provide necessary assistance to
their populations, they nevertheless have responsibility to provide full access
to them for others so that their basic needs can be met,'' Duval said.

<HEADLINE> Azinger Takes Sony First-Round Lead  </HEADLINE>
    By GORDON SAKAMOTO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONOLULU (AP) -- Paul Azinger sees the Sony Open as a good place for him to
refocus on golf.
</P>
<P>
	   Azinger, still trying to recover from last fall's tragic deaths of close
friend Payne Stewart and two business associates, moved in the positive
direction Thursday with a 7-under-par 63, which put him three strokes up on his
closest challengers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had a pretty tough offseason," said Azinger, who himself faced adversity
when he was stricken with lymphoma in his right shoulder in 1993. "I didn't play
for awhile and just wanted to make sure I would come back focused.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today, starting out, I just wanted to make a good score. I just wanted to
get focused on getting those distractions out of the way."
</P>
<P>
	   Azinger was referring to the deaths of Stewart and his managers, Robert
Fraley and Van Ardan, who were killed in a plane crash in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
	   "People say, 'Are you over it?' I don't want to get over it," Azinger said.
"I want to remember how I felt about their families."
</P>
<P>
	   Seven players were bunched at 4-under 66, and three of them won the
tournament when it was known as the Hawaiian Open. They include John Huston, who
set the PGA Tour record of 26-under in winning the final Hawaiian Open two years
ago, Jim Furyk and John Cook.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in the group are Vijay Singh, Stuart Appleby, Fred Funk and 1999
qualifying school graduate Ben Bates.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Sluman, the defending tournament champion; Ernie Els, who lost a
two-hole playoff to Tiger Woods in last week's Mercedes Championships; and
Shigeki Maruyama, No. 3 on the Japan PGA Tour money list; were among nine who
were four strokes back at 67.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other former Hawaiian Open winners are also in contention.
</P>
<P>
	   David Ishii, who plays on the Japan PGA Tour, is at 68 with 15 others, and
the 1-under group of 20 players has back-to-back Hawaiian Open winner Corey
Pavin.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Nicklaus, son of golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, is also at 69. The
younger Nicklaus is making his PGA Tour debut on a sponsor's exemption.
</P>
<P>
	   Huston provided a hint of what might be in store for Azinger.
</P>
<P>
	   "Paul shot exactly what I shot the first day," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   To that, Appleby added, "I think it's going to play a bit easier than in
previous years."
</P>
<P>
	   Azinger, however, isn't buying.
</P>
<P>
	   "This course used to be a pushover," he said, "but not anymore."

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Spar Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HOOKSETT, N.H. (AP) -- The leading Republican presidential contenders seem
eager to stress their differences over taxes, with Texas Gov. George W. Bush
urging a larger cut to keep money away from the spenders in Congress, and Sen.
John McCain arguing that smaller reductions mean more funds set aside for Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The voters will have a clear choice on Election Day,'' McCain vowed
Thursday, and campaign officials said both he and the Texas governor were
preparing new television commercials dealing with tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Fresh polls pointed to a tight race in the Feb. 1 leadoff presidential
primary in New Hampshire, and in long day of campaigning the two men never
crossed paths, but repeatedly referred to the other's approach to cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush lumped McCain in with Vice President Al Gore as the only ``two voices''
in the campaign to criticize his tax cut as too large.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks before a lunchtime audience in Portsmouth, the Texas governor
said that unless the tax cut is big enough, there would be too much money left
for Congress to use as it saw fit. ``I worry they may spend it on bigger
government,'' he said, without mentioning that his own political party commands
a majority in both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush stressed that his plan, a $483 billion package of cuts over five years,
would leave the Social Security surplus untapped, and keep the money in a
``lockbox'' to be available for shoring up the system in the future. A spokesman
said he would use about 80 percent of the projected non-Social Security surplus
for tax cuts, with the balance set aside for education, defense and other
priorities.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain said in a written statement that wasn't good enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the last few days Governor Bush has said that locking up the Social
Security trust fund will save Social Security on its own,'' McCain said. ``He's
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issue represents a ``fundamental disagreement between us,'' he said.
''...By not shoring up the Social Security system now, with surplus funds then
we are, by fiat, agreeing to raise payroll taxes in the future. I have called
this kind of economics fiscally irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain favors a tax cut roughly half the size of the one that Bush has
proposed, and says he would set aside not only the entire Social Security
surplus, but 62 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to be available for
the retirement program and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think its conservative to pay down the debt and save Social Security''
and help Medicare, he added later in remarks to reporters aboard his campaign
bus.
</P>
<P>
	   In one form or another, the debate over tax cuts has raged within the
Republican party for more than two decades, and other GOP contenders have
criticized Bush for not being aggressive enough on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush laid out a strict position on the issue in a recent debate, when he
said he would push for tax cuts ``so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believed
they were on safe political ground -- even in a Republican primary contest -- by
tempering tax cuts with a pledge to protect Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   Under either plan, money set aside for Social Security would go toward
retiring the national debt until the government agrees on an overhaul of the
retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
	   If both men seemed eager to engage in debate over tax cuts, both also were
on the receiving end of pointed questions over drugs at separate campaign
appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   During a town hall meeting in Londonderry, Bush bristled when a questioner
asked the governor for his perspective on the war on drugs based on ``your own
drug past.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sir, sit down please,'' the governor said. ``You're making an assumption
about me that you have -- you really don't know what you're talking about. I
don't accept that assumption.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush told the man that ``what you need to know about is, should I swear in,
I'm going to bring honor and dignity to the office.'' He added, ``You shouldn't
fall prey to rumors and gossip.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was asked by a persistent questioner about legislation that denies
federal financial aid to students convicted of a drug-related felony. The
Arizona senator said he would repeal that provision, and leave it up to the
states to decide how to treat such offenders when it came to financial aid.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in Kenyon College Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    COSHOCTON, Ohio (AP) -- A member of the national champion women's swimming
team at Kenyon College was killed and 10 others were injured when a van crashed
on a slick road.
</P>
<P>
	   Killed Thursday in the crash was Molly Hatcher, 21, of Evanston, Ill.,
dispatcher James Stewart of the State Highway Patrol in Zanesville said. She was
a member of the team that has won 16 straight NCAA Division III national
championships.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff's Lt. Jon Mosier said 10 other people in the van were injured in the
single-vehicle crash, which occurred about five miles east of Coshocton on
westbound U.S. 36.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the injuries were not believed to be life threatening, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash was not known, but slick roads might be to blame,
Mosier said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sgt. Kay Perkins with the State Highway Patrol in Cambridge told The
Coshocton Tribune that evidence indicated the van skidded sideways onto the
guardrail and rolled twice while on the rail. Few of the passengers were wearing
seat belts, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenyon College is in Gambier, about 30 miles west of the crash scene.
</P>
<P>
	   The team reportedly was returning from a swimming meet in North Carolina
when the crash occurred around 6:30 p.m., about 65 miles east of Columbus.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennifer Farmer, mayor of Gambier, said the school and village share close
ties, and the fatal accident was a blow to the whole community.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're integrally connected, and everybody will be affected by this loss,"
she told The Times Recorder of Zanesville.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our hearts go out to the members of the swim team and all their family and
friends," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Stamp, director of public Affairs for Kenyon College, told the Coshocton
newspaper that several students on campus had already learned about the
accident.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the kind of college where if you don't know the name, you know the
face," Stamp said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenyon has about 1,575 students. The school is on winter break. Classes are
scheduled to resume on Monday.

<HEADLINE> EPA Accused of Protecting Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans and farmers are accusing the Clinton
administration of delaying a decision on whether to exempt California from
regulations requiring ethanol in gasoline blends to avoid damaging Vice
President Al Gore's prospects in the Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmental Protection Agency officials deny that politics is playing a
part either in the decision or its timing. The caucuses take place Jan. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   But farmers see California as a vast new market for ethanol, a product of
corn, and they are promising to make EPA's decision an issue in the general
election in November if it rules against them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My fear is that the administration has decided that it is more interested
in California's big oil interests than it is in the Midwest farmer, and doesn't
want to make public its decision until after the Iowa caucuses,'' said Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   The politics of ethanol is so powerful that Gore's campaign has a volunteer
dressed up as a giant ear of corn trailing challenger Bill Bradley around Iowa,
a reminder of Bradley's former opposition to federal ethanol subsidies. Iowa is
a major corn-producing state.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Corn Growers Association says Gore is likely to have an ear of
corn following him too if EPA sides with California officials, who oppose using
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten days before the Iowa caucuses, Gore is more than 20 points ahead of
Bradley in various Iowa presidential polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It will be my job to make sure it is an issue this summer and fall,''
Bruce Knight, the Corn Growers' chief Washington lobbyist, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   California requested the EPA decision last June. Agency officials say they
only recently received some of the supporting material they requested from
California officials, and that it could be weeks or even months before they
reach the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency's general counsel, Gary S. Guzy, said EPA is ``absolutely
committed to promoting the use of ethanol.''
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in the ethanol industry claim corn prices could rise as much as 25
cents a bushel -- they are now averaging about $1.90 a bushel -- if California
and other states are forced to switch to ethanol.
</P>
<P>
	   Ethanol production, which is subsidized by a 5.4 cent-a-gallon federal tax
break, currently consumes about 600 million of the more than 9 billion bushels
of corn grown annually in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government requires that gasoline sold in cities with smog
problems contain an oxygenate that makes the fuel burn cleaner. Usually, that
additive is MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, a product of natural gas.
Ethanol, which is a more expensive oxygenate, is used primarily in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
	   But MTBE is believed to cause cancer. California Gov. Gray Davis, a
Democrat, decided to ban the use of MTBE in his state by the end of 2002 after
some of it was found leaking into groundwater from underground fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   The California Air Resources Board then asked the EPA for the waiver so
refiners wouldn't be forced to use ethanol once MTBE is banned.
</P>
<P>
	   The board claims that ethanol would raise the cost of gasoline by 1 cent to
2 cents a gallon and could pose a pollution problem of its own by raising levels
of nitrogen oxide. EPA officials say they have the authority to waive the
ethanol requirement if it would cause California to exceed its standards for
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oxygenates cost money and that's passed onto consumers,'' said Jerry
Martin, a spokesman for the California board.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidential candidates haven't taken a position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who long has supported ethanol subsidies, said in a radio interview
last month a waiver ``may be beyond the scope'' of what EPA can legally do. Gore
is ``committed to developing a market for ethanol and other renewables because
of their clean air benefits,'' his campaign spokesman, Chris Lehane, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley opposed the ethanol subsidies when was in the Senate but since has
changed his position. Of the leading Republican candidates, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush backs the subsidies, while Arizona Sen. John McCain remains opposed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As long as you have farm economies and low farm prices, ethanol will be an
issue,'' said political scientist Steve Schier of Carleton College in
Northfield, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Bush Not Ignored by Hollywood  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE DeARMOND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a show of strength in the Democratic stronghold of
Hollywood, George W. Bush has taken in more than twice the amount of
entertainment industry money that Republican candidate Bob Dole raised during
his 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's success carries benefits beyond the dollars amassed, which account
for only a fraction of the more than $67 million he has raised for his
Republican presidential campaign. His fund-raising ability in Hollywood suggests
he has avoided the polarizing struggle with popular culture that has dogged past
GOP candidates, observers say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The importance of Hollywood to any political organization or any group
trying to get the public eye in this country is enormous,'' said Lionel
Chetwynd, a conservative writer-director who wrote the film ``The Hanoi
Hilton.'' ``The next step will be to see Hollywood personalities out on the
stump for Republican candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   Donors in the television, film and music industries gave $488,327 to Bush
between Jan. 1, 1999, and Sept. 30, 1999, according to the most recent campaign
finance reports. Dole raised a total of $193,170 by the close of the 1996 race.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bush's entertainment industry contributions lag behind Vice President
Al Gore's take of $642,865, the Texas governor has outpaced Democratic contender
Bill Bradley, who raised $328,524, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., with $180,938.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has received more Hollywood money than Bill Clinton did in his entire
1992 campaign and nearly as much as the president brought in during his 1996
re-election. Clinton, however, has raised extensive Hollywood monies for
Democratic Party committees to finance other candidates in non-presidential
election years.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's father, former President Bush, raised $140,750 from the entertainment
industry in his entire 1992 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures come from a database created by the nonpartisan Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money in politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The totals do not include money from people tied to Hollywood who did not
list their occupation as the television, film or movie industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's prolific fund-raising in Hollywood can be attributed to a thriving
economy and the lack of an incumbent running for office, said Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, senior associate at Claremont Graduate University's School of Politics
and Economics.
</P>
<P>
	   Additionally, Hollywood is full of aging, and increasingly pragmatic, baby
boomers who want access to the next president and protection for their business,
she said. The entertainment industry has come under fire for the violent content
of films, videos and music, particularly in the wake of the shootings last April
at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've got enough to hedge their bets,'' she said. ``They are not
intensely ideological.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Graham, an agent at Creative Artists Agency and a registered Republican,
gave $1,000 because he was impressed by the number of people contributing to
Bush's campaign and saw that as a sign that other people wanted a change in
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't like the current state of the executive (branch) and the policies
that they are espousing,'' he said. ``I don't agree with everything that George
Bush has said, but I agree with many things he has said.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pamela Beck, a writer and producer for a film company, paid $1,000 to attend
a Bush fund-raiser in Los Angeles to satisfy her curiosity, but hasn't settled
on a candidate for this year. As a registered Democrat with a Libertarian bent,
she sometimes donates to candidates from both major parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Beck said she thinks more people may be evaluating candidates as she does --
on individual merits rather than the party they represent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Perhaps baby boomers are getting older and being less tied to a particular
party and being more interested in a candidate as opposed to a party,'' Beck
said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaigning for Bush  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PITT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Making a rare appearance on behalf of his son,
former President Bush urged Iowa Republicans to support the Texas governor,
calling him a candidate who can change the mood of political cynicism in
America.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush raised his profile in George W.'s campaign Thursday with pitch for
support from some 700 people at a high school in Atlantic before becoming the
after-dinner speaker at a Chamber of Commerce banquet here later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
	   His earlier outings had been at private fund-raising receptions. The Bush
campaign said the father will be making more public appearances on behalf of the
son.
</P>
<P>
	   In Atlantic, in southwestern Iowa, the former president called the national
political atmosphere ``rank'' and said he thought it could be changed fast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think new leadership in the White House will do enough to change it,''
Bush said. ``I think some of the cynicism about politics will change if whoever
is elected has respect for the office ...
</P>
<P>
	   ``And only speaking about our son if he were fortunate enough to win, he
would restore respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd's reaction appeared to be mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy Nelson of Atlantic said Bush did a tremendous job as president and
that his son could follow his footsteps.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Like they say, the apple sometime doesn't fall very far from the tree, and
I think his son will carry on in the same manner,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Michaels of Atlantic said Bush's visit would help his son a lot, but
he didn't think the younger Bush is clear about the issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``His name is Bush, but it shouldn't be beat-around-the-Bush,'' Michaels
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush leads the public opinion polls in Iowa by margins of 25 points and more
over Steve Forbes in preferences for the Jan. 24 caucuses that begin the process
of choosing a new president. Sen. John McCain, Bush's closest challenger
nationally, is not competing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can tell you in Iowa organization counts,''' the former president told
reporters. ``I came in here as (an) asterisk ... but I won.'' That was in 1980,
when he upset Ronald Reagan in Iowa. Then Bush said, ``I got dusted by Reagan in
New Hampshire.'' Nominated, Reagan made Bush his vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   Eight years later, Bush was the upset victim, running third in Iowa but
winning the White House anyhow.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said George W. was with him in four national campaigns, learning in the
process. ``You know presidential politics is not very pleasant, it's not very
civil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He knows it's tough,'' Bush said. ``He's seasoned enough to take criticism
and seasoned enough not to make mistakes when somebody writes something personal
about you.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the American people are tired of divisiveness,'' Bush said. ``I
think George has demonstrated an ability to bring people together.'' He said his
son had done that better than other Republicans, including ``certainly, his
Dad.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush recalled the fall of the Berlin Wall, the disintegration of the old
Soviet Union, the Persian Gulf War, all during his one term as president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All around that four-year period George was at my side during a lot of
this,'' he said. ``I think he'd be excellent at doing what I tried to do as
president in building coalitions.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the Des Moines dinner, Democratic Gov. Tom Vilsack introduced Bush as ``a
great man.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a nonpolitical event at a highly politicized time of the year in
Iowa,'' Bush said. ``I understand the ground rules.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Though I might be tempted to utter a few words of encouragement to anyone
who is considering my boy, I will heed the immortal words of Dana Carvey, 'not
gonna do it. Wouldn't be prudent.''' Carvey is the comic who used those lines in
parodies of Bush.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Look to Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Confident that his Iowa campaign has gained steam,
Al Gore is locking horns with presidential rival Bill Bradley over farm policy
and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic candidates never crossed paths Thursday as they traversed New
Hampshire, but it didn't matter: Their focus was still on Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore arrived late in the day to this first-in-the nation primary state after
starting in Iowa, where he paid to have a New Jersey farmer stand beside him and
accuse Bradley of neglecting agricultural issues during his 18 years in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley replied with a blunt assessment of the farm crisis, laying blame at
the feet of the Clinton-Gore administration. He tossed a question back to Gore:
``Where were you? Where were you when all this was happening?''
</P>
<P>
	   The day's rat-a-tat fueled an increasingly noisy and negative contest for
the Democratic presidential nomination and its first two rounds of voting in
Iowa, on Jan. 24, and in New Hampshire, on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley advisers are quietly evaluating their prospects in Iowa, after his
latest swing drew modest-sized crowds and left supporters concerned that the
vice president was widening his already substantial lead in polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Most surveys show the vice president leading Bradley by about 20 percentage
points in Iowa. Gore's own surveys registered higher ratings after Bradley
fumbled a question about flood relief for Iowa's farmers during a recent debate.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Bradley holds a slight lead or is tied with Gore,
according to public polls.
</P>
<P>
	   His laid-back style and promise to tackle big problems such as health care
still seem to be playing well in New Hampshire, a state with a history of
backing underdogs. Iowa's more intimate caucuses tend to favor establishment
candidates, such as Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is telling New Hampshire audiences that Gore is too cautious. ``I'm
not going to settle for nickle and diming on health care. I'm not going to
settle for symbolic acts in terms of child poverty,'' Bradley told businessman
in Nashua.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing before the same group hours later, Gore said a good first step
toward campaign finance reform would be agreements among candidates to drop TV
ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I'm privileged to be the Democratic nominee in the race for president,
I will make this challenge to the Republican nominee and here it is: Let's
eliminate all of the 30-second and 60-second TV and radio ads and let's debate
twice a week,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   He has urged Bradley to jointly forgo ads, but Bradley has refused.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Gore tangled with an audience member who argued against affirmative
action. Raising his voice, Gore said police departments benefit if minorities
are hired and departments reflect their communities -- even if the applicants
don't score quite as well ``on some test.''

<HEADLINE> Hang him, then smile for the camera  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - For many years, mobs dragged people from jails or off
the streets and hanged them from a tree - and in some particularly gruesome
cases, burned them alive. Then, often as not, the perpetrators and witnesses
lined up to be photographed with the deceased.
<P>
	   This sobering underside of America's past is depicted in an exhibit, titled
"Witness," that opens Friday in Manhattan. "It's clear to me that this is a
piece of history that demands an audience," said Andrew Roth, co-owner of the
Roth Horowitz Gallery.
</P>
<P>
	   The material was gathered over the past decade by James Allen, a
Georgia-based dealer in antiques and memorabilia, and is now part of the
Allen-Littlefield Collection at Emory University in Atlanta. The New York
showing is timed with the release of a book, "Without Sanctuary: Lynching
Photography in America."
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors may browse photos of corpses of young black men hanging from
branches, telephone poles and, in one case, a bridge. There is a shot of a man
being incinerated, and another of "the half-burned head of James" on a pole. But
not all are black - there also are white bank robbers and other criminals, done
in by frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People reported
3,436 people lynched between 1889 and 1922, and one photo in the collection is
dated 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   During the peak years, most victims were black men accused of offenses
ranging from murder and rape to not stepping off the sidewalk to let a white
person pass. It was a nationwide practice, and whether in Gadsden, Alabama,
Duluth, Minn., or the "Hanging Tree" in Helena, Mont., someone with a camera
always seemed to be present.
</P>
<P>
	   Picture after picture shows local citizens gathered around the dangling
bodies - some undoubtedly perpetrators of the crime, others simply bystanders
agape with curiosity.
</P>
<P>
	   The amateurish snapshots reveal a sameness about the southern racist mobs
and western posses carrying out vigilante justice - rawboned, angular-faced men
wearing hats. In some, small children watch the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the photos were turned into souvenir postcards, some colorized and
inscribed with such notations as "Down in Old Kentucky," or "Negro who shot J.H.
Rogers at Ten Mile, Miss., 5-21-19."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one series of photos, from a double lynching in Okeman, Okla., in
1911, was copyrighted by the photographer. Another picture, taken after dark in
1900, is stamped, "Flash light by Dabbs."
</P>
<P>
	   The postcards with one-cent stamps could be sent legally through the mail
until about 1908, when they were banned. "I bought this in Hopkinsville for 15
cents. It's not on sale openly (the law forbids it)," an anonymous correspondent
wrote on the back of one postcard.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said the postcards are not only curious but "insightful into the nature
of the medium and how it was disseminated in the public domain."
</P>
<P>
	   Pictures aside, perhaps the exhibit's most chilling entry is a 1921 pamphlet
issued by the National Association of Colored People. It reproduced the Jan. 26
and 27 front pages of the Memphis (Tenn.) Press that provided an account of a
white mob seizing a black youth from a jail in Georgia and transporting him to
Arkansas, where he was burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper duly reported how the kidnappers stopped off in Memphis and were
seen "laughing and talking" in the lobby of the Hotel Peabody, and how police
formed up to guard the roads, but did nothing to interfere - more than a decade
before the FBI won the power to take charge of interstate crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Questions," Roth said when asked what people should take away from the
exhibit. "Questions about our culture, our history, our times. People aren't
being lynched today, that we know about, but there certainly are references ...
that we hear on the news, morning noon and night, that connect back to this
history."

Economists Foresee Interest Rate Hike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing new
worries that the soaring stock market could lead to an overheated U.S. economy.
Private economists said Greenspan's new concerns make them more convinced that
the central bank will boost interest rates for a fourth time since last June
when they meet Feb. 1-2. Greenspan linked his worries about the high-flying
stock market to the surge in consumer spending. Greenspan said that this added
consumer demand is taxing the economy's resources and if not moderated could
lead to rising inflation because of tight labor markets and stretched production
capacity.

	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Steve Ballmer has been crowned Microsoft's new king,
while Bill Gates may be aiming even higher. Ballmer was named chief executive of
the software giant on Thursday. He inherited the job from Gates, who will remain
chairman of the company and will become a full-time development visionary,
taking on the role of "chief software architect." The move formalizes more than
a year and a half of changes at the software company, both in management and
vision. Gates said he gave up the day-to-day leadership of the company he
founded with Paul Allen in 1975 so he could return "to what I love most --
focusing on technologies for the future."

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States is rekindling an old debate at the
United Nations over the definition of a refugee, arguing that anyone who flees
fighting should be granted the same protection and care. The United Nations, for
a variety of political and financial reasons, distinguishes between refugees who
have crossed borders to escape conflicts and those who leave their homes but
remain in their countries. These so-called "internally displaced people" often
fall through the care cracks and receive less international aid than refugees.

	   HOOKSETT, N.H. (AP) -- The leading Republican presidential contenders seem
eager to stress their differences over taxes, with Texas Gov. George W. Bush
urging a larger cut to keep money away from the spenders in Congress, and Sen.
John McCain arguing that smaller reductions mean more funds set aside for Social
Security. "The voters will have a clear choice on Election Day," McCain vowed
Thursday, and campaign officials said both he and the Texas governor were
preparing new television commercials dealing with tax cuts.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Britain on Thursday pledged to help Sierra
Leone stamp out illegal diamond trading, which has led to international calls
for a boycott of gems from the war-battered West African nation. British Foreign
Office Minister Peter Hain said action must be taken to keep diamond profits
from funding warfare. An international policy research organization, Partnership
Africa-Canada, issued a report Wednesday accusing international diamond mining
companies, dealers and sellers of helping the RUF rebels wage a brutal
eight-year civil war.

	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Radiocarbon analysis has determined that Kennewick Man, one
of the oldest skeletons found on the North American continent, is more than
9,000 years old and an early Native American, the Interior Department said
Thursday. "We do not believe he wandered to the mid-Columbia area. He was born
here," said Francis McManamon, chief archaeologist for the National Park
Service. McManamon said a study of the sediment adhering to the bones and the
shape of the spear point in his hip confirm Kennewick Man lived and died along
the banks of the Columbia River.

<HEADLINE> Latest city crackdown targets reckless drivers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Concerned by a rise in traffic-related deaths, city
officials say police will soon begin a crackdown to catch reckless drivers.
<P>
	   Next week, police will start seizing the cars of motorists caught driving at
double the speed limit or who commit other reckless driving violations, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   This new crackdown on reckless driving is similar to the NYPD's zero
tolerance on drunken driving, and has civil libertarians frustrated.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't hang the person first and give them the trial later," said Norman
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
	   It's also the latest in a long line of crackdowns Giuliani has enacted in
his time as mayor, and the NYPD has been christened to enforce. Several of those
initiatives, such as jaywalking and double parking, have been for the most part
ignored by New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   But the DWI crackdown appears to have worked, Safir said. In 1999, there
were 23 DWI fatalities in the city, compared with 31 in 1998, according to
police statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   And he thinks the same success can be achieved with the reckless driving
campaign. Including drunken driving fatalities, 416 people were killed in
traffic-related accidents in the city last year, compared with 367 in 1998,
police statistics show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think there's a place that I've been where people are drinking
alcohol where I don't hear someone mention the fact that they 'can't go drive my
car because the police are going to seize it,"' Safir said. "And that's the kind
of public awareness we want for reckless driving as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new guidelines regarding reckless driving citations on city
highways, a motorist will be slapped with reckless driving, a misdemeanor
charge, when caught driving at twice the speed limit, Safir said. The driver
will also be charged with speeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, if a motorist is seen by an officer committing three hazardous driving
violations - such as following too closely, unsafe lane changing and driving in
unauthorized lanes - he or she will be slapped with reckless driving and other
traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Now for the car seizure part. Just like the DWI crackdown, if you own the
car, it will be seized, and a person must be acquitted of the charges to get
their car back. However, if you were driving someone else's car, the car will be
given back to the rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel said it will be interesting to see if the reckless driving campaign
holds up in court. Currently, the DWI seizure program is under the scrutiny of
the New York Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the city has the legal authority to do this," Siegel said.
"This is just another example of the increasingly authoritarian policies of
Giuliani."
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel said an article he wrote last year about the DWI seizure program
questioned how far the city would try to stretch its authority.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wondered in the article if they would start seizing cars from motorists
who were speeding," he said. "And here we are."

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's key stock index closed higher Friday after recovering
from a brief selloff prompted by remarks from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan. The dollar rose against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 123.26 points, or 0.65
percent, to end the day at 18,956.55. On Thursday, the average closed up 155.87
points, or 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 106.02 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market at
3:00 p.m. (1 a.m. EST), up 0.36 yen from 105.66 late Thursday but below its late
New York level of 106.13.
</P>
<P>
	   In stock trading, the Nikkei climbed higher in the morning, cheered by sharp
gains in U.S. stocks overnight. But selling set in after Greenspan suggested the
central bank might raise interest rates in early February.
</P>
<P>
	   Players were concerned Greenspan's comments could trigger a U.S. stock
selloff that might have a whiplash effect in Japan. But the fact that S and P
500 futures trading remained solid in 24-hour Asian electronic trading helped
ease the concern, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Greenspan remarks and position-adjustment ahead of the weekend prompted
selling, but the market was firmly supported," said Hiroichi Nishi of Nikko
Securities Co. "Market sentiment is favorable thanks to the recent weakness of
the yen and the planned establishment of several new stock investment trusts."
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.33 points on
Thursday to 11,582.43. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index broke out of
a two-day slump to finish up 107.19 at 3,957.21.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section slipped 9.73 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,648.24. On Thursday, the
TOPIX rose 1.05 points, or 0.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency trading, the dollar rose after U.S. sales and price data showed
that the U.S. economy is growing at a steady pace with no danger of a sharp rise
in inflation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The greenback fell back a bit on selling by Japanese exporters. Greenspan
had little effect on currency markets, as his remarks appeared to confirm the
rate hike that most traders had been expecting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 108.88 yen, slightly above
108.84 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.7700
percent from 1.7950 percent on Thursday. The bond's price rose 0.21 point to
101.09.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Request Bioenergy Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton wants a $243 million increase in
funding next year for developing technologies that turn trees, plants and animal
waste into energy and environmentally friendly products.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's proposed 2001 budget will ask Congress for a total $439
million to fund research and grants to aid the production of ``bioenergy'' and
other products, such as plastics and chemicals, from agricultural waste.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, outlined in a White House document obtained Thursday by The
Associated Press, follows up on an August executive order creating an
interagency council to promote bio-technologies and, hopefully, reduce U.S. oil
demand and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
	   It would go beyond the $196 million program Congress approved this year for
developing new biomass-based fuels by also focusing attention on other new
bioproducts such as feedstocks and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Ballantine, an adviser to the president on environmental issues,
pointed to an announcement by Cargill Inc. and Dow Chemical Co. that they would
begin producing plastics made from corn rather than petroleum as a harbinger of
things to come.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to revolutionize both the farming industry, in that you're
talking about another huge source of demand for farm products -- but even more
specifically the impact it can have environmentally,'' Ballantine said.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for GOP Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, said new congressional authority may be needed for some
of what Clinton wants to do. Still, he welcomed the president's commitment to
the promotion of bioenergy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There have been major breakthroughs in the technology,'' said Andy Fisher,
Lugar's spokesman. ``So this is sort of the right time to strike. The full
eco-balance of the equation is far better than anything we've seen before.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lugar has his own legislation promoting ``biomass'' development that would
authorize $300 million over six years for research. Approved in the Senate, it
has received a cooler reception in the House.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan includes a request for $49 million for the Energy
Department's research into cellulase systems to break down woody and grassy
crops into feedstocks and to underwrite development of new technologies to
develop new consumer products.
</P>
<P>
	   It also includes $194 million for Agriculture Department initiatives. A
large chunk, about $150 million, would be for incentive payments through the
department's Commodity Credit Corporation to bioenergy producers that buy more
farm commodities to expand their production.
</P>
<P>
	   Biomass energy, generated mostly from lumberyard waste, is currently about 3
percent of the total U.S. energy supply.

<HEADLINE> Koch Industries Fined for Pollution  </HEADLINE>
   By ROXANA HEGEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WICHITA, Kan. (AP) -- Paul Jackson could smell the gasoline long before he
reached the area where the Koch Industries pipeline had burst, spilling 79,000
gallons into a nearby creek. It was June 2, 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, president of Sedgwick County Rural Water District No. 1,
immediately shut down the line carrying water to Kechi, just north of Wichita.
He remembers Koch doing everything it could to help, shipping in water and
paying for problems in the tiny rural community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They didn't give us a minute's trouble on any of this,'' he said. ``We
were very nervous about this situation and they really eased our minds.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was more than a little surprised to learn the spill was one of 300 across
the nation involved in a landmark $35 million settlement announced Thursday by
the Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said it was the biggest civil fine ever levied under the
Clean Water Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch Industries, one of the country's largest oil pipeline operators, agreed
to pay the penalties for leaking 3 million gallons of oil into lakes and streams
in six states. The settlement singled out leaks from 1990 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement resolved two lawsuits charging that for years Koch's pipeline
subsidiary had left thousands of miles of pipeline in disrepair, leading to
hundreds of oil leaks.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch, based in Wichita, operates more than 35,000 miles of oil and gas
pipeline in the United States and Canada. Koch has refineries in Texas and
Minnesota through its Koch Petroleum Group subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides Kansas, the spills polluted waterways in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Louisiana and Missouri, according to the EPA.
</P>
<P>
	   EPA Administrator Carol Browner called Koch's actions ``egregious
violations'' and said the fine ``sends a strong message that those who try to
profit by polluting our environment pay a price.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This record civil penalty puts those who transport hazardous materials on
notice,'' added Attorney General Janet Reno. ``We will not let you foul our
water and spoil our land by breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Koch Industries, through its pipeline subsidiary, said the settlement was
``fair and reasonable'' and that it will avoid any additional litigation. The
government originally had sought between $71 million and $214 million in
penalties, according to the company.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have always sought to operate our pipelines with the highest safety and
environmental standards,'' said Pat McCann, the subsidiary's senior vice
president.
</P>
<P>
	   The government, in the complaints filed in 1995 and 1997, claimed Koch could
have prevented most of the spills, caused mainly by corrosion, through prompt
maintenance and safe operations. Under the settlement, Koch must examine 2,500
miles of pipeline and repair defects.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the same company whose state-of-the-art pipeline monitoring system
was recently honored by the Smithsonian Institute as one of the nation's leading
technological innovations.
</P>
<P>
	   As a privately held company, Koch Industries does not have to report annual
profits and revenues. It has been estimated the company's had $30 billion in
revenue last year from an array of businesses from oil refining and transporting
to chemical production and cattle ranching.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the settlement, Koch pays $30 million in fines, half of which will go
into the federal trust fund for cleaning up oil spills; the other half goes to
the state of Texas, which had joined in the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   An additional $5 million goes to preserve wetlands in Kansas and Oklahoma,
conduct a pipeline safety study and aid environmental programs in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Browner said the fine was the largest ever against a single company under
the Clean Water Act, surpassing a $12.6 million fine against Smithfield Foods
Inc. in 1997 for dumping hog waste into Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been larger settlements, involving air or water pollution, but
they generally have focused all or largely on cleanup costs. These include the
1989 Exxon tanker disaster in Alaska and last year's $150 million settlement --
all cleanup expenditures -- with General Electric Co., over toxic chemical
pollution of a river in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago, the EPA reached a $1 billion settlement -- including $100
million in penalties -- with seven diesel engine manufacturer accused of
tampering with air pollution control devices.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Kechi case, the EPA said the spill resulted in benzene contamination
of surrounding groundwater for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
	   That was news to Jackson, who said no one ever notified him. Not that he was
too worried -- his water district buys its water wholesale from Wichita.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other Koch cases cited by the EPA was the spill of 221,000 gallons
of oil into a creek in Payne County, Okla., in 1992. A 1994 pipeline rupture
also sent 90,300 gallons of oil into a Texas creek, contaminating areas along
Nueces Bay and Corpus Christi Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   On its Web page, Koch Industries touts its environmental record, saying it
has spent $980 million for environmental protection at refineries and other
facilities since 1990. It claims to have reduced pipeline leaks by more than 90
percent over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The penalties handed down Thursday are the latest in a series of problems
for the company.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, a jury in Tulsa, Okla., found that Koch had underreported
thousands of oil purchases. Damages haven't yet been assessed, but the judge
could fine the company a maximum of $214 million on the 24,587 claims the jury
found to be false.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nursing Home Probes  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To strengthen oversight of nursing homes, President
Clinton will ask Congress for an additional $15.9 million for training
inspectors, conducting surprise inspections and cracking down on the 100 worst
facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   With nearly a fourth of the nation's nursing homes deficient in meeting
national quality standards, according to government auditors, the administration
has promised in the last year to do more monitoring and give inspectors more
training.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal, to be included in the 2001 budget plan and announced
today, brings total funds for nursing care oversight to $70 million, an increase
of nearly 30 percent over last year. Most of the money goes to state agencies
responsible for inspecting some 16,700 nursing homes that provide care for about
1.6 million older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the funds are earmarked for:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Training inspectors to file computerized reports on nursing home
compliance that will make it easier to identify problem homes, track whether
they are making improvements and provide information for surveyors visiting the
facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports are integrated into a Website for consumers seeking information
on specific nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Inspecting nursing homes during evenings and weekends to ensure that
facilities, which know that inspections usually take place during the day,
aren't hiding substandard practices.
</P>
<P>
	   -- More inspections of at least 100 homes with the worst compliance records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that those entities are inspected more frequently,''
said Chris Jennings, Clinton's health policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month the government put in place tough new rules to crack down on
nursing homes that repeatedly violate standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Homes that are found to have caused harm, through abuse or neglect, to even
a single resident in two or more inspections can immediately be fined up to
$10,000 and have their Medicare or Medicaid payments suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously the penalties were mandatory only for nursing homes that showed a
pattern of harm to multiple residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings also said the administration would launch a $10 million campaign to
provide elderly Americans with information about what long-term care Medicare
covers, how to evaluate long-term care policies and how to get information on
community-based services.
</P>
<P>
	   The information would be distributed through handbooks, state organizations
and public service announcements on radio and television.

<HEADLINE> Manhattan grand jury indicts Combs on weapons charge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Sean "Puffy" Combs has just about had it all.
<P>
	   He has a Grammy award. He has his millions of dollars. And he has a
glamorous girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, like some others who have enjoyed success, Combs is encountering the
downside of fame: legal trouble, in the form of a grand jury indictment.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, a grand jury found there was enough evidence to indict the star
on weapons charges, two weeks after police found the rapper and a stolen handgun
inside a sports utility vehicle owned by his record label.
</P>
<P>
	   Minutes after prosecutors released the grand jury's decision, Combs'
attorneys, who include Johnnie Cochran of O.J. Simpson "Dream Team" fame and
well-known New York lawyer Benjamin Brafman, declared their client's innocence.
The pair also implored Combs' fans to withhold passing judgment on Combs until a
decision is rendered in court.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect he will be vindicated on all charges," Cochran said.
</P>
<P>
	   Brafman added that Combs' case has been splattered across headlines when it
should have been resolved at a police "precinct level." While some witnesses
have claimed Combs had a gun, Brafman said more witnesses will testify that he
was not carrying a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, who stayed out of public view Thursday, issued a statement saying,
"The decision to indict me is wrong. I'm innocent and we will prove it. I am
putting my faith in God and I know my name will be cleared."
</P>
<P>
	   Two of Combs' associates were also named in the indictment: his rapping
protDegDe Jamal "Shyne" Barrow for attempted murder in a Dec. 27 nightclub
shooting that preceded Combs' arrest, and bodyguard Anthony Jones on a weapons
charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was taken into custody by police, along with his girlfriend Jennifer
Lopez, as they drove away from the midtown club following the 2:30 a.m. gunplay.
</P>
<P>
	   He was charged with possession of a 9 mm handgun found inside the car, and
with possession of another 9 mm that was thrown from his fleeing vehicle,
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau told a jam-packed news conference
in his office library.
</P>
<P>
	   Both weapons were stolen, both had been fired and both held a combination of
hollow point and regular bullets, the district attorney said. The gun found in
the car had 11 bullets in the magazine and one in the chamber, while the other
had 7 bullets in the magazine and one in the chamber, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Each gun holds 16 bullets. The district attorney could not say where or when
the weapons had been fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was charged with second-degree possession of a weapon, meaning he had
a loaded gun with intent to use it. He was also charged in the third-degree,
which is simple possession of a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   His attorneys, who held a news conference without their high-profile client,
said Combs' fingerprints weren't on either weapon. "Mr. Combs intends to plead
not guilty to the charges," Cochran promised.
</P>
<P>
	   Lopez, who testified before the grand jury, released a statement saying she
never saw Combs with a weapon on the night of his arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am surprised and saddened to learn of the indictment against Sean Combs,"
she said. "I support him wholeheartedly throughout this difficult time."
</P>
<P>
	   Combs, who earned an estimated $53 million through his rap empire in 1998,
was released on $10,000 bail after his arrest. No timetable was set for Combs'
arraignment, although he had a pending Feb. 14 court date.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs and Lopez, the singer/actress who starred in the films "Selena" and
"Out of Sight," were arrested when officers stopped a 1999 sports utility car
that had run several red lights while fleeing the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Police found the couple in the back seat and a stolen 9 mm pistol in the
front seat. Also in the vehicle were a driver, who was not charged, and
bodyguard Jones.
</P>
<P>
	   Barrow, 19, was charged with wounding three people after allegedly opening
fire inside the club; he was also charged with weapons possession, assault and
reckless endangerment. Two of the victims have since filed multimillion-dollar
lawsuits against Combs and others.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Combs' second arrest of 1999. The rap impresario was arrested in
April for allegedly beating a fellow music executive, leaving the victim with a
broken arm and jaw. Combs pleaded guilty to harassment in the case, and was
ordered to undergo counseling.

Economists Foresee Interest Rate Hike
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing new
worries that the soaring stock market could lead to an overheated U.S. economy.
Private economists said Greenspan's new concerns make them more convinced that
the central bank will boost interest rates for a fourth time since last June
when they meet Feb. 1-2. Greenspan linked his worries about the high-flying
stock market to the surge in consumer spending. Greenspan said that this added
consumer demand is taxing the economy's resources and if not moderated could
lead to rising inflation because of tight labor markets and stretched production
capacity.

<HEADLINE> Malay Opposition Leaders Charged  </HEADLINE>
   By RANJAN ROY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- In the government's latest crackdown on
political dissent, a Malaysian court charged several opposition leaders today
with sedition and leaking state secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaysia's Sessions Court charged Karpal Singh, a longtime critic of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad and defense attorney for jailed politician Anwar
Ibrahim, with sedition after he alleged Anwar's sodomy trial that ``people in
high places'' had tried to poison his client.
</P>
<P>
	   Karpal, deputy chairman of the Democratic Action Party, pleaded innocent and
was released on bail. If convicted, he faces up to three years in prison and a
fine of $1,315.
</P>
<P>
	   The state crackdown started Wednesday with authorities arresting several of
the government's most vocal and prominent critics. On the same day, Mahathir
left for a two-week overseas vacation.
</P>
<P>
	   In a suburban court today, Mohamed Ezam Mohamed Nor, a senior leader of the
Anwar's National Justice Party, was charged with violating the Official Secrets
Act by leaking government documents to the media last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition called today for a mass campaign to persuade the government
to withdraw its charges against the five opposition politicians who had been
arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Karpal said it was the first time in any Commonwealth nation that a lawyer
was prosecuted for something said during a court hearing. He said the case would
test the independence of the judiciary and the status of lawyers in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We propose to take the bull by the horns,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of more than fifty Malaysian lawyers signed a petition today calling
for an urgent meeting of the country's Bar Council to discuss the case, lawyer
P. Uthayakumar said.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Karpal's case, a court today charged Marina Yusoff, a leader
of the National Justice Party, with sedition. Prosecutors for the court, in
northern Penang state, accused her of trying to incite racial unrest with
comments she made during a political speech last year. Her trial was set for
April 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the editor of the opposition Harakah newspaper, Zulkifli Sulong, was
charged Thursday with sedition for an Aug. 2 article on Anwar's trials that
included a quote accusing the government of conspiracy against the former
politician. The newspaper's printer, Chea Lim Thye, also was charged with
sedition.
</P>
<P>
	   Zulkifli's trial begins May 22. If convicted, he faces three years in
prison, and his newspaper would likely be shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   Malaysia has been in political turmoil since Anwar was fired in September
1998. His subsequent arrest and corruption conviction provoked massive
anti-government demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   Anwar is now serving a six-year prison term and standing trial for sodomy.
He has denied all the charges against him and says he's the victim of a
political conspiracy to destroy both him and the growing movement against
Mahathir's 18-year lock on power.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Eyes US Kashmir Involvement  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHY GANNON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan told visiting U.S. legislators today it
wanted the United States to take a more active role in finding a solution to its
52-year-old dispute with India over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   The four senators -- including Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota,
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, Harry Reid of Nevada and Daniel Akaka of Hawaii
-- were in Islamabad to push Pakistan's military leadership for a timetable on
returning to democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Pakistani foreign ministry officials focused their talks with the
lawmakers on Kashmir, which both India and Pakistan claim as their own. Their
long dispute over the Himalayan territory -- which has flared into two wars
since 1947 and bitter clashes last year -- has become a more prominent
international concern since the two countries tested nuclear weapons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Peace and security in the region is our basic issue,'' said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf. Pakistan controls roughly one-third of Kashmir,
and neighboring India rules the remaining two-thirds.
</P>
<P>
	   Last summer's bitter border war ended after then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
visited Washington on July 4 and agreed to order militants to withdraw from
Indian territory. Sharif said he had received a promise from President Clinton
for greater U.S. involvement in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. in our view has the capacity to play a moderating and
constructive role, particularly in the promotion of peace and security in the
region, which is predicated on a just and fair settlement of the core dispute of
Kashmir,'' Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane has escalated the tensions
between India and Pakistan, and launched a bitter war of words and accusations.
India says Pakistan orchestrated the hijacking, a charge Islamabad vehemently
denies.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the hijacking, which ended Dec. 31 in Kandahar, Afghanistan, India has
asked the United States and other countries to declare Pakistan a terrorist
state. The request has been ignored.
</P>
<P>
	   But observers have warned that the blistering rhetoric by both countries
does not bode well for fresh initiatives to ease tensions.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the Oct. 12 military takeover that ousted Sharif, Washington has
pushed Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who is running the country, to establish a
timetable for a return to civilian rule. Musharraf has resisted, saying
elections will have to wait until his military-led government implements
electoral reforms, revives the economy and cleans up corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   It's was not clear whether the legislators were to meet Musharraf, and the
U.S. Embassy in Islamabad refused to give information on the senators' agenda.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Sultan Mahmood, the premier in the Pakistani sector of Kashmir,
dissolved his Cabinet today without explanation. He said he would name a new one
shortly, though did not give an exact date.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmiri officials said on condition of anonymity that Mahmood had been
pressed to reduce the size of his 16-member Cabinet. Since the coup, the army
leadership has appointed provincial governments throughout the country, but kept
their sizes to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
	   Kashmir has a semi-autonomous status in Pakistan, with its own prime
minister.

fleeing oppression. At the same time, we must be able to control our borders to
protect our security as well as to keep our work force stable. I believe the
current level of immigration should be maintained.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``Maintained. I support our current legal immigration system that
is based on family reunification and labor shortage needs while at the same time
ensuring that American workers are not displaced or otherwise adversely
affected; and provides humanitarian protection for refugees.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``Illegal immigration should be ended without delay. Legal
immigration should be reduced to 250,000 newcomers a year, both to assimilate
the 30 million who have come here in recent decades, and to ease the downward
pressure on the wages of U.S. workers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Bauer: ``Legal immigration numbers should be reviewed each year based
on economic and social conditions in the United States. Legal immigration should
also be linked to the skill needs of U.S. industries. I would lower the number
temporarily in order to assess the Clinton-Gore administration's neglect in
preventing illegal immigration.''
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``America is a nation of immigrants; legal immigration is
good for America and for those who come here seeking freedom and opportunity. As
Governor of a border state, I know firsthand the great richness and benefits
that legal immigrants with different cultures, history and traditions bring to
America. I support increasing the number of H-1B visas to help meet America's
need for more high-tech workers, and I support expanding the H-2A temporary
agricultural workers program so that willing workers can help meet America's
labor needs. I oppose illegal immigration. The federal government must improve
its enforcement of our borders.''
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes: ``We are a nation of immigrants, but our government is doing a
terrible job on the immigration issue. As President, I will provide real
conservative leadership on this critical issue. I do not support increasing
legal immigration, except in the area of H1-B visas for high-tech workers to
work side-by-side with American scientists and engineers. The real issue,
however, is that the federal government is not protecting our borders and should
compensate states as a result. The INS is rife with dismal mismanagement and
badly needs drastic reform. We should more rapidly deport illegal immigrants.
The Border Patrol needs to be beefed up and provided more manpower and
state-of-the-art, high-tech equipment.''
</P>
<P>
	   Orrin Hatch: ``Maintained. As President, I will continue to work with the
Border Patrol and the INS to find solutions and ensure that immigration into the
United States is under control and legal. We must not allow a person's first
entry into our nation to be an illegal act.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``I strongly support ample legal immigration. I do not believe
that we, as a nation of immigrants, should shut our doors to those who would
contribute to our society and economy. I believe we should have immigration laws
and policies that are fair, reasonable, and sustainable and that have the
support of the American people. I have strongly supported dramatically expanding
visas for qualified high-tech workers who can help America maintain its world
leadership in the information technology revolution. As President, I will ensure
that the laws governing legal immigration will help ensure that our diversity
and openness remain a vital source of national strength and character.''

<HEADLINE> Christians Threatened in Jakarta  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Around 300 Muslim demonstrators threatened today
to launch a campaign to kill Christians in the capital if the government didn't
put an end to sectarian clashes in eastern Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
	   In two separate protests -- one at the presidential palace and the other in
front of the head office of the Communion of Churches in Indonesia --
demonstrators said they were ready to take up arms to stop the violence between
Muslims and Christians in the Maluku islands.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Christians must stop the massacre of Muslims in the Malukus, otherwise
we will do the same thing to Christians in Jakarta,'' protesters shouted from
Brigade Abaabil, a small radical Muslim group. ``There will be a holy war.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 2,000 people have died in a year of Christian-Muslim clashes in the
provinces of Maluku and North Maluku, known during Dutch colonial rule as the
Spice Islands or Molaccas.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past three weeks the violence has increased, leaving more than 1,000
dead in what many are calling one of the worst cases of religious violence since
the Southeast Asian country gained independence in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   Maluku's capital of Ambon, 1,600 miles west of Jakarta, was quiet today
despite rumors of impending clashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days of fierce fighting on nearby Seram Island also had ended, military
spokesman Col. Iwa Budiman said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the towns of Galela and Tobelo on Halmahera Island remained tense, with
gangs roaming the streets, newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 12 people were killed Wednesday and Thursday in clashes on the
island, the Kompas daily said. The report could not be confirmed by the
military.
</P>
<P>
	   Kompas also quoted Maluku military commander Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela as
saying 11 people had died in fighting in the town of Siohana on Halmahera.

<HEADLINE> Pet Co. Sues Singer George Strait  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- A pet food company is suing country singer George
Strait, saying he destroyed the profitability of a product line that carried his
name.
</P>
<P>
	   South Texas Pet Products Inc., which makes the dog food Strait Nutrition,
filed the lawsuit Monday. The suit also names Strait's general manager, Erv
Woolsey of Nashville, Tenn., and his corporation, Strait Productions Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Woolsey didn't respond to a request for an interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed D'Avanzo, the original president of the company, said Strait's bad
decisions dropped the company's value from $3 million to "a fraction of that
amount."
</P>
<P>
	   D'Avanzo said he co-signed a $1 million loan with Strait for operating
expenses. The partners split the stock equally, and each gave a small share of
ownership to Woolsey. With Woolsey's swing vote, Strait had controlling interest
in the company.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit alleges Strait and Woolsey used their majority ownership to
"instruct company attorneys to abandon a meritorious lawsuit against a supplier
which had caused great damage to the company by delivering defective products."
</P>
<P>
	   Strait also canceled a licensing and royalty agreement entered into in March
1994, precluding the company from using his image, appearance and endorsement,
D'Avanzo said.

    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A contractor's $415,000 claim against Cher for work on
her Malibu home has been revived by a state appeals court.
</P>

November 1997 without fully paying for design and construction work already done
on the $5 million house.
</P>

contract. But the 2nd District Court of Appeal said Thursday that the company
might be able to enforce its alleged oral agreement if it could prove its
claims.
</P>

	   The court also said Cher is "a highly sophisticated homeowner with previous
involvement in residential construction projects," rather than the ordinary
customer whom the law on written contracts was meant to protect.

    COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State University's athletics communications
director has resigned after the school referred to comedian Richard Lewis as a
drunk in two basketball media guides.
</P>

	   The guides were produced under the supervision of Gerry Emig, whose
resignation was announced Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> President Says Economy Is on Track  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While noting a bit ruefully that he may not be personally
sharing the full fruits of America's current economic boom, President Clinton
spent a day among Wall Street titans and said he sees no reason the good times
can't roll awhile longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton beamed Thursday evening as he gazed over the floor of the New York
Stock Exchange -- probably the most potent symbol of the robust economy Clinton
claims significant credit for fostering.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm superstitious,'' Clinton admitted to a sushi-nibbling crowd gathered
on the trading floor, and he doesn't want to jinx the market's remarkable rise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't ever comment on it, except that I like the way it looks,'' Clinton
said to applause.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, at 3,241 when Clinton took office in 1993,
has soared beyond the 11,500 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   During several appearances in New York, Clinton did comment extensively on
the turnaround in the American economy since he took office seven years ago,
exulting in the nation's good fortune but also appealing for help spreading
wealth to ``the people and places left behind.''
</P>
<P>
	   Much of the day was spent alongside the Rev. Jesse Jackson in an attempt to
round up corporate and Wall Street support for programs that help low-income and
minority entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
	   One corporate leader who has signed on to help Jackson, Citigroup Chairman
Sanford Weill, startled the president with an unorthodox greeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to thank you for my net worth,'' Weill declared, saying Citigroup's
stock had climbed considerably since Clinton took office.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, deeply in debt with legal bills, replied, ``I'm glad one of us made
money out of this administration.''
</P>
<P>
	   Assets held for the Clintons in a blind trust have presumably grown along
with the stock market. But the president's position makes it effectively
impossible for him to play the market the way many middle-class people,
including some of Clinton's own aides, have recently done to great success.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton may have another chance. He will be out of office in a year, and
could then set about making money in the stock market and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Clinton said the fundamentals of the economy are sound, and
there are no immediate fears of a boom-killing surge of inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll just see how long it'll go,'' Clinton said during an interview on
the financial network CNBC.
</P>
<P>
	   After noting that next month will mark the nation's longest stretch of
sustained economic growth ever, Clinton added:
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's never been anything like this before. The truth is no one knows
for sure what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   But in a speech Thursday to the Economic Club of New York , the chairman of
the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, said he was somewhat worried the strong
stock market could overheat the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is this imbalance between growth of supply and growth of demand that
contains the potential seeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that
could undermine the current expansion,'' Greenspan told his audience of top
economists and Wall Street professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also raised an estimated $250,000 for Democratic candidates at a
party on New York's Upper East Side that featured longtime Democratic donors,
some newly wealthy entrepreneurs and stock market wizards, and model Christie
Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
	   Now a New Yorker himself, Clinton then retired to his new house in suburban
Westchester County.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Would Boost Spending Limits  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN FRAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking political advantage for this election year,
President Clinton will propose raising strict spending limits by billions of
dollars, Democrats say.
</P>
<P>
	   Though some conservatives might be reluctant, many Republicans are willing
to consider it, perhaps in exchange for roping off some of the budget surplus
for tax cuts, GOP aides say.
</P>
<P>
	   But Republican leaders have not decided what to do about the limits, which
were forged in the 1997 pact between Clinton and Congress aimed at balancing the
budget by 2002. The budget was balanced in 1998, thanks to the robust economy,
and many lawmakers from both parties feel the limits are outdated in today's
world of growing federal surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The current blueprint we're working off is not the house we're building
today,'' said Richard May, a former GOP House Budget Committee director who is
now a consultant.
</P>
<P>
	   Boosting the spending caps could give Clinton a political edge over
Republicans. Since surplus projections are based partly on assumptions about
future spending, higher spending means less money left for the tax cuts many
Republicans want, including GOP presidential front runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   But facing re-election, many Republican lawmakers are as eager as Democrats
to bring federal dollars home to their districts and would oppose the cuts that
obeying the spending limits would require.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, the strong economy is producing so much federal revenue that many
Republicans feel there could be enough money for both extra spending and tax
cuts. And with the GOP eager to end this year's session of Congress early for
the fall campaign, a deal to raise the limits might limit time-consuming fights
over spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   By either ignoring the limits or changing them, the limits will almost
certainly be surpassed this year by tens of billions of dollars. They were
breached last year by $32 billion and the year before too, as both parties
indulged in a spending splurge and budget gimmickry, like declaring the census
an emergency.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, formally raising the spending caps would mark a symbolic,
bipartisan farewell to tight restraints envisioned in 1997, when federal
deficits prevailed. It would also underline that with swelling annual surpluses,
politicians and voters have little taste for such spending restrictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will propose letting spending rise somewhat below the inflation
rate, said Democratic officials speaking on condition of anonymity, but other
details were not available. The plan will be in the fiscal 2001 budget the
president presents Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Potentially, it could allow tens of billions of dollars to be spent next
year -- and hundreds of billions over the next decade -- beyond what the limits
would permit.
</P>
<P>
	   The spending caps are aimed at restraining one-third of the $1.7 trillion
federal budget. The limits affect all spending except automatically paid
benefits like Social Security and payments to holders of federal debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, the caps would force such spending downward from $613
billion in fiscal 2000 -- which runs through Sept. 30 -- to $579 billion in 2001
and $570 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The limits are due to expire after that. Some officials said Clinton might
propose extending the spending caps for several more years.
</P>
<P>
	   White House economic adviser Gene Sperling declined to say if Clinton will
propose raising the limits, but said Republicans ``shredded the caps'' last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Republicans abandoned the spending caps after finding they lacked
the votes to support them. Only a few conservatives complained.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the GOP promised to not spend the two-thirds of the $3 trillion
federal surplus projected through 2009 coming from Social Security, a pledge
they believe the public more readily understands.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., called last month
for raising the limits. Neither House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., nor Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., have ruled it out.
</P>
<P>
	   Ultimately, Republicans might propose raising the limits in exchange for
reserving parts of the surplus for tax cuts or debt reduction, aides said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We need to establish a new reality that restrains spending in an era of
surpluses'' and would ``leave room for a Bush tax-cut plan,'' said Terry Holt,
spokesman for House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office will try evading the issue by
producing three surplus estimates later this month: One assuming the spending
caps hold, and two assuming the limits are breached by varying degrees.

<HEADLINE> Letterman To Undergo Heart Tests  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Funnyman David Letterman suddenly turned serious during a
taping of his talk show, telling audience members and guest Regis Philbin that
he will be undergoing a test for possible heart disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, was to undergo an angiogram today at an undisclosed hospital
in New York. In an angiogram, a flexible catheter is inserted into an artery and
guided to the area of the heart, then dye is injected into the catheter and an
X-ray film is made of heart function.
</P>
<P>
	   The host of CBS' "Late Night" program revealed the news during a taping on
Thursday of a show set to air tonight, the Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   The test "could result in a clean bill of health, medication or other
procedures," Letterman spokesman Howard Rubenstein said. Letterman will have the
angiogram performed because "he thought it prudent to do this now as a
precaution," Rubenstein added.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman said the worst-case scenario would be to "open daddy's rib cage
... and I don't want that."
</P>
<P>
	   The host began by asking Philbin about his own successful emergency
angioplasty in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason I'm bringing this up is that I have very high cholesterol, and I
also have a history of this," Letterman said. Letterman's father died of a heart
attack in his 50s, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   After the taping, Philbin said he was surprised by the news. "He sprang it
on me," Philbin said. "You never know if he's kidding or not, but it became
clear he was serious."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman broke the news the day after his show with guest Hillary Rodham
Clinton registered his highest-rated broadcast in nearly six years.

<HEADLINE> NYC Gallery Shows Lynching Photos  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD PYLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Once upon a time in America, mobs dragged people out of
jails or off the streets and hanged them from the nearest tree. Sometimes they
burned them alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, often as not, members of the mob lined up to be photographed with the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of these sobering pictures-- some of them turned into postcards that
were occasionally used as warnings -- have been put on public display today at a
Manhattan gallery.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's clear to me that this is a piece of history that demands an audience,"
said Andrew Roth, co-owner of the Roth Horowitz Gallery.
</P>
<P>
	   There are photos of corpses of young black men hanging from branches,
telephone poles and, in one case, a bridge. There is a shot of a man being
incinerated and another of "the half-burned head of James" on a pole.
</P>
<P>
	   The material was gathered over the past decade by James Allen, a
Georgia-based dealer in antiques and memorabilia, and are now part of the
Allen-Littlefield Collection at Emory University in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Picture after picture shows people gathered around the dangling bodies --
some likely perpetrators of the crime, others simply curious bystanders.
</P>
<P>
	   The amateurish snapshots reveal a sameness about southern racist mobs and
western posses carrying out vigilante justice -- rawboned, angular-faced men
wearing hats. In some, small children watch the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims are overwhelmingly black.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People reported
3,436 people lynched between 1889 and 1922. One photo in the collection is dated
1960.
</P>
<P>
	   During the peak years, most victims were black men accused of offenses
ranging from murder and rape to not stepping off the sidewalk to let a white
person pass. It was not a strictly Southern practice, and whether in Gadsden,
Alabama, Duluth, Minn., or the "Hanging Tree" in Helena, Mont., someone with a
camera was there.
</P>
<P>
	   Many photos were turned into souvenir postcards, some colorized and
inscribed with such notations as "Down in Old Kentucky," or "Negro who shot J.H.
Rogers at Ten Mile, Miss., 5-21-19."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one series of photos, from a double lynching in Okeman, Okla., in
1911, was copyrighted by the photographer.
</P>
<P>
	   The postcards with one-cent stamps could be sent legally through the mail
until about 1908, when they were banned. "I bought this in Hopkinsville for 15
cents. It's not on sale openly (the law forbids it)," an anonymous correspondent
wrote on the back of one postcard.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps the exhibit's most chilling entry is a 1921 NAACP pamphlet. It
reproduced the Jan. 26 and 27 front pages of the Memphis (Tenn.) Press that
provided an account of a white mob seizing a black youth from a jail in Georgia
and transporting him to Arkansas, where he was burned at the stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper duly reported how the kidnappers stopped off in Memphis and were
seen "laughing and talking" in the lobby of the Hotel Peabody, and how police
guarded the roads but did nothing to interfere -- more than a decade before the
FBI won the power to take charge of interstate crime.
</P>
<P>
	   "Questions," Roth said when asked what people should take away from the
exhibit. "Questions about our culture, our history, our times.
</P>
<P>
	   "People aren't being lynched today, that we know about, but there certainly
are references ... that we hear on the news, morning noon and night, that
connect back to this history."

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher this morning after a
government report confirmed that inflation remains under control despite the
robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 137.44 to 11,719.87, as the blue chip index moved into record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index also moved into record territory, rising 106.25
to 4,063.86. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 21.20 to 1,470.88.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said today consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in December,
slightly below forecasts. Excluding energy prices, the gain was just 0.1
percent. The report was the latest signal the inflation fears remain unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday
night contained no great surprises, and Wall Street is now feeling more
comfortable that a hike of no more than a quarter-percentage point on Feb. 2 is
a likely outcome of the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York

<HEADLINE> White House Defends TV Drug Message  </HEADLINE>
    By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House today denied trying to rob TV networks of
creative freedom by having President Clinton's drug policy adviser consult with
them on scripts and offer financial credits for anti-drug messages in prime-time
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president's Office of National
Drug Control Policy was using "a very important and innovative" program of
advertising and partnerships to help reduce the demand for drugs, and anti-drug
messages being incorporated into TV scripts were a positive result of that.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no element of trying to dictate or infringe on any creative
process," Lockhart said. "We just think it's important to get the anti-drug
message out in as many ways as we can."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the program is important to Clinton, who called on Hollywood
executives last year to limit violent and inappropriate images in films in the
wake of the mass shootings at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'd like all elements of popular culture to join the effort to send a
strong message about the dangers of drugs, especially to our children," Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcast networks' consultations with the drug office, on such shows as
NBC's top-rated "ER," Fox's "Beverly Hills 90210" and CBS's "Chicago Hope,"
raised questions about their independence, but representatives of ABC, CBS, NBC,
Fox and the WB insisted Thursday that they still call the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "At no time has the Office of National Drug Control Policy either sought or
been granted creative control over Fox program content," said Tom Tyre, a
network spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House drug office said that it had reviewed the scripts of two
dozen programs over the past few years for anti-drug messages, sometimes
suggesting changes that were incorporated in the final product.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate arrangement worked out between the networks and the government
gave the companies a financial incentive for preaching against drug use.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress in 1997 authorized an anti-drug TV campaign that advocates hope
will have $1 billion in spending over five years. The government bought
commercial time on the networks for their ads, and the networks agreed to match
that time.
</P>
<P>
	   With business recently booming for TV ad sales, the government set up an
arrangement where networks would get credit for anti-drug messages incorporated
in their shows. This freed up commercial time where the networks would have had
to run the government ads, letting the broadcasters sell the time to other
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House drug office valued the programming messages it had approved
at $22 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm fairly amazed that there has been any concern expressed about this,"
said Rich Hamilton, CEO of Zenith Media, an ad buying firm that helped develop
the idea as a go-between for the broadcasters and government.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet an expert on media ethics said it raises questions about the motives of
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "What it can do for the networks is make it seem that they are only going to
run those messages or shows that have prior government approval," said Aly
Colon, a professor at the Poynter Institute. "That may not be reality, but at
least it can become a perception."
</P>
<P>
	   The government made no suggestions on script changes when it reviewed shows
to see if they would get financial credit, said Alan Levitt, director of the
national youth media campaign at the drug office.
</P>
<P>
	   "All we said was, if you believe that a certain program that you intend to
broadcast delivers our message -- essentially that drugs can kill you -- submit
it to us for an evaluation and we may decide that we can credit you for a pro
bono match," Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox earned monetary credit for episodes of "Beverly Hills 90210" and
"America's Most Wanted." The WB network received credit for an episode of "7th
Heaven," a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The WB said that in an episode of the "Smart Guy" series, two
substance-abusing teen-agers were originally depicted as being popular, but the
script was changed after government review to show them as "losers" hidden away
in a utility room taking drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Brad Turell said it is common for the network to ask for changes
to a script before a show is aired. Just because the government gave advice in
this instance doesn't mean the network gave up creative control, he said.

	   Producers and writers of "ER" have been in frequent contact with the feds.
One recent storyline about a youth coming into the emergency room after having
abused alcohol was likely included after the office told producers that alcohol
is the most frequently abused drug among young people, said Donald Vereen,
deputy director of the White House drug policy office.

	   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the network submitted scripts to the drug
office, but received no financial credit because it had already used enough free
commercials. ABC does not plan to seek credit in the future, Hoover said.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher this morning after a
government report confirmed that inflation remains under control despite the
robust U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 137.44 to 11,719.87, as the blue chip index moved into record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index also moved into record territory, rising 106.25
to 4,063.86. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 21.20 to 1,470.88.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said today consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in December,
slightly below forecasts. Excluding energy prices, the gain was just 0.1
percent. The report was the latest signal the inflation fears remain unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, a speech from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Thursday
night contained no great surprises, and Wall Street is now feeling more
comfortable that a hike of no more than a quarter-percentage point on Feb. 2 is
a likely outcome of the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1161.6 million shares.

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - For many years, mobs dragged people from jails or off
the streets and hanged them from a tree - and in some particularly gruesome
cases, burned them alive. Then, often as not, the perpetrators and witnesses
lined up to be photographed with the deceased.
<P>
	   This sobering underside of America's past is depicted in an exhibit, titled
"Witness," that opens Friday in Manhattan. "It's clear to me that this is a
piece of history that demands an audience," said Andrew Roth, co-owner of the
Roth Horowitz Gallery.
</P>
<P>
	   The material was gathered over the past decade by James Allen, a
Georgia-based dealer in antiques and memorabilia, and is now part of the
Allen-Littlefield Collection at Emory University in Atlanta. The New York
showing is timed with the release of a book, "Without Sanctuary: Lynching
Photography in America."
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors may browse photos of corpses of young black men hanging from
branches, telephone poles and, in one case, a bridge. There is a shot of a man
being incinerated, and another of "the half-burned head of James" on a pole. But
not all are black - there also are white bank robbers and other criminals, done
in by frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People reported
3,436 people lynched between 1889 and 1922, and one photo in the collection is
dated 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   During the peak years, most victims were black men accused of offenses
ranging from murder and rape to not stepping off the sidewalk to let a white
person pass. It was a nationwide practice, and whether in Gadsden, Alabama,
Duluth, Minn., or the "Hanging Tree" in Helena, Mont., someone with a camera
always seemed to be present.
</P>
<P>
	   Picture after picture shows local citizens gathered around the dangling
bodies - some undoubtedly perpetrators of the crime, others simply bystanders
agape with curiosity.
</P>
<P>
	   The amateurish snapshots reveal a sameness about the southern racist mobs
and western posses carrying out vigilante justice - rawboned, angular-faced men
wearing hats. In some, small children watch the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the photos were turned into souvenir postcards, some colorized and
inscribed with such notations as "Down in Old Kentucky," or "Negro who shot J.H.
Rogers at Ten Mile, Miss., 5-21-19."
</P>
<P>
	   At least one series of photos, from a double lynching in Okemah, Okla., in
1911, was copyrighted by the photographer. Another picture, taken after dark in
1900, is stamped, "Flash light by Dabbs."
</P>
<P>
	   The postcards with one-cent stamps could be sent legally through the mail
until about 1908, when they were banned. "I bought this in Hopkinsville for 15
cents. It's not on sale openly (the law forbids it)," an anonymous correspondent
wrote on the back of one postcard.
</P>
<P>
	   Roth said the postcards are not only curious but "insightful into the nature
of the medium and how it was disseminated in the public domain."
</P>
<P>
	   Pictures aside, perhaps the exhibit's most chilling entry is a 1921 pamphlet
issued by the NAACP. It reproduced the Jan. 26 and 27 front pages of the Memphis
(Tenn.) Press that provided an account of a white mob seizing a black youth from
a jail in Georgia and transporting him to Arkansas, where he was burned at the
stake.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper duly reported how the kidnappers stopped off in Memphis and were
seen "laughing and talking" in the lobby of the Hotel Peabody, and how police
formed up to guard the roads, but did nothing to interfere - more than a decade
before the FBI won the power to take charge of interstate crime.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nursing Home Probes  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To strengthen oversight of nursing homes, President
Clinton will ask Congress for an additional $15.9 million for training
inspectors, conducting surprise inspections and cracking down on the 100 worst
facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   With nearly a fourth of the nation's nursing homes deficient in meeting
national quality standards, according to government auditors, the administration
has promised in the last year to do more monitoring and give inspectors more
training.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore was announcing the proposal today at one of his
presidential campaign stops -- a meeting with the National Council of Senior
Citizens in New Hampshire. The money, part of Clinton's 2001 budget plan, would
bring total funds for nursing care oversight to $70 million, an increase of
nearly 30 percent over last year. Most of the money goes to state agencies
responsible for inspecting some 16,700 nursing homes that provide care for about
1.6 million older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the funds would be earmarked for:
</P>
<P>
	   --Training inspectors to file computerized reports on nursing home
compliance that will make it easier to identify problem homes, track whether
they are making improvements and provide information for surveyors visiting the
facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports are integrated into a Web site for consumers seeking information
on specific nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
	   --Inspecting nursing homes during evenings and weekends to ensure that
facilities, which know that inspections usually take place during the day,
aren't hiding substandard practices.
</P>
<P>
	   --More inspections of at least 100 homes with the worst compliance records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that those entities are inspected more frequently,''
said Chris Jennings, Clinton's health policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month the government put in place tough new rules to crack down on
nursing homes that repeatedly violate standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Homes that are found to have caused harm, through abuse or neglect, to even
a single resident in two or more inspections can immediately be fined up to
$10,000 and have their Medicare or Medicaid payments suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously the penalties were mandatory only for nursing homes that showed a
pattern of harm to multiple residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings also said the administration would launch a $10 million campaign to
provide elderly Americans with information about what long-term care Medicare
covers, how to evaluate long-term care policies and how to get information on
community-based services.
</P>
<P>
	   The information would be distributed through handbooks, state organizations
and public service announcements on radio and television.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Dept. Redeeming 1975 Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury Department said today it is redeeming $4.2
billion of 30-year bonds issued in 1975 to help reduce the government's interest
payments on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Redeeming the bonds, which carry an interest rate of 8 1/4 percent, before
they reach maturity, will save the government around $800 million in interest
payments. The bonds' maturity date is May 15, 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time Treasury redeemed any bond was in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the latest effort by the government to take advantage of mounting
surpluses to better manage the $5.76 trillion national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Clinton administration, seeking to operate in the new world
of budget surpluses, adopted rules that will allow the government to buy back up
to $30 billion of the national debt this year, something that hasn't happened
for at least a century.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, which first proposed the idea of debt buybacks last
August, has sought to portray its proposal as the responsible way to utilize the
government's burgeoning surpluses, the product of the current economic boom, in
contrast to Republican calls for large tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   The debt buyback program will be launched in the coming weeks with several
operations conducted in the next 12 months, totaling up to $30 billion. The
exact timing of the program and the size of each buyback program hasn't been
determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The national debt now stands at $5.76 trillion, with the amount of that debt
held by the public totaling $3.6 trillion. The rest of the debt, some $2
trillion, is held by the government's large trust funds, primarily the Social
Security trust fund.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher in early trading today, boosted
by a strong earnings report from high-tech bellwether Intel and comments from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that indicate interest rates will be
rising only slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The most closely-watched market indicators were all in record high
territory. At midmorning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
130.62 to 11,713.05.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index rose 128.11 to 4,085.32, while the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 20.95 to 1,470.88.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, which announced better than expected earnings late Thursday on a
surge in PC sales, drove the Dow. Intel, the world's leading computer chip
maker, rose 10 to 100 1/8 on the Nasdaq. IBM, rose 4 to 122 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a speech by Greenspan Thursday night, Wall Street seems to be
feeling more confident that the Fed is likely to raise rates no more than a
quarter-percentage point at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on
Feb. 1-2. Although rate increases are usually troublesome, market watchers said
they were impressed that Greenspan indicated he won't let inflation get in the
way of a surging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has demonstrated that he understands the world has changed and
that he doesn't intend to do anything scary to the market," said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities."We are comfortable
with Greenspan's comments because it shows he is not behind the curve, and won't
let inflation raise its mighty head."

<HEADLINE> Feds Urging Pilots To Report Errors  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Airline pilots and mechanics would get protection against
punishment for reporting operational and procedural errors to the Federal
Aviation Administration under an agreement worked out by the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, which could be announced at the White House as early as today,
comes after more than a year of talks between the airlines, the pilots and the
administration.
</P>
<P>
	   It aims to improve understanding of the errors that cause accidents --
errors that might go unreported by pilots or crew members who fear reprisals or
punishment for violating FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a reporting system that allows pilots to report safety discrepancies
and have them addressed by the FAA, the union and the airline in a non-punitive
environment,'' said one person familiar with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people familiar with the deal said they expected the announcement to
come today at the White House. All spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots at American Airlines and ground crew members of the Transport Workers
Union already are experimenting with safety committees that share information
among workers, airline officials and government regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the expanded deal, unionized pilots from American Airlines,
Continental Airlines and members of the Air Line Pilots Association, which
represents 50,000 pilots at 51 airlines, and others would participate in the
``Aviation Safety Advancement Partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots, mechanics and other airline personnel could go to committees
established by the program with problems they observe or even errors they
themselves commit. The aim is to increase the pool of safety information to try
to stop accidents from happening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you self-disclose, you can track trend information,'' said another
person familiar with the details of the program, who likened it to whistleblower
protection for airline pilots and other personnel. ``The thought is, let's talk
about it.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Execs May Seeks Medicare Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drug industry leaders have told the Clinton
administration they want to put aside their dispute over drug prices to try to
work out a compromise on a Medicare prescription benefit for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said today that President Clinton would
"welcome that support but encourage the companies to become engaged in this
effort and back up their words with actions and deeds."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no indication that the companies were going to change their
fundamental position, which has been to support improved drug coverage for the
elderly through the private sector, not directly from the government. The
industry has been worried that a government-run program could lead to price
controls.
</P>
<P>
	   However, at a White House meeting Wednesday afternoon, drug industry leaders
told administration officials for the first time that they would be willing to
support drug-coverage legislation separate from a comprehensive Medicare
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, they had said they could support the addition of drug coverage
to Medicare only as part of a wholesale redesign of the program in which more
senior citizens would get all of their health care through private health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that broad legislation were not able to be achieved this year, we would
support federal legislation that would provide expanded drug coverage for
seniors as a step toward the overall comprehensive modernization of the Medicare
program," said Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, who participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has proposed having the government run a Medicare drug benefit by
contracting with the same drug-purchasing management firms used by many private
health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to have very serious concerns ... about the president's plan,"
said Holmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry leaders have pledged, however, to tone down negative rhetoric
against the administration proposal -- including now-famous commercials
featuring an elderly woman named Flo, who insists on keeping the government "out
of my medicine cabinet."
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of our advocacy, including any advertising we might be involved
in, we intend to be very positive and constructive in our support of bipartisan
solutions," said Holmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Also attending the White House meeting, first reported by The New York
Times, was Gordon M. Binder, chairman of both the drug-maker Amgen and the
industry association; Clinton's top economic adviser, Gene Sperling; and White
House health policy adviser Chris Jennings.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to cover drug costs for patients who are not in hospitals is
considered a serious gap in Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   There is growing concern that senior citizens are being left behind as more
new drugs to treat diseases of aging are introduced, but prescription costs are
rising by more than 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates, including Vice President
Al Gore, are pushing to make prescription drugs a top issue in the 2000
elections and Clinton is expected to feature the issue in his State of the Union
Address, scheduled Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic polling has shown that Americans of all ages are concerned about
rising drug prices, and Clinton has expressed anger at the hard line drug
companies were taking against his proposal and the negative tone of their
advertising. He has promised a government study of drug pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders have said they support helping the elderly pay for drugs
but don't want to displace the private coverage some now have through retirement
benefits or HMOs. They have promised hearings in Congress this year.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns About Imbalances  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing new
worries that the soaring stock market could lead to an overheated U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Private economists said Greenspan's new concerns make them more convinced
that the central bank will boost interest rates for a fourth time since June
when they meet Feb. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the stock market continued to soar today after the government
issued a Consumer Price Index report indicating inflation is under control. In
late morning trading, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 120 points and was
in record territory and the Nasdaq composite index was up 112. Bond prices
initially rose this morning on the inflation report, but gave back gains and
were lower at late morning, with yields on the 30-year Treasury bond rising to
6.67 percent from Thursday's 6.65 percent level.
</P>
<P>
	   In remarks to the Economic Club of New York Thursday night, Greenspan linked
his worries about the high-flying stock market to the surge in consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan noted that many economists estimate that fully one-fourth of
annual economic growth since 1996 -- about 1 percentage point of the 4 percent
growth rate -- has come from the "wealth effect" of consumers spending more
because of their rising investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan said that this added consumer demand is taxing the economy's
resources and if not moderated could lead to rising inflation because of tight
labor markets and stretched production capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is this imbalance between growth of supply and growth of demand that
contains the potential seeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that
could undermine the current expansion," Greenspan told his audience of top
economists and Wall Street professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, Greenspan moderated his inflation worries by noting
that at present the economy has been able to grow at a strong rate without
pushing prices higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not only is the expansion reaching record length, but it is doing so with
far stronger-than-expected economic growth," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, private economists said Greenspan's worries about inflation problems
down the road left little doubt in their minds that the central bank will raise
rates again in February.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan continues to be worried that consumer spending and demand are
greater than potential supply," said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston
&AMP; Co., who was in the audience for Greenspan's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones said he expected the Fed will follow up its February rate increase
with at least one more quarter-point boost in the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge on overnight loans, probably at the March meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jones said Wall Street investors who came to the speech fearing that
Greenspan would sound an even more hawkish note on inflation were likely to be
relieved that he balanced his inflation worries with extensive praise for how
well the economy is doing at present.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said while economists 10 years from now undoubtedly will have a
clearer picture of the new forces at work in the economy, such as rising
productivity, the Fed can't wait that long to make its decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regrettably, we at the Federal Reserve do not have the luxury of awaiting a
better set of insights," Greenspan said. "Indeed, our goal, in responding to the
complexity of current economic forces, is to extend the expansion by containing
its imbalances and avoiding the very recession that would complete a business
cycle."
</P>
<P>
	   During a question-and-answer session following his speech, Greenspan said
the central bank would release before its February meeting a set of guidelines
intended to help financial markets better interpret the Fed's new policy of
revealing changes in its so-called directive. The directive is intended to
signal the future course of interest rates but so far has left markets confused.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that when economists look back from the year 2010 on the
current period, they may well conclude "at the turn of the millennium, the
American economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation
which propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits and stock prices
at a pace not seen in generations, if ever."
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan, who has worried at various times about over-exuberance on
Wall Street, suggested that the 2010 review might conclude alternatively that "a
good deal of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many

<HEADLINE> Justice Ginsburg Gets Chemotherapy  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said today she
has been undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment as a ``precautionary''
followup to her colon cancer surgery last September.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The treatments, which commenced in October and will be completed in June,
have not affected my schedule at the court,'' Ginsburg said in a statement
released by the court's public information office after news media inquiries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Following the treatments, it is anticipated that I will require only
routine examinations to assure my continuing good health,'' said Ginsburg, who
is 66.
</P>
<P>
	   The justice said she was undergoing ``a precautionary, post-surgery course
of chemotherapy and radiation'' at Washington Hospital Center, in consultation
with a doctor at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Ginsburg, the second woman to serve on the nation's highest court, had part
of her colon removed Sept. 17. Afterward, doctors reported the cancer had not
spread to any lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   She had fallen ill over the previous summer and initially was treated for a
gastric disorder. That led doctors to discover the cancerous tumor.
</P>
<P>
	   Seventeen days after her surgery, Ginsburg took the bench with her
colleagues for the opening of the current court term. Later in October, she told
an international women's group she felt ``a little wobbly'' but was progressing
steadily.
</P>
<P>
	   Ginsburg has missed no argument sessions, and while on the bench has shown
no signs of illness.

<HEADLINE> Economists Expecting Fed Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
    By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is expressing new
worries that the soaring stock market could lead to an overheated U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Private economists viewed Greenspan's comments as a further indication that
the Fed will boost interest rates at its next meeting on Feb. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wall Street investors pushed stock prices higher today, with the most
closely watched indexes all in record territory. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 131 points at 11,713 with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index and the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also showing big gains.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration's chief economic spokesman, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers, refused to comment directly today on Greenspan's worries that
the high-flying stock market, by boosting consumer spending, could threaten
inflation pressures down the road.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling Greenspan's comments a "thoughtful speech," Summers said the
administration continues to believe the best approach to managing the economy is
ensuring that the government's policies support good economic fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers, who will be in Tokyo on Jan. 21 with Greenspan for a meeting of
finance officials from the world's seven largest economies, said it is important
for America's allies to push forward with efforts to strengthen global growth
and help alleviate America's soaring trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   In Greenspan's remarks to the Economic Club of New York Thursday night, he
noted that many economists estimate that fully one-fourth of annual economic
growth since 1996 -- about 1 percentage point of the 4 percent growth rate --
has come from the "wealth effect" of consumers spending more because of their
rising investment portfolios.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said this added consumer demand is taxing the economy's resources
and if not moderated could lead to rising inflation because of tight labor
markets and stretched production capacity.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is this imbalance between growth of supply and growth of demand that
contains the potential seeds of rising inflationary and financial pressures that
could undermine the current expansion," Greenspan told his audience of top
economists and Wall Street professionals.
</P>
<P>
	   But at the same time, Greenspan moderated his inflation worries by noting
that at present the economy has been able to grow at a strong rate without
pushing prices higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not only is the expansion reaching record length, but it is doing so with
far stronger-than-expected economic growth," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, private economists said Greenspan's worries about inflation problems
down the road left little doubt in their minds that the central bank will raise
rates again in February.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan continues to be worried that consumer spending and demand are
greater than potential supply," said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston
&AMP; Co., who was in the audience for Greenspan's speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones said he expected the Fed will follow up its February rate increase
with at least one more quarter-point boost in the federal funds rate, the
interest that banks charge on overnight loans, probably at the March meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jones said Wall Street investors who came to the speech fearing that
Greenspan would sound an even more hawkish note on inflation were likely to be
relieved that he balanced his inflation worries with extensive praise for how
well the economy is doing at present.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said while economists 10 years from now undoubtedly will have a
clearer picture of the new forces at work in the economy, such as rising
productivity, the Fed can't wait that long to make its decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regrettably, we at the Federal Reserve do not have the luxury of awaiting a
better set of insights," Greenspan said. "Indeed, our goal, in responding to the
complexity of current economic forces, is to extend the expansion by containing
its imbalances and avoiding the very recession that would complete a business
cycle."
</P>
<P>
	   During a question-and-answer session following his speech, Greenspan said
the central bank would release before its February meeting a set of guidelines
intended to help financial markets better interpret the Fed's new policy of
revealing changes in its so-called directive. The directive is intended to
signal the future course of interest rates but so far has left markets confused.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenspan said that when economists look back from the year 2010 on the
current period, they may well conclude "at the turn of the millennium, the
American economy was experiencing a once-in-a-century acceleration of innovation
which propelled forward productivity, output, corporate profits and stock prices
at a pace not seen in generations, if ever."
</P>
<P>
	   But Greenspan, who has worried at various times about over-exuberance on
Wall Street, suggested that the 2010 review might conclude alternatively that "a
good deal of what we are currently experiencing was just one of the many
euphoric speculative bubbles that have dotted human history."

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 149.23; Nasdaq Up Up 119.21  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, boosted by a strong
earnings report from high-tech bellwether Intel and comments from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that indicate interest rates will be rising only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the most closely-watched market indicators were in record high
territory. At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
149.23 to 11,731.66. The Nasdaq composite index rose 119.21 to 4,076.97.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.30 to 1,467.98, just shy of record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, which announced better than expected earnings late Thursday on a
surge in PC sales, drove the Dow higher. Intel, the world's leading computer
chip maker, rose 11 3/8 to 101 1/4 on the Nasdaq. IBM, rose 3 3/16 to 121 5/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a speech by Greenspan Thursday night, Wall Street seems to be
feeling more confident that the Fed is likely to raise rates no more than a
quarter-percentage point at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on
Feb. 1-2. Although rate increases are usually troublesome, market watchers said
they were impressed that Greenspan indicated he won't let inflation get in the
way of a surging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has demonstrated that he understands the world has changed and
that he doesn't intend to do anything scary to the market," said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities."We are comfortable
with Greenspan's comments because it shows he is not behind the curve, and won't
let inflation raise its mighty head."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest economic data released today once again showed inflation remains
under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in December,
slightly below forecasts. Excluding energy prices, the gain was just 0.1
percent. The report was the latest confirmation that fears about accelerating
inflation remain unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 507.4 million shares.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index rose 5.45 to 506.64.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Offers Vodafone Defense  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German telecommunications company Mannesmann AG
urged its stockholders today not to sell their shares to British suitor Vodafone
AirTouch PLC, arguing it is worth much more than is being offered.
</P>
<P>
	   Today was the deadline for Mannesmann to offer its official defense against
Vodafone's stock offer which at about $137.6 billion is the largest hostile
takeover attempt to date.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann shareholders have until Feb. 7 to accept the bid from Vodafone,
the world's No. 1 mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   In a 10-page newspaper insert in Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung,
Mannesmann argued that within a year, its shares will be worth $360 each
compared with Vodafone's offer of $265 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   "Shareholders who accept Vodafone's offer have to weigh two concerns,"
Mannesmann chief executive Klaus Esser told a news conference. "One is that they
will end up with something worth much less. And the second is that there will be
considerable risks."
</P>
<P>
	   But Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent called Mannesmann's defense
"desperate."
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone reiterated its argument that Mannesmann would have a hard time
establishing itself as a leading technology business without a U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
	   By midday, Mannesmann shares hit a record $257 a share, resuming an upward
course as German investors saw the chances of Vodafone failing in hostile bid.
Herman Reith, an analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt, said shareholders should be
encouraged by the Mannesmann's arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the added value estimate Mannesmann made was "very plausible,
because we're expecting big growth in 2000 because of the acquisition of
Orange."
</P>
<P>
	   "Mannesmann is a smaller company, but its speed of business is faster than
Vodafone, which has no Internet or e-commerce synergies," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann's defense document -- filled with charts and graphs outlining
reasons why Mannesmann thinks its diversified strategy of mobile and fixed line
services is the right course -- also focused on possible risks of separating
Orange from Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Vodafone buyout of Mannesmann takes place, Vodafone is expected to
sell Mannesmann's stake in Orange because British law prevents Vodafone from
owning a major competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Esser also warned shareholders -- especially those in Germany and the United
States -- that they could see some heavy tax bills if the merger with Vodafone
and divestiture from Orange goes through.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone also has argued that Mannesmann shareholders would be better off
owning 47.2 percent of the enlarged group than all of Mannesmann alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "The argument of Vodafone is that both companies would be the industry's
biggest player in the world. Mannesmann's is that it has the potential for
faster growth," Reith said. "And from the investor's point of view it is always
share growth potential that outweighs sheer volume."
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies have been locked in an expensive campaign to woo
investors. Mannesmann said last week it expects to spend up to about $200
million defending itself against Vodafone, pouring that money into ads in major
financial dailies and a series of international roadshows to meet the investors
who will decide the company's fate.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Test Had Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon acknowledged today that a test last October
of an anti-missile missile -- eventually to be part of a national missile
defense -- encountered more technical problems than officials initially
revealed.
</P>
<P>
	   The 55-inch-long anti-missile missile, known as a ``kill vehicle,''
successfully destroyed its target in space. But that was only after it put its
crosshairs on a large decoy balloon meant to simulate the kind of simple
measures a hostile nation might take to confuse an American anti-missile system,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The balloon was deployed, along with a mock warhead, from a re-entry vehicle
sent aloft aboard a converted Minuteman missile. One objective of the flight
test was to see if the intercepting missile launched from an island in the
central Pacific Ocean could distinguish between the balloon and the target
warhead.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially the intercepting ``kill vehicle'' spotted the balloon and
recognized that it was not the correct target. But after it then searched with
its infrared sensor for the mock warhead and could not find it, it refocused on
the balloon, put its crosshairs on it and was about to destroy it, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   For reasons that are not yet clear, the intercepting missile at the last
second spotted the correct target and rammed it instead of the balloon, a senior
military official involved in the missile defense program told reporters. The
official discussed details of the Oct. 2 test on condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus the objective of hitting the warhead was met, even though officials are
not sure why the interceptor made the last-second correction.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem was first reported in today's editions of The New York Times.
Asked why the Pentagon had not mentioned the problem when it described the test
results for reporters last fall, the Pentagon official replied that he, ``didn't
think it was that big of a deal, to be honest.''
</P>
<P>
	   In a second test of the anti-missile system, scheduled for Tuesday, the
``kill vehicle'' will be programmed to search a wider area in space to find the
target, in hopes that the same problem is not repeated, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times also reported, and the Pentagon today confirmed, that the ``kill
vehicle'' also had a navigation problem in the October test. Because an
incorrect star map was loaded into the interceptor's computer, it could not
navigate using the stars once it had separated from the booster rocket that sent
it into space. An on-board guidance system worked, however, so the navigation
problem was of no consequence, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart CEO David Glass Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. president and chief executive David
Glass, who is credited with building the company into the world's biggest
retailer, stepped down today in a move that was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass, 64, succeeded Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton as CEO 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee Scott, who is chief operating officer and vice chairman of Wal-Mart for
the past year, will succeed Glass as CEO and president.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said that Scott was tapped about a year ago as next in line to take
over for Glass, who will remain with Wal-Mart for at least the next year as
chairman of the executive committee of the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
	   "Lee Scott, just like David Glass, really understands this company, and
Wal-Mart won't miss a beat as it moves forward," said Walter Loeb, who runs the
retail consulting firm Loeb Associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors took today's announcement in stride, sending Wal-Mart shares up 25
cents to $65.37 1/2 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart has expanded significantly under the Glass' watch, becoming one of
the biggest corporations in the world, rivaling giants such as General Motors
and Ford.
</P>
<P>
	   When Glass took over more than a decade ago, the company had 1,200 stores
and was the nation's third-largest retailer. Now, Wal-Mart now operates more
than 2,485 Wal-Mart discount stores and 456 Sam's Clubs warehouse stores in the
United States, plus about 600 stores around the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart increased its annual revenues from $16 billion in 1988 to an
estimated $165 billion in the fiscal year that will end on Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Glass, the company began its successful Supercenter concept, which
combines discount stores with grocery operations. More than 700 of its stores
are now Supercenters, and about 160 more will be added this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass also led the development of its Neighborhood Markets, a new
stand-alone supermarket that the company began testing in 1998. In addition, he
oversaw Wal-Mart's international expansion, which now brings in an estimated $22
billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
	   Most importantly, Glass is credited for helping build Wal-Mart's advanced
technology system, which let vendors exchange invoices, purchase orders and
other documents with Wal-Mart by electronic data interchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Stores are linked to the company's headquarters via satellite, which helps
them quickly replenish and reorder inventory.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, too, has been instrumental in building the less-glamorous
behind-the-scenes systems of Wal-Mart. He began his career with the company in
1979 in the logistics department, and eventually helped build the company's
distribution centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott moved into the merchandising side of the business in 1995, when he
became executive vice president of the Wal-Mart stores division. Three years
later, he was named president and CEO of that unit.
</P>
<P>
	   A year ago, Scott was promoted to chief operating officer and vice chairman,
positioning him as the frontrunner to succeed Glass.

They are probably tired of the hoopla and critical acclaim surrounding this
drama. (You are hereby excused from this column, with our thanks.)
</P>
<P>
	   -- Committed Sopraniacs who savored all 13 episodes last year and haven't
stopped raving about it are counting the minutes until 9 p.m. EST Sunday. But
these devotees also worry how the series' creator, David Chase, will manage to
make lightning strike again. (You may relax. Based on the first three hours, the
new season is electrifying.)
</P>
<P>
	   -- Newcomers could be cowed by the challenge of plunging into this complex,
highly populated drama in medias res.
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, Tony (masterfully portrayed by James Gandolfini) is easy to target.
But who knows Silvio from Paulie Walnuts? In the absence of a copy of "'The
Sopranos' for Dummies," how's a newbie supposed to keep up? (Your concern is
understandable, but consider this: To enjoy a feast, you don't need to be versed
in the ingredients.)
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, Sunday's episode begins with a catch-up montage, tunefully
accompanied by Jersey favorite son Frank Sinatra crooning "It Was a Very Good
Year."
</P>
<P>
	   Was it?
</P>
<P>
	   Here's Tony's mommy dearest, Livia (the incomparable Nancy Marchand), lying
in her hospital bed still recovering from her alleged stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's Tony -- suburban husband, father, Mafia boss -- still on the job at
the Bada Bing! strip club, receiving a Bloomingdale's shopping bag full of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's a glimpse of a bulletin board: the Feds' schematic of the crime
family that Tony runs. Seems the Feds are still after Tony.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's Tony's resolute wife Carmela (Emmy winner Edie Falco), still at home;
Tony's Uncle Junior (Dominic Chianese), who wants his nephew dead, still in
jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), who was Tony's psychiatrist until his
enemies got wind he was spilling his guts to a shrink, continuing her practice
in a motel room where she's hiding out.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's Tony's screw-up nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli), watching
movie mobster Edward G. Robinson on TV while snorting cocaine off his coffee
table.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's Tony teaching daughter Meadow (Jamie Lynn-Sigler) to drive. Parking
in the sack with one of his Bada Bing! girls. Returning home in the middle of
the night to a penetrating look from Carmela as he slips into bed.
</P>
<P>
	   It's an enchanting, chilling and bitterly funny interlude, which pretty much
sums up the series' appeal. And it inventories the pressures and conflicts
besetting poor Tony, who, now deprived of Dr. Melfi's services, is once again
plagued by anxiety attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Even raising two teens ties Tony in knots, as when, in a future episode,
Meadow throws a wild party at her grandmother's empty house.
</P>
<P>
	   "There has to be consequences," Carmela tells Tony.
</P>
<P>
	   "And there will be," he replies. "Let's just not overplay our hand, 'cause
if she finds out we're powerless, we're (cooked)."
</P>
<P>
	   The acting is still superb, the writing still crackles. And, as before, the
language is blue and the blood flows red.
</P>
<P>
	   Business as usual for "The Sopranos"? Never fear, no one is standing pat in
Season Two. You wouldn't get gripping drama that way and, in Tony's world, you
might not even get to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
	   These days, Christopher is managing a mob-controlled brokerage. Big Pussy
(Vincent Pastore), who vanished last season after maybe ratting Tony out, is
back, and all is forgiven -- or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
	   And sure to give the pot a good stirring: the sudden appearance of Tony's
sister, Janice, a scheming overage hippie he hasn't seen in years.
</P>
<P>
	   Most recently, she was living in Seattle on bogus disability. But now she's
come home, professing born-again concern for her ailing mom -- which puts her at
loggerheads with Tony, who thinks Livia tried to have him whacked.
</P>
<P>
	   Played richly by Aida Turturro, Janice may just want to do the right thing.
Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wonder what the scam is this time," Tony grumps to his wife. "Whatever it
is, I'm gonna be five grand lighter before she rain-dances back to the commune."
</P>
<P>
	   By episode three, Livia is panicked that her caretaker daughter means to
kill her for her savings. Meanwhile, Janice seems to be rekindling a long-ago
romance with a thug who has thoughts of offing Tony.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, "The Sopranos" is devilishly complex. But the message is gloriously
simple: "The only way to run a family these days is bunker-style," Tony beefs.
"You peer out through the slit."
</P>
<P>
	   No wonder viewers will still love peering in.

<HEADLINE> Essex man sues father in mother's death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ESSEX, Conn. (AP) - A 29-year-old man is suing his father, who is in
jail awaiting trial on criminal charges in the fatal shooting of his wife during
a dispute at the family's home.
<P>
	   Richard A. Walden has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against his father,
Harold Walden. The elder Walden is accused of killing his wife, Sandra Walden
last October.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit, prepared by Richard Walden's attorney, John J. Carta Jr. of
Essex, accuses Harold Walden of negligence and engaging in willful, wanton and
malicious conduct in taking Sandra Walden's life. The attorney said the elder
Walden will be served in jail.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Walden, 29, is the administrator of his mother's estate. He decided
to file the lawsuit as a way of honoring his mother and showing his love for her
after her death, Carta said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The kids were really close to their mother," the attorney said. "I think a
lot of what's going on here is to honor their mother's memory. It's the right
thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Police say Harold Walden shot his 50-year-old wife several times with a
shotgun before turning the gun on himself in an apparent suicide attempt early
on the morning of Oct. 4. Several shots were fired inside the house before the
violence spilled outside, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandra Walden's body was found on the front lawn. Harold Walden was found
nearby, suffering from a severe gunshot wound to the face. Three of the couple's
children, including an 8-year-old, were inside the house at the time of the
attack. One of them, 21-year-old Nicholas, suffered a minor stab wound in an
arm, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicholas and his older brother, Harold Walden Jr., 28, managed to flee to a
neighbor's house to call police.
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Walden, a 48-year-old state transportation worker, has been
undergoing a series of reconstructive surgeries for his wounds. He has been
released from the hospital and is being held at the Hartford Correctional Center
in lieu of $1 million bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Walden faces charges of murder, second-degree assault, reckless
endangerment, threatening and risk of injury to a minor. He is due to appear
Feb. 15 in Middletown Superior Court, where a hearing will be scheduled to
determine if the state has sufficient evidence to try him on the murder charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Walden's lawsuit does not specify a dollar amount in damages. The
lawsuit only says that Walden is seeking monetary and punitive damages and any
other relief deemed appropriate by the court.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Protect Consumer Privacy  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coming soon to your local travel agency, mortgage
company, tax preparation service and storefront check-cashing outlet: federal
rules to protect consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators are drafting the rules to spell out how consumers'
personal information will be protected as barriers between financial businesses
come down, because of landmark legislation enacted in November. The law allows
banks, investment firms and insurance companies to get involved in each other's
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's less widely known that the law's privacy provisions reach beyond
banks, Wall Street and insurance to a diverse panoply of "money" businesses.
They include consumer finance companies, department stores that issue credit
cards, money transmitters and money-order businesses, debt collection agencies,
credit bureaus and telemarketing firms that sell financial products.
</P>
<P>
	   The definition of "financial activities" is being broadened as traditional
distinctions blur in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   Importantly, consumers are getting a new right to stop the financial
businesses from sharing their personal data with a third party, such as a
telemarketer, with some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   That right, however, doesn't go as far as consumer groups and privacy
advocates had wanted. Financial companies with whom you do business will be able
to share or sell your data unless you expressly ask them, in writing, not to do
so. The onus is on consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial and money businesses of all shapes and sizes will have to disclose
their privacy policies to customers at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because the privacy provisions apply to a company doing a financial
business, regardless of whether the company is affiliated with a bank, they will
apply to a very broad group of companies and industries," said Scott Alvarez,
associate general counsel of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because financial holding companies are allowed to engage in a wide
range of activities, with the new requirement that they abide by the privacy
rules. Consumers should get the same protection whether a business is part of a
holding company group or stands alone, the government's reasoning goes, so all
"money" businesses should be subject to the privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is, for example, that if you do business with a mom and pop travel
agency, your personal data should be as well protected as that of customers of
American Express Co., which has a travel business, banking operations and other
financial divisions under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve is among a passel of agencies drafting privacy rules for
the industries and sectors they regulate, along with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift
Supervision and others. The Federal Trade Commission is writing the rules for
insurance companies and agents and all other affected businesses outside of
banks and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
	   They're working under a tight deadline, aiming to put out proposed rules for
30 days of public comment in early to mid-February. Under the new law, final
regulations must be in place by May.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of several "money" business groups affected by the new privacy
rules, contacted by The Associated Press, declined to comment on them because
they haven't yet been proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   They included the American Society of Travel Agents; the American Financial
Services Association, whose members include consumer finance companies,
automobile financing divisions and retail chains; and the Community Financial
Services Association of America, which represents check-cashing and short-term
cash loan businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Some officials of groups representing the banking, securities and insurance
industries, which closely followed Congress' lengthy deliberations on the
financial overhaul legislation, already have discussed the new privacy rules
with regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the overhaul law, banks, brokerages and insurers that affiliate are
entitled to share customers' personal data with each other -- a provision that
raised a storm of protest by consumer groups and privacy advocates. It's a key
reason the financial companies wanted to be able to merge -- to help them find
potential customers for new products.

<HEADLINE> Streisand Wants Name Off Marquee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Barbra Streisand wants her name off the marquee of a
$15 million estate she donated to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy because
the group wants to let tourists in.
</P>
<P>
	   When she donated The Streisand Center for Conservancy Studies in 1993, the
star intended it as "a small conference center for scientists, academics and
environmentalists," she said in a letter Thursday to the California Coastal
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not in agreement with the proposed use of the land, my name will no
longer be affiliated with the property."
</P>
<P>
	   The commission delayed until April a decision on whether to grant the
conservancy a permit to open its 22 acres to visitors. It has already been
renting the grounds for weddings, bar mitzvahs, conferences and tours.
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director, said now is "a good
place to part the way" with Miss Streisand. Using the property more as a park
than an academic center "fits more of our profile," he said.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Disputes EEOC Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MARIETTA, Ga. (AP) -- An investigation by the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission has reportedly found that some white managers at Lockheed
Martin Aeronautical Systems discriminated against black employes.
</P>
<P>
	   The company disputed the findings which are one step in a long process of
bringing discrimination claims under federal civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Friday that the EEOC outlined its
allegations in "letters of determination," dated Sept. 30. The letters do not
carry a legal penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   According to documents obtained by the newspaper, black employees often had
more seniority and experience than white employees who won promotions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernice Williams-Kimbrough, director of the Atlanta District of the EEOC,
issued nine findings of racial discrimination and one case of discrimination
against the disabled. The EEOC also alleged that Lockheed managers retaliated
against one employee for filing an EEOC complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an extremely serious situation with far-reaching consequences for
employees at both Lockheed's Marietta plant and other Lockheed plants," said
Josie A. Alexander, one of the lawyers representing more than 20 current and
former Lockheed employees. "My clients believe there is an atmosphere of racism
that permeates the plant."
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed President Tom Burbage said the defense contractor has long-standing
policies forbidding discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the issues that were raised are widespread," Burbage said. "I
think it all relates to the past. I can do nothing about the past but apologize
for it. What I can deal with is the future."
</P>
<P>
	   The company is contesting the EEOC allegations, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed and the plaintiffs are tentatively scheduled to engage in what
amounts to settlement talks in February, Alexander said. If no agreement is
reached, the EEOC could issue a "right-to-sue" letter to the plaintiffs, or
elect to sue the company itself.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Programmer Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A Chinese programmer convicted of gaining unauthorized
access to an Air Force computer was sentenced Friday to four months in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Magistrate Michael Merz also fined Steven Liu $4,000 and imposed one
year of supervised release. For four months of that time, he will be confined to
his home and will have to wear an electronic monitoring device.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu, a 27-year-old Chinese citizen who worked for a U.S. military
contractor, was convicted in July on two misdemeanor counts of downloading
passwords in 1996 from the $148 million computer at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
	   The computer tracks the combat readiness of aircraft and weapons, including
maintenance and failure-rate information, and is used to determine which
aircraft and weapons are available for missions and when parts need to be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   The information is not classified, but Air Force officials said it could be
of value to adversaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu told investigators he accidentally discovered the password file and used
it to try to find his job evaluation.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators said they could not be sure he did not give away information
that was in the computer or that others did not access the system before the
passwords were changed and security upgraded.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Corning Oppose Implant Opinion  </HEADLINE>
    By RANDI GOLDBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc. are asking a federal judge
to vacate an opinion by bankruptcy Judge Arthur Spector, arguing the opinion
modifies the $3.2 billion settlement over silicone breast implants that he
approved.
</P>
<P>
	   Dow Chemical and Corning on Friday filed notice with U.S. District Judge
Denise Page Hood in Detroit that they are joining a motion filed earlier by
Midland-based Dow Corning Corp. and the lawyers for thousands of women who voted
in favor of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   They are asking Ms. Hood to overturn the portion of Spector's Dec. 21
opinion that says women who voted against the settlement could still sue Dow
Chemical and Corning if they choose. Spector said he lacked the power to release
those companies from future liability, and the settlement wasn't designed to
grant such a release anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies and lawyers argue Spector's opinion changed the terms of the
settlement he approved Nov. 30 and thus made the deal invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Dow Chemical and Corning filed a similar notice with Spector on
Dec. 29, arguing that his opinion violated the ban on future lawsuits against
those companies.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it (Spector's opinion) stands as the interpretation, we don't accept it.
Then the plan won't be confirmed," Dow Chemical spokesman John Musser said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the section releasing the parent companies from liability in future
lawsuits was thoroughly discussed during the 4 1/2 years of negotiations to get
the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   "In our view, there was never any ambiguity about whether or not the plan
provided for full protection and a full release regardless of whether claimants
voted to accept the plan or not," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement calls on Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow
Chemical and Corning, to pay $3.2 billion to settle claims by more than 170,000
women blaming Dow Corning implants for a wide range of health problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Spector said that the Nov. 30 approval stands -- but said
that he did not mean to imply in that ruling that Dow Chemical and Corning were
immune from future lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Spector said there was no reason to assume allowing claims from women who
voted against the settlement would create an undue burden on the companies.
About 94 percent of the 112,774 women who voted on the plan in 1999 approved it.
</P>
<P>
	   The no-lawsuit release in the settlement had been fought by lawyers for a
group of women in Nevada. That state's supreme court has upheld damages against
Dow Chemical over silicone implants, opening the door for similar lawsuits.

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Until last month, Chris Paciello confidently reigned
over a South Beach nightclub regime catering to the see-and-be-seen set.
<P>
	   Madonna, Donald Trump, Jennifer Lopez - all hung out at Paciello's clubs,
lounging in black leather booths, sipping Dom Perignon and schmoozing with the
beefy, dark-haired owner.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities claim a truer picture of Paciello emerged years earlier in a
more mundane setting: the middle-class home of Staten Island housewife Judith
Shemtov. It was there, they say, that Shemtov took a bullet in the head - part
of an evil past that has finally caught up to Paciello.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 1, the Brooklyn native surrendered in Miami on murder and robbery
charges after he was named in a New York indictment accusing him of being a
former member of the violent "Beach Avenue Crew."
</P>
<P>
	   The goon squad, authorities say, provided muscle and money for the Bonanno
organized crime family by going on a crime spree that left a half dozen bodies
in its wake. They claim Paciello, whose legal name is Christian Ludwigsen, was
known as "the Binger" because he liked to binge on crime.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal case could force Paciello, 28, to forfeit his multimillion
dollar enterprise and put him behind bars for life.
</P>
<P>
	   The mercurial rise and fall of the man a Miami alternative weekly, New
Times, calls "the dangerous darling of the SoBe nightlife set" has both
enthralled and stunned his supporters and associates.
</P>
<P>
	   Gerry Kelly, owner of the new nightclub Level, learned from authorities last
week that Paciello once discussed responding to the competition by having him
"whacked."
</P>
<P>
	   "This is definitely a 'Jekyll and Hyde' situation," said Kelly, Paciello's
onetime marketing director. He recalled Paciello as a kind boss who began each
day with a two-hour workout.
</P>
<P>
	   "I never, ever even heard him raise his voice," he said. "I thought he was
my friend. ... It's scary as hell."
</P>
<P>
	   Ingrid Casares - Paciello's partner in the trendy dance club Liquid and
close friend of Madonna - and other South Beach glitterati have rallied behind
Paciello. Insisting Paciello is a legitimate entrepreneur and community leader,
several wealthy backers have put up personal property to secure a $15 million
bail bond.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello's attorney, Roy Black, has sought to portray the graduate of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School in Bensonhurst as a "young man who's
turned his life around." He notes that Paciello - despite growing up with known
criminals and having several previous arrests - has never been convicted of a
felony.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, the way our society works is when someone becomes successful
or a high-profile person, they become a target," Black told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   South Florida friends say Paciello's success sprung from a shy charm and
knack for drawing black-clad beautiful people to his nightspots dotting South
Beach's Art Deco District.
</P>
<P>
	   Before his arrest, Paciello himself responded to mob rumors, saying, "It
doesn't make me a gangster because I hung out on the corner with people while I
was growing up." He has said he began using his mother's maiden name, Paciello,
because his parents broke up - not to escape his past.
</P>
<P>
	   But prosecutors call the portrait a sham. They say Paciello led a double
life after he went south, switching his allegiance to the Colombo crime family
and settling scores with assaults and death threats.
</P>
<P>
	   In one incident noted in gossip columns, Paciello allegedly decked a former
football player at a South Beach club in a fight over a super model. A lawsuit
by a former Mr. Universe accuses him of breaking the plaintiff's face with a
beer bottle.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a character trait of Mr. Ludwigsen to resort to violent activity,"
said Assistant U.S. Attorney James Walden.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities allege Paciello first gravitated to the mob in the late 1980s
after moving to Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
	   Accomplice witnesses have told investigators that as part of the Bonanno
holdup crew, Paciello was both mastermind and lookout for the 1992 robbery of a
branch bank in a Staten Island mall. Armed bandits smashed out windows with a
sledgehammer before making off with $300,000.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 18, 1993, the crew struck again, this time ringing the doorbell at
the home of Staten Island home of Shemtov, 46, on a tip that her businessman
husband had $200,000 stashed in a safe. Within minutes, a gunman had shot and
killed her; Paciello allegedly drove the getaway car as they fled, empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello made enough money to reinvent himself in South Beach by opening a
club called Risk in 1994, investigators say. The name was apt: Risk was
destroyed by fire in what authorities now suspect was an arson-insurance scam
which helped Paciello raise enough money to start Liquid.
</P>
<P>
	   Teaming with Casares - a member of a rich Cuban family which credits him
with helping her kick a drug habit - Paciello also opened the celebrity hangout
Bar Room and a restaurant, Joia, held fundraisers and bought a pricey
beach-front home. As his profile rose, so did stories linking him romantically
to the likes of Niki Taylor and Daisy Fuentes.
</P>
<P>
	   But authorities say Paciello also had another acquaintance - an undercover
agent posing as a corrupt narcotics officer. The agent was making secret
recordings of their phone calls, evidence that prosecutors say exposes the
defendant as a career thug.
</P>
<P>
	   "We got to get him beat up," Paciello allegedly said of Kelly. "I got to get
him whacked." Later, he warned that he would have to "come out of retirement.
I've become a big (sissy) down here. A big sucker."
</P>
<P>
	   About the same time, Paciello was observed introducing the undercover agent
to Alphonse Persico, then the acting boss of the Colombo crime family,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting has raised suspicions Paciello was laundering mob money through
his clubs. Prosecutors also allege that he allowed Liquid to become a haven for
dealers peddling the designer drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
	   The combination of Paciello's violent background and newfound fame would
make him "a commodity to the Colombos," said Jerry Capeci, a crime expert
tracking the Mafia on his Ganglandnews.com. Web site. "He's willing to break
heads to make money and he's an entree to celebrities with lots of cash."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys have denied their client has any mob ties. And they
complain that the recorded conversations were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's unfair to suggest that Chris Ludwigsen was plotting to kill anybody,
because that's nonsense," said attorney Howard Srebnick.
</P>
<P>
	   Paciello is expected to be released from a Brooklyn jail by the end of the
month. But he will remain under house arrest until his trial in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the party goes on at Paciello's Bar Room. Madonna and Gwyneth
Paltrow were spotted dancing on tabletops there at 4 a.m. New Year's Day.

<HEADLINE> More public Hillary Clinton agrees to appear at satire show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In yet another sign she is leaving the White House
cocoon that has shielded her for the past seven years, Hillary Rodham Clinton
agreed Friday to take the stage at the nation's longest-running political
gridiron show.
<P>
	   The first lady, fresh from her star turn on the "Late Show with David
Letterman" and set to formally enter New York's Senate race next month, accepted
an invitation to be part of the 100th annual Legislative Correspondents
Association show on June 10 in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll have to get the home office in Chappaqua working overtime on this,"
Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign committee, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who had never lived or worked in New York before, recently
moved into a house in Chappaqua in Westchester County just north of New York
City to establish New York residency for her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's expected opponent for the Senate race, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has also been invited to appear at the LCA show. There was no
immediate response Friday from the mayor on whether he planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   As a featured guest, Republican Giuliani did a lengthy monologue at the
LCA's 1991 show.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, as she draws closer to formally entering the Senate race,
the notoriously media-shy Mrs. Clinton has begun conducting regular
question-and-answer sessions with reporters during campaign stops. She mixes
easily with people who happen to show up at her events. The first lady is also
planning a series of in-depth interviews in the days leading up to her early
February campaign kickoff.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a far cry from her early forays onto the New York political stage
last year when she rarely left the security of her Secret Service detail and
contact with the public generally involved little more than some handshaking
along a rope line. Questioning by reporters was rare.
</P>
<P>
	   That is in sharp contrast to Giuliani, who holds a "media availability"
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown the mayor leading the first lady among New York
voters and some of her aides have been advising a more open approach to
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to appear at the LCA show, Mrs. Clinton is accepting what has
become almost a right of passage in New York politics for major candidates. In
1998, then-U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer took a turn. Five months later, Democrat
Schumer defeated Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato in that year's U.S. Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, once the reporters have finished skewering the politicians
with songs and skits, the governor and two guests, one Republican and one
Democrat, are invited to offer responses - generally humorous speeches or more
elaborate skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfson said Friday that he wasn't yet sure what Mrs. Clinton would do.
</P>
<P>
	   The black-tie, $175-a-person dinner and show raises money for charity and to
support LCA operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the Hillary Clinton campaign team appeared to have rejected the
LCA's invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 10 letter to LCA President David Hepp, co-host of the "Inside
Albany" television show, Mrs. Clinton's scheduling director, Paul Rivera, had
written that "Mrs. Clinton's official schedule will not permit her to accept the
invitation."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the rejection, Wolfson had said Thursday that he believed there
had been a mistake. By this morning, Hepp had a new letter in hand from Rivera
stating that the first letter "was sent in error."
</P>
<P>
	   "Please be assured that we plan to participate in the show," Rivera wrote in
the second letter.

<HEADLINE> Court TV trying to get cameras into Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Court TV is making a second attempt to get
television cameras into the murder trial of the four New York City police
officers charged in the killing of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo.
<P>
	   A Bronx judge already has refused another network's request to allow
television coverage of the trial. However, a state appeals court moved the
officers' trial to Albany, allowing Court TV to make its request to a different
judge.
</P>
<P>
	   "The basic cable network is asking New York state Supreme Court Justice
Joseph C. Teresi to declare unconstitutional the New York statute barring
cameras in the courtroom," Court TV officials said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not immediately known when Teresi would hear arguments or rule on the
issue. Jury selection begins Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Bronx Supreme Court Justice Patricia Williams refused a similar request from
the Regional News Network, WRNN-TV, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vendor, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999. Diallo was hit by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder.
All pleaded innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been almost three years since trials and criminal court hearings were
televised in New York. Audio and video recording was first allowed into New
York's trial courts in 1987, but only on an experimental basis. The law was
extended a few years at a time. The last extender expired in June 1997 and state
lawmakers have, thus far, refused to renew the law allowing television and audio
recording equipment back into the state's trial courts.

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann Argues Against Vodafone  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German telecom Mannesmann AG took its case to
shareholders Friday with detailed graphs and charts meant to persuade them that
going alone would generate higher stock prices than if they sold out to British
rival Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann's 47-page defense document was intended to demonstrate that the
German telecom company was strong enough to withstand the biggest hostile
takeover bid in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone chief Chris Gent was unimpressed, describing the move as
"desperate." He added it offered nothing new to the debate about whether
Mannesmann shareholders should accept his company's all-stock, $137.6 billion
bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Shareholders have until Feb. 7 to reply to the offer from Vodafone, the
world's No. 1 mobile phone company.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday was the deadline for Mannesmann to tender its official defense
against Vodafone's bid, and it began by purchasing a 10-page newspaper insert in
Germany's influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
	   Key to Mannesmann's argument was that within a year, its shares will be
worth $360 each, as compared with Vodafone's standing offer, worth $265 per
share.
</P>
<P>
	   "This year will be a Mannesmann year," Mannesmann chief executive Klaus
Esser said at a news conference. "Shareholders who accept Vodafone's offer have
to weigh two concerns: One is that they will end up with something worth much
less. And the second is that there will be considerable risks."
</P>
<P>
	   Esser said that potential for growth comes from Mannesmann's merger with
Orange PLC, Britain's third largest mobile phone company, and the company's
Internet division. Esser said Mannesmann was also considering putting its
Internet service, Europe's No. 3 player, up for sale on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann shares shot up 19.75 euros, or 8.25 percent, on the news, closing
at a record 259.25 euros ($267) in Frankfurt. Meanwhile, Vodafone shares rose
20.5 pence, or 6 percent, to 327 pence ($5.34) in London.
</P>
<P>
	   Herman Reith, an analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt, said shareholders
should be encouraged by the Mannesmann's arguments.
</P>
<P>
	   "The additional value of 100 euros is very plausible, because we're
expecting big growth in 2000 because of the acquisition of Orange," he said.
"Mannesmann is a smaller company, but its speed of business is faster than
Vodafone, which has no Internet or e-commerce synergies."
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann's defense document also focused on possible risks of separating
Orange from Mannesmann. If the Vodafone buyout of Mannesmann takes place,
Vodafone is expected to sell Mannesmann's stake in Orange because British law
prevents Vodafone from owning a major competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone issued a news release reiterating its argument that Mannesmann
would have a hard time establishing itself as a leading technology business
without a U.S. presence. It also argued that Mannesmann shareholders would have
greater value by owning 47.2 percent of the enlarged group following a merger of
the two companies than by owning 100 percent of Mannesmann alone.
</P>
<P>
	   "The argument of Vodafone is that both companies would be the industry's
biggest player in the world. Mannesmann's is that it has the potential for
faster growth," Reith said. "And from the investor's point of view it is always
share growth potential that outweighs sheer volume."
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies have been locked in an expensive campaign to woo
investors. Mannesmann said last week it expects to spend nearly $200 million
defending itself against Vodafone, pouring that money into ads in major
financial dailies and a series of international roadshows to meet the investors
who will decide the company's fate.

<HEADLINE> Study Bolsters Birth Defects Idea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- Women in 14 Texas border counties who had babies with birth
defects and then took folic acid during a subsequent pregnancy greatly reduced
the chance of having a second baby with spinal birth defects, according to
government researchers.
</P>
<P>
	   The report, published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, bolsters earlier findings that the B vitamin can help prevent neural
tube defects (NTD).
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990 and 1991, there was a surge of babies born without brains around
Brownsville, Texas. A 1993-1998 study found that the Texas counties that border
Mexico -- which have a predominantly Hispanic population -- have an NTD rate of
1 per 750 births. The national rate is 1 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Researchers tracked 124 women who had babies with birth defects. All took
folic acid during a subsequent pregnancy, and only one woman had a second baby
with a birth defect. And in that case, researchers could not locate the woman
during her pregnancy to provide the folic acid and track her progress, said the
project director, Dr. Russ Larsen.
</P>
<P>
	   Folic acid is found naturally in leafy green vegetables, beans, tuna, eggs
and other foods. The Food and Drug Administration ordered manufacturers to begin
fortifying foods with folic acid in January 1998.

<HEADLINE> Lori Berenson Goes on Hunger Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- An American woman serving a life sentence for treason in
Peru has gone on a hunger strike in protest of her conviction and imprisonment,
family members said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Lori Berenson, a New York native and former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology student, was convicted by a secret military court in 1996 for helping
pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement rebels plan a thwarted attack on
Peru's Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She is frustrated. She is asking for her freedom because she was
wrongfully convicted and she's innocent,'' said her father, Mark Berenson, who
was reached at his New York home today.
</P>
<P>
	   According to a press release from the national penitentiary institute,
Berenson, 30, informed prison authorities that she was beginning a hunger strike
on Jan. 11. She is consuming liquids but not solid foods.
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson is being held in Socabaya prison, 465 miles southeast of Lima. She
began her hunger strike on Tuesday to commemorate the fourth anniversary of her
conviction, her father said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mr. Berenson and his wife, Rhoda, have been carrying out a campaign to free
her. But President Alberto Fujimori has said she is a terrorist and will serve
her full sentence in Peruvian prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson, who was convicted by a military court, has said she was not
allowed to present evidence at her trial or to question prosecution witnesses
and that the judge wore a hood.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department has asked Peru to give her an open civilian trial,
arguing that her summary military trial denied her due process.
</P>
<P>
	   In comments to reporters on Thursday, Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante, who
is also the justice minister, said that a pardon for Berenson is out of the
question and that she could only receive a new trial if she proves her
conviction was unjust, arbitrary or not based on the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   The government maintains that secret military proceedings with hooded judges
were necessary during Peru's bloody battle with leftist rebels because civilian
courts were releasing too many suspects and judges feared reprisals. The
practice was abolished in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Peru's internal war against rebels reduced dramatically in intensity after
the capture of top rebel leaders in 1992, but thousands of convicted rebels
remain in Peru's prisons.

<HEADLINE> Nine Miners Rescued in South Africa  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSANNA LOOF Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORKNEY, South Africa (AP) -- Rocks and earth came crashing down around the
miners more than one mile underground, plunging them into a world of darkness
and whirling dust.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon the cries and weeping of trapped men arose, and survivors who were
still able to move began struggling to save their comrades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We kept on searching for people who were crying until there was no more
sound,'' said Hlapane Lefielo, one of nine miners rescued after four days of
entombment in a gold mine here.
</P>
<P>
	   The miners met with reporters on Friday, a day after their rescue, while
rescuers continued desperate attempts to reach two seriously injured miners
unable to make their way to an open area where the survivors were found. Four
others near them lay dead, mine officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lefielo, of the southern African kingdom of Lesotho, was the leader of the
15-member team at the African Rainbow Minerals mine trapped when a tremor caused
the collapse Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We were terrified because it was full of dust. We could not see anything
around us. We feel very glad to be out and alive,'' Lefielo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing blue hospital gowns and still attached to drips, he and the eight
others sat in a semicircle in a hospital meeting room in Orkney, about 110 miles
southwest of Johannesburg and near the mine shaft. One man had a bandage on his
head. The survivors appeared tired but in good condition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was encouraging and comforting the men, that they would not end up in
the mine'' forever, he said. ``We were praying in our hearts to God to help us
get out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually, Lefielo said he found a pipe that he managed to cut through. He
started screaming into it, and managed to make contact with rescuers on the
other end. Rescuers used the pipe to pass on water, a nutritional drink and
fluorescent light tubes.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, falling rocks in the shaft further hampered the rescue work for
the remaining miners.

<P>
	   ``That area has very, very little ventilation now,'' African Rainbow chief
executive Andre Wilkin said. ``Their chances (of survival) are certainly
reduced, but I don't want to speculate on their conditions. ... I'm still
convinced that we will be able to get to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the miners still underground was Pedro Nkuna, 25, of Mozambique. His
brother Rui also works at the mine, and continued working his shifts throughout
the painful week. He was critical of management for not contacting him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm his oldest brother. I should be the first person to be contacted,'' he
said. The mine's managers have said they are in the processing of trying to
reach family members.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Rui Nkuna, almost all of the rescued miners said they would go back
down into the deep shafts despite the dangers -- to support their families at
wages averaging the equivalent of $430 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The rescue drama captured national attention in a country where mining is a
major part of the economy, and where accidents kill hundreds of miners every
year in some of the world's deepest and thus most dangerous mines.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry draws migrant workers from across the region. Of the 15 miners
trapped underground, eight were from Lesotho, two from Mozambique, one from
Swaziland and four from South Africa.

<HEADLINE> US Army Kids in Korea Try Gas Masks  </HEADLINE>
   By SANG-HUN CHOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Lauren Vazquez, a 7-year-old from New York City,
went to class Friday at the main U.S. military base in Seoul to learn how to
wear a gas mask.
</P>
<P>
	   She was among 18 people attending a mandatory 2 1/2-hour class for all U.S.
military dependents in South Korea. The class reflects growing concern about
North Korea's germ warfare capabilities and uncertainty about the intentions of
the isolated Stalinist state.
</P>
<P>
	   The students listened as an instructor explained, ``There are a lot of
things we don't know about what's going on in North Korea. It's prudent for us
to take a precautionary measure.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was Lauren's first experience wearing a gas mask.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The air stinks!'' the girl said with a giggle.
</P>
<P>
	   The class took place in the 8th Army's Dragon Hill Lodge hotel. The
trainees, most of them civilian employees at the hotel, first watched a video
presentation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am glad we have this available. I feel much safer with this,'' said
Lauren's father, Spc. Carlos Vazquez with the 8th Military Police Brigade.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military began distributing Army gas masks in December to all
family members of the 37,000 U.S. soldiers in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not as a response to any immediate threat. The threat has been
there for years,'' said Maj. John Michaels, a chemicals officer.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. initiative has attracted the attention of civil defense officials,
especially in Seoul, 35 miles south of the border and well within the range of
North Korean missiles and artillery shells, which experts say can carry anthrax
and other deadly germ weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent surveys showed only 300,000 of Seoul's 11 million people have bought
gas masks. But South Korean officials have ruled out any immediate campaign to
distribute gas masks.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean defense officials say North Korea has boosted its stockpile of
chemical weapons fivefold over the past dozen years, to 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, North Korea rejected a U.S. claim that it had drastically
increased its potential to wage chemical warfare, calling the claim ``the height
of impudence'' through its official foreign news outlet, the Korean Central News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   When the United States began a $130 million program in 1998 to inoculate all
of its 2.4 million troops and reservists against anthrax, U.S. soldiers in South
Korea were among the first to roll up their sleeves. Anthrax, an infectious
disease that normally affects animals, is considered among the most lethal
biological agents.

<HEADLINE> New Rules Protect Consumer Privacy  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Coming soon to your local travel agency, mortgage
company, tax preparation service and storefront check-cashing outlet: federal
rules to protect consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators are drafting the rules to spell out how consumers'
personal information will be protected as barriers between financial businesses
come down, because of landmark legislation enacted in November. The law allows
banks, investment firms and insurance companies to get involved in each other's
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's less widely known that the law's privacy provisions reach beyond
banks, Wall Street and insurance to a diverse panoply of "money" businesses.
They include consumer finance companies, department stores that issue credit
cards, money transmitters and money-order businesses, debt collection agencies,
credit bureaus and telemarketing firms that sell financial products.
</P>
<P>
	   The definition of "financial activities" is being broadened as traditional
distinctions blur in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   Importantly, consumers are getting a new right to stop the financial
businesses from sharing their personal data with a third party, such as a
telemarketer, with some exceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   That right, however, doesn't go as far as consumer groups and privacy
advocates had wanted. Financial companies with whom you do business will be able
to share or sell your data unless you expressly ask them, in writing, not to do
so. The onus is on consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Regardless of what the (federal) agencies do, they are merely shuffling
deck chairs on the Titanic," Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at Public
Interest Research Group, said Friday. "The ultimate solution to give consumers
real privacy protections lies with the states."
</P>
<P>
	   The financial overhaul law gives supremacy to state laws that grant
consumers stronger privacy protections than the federal law does, and officials
in some states have said they intend to use that power to enact their own
privacy laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial and money businesses of all shapes and sizes will have to disclose
their privacy policies to customers at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Because the privacy provisions apply to a company doing a financial
business, regardless of whether the company is affiliated with a bank, they will
apply to a very broad group of companies and industries," said Scott Alvarez,
associate general counsel of the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because financial holding companies are allowed to engage in a wide
range of activities, with the new requirement that they abide by the privacy
rules. Consumers should get the same protection whether a business is part of a
holding company group or stands alone, the government's reasoning goes, so all
"money" businesses should be subject to the privacy rules.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is, for example, that if you do business with a mom and pop travel
agency, your personal data should be as well protected as that of customers of
American Express Co., which has a travel business, banking operations and other
financial divisions under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve is among a passel of agencies drafting privacy rules for
the industries and sectors they regulate, along with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift
Supervision and others. The Federal Trade Commission is writing the rules for
insurance companies and agents and all other affected businesses outside of
banks and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
	   They're working under a tight deadline, aiming to put out proposed rules for
30 days of public comment in early to mid-February. Under the new law, final
regulations must be in place by May.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of several "money" business groups affected by the new privacy
rules, contacted by The Associated Press, declined to comment on them because
they haven't yet been proposed.
</P>
<P>
	   They included the American Society of Travel Agents; the American Financial
Services Association, whose members include consumer finance companies,
automobile financing divisions and retail chains; and the Community Financial
Services Association of America, which represents check-cashing and short-term
cash loan businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Some officials of groups representing the banking, securities and insurance
industries, which closely followed Congress' lengthy deliberations on the
financial overhaul legislation, already have discussed the new privacy rules
with regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the overhaul law, banks, brokerages and insurers that affiliate are
entitled to share customers' personal data with each other -- a provision that
raised a storm of protest by consumer groups and privacy advocates. It's a key
reason the financial companies wanted to be able to merge -- to help them find
potential customers for new products.

<HEADLINE> Prices Rose 2.7 Percent in 1999  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices, boosted by sharp increases in fuel oil
and gasoline, rose 2.7 percent last year, the worst showing in three years. But
aside from energy costs, most other prices were well-behaved, posting the
smallest annual gain since Lyndon Johnson was president in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   The "core" rate of inflation -- which excludes the volatile energy and food
sectors -- rose just 1.9 percent in 1999, the best showing since a 1.5 percent
rise 34 years ago, and even better than a 2.4 percent rise in 1998, the Labor
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is good for consumers. It means that whatever wage increases they are
getting are worth more than they have for a long time," said William Cheney,
chief economist for John Hancock.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's low core rate is evidence that inflation was under control,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Inflation remains the dog that didn't bark," said Merrill Lynch's chief
economist Bruce Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
	   For December, the Consumer Price Index, the most closely watched inflation
gauge, rose a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent led by a big 1.4 percent jump in
energy prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street was cheered by the tame inflation report. The Dow Jones
industrial average was up more than 106 points in early afternoon trading. The
Nasdaq was up 104 points. But bond prices, which initially rose after the
report's release, fell as yields on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bonds rose
to 6.70 percent from 6.65 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the CPI report and Thursday's report
showing benign inflation at the wholesale level "should be nominated for 'Best
Picture' at this year's Academy Awards."
</P>
<P>
	   The good CPI news didn't change economists' predictions that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates on Feb. 2. But economists said the report
reduced the odds that the central bank would have to act aggressively by
boosting rates a half of a percentage point. It "puts the nail in the coffin" of
an increase of that size, said First Union's chief economist, David Orr. A more
mild, quarter of a point increase is all but certain, economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve bumped up interest rates three times last year to slow
the sizzling economy and keep inflation under control. On Thursday, Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan expressed new worries that the soaring stock market could lead to
an overheated U.S. economy, signaling that the Fed would raise interest rates
again soon.
</P>
<P>
	   In two other reports, the nation's industrial output rose 0.4 percent in
December and business inventories grew by 0.9 percent in November, the fastest
pace since 1995, while sales rose a brisk 1.3 percent, additional signs that the
economy headed into 2000 with lots of momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   On the inflation front, a 13.4 percent surge in energy prices in 1999 -- the
biggest annual increase since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and drove up energy
costs -- was the main factor behind the 2.7 percent advance in overall consumer
prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Production limits by oil-producing nations and increased demand from
recovering economies in Asia accounted for the spike in fuel oil, gasoline and
other energy costs. In 1998, energy costs fell steeply as the Asian financial
crisis depressed global demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Fuel oil prices rose 5.9 percent in December, pushing the total increase for
the year to 30.9 percent, the largest annual gain since 1979. Gasoline prices,
which rose 4.1 percent for the month, posted the biggest annual increase in nine
years, rising a huge 30.1 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Many economists expect energy costs to moderate this year as crude oil
prices stabilize.
</P>
<P>
	   Food prices, meanwhile, rose a tiny 0.1 percent in December and 1.9 percent
for the year. Rising prices for beef, pork and vegetables in December offset
falling prices for poultry and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
	   New car prices fell 0.1 percent last month and 0.3 percent last year, the
best showing on car prices since 1997. Airfares fell 0.7 percent in December,
but rose 10.9 percent for the year, the biggest annual increase in three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors' fees were unchanged in December and were up 2.6 last year, the
smallest annual increase since 1963, while prescription drug prices rose 0.4
percent for the month and 6.1 percent for the year, the largest annual gain in
eight years, as drug companies raised prices to cover litigation risks.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside energy and food, the "core" rate of inflation rose a
smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in December, mostly reflecting a smaller
increase in housing costs. For the year, more moderate prices for housing and
tobacco products, which rose sharply in 1998, helped make core prices low.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Court Frees Basque Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A Basque leader left prison a free man Friday after the
Supreme Court threw out charges against him.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said Jose Antonio Urruticoetxea Bengoetxea was awaiting trial on
weapons possession and other charges for which he had already served time in
France. It said he could not be tried again.
</P>
<P>
	   Hours after the ruling, the 49-year-old Urruticoetxea left a prison in
Nanclares de la Oca in the Basque province of Alava, the news agency Efe said.
He was greeted by his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
	   Urruticoetxea was once one of the best-known and most recognizable faces of
the ETA leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Basque group's top leader from 1984 to 1989, he was suspected of
ordering attacks including a deadly car bombing in Barcelona in June 1987. The
blast in an underground parking lot killed 21 people and wounded 45.
</P>
<P>
	   While in jail in October 1998, he was elected to the Basque regional
parliament as a member of Herri Batasuna, the party seen as ETA's political
wing. Spaniards were enraged three months later when the party named him as its
representative to the legislature's human rights commission.
</P>
<P>
	   The charges dismissed Friday stem from the 1986 discovery of an arms cache
in a factory in Hendaya, a town in the French Basque country just across the
border from Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   A French court convicted Urruticoetxea in that case in 1990 and sentenced
him to 10 years in jail. He was released after serving six years and extradited
to Spain in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   While Urruticoetxea was being held, prosecutors tried to bring charges
against him in a number of cases. Each gradually fell apart for lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ETA has been fighting since the late 1960s to create an independent Basque
nation. Nearly 800 people have been killed in shootings and bombings blamed on
the group.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Cuban mothers marched Friday as Fidel
Castro's government appealed to emotion in demanding the repatriation of a
6-year-old boy separated from his father by the same sea that took his mother's
life.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of visibly pregnant women were organized into rows, while other
mothers carried small children and many waved Cuban flags.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bring back our son!'' the women cried as they moved slowly up the Malecon
coastal highway to the American diplomatic mission. ``We want our son!''
</P>
<P>
	   The march outside the U.S. Interests Section marked a return to the larger
demonstrations of early December, when hundreds of thousands of people rallied
in some of Cuba's biggest gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that
brought Castro to power 41 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday was the U.S. government's original deadline for Elian Gonzalez's
return to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service earlier ruled that only the father can speak for Elian on
immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's Miami
relatives a chance to fight for the boy in federal court. Reno said this week
that only a federal court has jurisdiction in the case and rejected a Florida
state judge's order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments
by his American relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading Friday's march was Elian's young stepmother, Nelsy, pushing his baby
half-brother in a stroller. She was flanked by Elian's two grandmothers and
Vilma Espin, head of the Cuban Federation of Women and wife of Raul Castro, the
president's brother and armed forces minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in the ``March
of the Combatant Mothers,'' as Castro's communist government increasingly
appealed to familial sentiment in its campaign to reunite Elian and his father.
</P>
<P>
	   A sign outside the American diplomatic mission showed a portrait of the
first-grader behind a chain-link fence, underscoring Cuba's position that the
boy has been ``kidnapped'' by relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Red, white and blue Cuban flags fluttered amid the sea of women stretching
for many blocks down the Malecon as choppy ocean waves splashed against the
coastal wall. A few men and children also joined the march.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his rescue Nov. 25 off Florida's coast, Elian has been increasingly
referred to in Cuba as ``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's
decades-long ideological battle with Cuban exiles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than a clash between two governments, the dispute over Elian is a
battle between Cubans of differing political views living on both sides of the
Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   In a powerful interview Thursday with ABC's ``Nightline,'' Gonzalez, 31,
expressed growing rage and frustration over his separation from his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, expressed her own despair in
recent days, saying that her dead daughter will not rest until Elian is back in
Cuba. Elisabeth Brotons, Elian's mother, was among 11 people who died when their
boat sank off Florida's coast. Elian survived by clinging to an inner tube.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez is fighting to keep the boy
with him in Miami, saying he can give the child a better life outside Cuba. He
and others who oppose the boy's return to Cuba say that Brotons died to give the
boy freedom in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Saying that keeping Elian there out of respect for my daughter's will is a
bunch of lies,'' Rodriguez told Cuban journalists this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can see that none of them know her,'' she said, referring to the
statements made by Elian's relatives in Miami about her daughter. ``I was her
mother and I knew her better than anyone.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 147.68; Nasdaq Up 118.09  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, boosted by a strong
earnings report from high-tech bellwether Intel and comments from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that indicate interest rates will be rising only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the most closely-watched market indicators were in record high
territory. In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 147.68 to 11,730.11. The Nasdaq composite index rose 118.09 to 4,075.30.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.30 to 1,467.98, just shy of record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, which announced better than expected earnings late Thursday on a
surge in PC sales, drove the Dow higher. Intel, the world's leading computer
chip maker, rose 7 3/8 to 103 7/8 on the Nasdaq. IBM rose 3 11/16 to 121 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a speech by Greenspan Thursday night, Wall Street seems to be
feeling more confident that the Fed is likely to raise rates no more than a
quarter-percentage point at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on
Feb. 1-2. Although rate increases are usually troublesome, market watchers said
they were impressed that Greenspan indicated he won't let inflation get in the
way of a surging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has demonstrated that he understands the world has changed and
that he doesn't intend to do anything scary to the market," said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities."We are comfortable
with Greenspan's comments because it shows he is not behind the curve, and won't
let inflation raise its mighty head."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest economic data released today once again showed inflation remains
under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in December,
slightly below forecasts. Excluding energy prices, the gain was just 0.1
percent. The report was the latest confirmation that fears about accelerating
inflation remain unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's financial stocks rose following the report. American Express was
up 4 15/16 to 160 15/16 and J.P. Morgan gained 3 7/8 to 126 11/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Optimism about earnings extended beyond the technology sector. Lands' End
rose 4 5/16 to 39 3/16 after a Wall Street analysts noted that in spite of
slumping sales in the eight-week holiday shopping season, profits improved.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 745.07 million shares, well ahead of
Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.13 to 507.32.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Dept. Redeeming 1975 Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is redeeming $4.2 billion of 30-year bonds
issued in 1975 to help pare down interest payments on the national debt, the
Treasury Department announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   It marks the latest effort by Treasury to better manage the $5.76 trillion
national debt. The government hasn't redeemed any bonds since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Redeeming the bonds, which carry an interest rate of 8 1/4 percent, before
they reach maturity, will save the government around $800 million in interest
payments. The bonds' maturity date is May 15, 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate move to better manage the nation's debt, the Clinton
administration said Thursday that it adopted rules allowing the government to
buy back up to $30 billion of the national debt this year, something that hasn't
happened for at least a century.
</P>
<P>
	   The debt buyback program will be launched in the coming weeks with several
operations conducted in the next 12 months, totaling up to $30 billion. The
exact timing of the program and the size of each buyback program hasn't been
determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The national debt now stands at $5.76 trillion, with the amount of that debt
held by the public totaling $3.6 trillion. The rest of the debt, some $2
trillion, is held by the government's large trust funds, primarily the Social
Security trust fund.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration, which first proposed the idea of debt buybacks last
August, has sought to portray its proposal as the responsible way to utilize the
government's burgeoning surpluses, the product of the current economic boom, in
contrast to Republican calls for large tax cuts.

<HEADLINE> Russia: U.S. Trying To Weaken Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SEWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia unveiled its new national security doctrine on Friday,
broadening the Kremlin's authority to use nuclear weapons and accusing the
United States of trying to weaken Russia and become the world's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine replaces one adopted in 1997, a time when political and
military partnership with the West were still buzzwords and many Russians
remained optimistic about the country's economic future.
</P>
<P>
	   But Russia's attitude to the West has hardened following the eastward
expansion of NATO and the alliance's intervention in Yugoslavia, and the
nation's economic reform efforts have suffered serious setbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea of partnership has vanished,'' said Sergei Sokut, a military
affairs writer at the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper, which published the entire
doctrine in its weekly military supplement.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the ``Concept of National
Security'' into law on Monday, but the full document was not published in
Russian newspapers until Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The most significant change in the lengthy document, which covers two full
newspaper pages, concerns the use of Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   In a section called ``Ensuring the National Security of Russia,'' the new
doctrine would allow the country's leaders to use all existing forces
``including nuclear weapons'' to oppose any attack -- nuclear or conventional --
if other efforts fail to repel the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous doctrine stated that Russia would use nuclear weapons only in
cases when its national sovereignty was threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The level and scale of military threats is growing,'' the doctrine said,
as if to justify the new emphasis on the potential use of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Military experts say the shift was due to the tremendous weakness of
Russia's conventional forces, which might not be able to defend the country
against attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It widens the range of Russia's use of nuclear weapons,'' Sorkut said in
an interview. ``It's a guarantee that Russia won't be attacked.''
</P>
<P>
	   Following the publication of the document, the Russian military tried to
play down the significance of the nuclear aspect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Moscow is interested in expanding cooperation with the West,'' Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov, the deputy chief of the General Staff, told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials who have seen the document
described it as having a much more aggressive and confrontational tone than its
predecessor. However, security experts have pointed out that the new stress on
nuclear weapons sounds like NATO's own doctrine.
</P>
<P>
	   Publication of the new doctrine comes at a time when relations between the
United States and Russia have soured, with sharp differences over Washington's
desire to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to protect itself from
rogue states like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia claims that pulling back from the treaty risks upsetting the
strategic nuclear balance and could unleash a new arms race, which the new
doctrine warns against.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine identifies two ``mutually exclusive'' trends in international
relations following the end of the Cold War: one an attempt to create a
multipolar world and the other an alleged effort led by the United States to
dominate the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, China, India and France have all opposed what they call U.S.
hegemony following the Cold War and have attempted to create a counter-balance.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine condemns alleged efforts by a series of countries, which are
not identified by name, to weaken Russian economically, politically and
militarily.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, which seems defensive about Russia's loss of international
authority, warned of the dangers of sapping Russia of its strength and reducing
its influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The national interests of Russia in the international sphere consist of
guaranteeing its sovereignty and consolidation of Russia's position as a great
power,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is accused of trying to decide key international problems
on its own and to bypass international law. The doctrine urges that the United
Nations and other international institutions be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine is frank about Russia's economic weaknesses, calling for
efforts to strengthen the economy in order for the country to remain a major
power.
</P>
<P>
	   It acknowledges that it is in Russia's interest to maintain its economic
links to the outside world and there is no suggestion that it intends to abandon
free market principles.
</P>
<P>
	   The document identifies sharp differences between rich and poor,
unemployment and poverty as obstacles to Russia's status as an important power.
</P>
<P>
	   It also voices fears of a growing number of foreign spies in Russia, and
calls for greater efforts to fight terrorism, a danger that threatens the
country's stability.

<HEADLINE> Israel Leaders Tangled in Scandals  </HEADLINE>
   By KARIN LAUB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The president has admitted pocketing wads of cash from a
rich admirer. An ex-premier is under suspicion that he made off with the
silverware from his official residence. A former justice minister faces a fraud
indictment. A one-time interior minister is headed for jail on a bribery
conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   And that's just the short list.
</P>
<P>
	   The recent slew of corruption scandals has made Israelis long for a time,
not so long ago, when frugal leaders like Menachem Begin lived in cramped
apartments and indignantly turned down gifts as innocent as a new suit for a
White House visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Some say the scandals are a sign of Israel's identity crisis, with the
country unable to find new values to replace discarded ideals of sacrifice and
togetherness.
</P>
<P>
	   Other say the plethora of police probes only proves that Israel is an open
democracy, no different from its role models, the United States and Western
European nations. ``Arrests go with politicians like beans go with franks,''
says columnist Zeev Chafetz. ``If you don't see arrests, there is something
wrong with society.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the latest affair -- involving President Ezer Weizman -- is painful
for many Israelis who consider the presidency one of the country's few unifying
forces.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, police began investigating allegations that the 75-year-old
president was for years on the payroll of a French textile magnate. Weizman,
once a beloved, irascible figurehead, has said he accepted less than the
$430,000 cited and that he did nothing wrong since his benefactor expected
nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
	   But the denial has not silenced calls for his resignation, and few believe
Weizman will serve out the three years remaining in his term even if police find
no proof of criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He should have apologized, packed his bags and left,'' columnist Nahum
Barnea wrote in a front-page commentary in the Yediot Ahronot daily. ``He, too,
knows he has lost his honor, and that without honor, there is no meaning to his
job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Weizman is not alone in his troubles.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife, Sarah, have been
grilled by police about suspicions that they illegally kept tens of thousands of
dollars worth of gifts belonging to the state, including silverware,
candlesticks, carpets, pictures, scarves and a gold letter opener from Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general has not decided whether to prosecute the Netanyahus,
who have maintained their innocence. Still, the affair has put on hold
Netanyahu's comeback plans, such as leading a campaign against a Golan
Heights-for-peace with Syria treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Two former Cabinet ministers serving under Netanyahu are even more deeply
entangled with the law.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Interior Minister Arieh Deri is appealing a four-year prison sentence
for bribery. And police have recommended that ex-Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi
be charged with fraud for allegedly receiving an illegal salary of tens of
thousands of dollars from a nonprofit group he helped found.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanegbi's successor, Yossi Beilin, said Friday that such high-profile
investigations, especially the Weizman case, prove that ``no one is above the
law.''
</P>
<P>
	   But even Beilin's boss, Prime Minister Ehud Barak -- who likes to portray
himself as a political rookie untainted by past backroom deals -- has come under
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
	   The state comptroller is investigating whether nonprofit groups, apparently
set up by Barak associates including a brother-in-law, funneled millions of
dollars in illegal foreign contributions to his 1999 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Law professor Uriel Reichman says the scandals are a sign of a greater
malaise. ``Without a moral agenda, the nation will find it more and more
difficult to continue,'' said Reichman, president of the Interdisciplinary
Center in Herzliya, a private university. ``What is needed is a redefinition of
the national goals.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Chechnya Attacks  </HEADLINE>
   By YURI BAGROV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUDERMES, Russia (AP) -- Russia launched heavy air and artillery strikes on
Chechen rebel positions Friday, claiming the attacks killed scores of rebels and
denying media reports of growing Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia claims to have regained momentum after its offensive stalled early
this week in the face of rebel attacks on Russian-held towns and fierce
resistance by fighters in Chechnya's capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman, Lt. Col. Konstantin Kukharenko, said up to 60 rebels
were killed in heavy shelling of the village of Khimoi. The statement could not
be verified independently. It came on top of the military's claim to have killed
40 rebels the previous day.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, a leader of pro-Moscow Chechens reached agreement with rebel
field commanders to surrender the area around Nozhai-Yurt, the Interfax news
agency reported. It said many rebels are based in the sizable southern mountain
village.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the reports of a high rebel death toll, Russian news media
increasingly have begun questioning the Chechnya offensive amid reports of
growing Russian casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia generally has reported only a few deaths each day, but this week
reports surfaced of tens of soldiers dying daily. On Thursday, Interfax reported
a death toll of 33 in the past 24 hours -- the highest toll reported by
mainstream media. The report cited military sources.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Ministry said only one soldier had been killed and 13 wounded on
Thursday. In a press release, the ministry called media reports of higher
casualties ``conscious lies.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the long ground campaign, which began in late September,
appears to be wearing soldiers' nerves thin.
</P>
<P>
	   In Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, Russian forces have been in
control for weeks. But members of a special police force worry about rebels who
may still be in the area. One officer said the Russians feel that their only
friends in the city are the stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feed all the mongrel dogs in the area. Chechens don't,'' Capt. Vladimir
Latyshev said. ``As a result, the dogs have become accustomed to men in uniform
and bark at others, alerting us.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel much calmer on the front line in Grozny,'' said another officer,
Igor Molotov. ``There you look the enemy in the face and here you constantly
feel their look on your back.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because of concern about rebels going undetected in Russian-held towns,
Russia this week ordered that all males between ages 10 and 60 be checked out
for rebel ties. The order meant that males in that age range could not enter or
exit Chechnya, a move that sparked strong foreign criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   But Russian soldiers manning a checkpoint in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia started allowing Chechen men to cross on Friday. It was unclear
whether the travel restriction would be rescinded altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya in late September after weeks of
airstrikes. The offensive is intended to wipe out Chechnya-based rebels who
twice invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan last summer and who are
blamed for apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart CEO David Glass Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Glass, the man who turned Wal-Mart Stores Inc. into
the world's biggest retailer from a chain catering to small-town America,
stepped down Friday in a move that was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass, 64, succeeded Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton as CEO 12 years ago. Lee
Scott, who has been the company's chief operating officer and vice chairman for
the past year, is taking over as CEO and president.
</P>
<P>
	   "Glass had a global vision for this company that catapulted Wal-Mart to grow
in ways that most never anticipated it could," said Walter Loeb, who runs the
New York-based retail consulting firm Loeb Associates. "Lee Scott, just like
David Glass, really understands this company, and Wal-Mart won't miss a beat as
it moves forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors took Friday's announcement in stride, with Wal-Mart shares
drifting down 12 1/2 cents to $65 a share in afternoon trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, where it is one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial
average.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott was tapped about a year ago to succeed Glass, who will remain with
Wal-Mart for at least the next year as chairman of the executive committee of
the board of directors. After that, Glass plans on devoting more time to
baseball, "a great passion all my life," and his association with the Kansas
City Royals.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second time in as many days that a chief executive of a
world-class corporation stepped down. On Thursday, Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, unexpectedly promoted company president Steve Ballmer to the additional
job of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Glass' greatest achievements was taking Wal-Mart out of middle
America and making it a global brand. It now is one of the biggest corporations
in the world, rivaling giants like General Motors and Ford.
</P>
<P>
	   The first Wal-Mart opened in Rogers, Ark., in 1962 by Walton and his brother
James "Bud" Walton, who saw a demand for discount stores in small towns that
were underserved by larger chains.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation of their business: Keep prices low and never falter on
customer service.
</P>
<P>
	   Those principles haven't changed. Today, Wal-Mart is more price competitive
than ever before and that smiley-face service still is found throughout the
company, starting with the bubbly "greeters" who stand at the entrance of each
store.
</P>
<P>
	   When Glass took the helm in 1988, the company had 1,200 stores and was the
nation's third-largest retailer. Sales totaled $16 billion that year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Walton died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Wal-Mart now operates more than 2,485 Wal-Mart discount stores and 456
Sam's Clubs wholesale stores in the United States, plus about 1,000 stores
around the globe. Wal-Mart is expected to bring in $165 billion in sales for the
fiscal year ending Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 million people shop at Wal-Mart each week, and the company
employs about a million people.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sam Walton steered clear of certain challenges. He conquered the
countryside but left the cities alone," said Burt Flickinger, managing director
of Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn. "But there was no competitive risk that
steered David away, and that aggressiveness obviously paid off for the company."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides his growth initiatives in the United States and around the world,
Glass is credited with helping build Wal-Mart's inventory and distribution
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Vendors can exchange invoices, purchase orders and other documents with
Wal-Mart by electronically. Stores are linked to the company's headquarters via
satellite, which helps them replenish and reorder inventory only when needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Its systems are so advanced that Wal-Mart knows how to position items in its
stores to achieve the best sales or quickly transfer sluggish products to stores
where they will sell.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Glass, the company also developed in the early 1990s its successful
Supercenter concept, which combines discount stores with grocery operations, and
recently began the test of its Neighborhood Markets, a stand-alone grocery
chain.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are ready to make a brutal attack on the food industry, that's their
next step for growth," said Daniel Binder, an analyst at the New York investment
firm Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said that Scott will likely continue the programs Wal-Mart has in
place, including the company's efforts on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the company announced that it was partnering with a Silicon
Valley venture capital firm to form a separate Web company called Wal-Mart.com.
In December, Wal-Mart signed a deal with America Online to create an Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
	   Online sales can only add to the company's aggressive plans going forward.
Flickinger believes that Wal-Mart's sales will hit $250 billion by 2003, which
he said will exceed the combined revenues of the next six to seven global
competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott's experience at Wal-Mart is vast.
</P>
<P>
	   He began his career in 1979 in the logistics department, and eventually
helped build the company's distribution centers. Five years ago, he moved into
the merchandising and store side of the business, and in 1998, he was named
president and CEO of the Wal-Mart stores division.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Foreign Fliers Lifted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOJAVE, Calif. (AP) -- The State Department on Friday lifted the ban it had
imposed on foreign fliers at a private test-pilot school over fears the classes
could teach hostile nations about U.S. weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The government ordered the ban Jan. 4 after four Pakistani pilots applied
for U.S. visas so they could train in supersonic fighter jets at the National
Test Pilot School at Mojave Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The order effectively closed the school because 15 of its 17 students are
not Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the government said it would lift the ban only after the school
obtained a license to teach foreigners. However, the State Department said
Friday the school can continue teaching all students while the license is
processed, according to Russ Stewart, the school's director of marketing.
</P>
<P>
	   The current class includes students from seven nations, most members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, with others from Australia and South Korea,
the school said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuition for the yearlong class is $500,000 per student, many of whom return
to their countries to help flight test their military's aircraft.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shulman gets 25 to life on top of death penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Robert Shulman, who has admitted killing five
women and is already on death row, was sentenced Friday to 25 years to life in
prison for murdering the two victims whose bodies ended up in Westchester.
<P>
	   The sister of one victim stood up in court to denounce Shulman, saying,
"What this gentleman has done has torn up my family completely."
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't forgive him and we certainly can't forget it," said Dawn Paul, 28,
of Brooklyn, younger sister of victim Lori Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, eyes downcast, stood as County Court Judge Joseph West said, "This
is a horrible case. These are heinous crimes. ... You have served as judge, jury
and executioner."
</P>
<P>
	   He sentenced Shulman to 25 years to life for second-degree murder and
ordered the term be served only after any other sentence he faces.
</P>
<P>
	   Shulman, 45, is under a death sentence in Suffolk County in the killings of
three other women at his Hicksville apartment. He is appealing, and Westchester
District Attorney Jeanie Pirro said she pursued the case to make sure he spent
his life behind bars.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will guarantee that he dies in prison, either way," she said when he
pleaded guilty. "He'll go by lethal injection or by natural causes."
</P>
<P>
	   The case ended up in Westchester because Shulman and his brother Barry
dumped Ms. Vasquez and another victim, who was never identified, in Yonkers.
They were found in 1991 and 1992, crammed into plastic trash cans. There was no
death penalty law at the time.
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Shulman, who has admitted helping his brother dispose of the bodies,
faces two years in prison. Lawyers said Robert Shulman pleaded guilty to murder
for a deal that spares his brother additional time.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Paul told the judge that her sister, a prostitute, "wanted to change
her life and this gentleman here took her life away."
</P>
<P>
	   Outside court, she said she had learned of her sister's killing a day after
they were supposed to get together for an outing at Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "She didn't show up, so I knew she was missing, and then the next day we got
the news," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss Paul said her fifth child, a 10-month-old girl, was born on Ms.
Vasquez's birthday and was named for her.

	   Economists Expecting Fed Rate Hike
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's chief economic
spokesman, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, refused to comment
directly today on Federal Reserve head Alan Greenspan's worries
that the high-flying stock market, by boosting consumer spending,
could threaten inflation pressures down the road. Calling
Greenspan's comments yesterday a ``thoughtful speech,'' Summers
said the administration continues to believe the best approach to
managing the economy is ensuring that the government's policies
support good economic fundamentals. Private economists, meanwhile,
see Greenspan's comments as a further indication that the Fed will
hike interest rates at its meeting Feb. 1-2.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, boosted by a
strong earnings report from high-tech bellwether Intel and comments
from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that indicate interest
rates will be rising only slightly. Two of the most closely-watched
market indicators were in record high territory. Just before 3 p.m.
EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 131.94 to 11,714.37.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 110.86 to 4,068.07. Intel, which
announced better than expected earnings late yesterday drove the
Dow higher. Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker, rose 7 3/8

	   Prices Jump 2.7 Percent in 1999
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent last year,
the biggest increase in three years. Energy prices were largely
responsible. The Labor Department, announcing the figure, noted
that not counting energy and food, the ``core'' rate of inflation
was only to 1.9 percent last year. For December, the Consumer Price
Index, the most closely watched inflation gauge, was up 0.2
percent, less than many analysts were forecasting. last year's rise
in consumer prices included a 13.4 percent increase in energy
costs. In other economic reports today, the Commerce Department
announced that business inventories rose 0.9 percent in November,
after rising 0.3 percent in October. And the Federal Reserve said
industrial production for November was up 0.4 percent.

	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- The last batch of German mark bills went
into print today, another step in the nation's farewell to one of
the world's strongest and most successful currencies. In less than
two years, the mark will disappear when Germany and 10 other
countries introduce the new euro currency as cash on Jan. 1, 2002.
German central bank chief Ernst Welteke, who gave the go-ahead at

	   Mannesmann Argues Against Vodafone

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German telecom Mannesmann AG took its
case to shareholders today with detailed graphs and charts meant to
persuade them that going alone would generate higher stock prices
than if they sold out to British rival Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
Mannesmann's 47-page defense document was intended to demonstrate
that the German telecom company was strong enough to withstand the
biggest hostile takeover bid in history. Vodafone chief Chris Gent
described the move as ``desperate.'' He added it offered nothing
new to the debate about whether Mannesmann shareholders should
accept his company's all-stock, $137.6 billion bid. Shareholders
have until Feb. 7 to reply to the offer from Vodafone.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are drafting the rules to
spell out how consumers' personal information will be protected as
barriers between financial businesses come down. Legislation
enacted in November allows banks, investment firms and insurance
companies to get involved in each other's businesses. But it's less
widely known that the law's privacy provisions reach beyond banks,
Wall Street and insurance to a diverse panoply of ``money''
businesses. They include consumer finance companies, department
stores that issue credit cards, money transmitters and money-order
businesses, debt collection agencies, credit bureaus and
telemarketing firms that sell financial products.

	   Dow, Corning Oppose Implant Opinion
</P>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc. are asking a
federal judge to vacate an opinion by bankruptcy Judge Arthur
Spector, arguing the opinion modifies the $3.2 billion settlement
over silicone breast implants that he approved. Dow Chemical and
Corning on today filed notice with U.S. District Judge Denise Page
Hood in Detroit that they are joining a motion filed earlier by
Midland-based Dow Corning Corp. and the lawyers for thousands of
women who voted in favor of the settlement. They are asking Ms.
Hood to overturn the portion of Spector's Dec. 21 opinion that says
women who voted against the settlement could still sue Dow Chemical
and Corning if they choose. Spector said he lacked the power to
release those companies from future liability, and the settlement
wasn't designed to grant such a release anyway.

	   DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines, USAirways and 21 other carriers
will take part in an online travel business planned by United,

to a burgeoning number of travel Web sites, such as Travelocity and
Expedia. It will sell car rentals, hotel rooms and other items in
addition to airline tickets. The site also represents another way
for airlines to sell more tickets on the Internet and fewer through
travel agents, who receive commissions. The other U.S. carriers
joining the site are American Trans Air, AirTran, Hawaiian, Midwest

<HEADLINE> Former State Official Helps Arafat  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Yasser Arafat meets here next week with President
Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, he will be able to draw on the
advice of a former U.S. career diplomat with about 20 years of Mideast
experience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not unique,'' the diplomat, Edward Abington, said Friday after an
account of his lobbying job appeared in Forward, an English-language American
Jewish newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What the objective is is to work with the Palestinians in terms of their
partnership with Israel and the United States to reach a comprehensive peace,''
Abington said in an interview. ``Our efforts are aimed at promoting that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abington served 30 years in the U.S. foreign service before taking a job
recently with Bannerman and Associates, registered with the Justice Department
as a foreign agent representing the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   As consul-general, he headed the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem that deals
directly with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
	   Abington said he left the post in 1997 and was not involved in Mideast
diplomacy in his last job, as a senior official in the State Department's office
of Intelligence and Research.
</P>
<P>
	   The firm's name partner, Graeme Bannerman, was an assistant to Sen. Dick
Lugar, R-Ind., a veteran member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat is due to see Clinton next week at the White House. Barak will be in
the Washington area at the same time to resume negotiations with Syria on a
land-for-peace treaty. Alon Pinkas, an adviser to Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy, quoted Levy as saying Barak and Arafat will meet Thursday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat is seeking a state on land held by Israel and other territory already
turned over to the authority, with its capital in Jerusalem. Clinton is aiming
for the framework of an agreement by Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   A Bannerman associate, Mark Habeeb, said the firm has a $2.25 million,
three-year contract with the Palestinian Authority. Abington said the authority
was drawing on its ``own resources'' and not on U.S. assistance for the lobbying
work.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the jobs the firm does for the Palestinian Authority is to arrange
meetings on Capitol Hill for Palestinian officials and provide advice on how to
deal with Congress and the Clinton administration.

<HEADLINE> Letterman to undergo heart test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - David Letterman was undergoing a heart test Friday at an
undisclosed New York hospital to see if there is a blockage in his arteries.
<P>
	   The late night funnyman was having the test, called an angiogram, because he
has high cholesterol and heart disease in his family. With that kind of history,
Letterman spokesman Howard Rubenstein said, "he thought it prudent to do this
now as a precaution."
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital where he was having the test was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   During an angiogram, a flexible catheter is inserted into an artery and dye
is injected into it so doctors can get a clearer picture of how blood is moving
into the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "The test could result in a clean bill of health, medication or other
procedures," Rubenstein said, adding that he was not sure whether the results
would be made public.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, told guest Regis Philbin that he was having the test done
during a taping of CBS' "Late Show" program to air Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The jovial host turned momentarily serious when he asked Philbin about his
own successful emergency angioplasty at age 59 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason I'm bringing this up is that I have very high cholesterol, and I
also have a history of this," Letterman said. Letterman's father died of a heart
attack in his 50s.
</P>
<P>
	   But he was back to cracking jokes when Philbin asked him how high he
cholesterol level was and he quipped, "It's borderline. ... 680." Doctors
usually recommend people keep their cholesterol levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman also said the worst the tests could show is that it was time to
"open daddy's rib cage ... and I don't want that."
</P>
<P>
	   After the taping, Philbin said he was surprised by the news. "He sprang it
on me," Philbin said. "You never know if he's kidding or not, but it became
clear he was serious."

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Dominates Campaign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin dominated the campaign field
Friday, promising to raise wages for state workers and improve education, while
his foes registered for the presidential race they have little chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
	   Support groups for Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, ultranationalist
Vladimir Zhirinovsky and several other candidates registered with the Central
Election Commission on Friday. They are now eligible to start collecting the
necessary 500,000 signatures by Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   A group consisting of powerful regional leaders and businessmen who
nominated Putin this week has said it would gather signatures well ahead of the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin owes his popularity largely to tough handling of the war in Chechnya
and promises to restore Russia to its past glory after a decade of failed
reforms, falling living standards and widespread official corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin used the privileges of incumbency Friday, dominating nationwide
television news with his promise to raise salaries for state workers by 20
percent starting April 1. Putin promised earlier this week that pensions would
be increased by the same 20 percent, not 12 percent as earlier planned.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin also pledged to education workers Friday that the government will pour
more resources into schools and universities after years of neglect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The revival of Russia is impossible without a new look at the teacher,''
he said. ``We mustn't repeat mistakes of the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   His adversaries have been disorganized since Boris Yeltsin's abrupt
resignation Dec. 31, which made Putin acting president and moved the election to
March 26 instead of June.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown Putin attracting the support of more than 50 percent
of the electorate, with nearest rival Zyuganov registering in the teens.
</P>
<P>
	   The Union of Right Forces, a centrist group that was fourth in parliamentary
elections last month, met Friday to discuss its presidential candidate. Some
people proposed to nominate Anatoly Chubais, the architect of Russia's
privatization drive who is now head of the monopolist energy utility. But
Chubais said the group must support Putin.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Didn't Always Impress CEO  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID A. LIEB Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- As he tells the story, David Glass wasn't too
impressed by his first encounter with Wal-Mart back on a sweltering day in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass, then working for Crank Drugs, drove south from Springfield, Mo., to
Harrison, Ark., to see one of Sam Walton's first Wal-Mart discount stores.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the worst retail store I had ever seen," Glass recalls in an account
replete with memories of bursting watermelons.
</P>
<P>
	   As Wal-Mart spread through small-town America, Glass changed his mind,
accepting a job after Walton's repeated invitations and helping make Wal-Mart
the world's largest retailer.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass, 64, Friday announced he had stepped down as Wal-Mart's president and
chief executive and turned the reins over to Lee Scott, who had been expected to
move up ever since being named chief operating officer and vice chairman last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass still plans on spending at least another year with Wal-Mart as
chairman of the executive committee of its board. But he also is looking forward
to devoting more time to "a great passion" -- baseball -- with an attempt to
acquire the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
	   After Walton, who died in 1992, Glass is probably the person most directly
associated with Wal-Mart's rise to prominence. Like Walton, Glass has maintained
a relatively low public profile and has never been known for flashing his
wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass became Wal-Mart's president and CEO in 1988 and presided over the
company as it became a giant. Under Glass's leadership, Wal-Mart:
</P>
<P>
	   --Increased annual revenues from $16 billion 12 years ago to an estimated
$165 billion in revenues in the current accounting year, which ends Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   --Launched Wal-Mart Supercenters, which combines discount stores with
grocery operations, and expanded Sam's Club, its discount warehouse chain.
</P>
<P>
	   --Expanded operations into Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany,
Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Korea and the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet when Glass first visited a Wal-Mart, he didn't see how Walton -- or his
stores -- could be successful in small-town Arkansas, let alone the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sam had brought a couple of trucks of watermelons in and stacked them on
the sidewalk," Glass recalls in a story now preserved in Walton's autobiography
and in a video at the company's Bentonville visitor center. "He had a donkey
ride out in the parking lot. It was about 115 degrees, and the watermelons began
to pop, and the donkey began to do what donkeys do, and it all mixed together
and ran all over the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
	   "And when you went inside the store, the mess just continued, having been
tracked in all over the floor," Glass says. "He was a nice fellow, but I wrote
him off. It was just terrible."
</P>
<P>
	   Glass remained in the discount drug business in Missouri until 1976, when he
finally agreed to join Walton's now-growing business.
</P>
<P>
	   Years later, when Glass was Wal-Mart's president, he dressed up in overalls
and straw hat and rode a donkey around the parking lot at the Harrison store,
which he had once abhorred, according to Walton's autobiography, "Made In
America."
</P>
<P>
	   Walton also wrote that Glass deserves most of the credit for developing
Wal-Mart's automated distribution system -- linking stores and suppliers
together by computers as early as 1978.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides leading Wal-Mart, Glass also has served as chairman and CEO of the
Kansas City Royals since owner Ewing Kauffman died in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass on Friday repeated his previously announced plans to buy the team. But
he insisted that his love of the sport was unrelated to his decision to step
down at Wal-Mart, which he said was "consistent with a succession plan that has
been in place for several years."

<HEADLINE> High Court Takes on Gays in Scouts  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide whether the Boy
Scouts of America can exclude homosexuals as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will review a ruling in which New Jersey's highest
court said the organization unlawfully ousted a young man, James Dale, after
learning he is gay. Their decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The state court ruled last summer that the Boy Scouts' denial of membership
to homosexual boys and leaders violated a New Jersey law banning discrimination
in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the Boy Scouts told the justices that the state court's ruling
``endangers important constitutional principles of freedom of speech and freedom
of association.''
</P>
<P>
	   At stake, they said, are ``constitutional rights at the heart of our free
society: the freedom of a private, voluntary, noncommercial organization to
create and interpret its own moral code, and to choose leaders and define
membership criteria accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
	   But lawyers for Dale said there is ``no evidence'' to support the Boy
Scouts' contention ``that preventing it from discriminating against its gay
members would in any way alter or burden the messages, purposes and values that
bring Scouting's diverse members together.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Weighs Partial Birth  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today set the stage for its most
important abortion ruling in recent years, agreeing to decide whether states may
ban a surgical procedure opponents call ``partial birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices voted to review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for doctors
to perform such abortions. A federal appeals court struck down that law, calling
it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly identical laws have been enacted by 30 states, but courts have
blocked enforcement of most of them.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after the Nebraska law was invalidated along with laws in Iowa and
Arkansas, nearly identical abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin were upheld
by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   That created a direct conflict legal experts predicted would force the
Supreme Court to re-enter the legal, political and moral storm it created by
ruling in 1973 that women have a constitutional right to abortion. The justices
reaffirmed that core right in 1992, their last major abortion ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the current controversy swirls around a specific procedure,
abortion-rights activists contend far more may be at stake. They say the court's
eventual decision could broadly safeguard -- or dramatically erode -- abortion
rights, depending on what state legislatures are allowed to consider when
passing laws to regulate abortions.

<HEADLINE> Studios Unaware of Anti-Drug Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The bosses of several studios that produce
prime-time TV shows said Friday they were angry that the networks had been
working with President Clinton's drug policy adviser to insert anti-drug
messages in programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Five studio heads, responsible for shows like "ER," "The Drew Carey Show"
and "The Simpsons," all said they were unaware the networks were offered
financial incentives by the government if certain programs preached against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's appalling," said Gail Berman, president of Regency Television,
which makes "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Roswell." "It's inappropriate for
government to participate in this way in the production of television."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's drug advisers said they had consulted with "ER" writers, and even
said they believed a recent episode in which a teen-ager came into the emergency
room suffering from alcohol abuse was a result of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers Television, said neither he nor
"ER" producer John Wells was aware of the government's efforts. Roth said he
would never demand his producers or writers reflect a particular point of view
on a social issue, even if there were a financial benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials denied they were trying to rob TV networks of creative
freedom through the policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The government spends millions of dollars each year to buy ads on network TV
for anti-drug public service announcements. Recently, it has been forfeiting
some of the time it had bought if the networks could prove they inserted
anti-drug messages into programs. That enables the networks to make more money
by selling ad time to other clients.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and the WB have all acknowledged letting the White House
press office review the scripts of some of their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton's spokesman on Friday said he'd like all elements of
popular culture to join the effort to send a strong message about the dangers of
drugs, especially to children.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no element of trying to dictate or infringe on any creative
process," Joe Lockhart said. "We just think it's important to get the anti-drug
message out in as many ways as we can."
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Clinton's drug office were in Pasadena on Friday to release a
study that concludes television generally does better than movies or music when
it comes to depicting drug, alcohol and tobacco use responsibly. The study
encompassed a period in which the officials were quietly working with the
networks to get their message across.
</P>
<P>
	   David Kissinger, president of Studio USA, who oversees production of "Law &AMP;
Order" and "Xena: Warrior Princess," said he believed the cooperation between
the government and networks is both wrong and destined to be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way for television shows to reflect values the society regards as
important is for the producers to actually care about them and not for the
government to impose it on them," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Newman, president of 20th Century Fox and responsible for "The
Simpsons" and "Ally McBeal," said he was unaware of the government's efforts and
opposed to them, as did Steve McPherson, executive vice president of Touchstone
Television, which produces "Sports Night" and "Felicity."

<HEADLINE> More Kids To Get Free Breakfasts  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government thinks fewer middle-class kids would skip
breakfast if schools provided it to all students free, and it's looking for some
schools willing to try the idea at federal expense.
</P>
<P>
	   The schools and students will be studied for three years to see how well
youngsters participate in the program and to track the impact on academic
performance and behavior -- preliminary studies indicate grades improve when
children eat breakfast. Most schools already offer students federally subsidized
breakfast, but only poor children get it free or at a reduced price.
</P>
<P>
	   On any given day, an estimated 15 percent of children don't eat breakfast,
including 8 percent of those in elementary schools, an Agriculture Department
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many children come to school without food, regardless of their income,
regardless of the makeup of the family,'' said Shirley Watkins, the Agriculture
Department's undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're in a different environment in this country now with single-parent
families, or you have two parents working and leaving home early and children
are left alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department is hoping to get six school districts with varied
demographics to volunteer for the $13 million pilot program, which would begin
next fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the government should leave it to parents to make sure their
children eat, especially those who can afford it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Kids need diapers ... but that doesn't mean there should be a federal
diaper program,'' said Darcy Olsen, who studies education issues for the Cato
Institute, a libertarian think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, 7.4 million children eat federally subsidized breakfasts each
day in 71,000 schools, about two-thirds of the public schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   The typical school breakfast consists of cereal, milk, juice and toast. A
few schools offer something hot, like a biscuit sandwich or French toast sticks.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislation has been introduced in Congress to offer free breakfasts to all
students at an estimated cost to taxpayers of about $400 million a year. The
Agriculture Department considered a similar proposal but decided instead to
pursue the pilot project, which Congress approved last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters say children would be more likely to eat breakfast at school than
at home if their friends were eating it, too. They also say the change would
remove the stigma attached to a program now used primarily by poor children.
</P>
<P>
	   Studies have shown that providing breakfast at school improves academic
performance, at least among poor students. Ongoing research in inner city
Philadelphia and Baltimore by Harvard University has found that math grades rise
from an average of C to B six months after children start eating breakfast
regularly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ideal is for every child to have a breakfast meal at home with their
parents before going to school, but that's not the way our world operates these
days,'' said Phyllis Griffith, food service director for the Columbus, Ohio,
schools and president of the American School Food Service Association. ``We need
to address life as it is and the nutritional needs of kids as they exist.''
</P>
<P>
	   The school system in Prince George's County, Md., is considering whether to
apply for the federal pilot program. Last year, one of its elementary schools
participated in a similar state-run project that lasted four months.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 300 of the school's 700 students took the breakfasts -- typically
cereal, a muffin or yogurt -- compared with the 100 who usually got the
federally subsidized meal.
</P>
<P>
	   Some parents objected, saying they wanted their children to continue eating
at home. And a few teachers complained about the trash it created and the time
it took; the meals were served in the classroom after the regular school day
began.
</P>
<P>
	   About 19,000 of the district's 129,000 students now eat breakfast at school.
``There are a lot of kids who aren't eating at all,'' said Karen Haghighi, the
district's food service director.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 107.35; Nasdaq Up 99.82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, boosted by a strong
earnings report from high-tech bellwether Intel and comments from Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that indicate interest rates will be rising only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the most closely-watched market indicators were in record high
territory, although they had dipped from earlier gains. With an hour remaining
in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 107.35
to 11,689.78. The Nasdaq composite index rose 99.82 to 4,057.03.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 11.15 to 1,460.83, just shy of record
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, which announced better than expected earnings late Thursday on a
surge in PC sales, drove the Dow higher. Intel, the world's leading computer
chip maker, rose 12 11/16 to 103 3/4 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's strong report and optimistic outlook lifted rival chip maker
Applied Materials 10 9/16 to 135 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a speech by Greenspan Thursday night, Wall Street seems to be
feeling more confident that the Fed is likely to raise rates no more than a
quarter-percentage point at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on
Feb. 1-2. Although rate increases are usually troublesome, market watchers said
they were impressed that Greenspan indicated he won't let inflation get in the
way of a surging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has demonstrated that he understands the world has changed and
that he doesn't intend to do anything scary to the market," said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities."We are comfortable
with Greenspan's comments because it shows he is not behind the curve, and won't
let inflation raise its mighty head."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest economic data released today once again showed inflation remains
under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in December,
slightly below forecasts. Excluding energy prices, the gain was just 0.1
percent. The report was the latest confirmation that fears about accelerating
inflation remain unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's financial stocks rose following the report. American Express was
up 4 7/16 to 160 7/16 and J.P. Morgan gained 4 3/4 to 127 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Optimism about earnings extended beyond the technology sector. Lands' End
rose 4 5/16 to 39 3/16 after a Wall Street analysts noted that in spite of
slumping sales in the eight-week holiday shopping season, profits improved.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent Technologies declined 3 5/8 to 52 3/8 in heavy trading amid rumors
that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company's
accounting practices. Lucent officials said they were unaware of any
investigation and the SEC would not confirm or deny an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 871.60 million shares, well ahead of
Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.71 to 506.90.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Star's Arrest Causes Furor  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Gloria Trevi was always outrageous. As a pop star, she
sometimes rocketed to the front pages of newspapers with her sexual audacity and
promises to run for president.
</P>
<P>
	   But nothing in her career dominated Mexican news as much as her arrest this
week in Brazil on charges that turned her public image on its head: the rebel
singer portrayed as a submissive celebrity cat's-paw for a manager accused of
preying on underage girls.
</P>
<P>
	   Television networks broke into other programming Thursday and Friday to
broadcast live updates from Brazil. Some showed Trevi blowing a kiss to the
cameras as police took her away, others repeatedly aired old clips of shows in
which she summoned young men from the audience and stripped them to their
underwear.
</P>
<P>
	   The story knocked the ruling party's presidential contender off the front
page of leading newspapers Friday even though he formally registered his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Behind Bars!'' declared the leftist daily La Jornada over a large file
photo of a nearly nude Trevi in a baby crib.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevi, manager Sergio Andrade and another entertainer, Maria Raquenel
Portillo, were arrested in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday near the Copacabana beach.
</P>
<P>
	   Chihuahua state prosecutors accuse them of corrupting Karina Yapor, 17,
whose parents had turned her over to Andrade's care at age 12 for musical
training -- allegedly at Trevi's behest. Karina abandoned a baby in Spain in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in the Yapors' home state of Chihuahua, along the Texas border,
say the three face charges of abduction and statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
	   Rio police spokeswoman Luciene Silva said all three denied the charges. They
were being held while Brazil studies an extradition request, which could take
months.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevi, whose full name is Gloria de los Angeles Trevino Ruiz, probably was
Mexico's most famous pop star in the early 1990s, her appeal ranging from the
cheesy to the cerebral.
</P>
<P>
	   Teen-age girls helped make her anthems of youthful frustration national
hits, and flocked to see her films. Teen-age boys and middle-aged mechanics
collected her yearly nude calendars, which showed her posing as a presidential
candidate or Olympic athlete.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading intellectuals wrote essays acclaiming her calls for sexual
liberation. She denounced social hypocrisy and spoke of running for president
someday.
</P>
<P>
	   But in April 1998, Andrade's ex-wife Aline Hernandez published a book that
accused Trevi of luring her into Andrade's care -- and his bed -- before he
married her when she was 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrade's friends said he kept tight discipline over his troupe of girl
entertainers-in-training. Hernandez and others described it as a cult-like power
that sometimes veered into sex.
</P>
<P>
	   Hernandez filed a 1998 criminal complaint in Mexico City but no charges were
filed. Trevi appeared before prosecutors and on television to deny the claims,
accusing Hernandez of lying to promote her own television career.
</P>
<P>
	   But other women began telling similar stories -- some to reporters, some in
court affidavits.
</P>
<P>
	   After the news that Yapor's baby had been found at a Spanish orphanage,
Trevi dropped out of sight -- but not out of the news.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexican media reported that she had been spotted in Los Angeles, Las Vegas,
Texas, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, Chihuahua state officials said Trevi and Andrade were wanted for
questioning. By November, a judge had issued arrest warrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Yapor turned up in Mexico City on Dec. 15, denying that she had been abused
by Andrade or Trevi but giving a confused version of why she abandoned her baby
and insisting the child was not Andrade's.
</P>
<P>
	   Family attorneys say Yapor is undergoing psychological therapy. Prosecutors
suggested Friday they might seek DNA samples from Andrade to determine if he is
the child's father.

<HEADLINE> Schiffer pleads guilty in officer's killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A Pennsylvania man pleaded guilty to felony
murder Friday in the 1958 shooting death of a Rahway police officer and agreed
to testify against his cousin.
<P>
	   Under sentencing guidelines from 1958, Theodore Schiffer of Blakeley, Pa.
could serve less than three years under a plea agreement reached with Union
County prosecutors. The plea also calls for Schiffer, 61, to serve his sentence
at Lackawanna County Jail in Scranton, Pa.
</P>
<P>
	   The carpet installer was charged last summer with the murder of Charles
Bernoskie, a 30-year-old father of six who was shot three times while trying to
stop two men from robbing a a Rahway car dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer's cousin, Robert Zarinsky, was charged last month with the Nov. 28,
1958, killing. Zarinsky, who is serving a 98-year prison term for the 1969
murder of a 17-year-old girl, is suspected of killing four other women in
central New Jersey from 1969-1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer's lawyer, Joseph D'Andrea, said his client never told anyone about
the murder.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was terrified of his cousin," D'Andrea said.
</P>
<P>
	   In court, Schiffer told Superior Court Judge John Triarsi that he was
breaking into the dealership and ran when he heard someone behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   "After I started running, I heard shots fired," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, officers had little more than the statements of two witnesses in
the Bernoskie killing, and fingerprints from the scene. The witnesses are now
dead.
</P>
<P>
	   But an affidavit provided by Judith Sapsa, Zarinsky's sister, last summer,
implicated Schiffer and Zarinsky. Authorities later matched Schiffer's
fingerprints to the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Sapsa said in an affidavit that Schiffer and Zarinsky came to her home with
gunshot wounds on the night Bernoskie was shot, and watched as her mother
removed a bullet from Zarinsky's buttocks. Zarinsky said at the time that he
shot Bernoskie after the officer shot Schiffer, according to Sapsa's affidavit.
</P>
<P>
	   Police also found a scar on Schiffer's chest where Sapsa said a bullet had
been removed, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Glaxo, SmithKline Renew Talks  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceutical heavyweights Glaxo Wellcome PLC and
SmithKline Beecham PLC said Friday that they've resumed merger talks. If
successful, a union between them would create the world's largest drugmaker.
</P>
<P>
	   The renewal of talks, which collapsed two years ago over differences between
their top executives, highlights the pressure that even the biggest
pharmaceutical firms are under to consolidate with industry rivals as a way to
afford the rising costs of developing and selling new medicines.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came just a day after Pfizer Inc. emerged as the likely
winner in the battle for U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co. Bowing to pressure
from its investors, Warner-Lambert management said they would negotiate a buyout
from Pfizer, backing away from a previously announced merger deal with American
Home Products Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham confirmed that were "in discussions
which may or may not lead to a merger of equals." They refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo's strength lies in its top anti-migraine drug, Imitrex, and in
treatments for asthma and viral infections including HIV.
</P>
<P>
	   SmithKline's top products include the antibiotic Augmentin, the
antidepressant Paxil and a new diabetes drug, Avandia. It also has a strong
vaccines business.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the merger would involve Glaxo buying SmithKline in a stock
deal. Glaxo has a market capitalization of $101.0 billion and SmithKline has a
$71 billion market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the merger makes a great deal of sense," said Anthea Gaukroger, an
industry analyst at London-based brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
	   The two companies have complementary drug portfolios and could save as much
as $2.4 billion in costs on overlapping operations, she said. A merger would let
them pool their research and development funds and would give the merged company
a bigger sales and marketing force.
</P>
<P>
	   "It gives them the opportunity to do more and better on a global scale,"
said Martyn Postle of Cambridge Pharma Consultancy.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts predicted that a merger could occur within a week.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement sent their U.S. shares surging on the New York Stock
Exchange. Glaxo rose $2.25 to $60.25, while SmithKline rose $3 to $69.75.
</P>
<P>
	   Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of the combined company would total $17.8
billion, based on 1998 annual figures. That would surpass the $15.9 billion in
sales of a combined Pfizer-Warner-Lambert.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the British firms were able to start a new round of merger
talks following the announcement in December that SmithKline Beecham chief
executive Jan Leschly plans to resign by April. Leschly's inability to agree
with Glaxo Wellcome chairman Sir Richard Sykes was seen as the main reason for
the suspension of earlier negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's most likely to go ahead this time. The big stumbling block was
management. I think we've gotten over that with the retirement of Jan Leschly,"
said Susan Haylock of Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   If the firms merge, analysts suggested that Sykes would take over as
chairman of the new entity, with Leschly's deputy, Jean-Pierre Garnier, becoming
its chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham have long pondered a merger, but
Pfizer's apparent success in mounting a hostile bid for Warner-Lambert has given
new impetus to such a deal.
</P>
<P>
	   "That just intensifies the pressure on everyone in the industry to find
critical mass," Haylock said.
</P>
<P>
	   Other mergers and takeovers are likely to follow, with Novartis,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Roche and American Home Products all seen as
candidates for consolidation.
</P>
<P>
	   If Glaxo Wellcome merges with SmithKline Beecham, it would have just 7.5
percent share of the global pharmaceutical market. Pfizer, if it buys out
Warner-Lambert, would have a 6 percent share.
</P>
<P>
	   To merge, the companies would need the approval of the Federal Trade
Commission and European Union.

<HEADLINE> Drug Execs May Seek Medicare Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged drugmakers today to back up with
deeds a new promise to cooperate on designing a Medicare prescription benefit
for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's news that the drug companies say they are ready to work with us on
providing affordable optional drug coverage and making sure older people have
access to the highest quality medications developed is a very good first step,"
Clinton said. "Now what we need is positive actions from the drug companies and
positive action in Congress."
</P>
<P>
	   Drug industry leaders told the Clinton administration this week that they
want to put aside a dispute over drug prices to try to work out a compromise on
a Medicare drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no indication that the companies were going to change their
fundamental position, which has been to support improved drug coverage for the
elderly through the private sector, not directly from the government. The
industry has been worried that a government-run program could lead to price
controls.
</P>
<P>
	   However, at a White House meeting Wednesday afternoon, drug industry leaders
told administration officials for the first time that they would be willing to
support drug-coverage legislation separate from a comprehensive Medicare
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, they had said they could support the addition of drug coverage
to Medicare only as part of a wholesale redesign of the program in which more
senior citizens would get all of their health care through private health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "If that broad legislation were not able to be achieved this year, we would
support federal legislation that would provide expanded drug coverage for
seniors as a step toward the overall comprehensive modernization of the Medicare
program," said Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, who participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has proposed having the government run a Medicare drug benefit by
contracting with the same drug-purchasing management firms used by many private
health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to have very serious concerns ... about the president's plan,"
said Holmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry leaders have pledged, however, to tone down negative rhetoric
against the administration proposal -- including now-famous commercials
featuring an elderly woman named Flo, who insists on keeping the government "out
of my medicine cabinet."
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of our advocacy, including any advertising we might be involved
in, we intend to be very positive and constructive in our support of bipartisan
solutions," said Holmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Also attending the White House meeting, first reported by The New York
Times, was Gordon M. Binder, chairman of both the drug-maker Amgen and the
industry association; Clinton's top economic adviser, Gene Sperling; and White
House health policy adviser Chris Jennings.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to cover drug costs for patients who are not in hospitals is
considered a serious gap in Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   There is growing concern that senior citizens are being left behind as more
new drugs to treat diseases of aging are introduced, but prescription costs are
rising by more than 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic lawmakers and presidential candidates, including Vice President
Al Gore, are pushing to make prescription drugs a top issue in the 2000
elections and Clinton is expected to feature the issue in his State of the Union
Address, scheduled Jan. 27.

<P>
	   Democratic polling has shown that Americans of all ages are concerned about
rising drug prices, and Clinton has expressed anger at the hard line drug
companies were taking against his proposal and the negative tone of their
advertising. He has promised a government study of drug pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders have said they support helping the elderly pay for drugs
but don't want to displace the private coverage some now have through retirement
benefits or HMOs. They have promised hearings in Congress this year.

<HEADLINE> Missile Defense Test Had Problems  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon acknowledged Friday that an October test of
a critical part of a national missile defense system encountered more technical
problems than officials initially revealed.
</P>
<P>
	   A prototype missile interceptor, thrust into space aboard a two-stage
booster rocket, hit and destroyed its target in space. It did it, however, only
after putting its ``cross hairs'' on a large decoy balloon, said a senior
military officer involved in the test, who briefed reporters about the results
on condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   The balloon was there to replicate the kind of ``countermeasures'' a hostile
nation might use to confuse an American anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
	   The interceptor, known as a ``kill vehicle'' and manufactured by Raytheon
Corp., also was unable to navigate using the stars because an incorrect star map
was loaded into the interceptor's onboard computer, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   These problems, not mentioned when the Pentagon declared the test a success
Oct. 2, were first reported Friday by The New York Times. The Pentagon said it
did not disclose the problems at the time because it did not consider them
significant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had some problems, challenges, anomalies, and it worked in spite of
those,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   It remains unclear, he said, why the target, a mock warhead deployed from a
Minuteman missile launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., suddenly came
into the interceptor's field of view at the last second. If it had not, the
interceptor would have rammed itself into the balloon instead, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   A few minutes after the ``kill vehicle'' separated from its rocket booster
about 1,400 miles from the target it spotted the balloon and recognized that it
was not the target. It then searched for the target but could not find it, the
officer said. With time running out, it refocused on the balloon and was
preparing to ram it when suddenly the target appeared. It then turned its
attention to the target and rammed it.
</P>
<P>
	   The kill vehicle took aim at the balloon, even though it previously
recognized it as an incorrect target, because after failing to find the target,
the logic of its on-board computer told it, ``I'm a kill vehicle; I'm going to
kill something,'' the officer said.
</P>
<P>
	   A prime objective of the October flight test was to see if the kill vehicle
would distinguish between the balloon and the target.
</P>
<P>
	   In a second test of the anti-missile system, scheduled for Tuesday, the
``kill vehicle'' will be programmed to search a wider area in space to find the
target, in hopes that the same problem is not repeated, the official said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tuesday's test also will use a prototype X-band radar on Kwajalein Atoll in
the central Pacific to help the interceptor understand where in space to look
for the target.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen, said Friday
that the Pentagon still intends to make a recommendation to President Clinton
this summer on whether to commit to deploying an anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
	   Other officials said Clinton will have to make the decision no later than
September to allow the Pentagon is to keep its current timetable for building
the system in Alaska by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Aid Would Boost Military  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will have a
hard time convincing Colombians that a massive new U.S. aid plan is solely aimed
at fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in this South American nation see the two-year, $1.3 billion proposal,
which Albright was promoting Friday in the port city of Cartagena, as a weapon
to be turned on leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a scam that everybody accepts,'' said former national security
adviser Alfredo Rangel. ``This aid -- ostensibly for fighting narcotics -- is
really destined for the counterinsurgency war.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the package includes funds for economic development, Colombia's
military would get most of the aid, which must still be approved by the U.S.
Congress. The package would include attack helicopters, training and equipment
for two new army battalions whose job will be to retake rebel-dominated southern
jungles so anti-narcotics operations can proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocaine production in the south is exploding thanks to an alliance between
drug traffickers and the entrenched Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC. The guerrillas control about a third of the nation, earning huge payoffs
from protecting traffickers' operations and taxing peasants who grow illegal
drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Colombians believe it's ridiculous to say the aid is for fighting
drugs, not the rebels, given the blurred line between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who believes Madeleine Albright?'' columnist Luis Canon wrote in the
Bogota daily El Espectador. ``Nobody, of course, because the whole country knows
that the south is in the hands of the FARC.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Colombians, however, believe the U.S. aid could help rescue their
country. When asked in recent polls if they favored a U.S. military invasion to
stop the FARC, more than half said they would, if peace talks failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombians are fed up with crime, violence and the world's highest
kidnapping rate linked largely to a 35-year-long civil war that has killed more
than 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   President Andres Pastrana is embracing the aid package, calling it a vote of
confidence for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   When he took office 17 months ago, Pastrana had a far different approach to
stemming the drug trade. He pushed for peace talks and played down military
interdiction in favor of providing alternatives to illegal crops.
</P>
<P>
	   But peace negotiations, which continued Friday with a meeting in the
southern town of San Vicente del Caguan, have moved slowly. Fighting between
rebels and security troops has been intensifying, and drug production is up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government presents this as if the United States loves us,'' said
political commentator Jose Luis Ramirez. ``But the truth is that we're getting
this money because the situation is so serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   With guerrillas failing to reciprocate Pastrana's peace concessions, helping
Colombia defend itself has taken on new urgency in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If this assistance that's intended for anti-narcotics can help impress
upon the guerrillas to stop fooling around and negotiate seriously, that's all
for the better,'' said Myles Frechette, a former ambassador to Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   International human rights groups oppose the aid package, worried about
granting new tools to the Colombian military -- a force long accused of backing
violent rightist militia groups.
</P>
<P>
	   While the proposal does include $145 million to help growers switch to legal
crops, Rangel foresees violent clashes between the new army battalions and
peasants trying to protect their livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   David Rojas, a 23-year-old architecture student, worries there could be
strings attached to such a large donation from Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This isn't humanitarian aid for Colombia,'' he said. ``They'll find a way
to charge us for it.''

<HEADLINE> Unrest Feared in Chile Election  </HEADLINE>
   By EDUARDO GALLARDO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Authorities on Friday urged both presidential
candidates to await final official elections returns before claiming victory, in
the fear that extremely close results in Sunday's vote could trigger unrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservative contender Joaquin Lavin and socialist Ricardo Lagos agreed not
to announce internal polling results Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said they were worried that supporters might still take to the
streets in celebration if their side appears ahead -- only to see the situation
reverse later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I urge everybody to act with extreme caution, not to make announcements
based on partial information,'' said Gen. Sergio Candia, who is in charge of
election security. ``A premature victory announcement could later result in
frustration and tension.''
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign closed at midnight Thursday amid sporadic violence that left 29
people injured, three seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   Lavin and Lagos battled to virtual draw in the first round Dec. 12: Lagos
received 47.9 percent of the vote and Lavin received 47.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The two latest polls showed the race remains tight.
</P>
<P>
	   The winner will be inaugurated March 11 for a six-year term, succeeding
Eduardo Frei, a Christian Democrat who was constitutionally barred from
re-election.

<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures increased sharply Friday for a third
straight day on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by forecasts for extreme heat
and dryness in key growing regions of South America next week. Grains were
mixed. Meteorologists said temperatures will top 100 degrees Fahrenheit at
mid-week in southern Brazil and northern Argentina, further threatening a crop
that is facing drought damage. Soybeans closed in the on the $5-a-bushel mark
for the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat prices rose to nine-week highs before giving up some of their gains in
profit-taking ahead of the three-day weekend. Drought concerns involving the
winter wheat crop provided support.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Letterman To Undergo Heart Test  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- "Late Show" host David Letterman was to undergo a heart
test Friday to determine if he has a blockage in his arteries.
</P>
<P>
	   The 52-year-old funnyman scheduled an angiogram at an undisclosed hospital
because of what he said was his high cholesterol and a history of heart disease
in his family.
</P>
<P>
	   During an angiogram, a flexible tube is inserted into an artery and dye is
injected so doctors can get a picture of how blood is moving into the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   "He thought it prudent to do this now as a precaution," said his spokesman,
Howard Rubenstein.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman disclosed he was going to have the procedure during a taping of
the CBS program with guest Regis Philbin. The segment was to air Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The host turned momentarily serious when he asked Philbin about his own
successful emergency angioplasty at age 59 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason I'm bringing this up is that I have very high cholesterol, and I
also have a history of this," said Letterman, whose father died of a heart
attack in his 50s.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman returned to jokes when Philbin asked him how high the cholesterol
level was.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's borderline ... 680," Letterman wisecracked. Doctors usually recommend
people keep their cholesterol levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman said the worst-case scenario would be to "open Daddy's rib cage
... and I don't want that."
</P>
<P>
	   After the taping, Philbin said he was surprised by the news.
</P>
<P>
	   "He sprang it on me," Philbin said. "You never know if he's kidding or not,
but it became clear he was serious."

<HEADLINE> Winter arrives in New York City area with an icy jolt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Lulled by a relatively balmy December and early January,
the icy cold jolted New Yorkers on Friday as temperatures hovered in the teens
and the wind chill plummeted as low as 25 degrees below zero.
<P>
	   "Even the money is cold," Charles Masur, 28, said at an ATM machine in White
Plains. "You can't wear enough to be warm when the wind's like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Some school districts in the northern suburbs opened up to two hours late.
And in Sullivan County, Monticello schools were closed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Long Island, two duck hunters had a close call when they were rescued
from Oyster Bay. One of the men was submerged up to his waist in the icy cold
mud. Both were treated for exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City also was on a cold weather alert.
</P>
<P>
	   "Up to last night we were averaging 11 degrees above normal for the month,"
said meteorologist Scott Reynolds of the National Weather Service. "Today we'll
take a little bite out of that, I suspect."
</P>
<P>
	   Shelters and soup kitchens braced for the worst.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coalition for the Homeless was giving hot meals and blankets to hundreds
of people on the streets and urging them to go to shelters.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it gets this cold it's a matter of life and death," said Patrick
Markee, senior policy analyst for the coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   "On nights like this we see literally hundreds of men pouring into
shelters," said Markee. He said that on Thursday night, some men waited hours to
get into a shelter.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Hossein Saadat, executive director of St. John's Bread and Life soup
kitchen in Brooklyn: "When it's cold like this people tend to stay longer than
usual. The challenge is finding space for so many people. We don't have the
heart to tell them to leave, so we just have to manage."
</P>
<P>
	   He said people began seeking warmth at the kitchen at 7:30 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   David Billig, a spokesman for the Emergency Medical Service, said that on
Thursday, "we had five calls directly attributed to cold weather - hypothermia,
frostnip and frostbite." More calls were coming in Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Billig said people who have to work in the street, such as EMTs, paramedics,
firefighters, police officers and work crews, are most in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you don't need to be outside, stay inside," he said, and for those who
have to go out, he stressed the importance of layered clothing with a waterproof
outer layer. He said people should avoid smoking and alcohol, and should be sure
to wear gloves and a hat.
</P>
<P>
	   Waiting for a city subway to get to her first day on the job as a clerical
worker, 31-year-old Aida Rios of the Bronx said she felt frozen despite her
heavy coat and scarf.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been warm and now all of a sudden it is so cold," she said. "I was
forced to be outside in this weather. I felt like I was in a freezer."
</P>
<P>
	   Back in White Plains, Jan Pferd of Goteborg, Sweden, said the weather
reminded him of home. But "that doesn't mean I like it. I think the wind will
bowl me over."

<HEADLINE> College students honor Martin Luther King with a day of community  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Students and faculty at Camden County College are
skipping the speeches this year to honor the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and
instead are paying tribute to the slain civil rights leader by serving the
community.
<P>
	   After a breakfast and kickoff rally, they braved the bitter cold to
volunteer their services to Habitat for Humanity, which is rehabilitating
rowhouses in downtown Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good thing to do. I think we should do something like this every
year," said student Pat Seidman, 52, of Westmont. "We're a community college;
it's our obligation."
</P>
<P>
	   College President Phyllis DellaVecchia said the community service project
was inspired by a speech by Coretta Scott King gave at the college last year at
a tribute honoring her late husband.
</P>
<P>
	   "She said, 'Go out and serve,"' said DellaVecchia. "So, it's the service
that we're concentrating on. We're trying to keep that legacy alive. There's no
speeches this year."
</P>
<P>
	   About 20 students and school officials worked side-by-side hauling debris
from behind a gutted out rowhouse to a Dumpster at the curb. After only several
hours, the Dumpster was nearly half-full.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great opportunity to get involved. It makes me feel good, doing
something to help somebody," said Sharon Yancey, an administrative assistant at
the college. Her matching purple coat and hat were sullied with dirt stains.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the temperature dipping to below freezing and a brisk wind making it
feel even colder, the volunteers cheerfully carried nail-studded boards, sticks
and bags of trash from a lot behind the rowhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sorry to say the cold isn't bothering me a bit," said student Jane
Byrne, 38, of Magnolia, an elementary education major. "I love it. I'm
personally very happy to be able to participate in making the community better."
</P>
<P>
	   The activity drew attention from residents in the historic Cooper Plaza
neighborhood. Some watched the cleanup from their doorways and passers-by paused
to gawk.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm glad to see progress being made," said James Mosely, a retired history
teacher who lives across the street from the work site. "I just hope it happens
in as many places as possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Teams of volunteers from the college will return to the site on Monday, the
national holiday in honor of King's birthday. King, 39, was assassinated on
April 4, 1968 in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's an excellent way to mark the Martin Luther King holiday," said
Jane-Ellen Miller, the college's executive director of information technology.
"The major thing is that we continue this, that it's not a one-day thing."
</P>
<P>
	   DellaVecchia said teams of volunteers will continue working on the projects
for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The volunteers were scheduled to help paint a rowhouse on Clinton Street
Friday, but the cold weather forced officials to scrap those plans. The
volunteer labor, nevertheless, was welcomed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We depend heavily on the volunteers," said Joe Mannion, construction
manager for Habitat for Humanity. "We're getting a lot of work done."

<HEADLINE> First Union Meets Expectations  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NOWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at First Union Corp. fell 15
percent compared to the same quarter in 1998, though the bank met Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's sixth-largest bank reported operating earnings of $846 million
in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared to $993 million in the last quarter
of 1998. Per-share profit -- excluding merger-related and restructuring charges
-- dipped to 86 cents, which was in line with the estimate of analysts surveyed
by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings per share were $1 in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   For 1999, the bank reported operating net income of $3.48 billion, or $3.60
a share, compared to $3.69 billion, or $3.77 a share, for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Charlotte-based banking company said net income for the year included
nonrecurring gains of 20 cents a share related to the sale of its interest in
Electronic Payment Services Inc. and the sale of factoring assets. Excluding the
one-time gains, earnings amounted to $3.3 billion, or $3.40 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of 1999, First Union had assets of $253 billion and stockholders'
equity of $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   First Union's earnings were down throughout 1999 as the company has
struggled to deal with tripling its size in recent years through acquisitions
such as CoreStates Financial Corp. of Philadelphia and The Money Store.
</P>
<P>
	   First Union lost 20 percent of CoreStates' 2 million customers since First
Union completed the acquisition in April 1998. Many of the customers said they
were frustrated with the bank's handling of basic services as well as the bank's
lack of commitment to lending to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   First Union provides banking services to 16 million retail and corporate
customers throughout the East Coast and the nation. The company operates
full-service banking offices in 12 East Coast states and the District of
Columbia and full-service brokerage offices in 41 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of First Union were trading at $34.81 3/4, up 81 3/4 cents, on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Justices To Review Davidians Appeal  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to review an appeal in
which five Branch Davidians challenged the sentences they got for using firearms
during a gun battle that began the 1993 standoff at the cult's compound near
Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said it will hear the Davidians' argument that they could not be
given longer sentences for using machine guns, rather than some other kind of
firearms, because a jury never decided what type of weapons were used.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Four federal agents and three Davidians were killed during the Feb. 28,
1993, shootout that started when federal agents tried to arrest cult leader
David Koresh. Fifty-one days later, Koresh and 74 followers died in a fire after
agents injected tear gas in the building. Nine Davidians who escaped were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   After a trial, Jaime Castillo, Brad Eugene Branch, Renos Lenny Avraam and
Kevin A. Whitecliff were sentenced to consecutive terms of 10 years in prison
for manslaughter and 30 years for using machine guns during a violent crime.
Graeme Leonard Craddock was sentenced to 10 years for using a grenade and a
consecutive 10 years for using a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The firearm law set a five-year sentence but allowed a 10-year term if the
weapon was a semiautomatic firearm and a 30-year term for use of a machine gun
or grenade.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury was not asked to decide what type of firearm was used. The judge
made that determination during sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   The five Davidians challenged the firearm sentences, saying the type of
weapon should be considered an element of the offense that must be submitted to
the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them, saying the type of
weapon need not be decided by the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on today, the Davidians' lawyers said the firearm law's
sentence-enhancing provision was similar to one in the federal carjacking law
allowing longer sentences in cases of serious injury. Last year, the Supreme
Court decided the serious-injury issue was an element of the carjacking crime
that must be submitted to the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyers acknowledged that federal appeals courts had
differed on the firearm law. But they added the law has been revised to clarify
that the type of weapon was a sentencing issue and need not be decided by the
jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Castillo vs. U.S., 99-658.

<HEADLINE> New CEO for Wal-Mart  </HEADLINE>
    By KRISTEN EVERETT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lee Scott survived a stormy apprenticeship with
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. more than 20 years ago to work his way up to the top
management post at the world's leading retailer.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott, 50, on Friday succeeded David Glass, 64, who stepped down as
president and chief executive officer after 12 years at the helm. The move had
been expected since Scott became chief operating officer and vice chairman last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   The future wasn't as clear in 1979, when Scott was newly hired as assistant
transportation director and a group of truck drivers demanded his dismissal,
complaining of a dictatorial style.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott was summoned by Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton, for a lesson he long
remembered.
</P>
<P>
	   Walton ordered Scott to meet with the drivers, hear their complaints, and
offer to help resolve problems, according to published accounts of the incident.
And then, Scott was directed to stand at the door and thank each driver for
using the open-door policy allowing them to voice complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott said he learned then to listen to employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday morning, Scott, Glass and Rob Walton, the chairman of Wal-Mart and a
son of Sam Walton, taped a video message that was relayed by satellite
throughout the day to stores around the world. Scott was not available for
interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are pleased to have someone of the caliber of Lee Scott to succeed David
Glass and fortunate that David will remain with Wal-Mart in a significant role,"
Rob Walton said in a statement announcing Scott's appointment.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott has served in key leadership roles in merchandising and as president
and CEO of the Wal-Mart Stores division. In 1995, he was appointed executive
vice president of merchandise for the Wal-Mart Stores division and played a key
role in reducing inventory levels, a key to the chain's success.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott also worked to develop Wal-Mart's distribution network.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, he will have full responsibility for the day-to-day operations and
growth strategies of Wal-Mart.

<HEADLINE> Some Algerian Rebels Surrender  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLAS MARMIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Some Islamic insurgents were putting down their
weapons Friday, a day after a government deadline for them to surrender or face
annihilation.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Algerian soldiers stepped up their deployment in the country's
mountain citadels and prepared for a possible offensive against rebel holdouts.
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika made clear he was not backing down from his
stated intention to eradicate Muslim rebels who refuse to accept his plan for
``civil concord.''
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, passed by parliament in July and ratified in a national referendum
in September, aims to end an eight-year Islamic insurgency that has left more
than 100,000 people dead. It offered partial amnesty to insurgents who
surrendered as long as they had not committed murders, rapes or bombings.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have been mum on how many insurgents surrendered in the six
months since the peace plan was passed, or in the final hours before the
deadline expired Thursday night. For that matter, there are only vague estimates
as to how many rebels were waging the ``jihad,'' or holy war, in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent newspaper reports said 1,700 insurgents had surrendered since July.
</P>
<P>
	   In a surprise announcement, a dissident branch of the rebel Islamic
Salvation Army, or AIS, dissolved itself on Friday, the official Algerian news
agency reported, citing a statement from the group. It was not known how many
insurgents were in the faction.
</P>
<P>
	   The main AIS branch was granted full amnesty on Tuesday and dissolved itself
afterward. Algerian security forces who asked not to be named said AIS members
would be given a one- to two-week grace period to let them to return to their
families and let authorities use information they provide.
</P>
<P>
	   Other rebel groups, though, had not surrendered. For days, Algerian troops
have been airlifted to mountain regions around the nation to prepare to battle
those who resist. The deployments continued Friday, some in positions vacated by
the AIS.
</P>
<P>
	   The fate of one insurgency leader, Hassan Hattab, remained unclear. State
radio and privately owned newspapers reported Thursday that Hattab was locked in
negotiations with military authorities, trying to obtain good terms for the
surrender of his rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcome of the talks was not known. Hattab's surrender would strengthen
Bouteflika's hand and boost confidence in his peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Violence has wracked this North African nation since the insurgency began in
1992, triggered by the army's cancellation of national elections that the
now-outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those killed have been shot or bombed in brutal massacres blamed on
the radical Armed Islamic Group. The group holds pockets of the Jijel region,
225 miles east of Algiers.

<HEADLINE> N.J. develops bailout to erase $57.6 million deficit at Newark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The state Department of Education has developed a
bailout plan to erase a $57.6 million deficit at the state-run Newark school
district, a department spokesman said Friday.
<P>
	   The deficit was amassed during the four-year tenure of former Superintendent
Beverly Hall but only discovered early this year following an audit, said the
spokesman, Bob DeSando.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall was installed by the state when it assumed control of the district in
1995. She resigned in June to become head of the Atlanta school district. Her
chief financial officer also left the district about that time.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're looking at here is a business office that was inefficient,"
state Education Commissioner David Hespe told The Star-Ledger of Newark during a
visit to Newark on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you're going to find the kind of misspending that caused the
state to take over the district in 1995, but with the operations of a budget
this big, rebuilding the books sometimes is difficult. Still, there certainly is
no excuse why the district has a deficit," Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner believes a bookkeeping process in now in place that will
alert the district to deficits, DeSando said. "We're confident that this will
not happen again," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall had no immediate response on Friday to the shortfall, said Seth
Coleman, a spokesman for the Atlanta schools.
</P>
<P>
	   The deficit represents about 12 percent of the current $472 million
operating budget.
</P>
<P>
	   Hespe has agreed to erase the shortfall by providing $14.8 million in
additional state aid, shifting $10 million from district accounts with a
surplus, giving $5.3 million to adjust for higher enrollment than expected, and
forgiving $4.9 million owed the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining $22.6 million will be sought in the state budget. Gov.
Christie Whitman has agreed to request that allocation, DeSando said.
</P>
<P>
	   If those actions were not taken, Newark would have cut teacher salaries and
educational programs, Superintendent Marion Bolden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolden, who took over in July, said she hired a new business administrator
and installed a new accounting system as part of an effort "to get a handle on
our finances."
</P>
<P>
	   "We just really had to overhaul the whole system," Bolden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit that uncovered the shortfall's origins was on the Newark
district's 1997-98 budget, DeSando said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hespe became commissioner in April and ordered the audit after learning the
books were not yet closed on that budget, DeSando said. That budget and
subsequent budgets were submitted as balanced, but had not been audited because
the district requested more time, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "From year to year, what the auditors found, was that the district exceeded
its spending limits," DeSando said. "It would continue to roll up a deficit."
</P>
<P>
	   "We turned around immediately to resolve the problem so it will have no
impact on the children, and so it will never happen again," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Auditors did not uncover criminal wrongdoing, Hespe told The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark is the state's largest school district, with 43,000 students. Bolden
said it will be at least another two years before it can emerge from state
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark was beset by low test scores, corruption and decrepit buildings it
became the third district under state control, following Jersey City and
Paterson, the next-largest cities.

<HEADLINE> Clearasil inventor Ivan Combe dead at 88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - Ivan DeBlois Combe, the inventor of Clearasil,
the acne cream that helped millions of pimply-faced baby boomers get through the
awkward teen-age years, has died at 88.
<P>
	   Combe died Tuesday in Greenwich Hospital as the result of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, Combe got the idea for Clearasil after talking to teen-agers and
pharmacists about the need for an acne product that actually worked. He asked a
chemist to create a formula that would dry up pimples, then cover them with a
flesh-colored cream.
</P>
<P>
	   He named the product "Clearasil" to capitalize on every teen-ager's dream of
having clear skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe peddled the new product himself to drug stores across the country, but
store owners were reluctant to buy another acne product when so many others had
failed. Finally, Combe gave out free tubes of Clearasil to store owners in
exchange for a promise to order more if the product sold. It did.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales skyrocketed after Combe began advertising Clearasil on the popular
teen-age dance show "American Bandstand" in 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Clark, the rock 'n' roll icon who hosted the television show from 1952
to 1989, remembers reading dozens of different Clearasil advertisements in the
early days of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "We became sort of synonymous - Dick Clark, Bandstand and Clearasil - we
were tied together," Clark said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said Clearasil tapped into a huge market of teen-agers eager to try
something new to get rid of pimples.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was pretty much it on the market then," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As adults we say, 'Don't worry, your face will clear up,' but it really is
an emotional and sometimes stressful thing for kids."
</P>
<P>
	   Combe's son, Chris, said his father received hundreds of letters over the
years from grateful teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
	   "They'd say, 'I became a cheerleader because of Clearasil' or 'I got invited
to the prom because of Clearasil,' " he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1960, Vick Chemical bought the Clearasil business from Combe's company,
Combe Inc. Procter &AMP; Gamble bought Clearasil in 1985. Today, the company sells a
line of 25 different Clearasil products, including the traditional acne cream,
as well as soap, stringent and cleansing pads.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe began rebuilding his business by finding a niche in products used to
help embarrassing health and beauty problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1960s, Combe acquired Grecian Formula 16, the men's haircoloring
product, and Lanacane, the itch cream. In the '70s and '80s, he introduced
Odor-Eaters foot care products, Vagisil feminine care products and Just for Men,
the men's hair color product.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was always a great student of human nature and always trying to start
with the need rather than the product. He would say, 'What need can I fill
that's not being filled?' " said Chris Combe, who is now president of Combe
Inc., a health and beauty products company based in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivan Combe was born April 21, 1911, in Fremont, Iowa. He was raised in
Greenville, Ill., where he was a high school tennis champion, and graduated from
Northwestern University in 1933. He had lived in Greenwich since 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe is survived by his wife Mary, three children and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service was scheduled for Saturday in Greenwich.

<HEADLINE> Russia Launches Chechnya Attacks  </HEADLINE>
   By RUSLAN MUSAYEV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia launched heavy air and artillery strikes on
Chechen rebel positions Friday, claiming the attacks killed scores of rebels and
denying media reports of growing Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia says it has regained momentum after its offensive stalled early this
week in the face of rebel attacks on Russian-held towns and fierce resistance by
fighters in the Chechen capital, Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   A military spokesman, Lt. Col. Konstantin Kukharenko, said up to 60 rebels
were killed in heavy shelling of the village of Khimoi. Another military
spokesman, Alexander Veklich, said 61 rebels were killed in recent days in the
Sharoi region, where Russian forces seized strategic heights this week, the
Interfax news agency reported. The statements could not be verified
independently.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the reports of a high rebel death toll, Russian news media
increasingly have begun questioning the Chechnya offensive amid reports of
higher Russian casualty figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia generally has reported only a few deaths each day, but this week
reports surfaced of tens of soldiers dying daily. On Thursday, Interfax reported
a death toll of 33 in the past 24 hours -- the highest toll reported by
mainstream media. The report cited military sources.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Ministry said one soldier was killed and 13 wounded on Thursday.
In a statement, the ministry called media reports of higher casualties
``conscious lies.''
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, a leader of pro-Moscow Chechens reached agreement with rebel
field commanders to surrender the area around Nozhai-Yurt, Interfax reported. It
said many rebels are based in the sizable southern mountain village.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, rebels were showing apparently high morale and a commander said
Grozny was far from falling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Grozny is an ideal place for street fighting. It is possible to defend it
for years,'' rebel commander Khizir Khachulayev said. ``Russian soldiers will
find their death here.''
</P>
<P>
	   Guerrilla attacks in Grozny's streets severely bloodied Russian troops in
the 1994-96 war and Russian forces have not entered Grozny en masse this time.
Instead, Russia has shelled the city for months, and small groups of Russian
troops have gone in to pick off weakened rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy has left much of the city in ruins. The remaining residents are
huddling in basements.
</P>
<P>
	   A top Russian commander, Lt. Gen. Gennady Troshev, said Friday that Russia
is preparing to step up the ground campaign in Grozny with ``thoroughly trained
forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   Even away from the most intense fighting, soldiers' nerves were stretched.
</P>
<P>
	   In Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, Russian forces have been in
control for weeks. But members of a special police force worry about rebels who
may still be in the area. One officer said the Russians feel that their only
friends in the city are the stray dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feed all the mongrel dogs in the area. Chechens don't,'' Capt. Vladimir
Latyshev said. ``As a result, the dogs have become accustomed to men in uniform
and bark at others, alerting us.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel much calmer on the front line in Grozny,'' said another officer,
Igor Molotov. ``There you look the enemy in the face and here you constantly
feel their look on your back.''
</P>
<P>
	   Because of concern about rebels going undetected in Russian-held towns,
Russia this week ordered that all males between ages 10 and 60 be checked out
for rebel ties. The order meant that males in that age range could not enter or
exit Chechnya, a move that sparked strong foreign criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   But Russian soldiers manning a checkpoint in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia started allowing Chechen men to cross on Friday. It was unclear
whether the travel restriction would be rescinded altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent ground troops into Chechnya in late September after weeks of
airstrikes. The offensive is intended to wipe out Chechnya-based rebels who
twice invaded the neighboring republic of Dagestan last summer and who are
blamed for apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that killed about 300 people.

<HEADLINE> Investors Betting on Chef Ditka  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY FOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Investors are betting $2 million that former football
coach Mike Ditka can once again be a winner, this time with another branch of
his restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka and his backers have put the money into renovating "Mike Ditka's,"
which has been up and running since December but had its ceremonial opening
Friday, just days after Ditka was fired by the National Football League's New
Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why shouldn't it work?" Ditka said. "I got fired, but that doesn't mean
people don't like me. They do. They come up and shake my hand, wave at me when
I'm in the car. I still have a lot of people who think I'm OK."
</P>
<P>
	   Ditka already has restaurants in Naples, Fla. and Chicago, where he coached
the Bears to the playoffs seven times and won the Super Bowl in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still do a good business in Chicago," Ditka said. "We made over $5
million last year. We made about $13 million a year in the heyday of the Bears."
</P>
<P>
	   He's not as popular with fans in New Orleans, where he followed up two 6-10
years with a 3-13 record this year, the second-worst finish in the Saints'
history. But Mason Jambon, the restaurant's general manager, said Ditka's
disgrace hasn't hurt business.
</P>
<P>
	   "If anything, the publicity made us even busier," Jambon said. "We have been
running at about 100 percent this past week."
</P>
<P>
	   With main dishes costing as much as $31 and a selection of expensive cigars,
Ditka's plush restaurant caters to an upscale crowd. But Ditka's brash
personality is part of the restaurant's draw.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody loves him, regardless of what they feel about him as a coach.
When he works a room, he works a room like no other," Jambon said.
</P>
<P>
	   Do not confuse Ditka's with Planet Hollywood, Fashion Cafe or other
celebrity-oriented chain restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those other places cater to a younger crowd," Ditka said. 'I'm looking for
the businessmen, the people who can afford a good meal and good wine and want a
nice place to enjoy it."
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the former coach chatted up customers and signed dinner plates
bearing his caricature -- which are then sold for $75.
</P>
<P>
	   "I really like the restaurant, but it's a kick actually getting to talk to
Iron Mike," said Robert Miner, 55, a chemical engineer from Houston. "I'd eat
here even if he wasn't likely to show up, but it's a big deal if he does."

<HEADLINE> High Court Takes on Gays in Scouts  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking on emotional issues of free speech and
homosexuality, the Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether the Boy Scouts
of America can exclude gays as members and troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will decide whether the organization had a
constitutional right to oust a young troop leader after learning he is gay. The
court is expected to hear arguments in April and issue a decision by July.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's highest court ruled last summer that the Boy Scouts' denial of
membership to homosexual boys and leaders violated a state law banning
discrimination in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Scouts' lawyer contends that law violated the organization's rights
of free speech and free association under the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Scouting adheres to a moral belief ... that homosexual conduct is not
moral,'' the Scouts' lawyer, George A. Davidson, said after the high court
granted review Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   An openly gay person would not be a proper Scout role model, Davidson said,
adding, ``Boy Scouting is really all about sending messages. The message is that
you should be morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the attorney for James Dale, the former assistant scoutmaster whose
leadership role was revoked, said opposition to homosexuality is not one of the
Scouts' main purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As gay people we know how important the First Amendment is,'' said lawyer
Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``Their First
Amendment rights are not being interfered with. The members did not join the Boy
Scouts for bigotry in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dale was 20 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matewan, N.J., troop when in
1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as co-president of a campus
lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
	   He previously had attained the rank of Eagle, which only 2 percent of all
Scouts achieve, and had been elected to the Order of the Arrow, a Scouting honor
society.
</P>
<P>
	   The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's registration as an adult leader.
Dale was told the Boy Scouts ``does not admit avowed homosexuals to membership
in the organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dale sued the Monmouth Council and the national organization in 1992,
contending they violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. His lawsuit
seeks reinstatement and monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
	   A state trial judge threw out the case, ruling that the Boy Scouts is not a
place of public accommodation and therefore is not covered by the law. But an
appeals court and the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled for Dale.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court rejected the organization's argument that accepting
homosexuals would violate the Scout Oath's commitment to remain ``morally
straight'' and the Scout Law's commitment to remain ``clean.''
</P>
<P>
	   Its decision added: ``The Boy Scouts' expulsion of Dale is based on little
more than prejudice and not on a unified Boy Scout position.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Scouts' appeal to the nation's highest court said the New Jersey court
decision leaves many organizations vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Almost any organization could find itself a victim of a court's desire to
foster social change by forcing social private associations to conform to its
idea of egalitarian values,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal relied on a 1995 decision in which the justices said the sponsor
of Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade should not be forced to let a group of gays
and lesbians participate. The court said parades are ``a form of expression''
and private sponsors cannot be forced to include ``a group imparting a message
the organizers do not wish to convey.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Dale's lawyers contend his case should be governed by a series of
Supreme Court decisions dealing with state public accommodations laws.
</P>

	   The court ruled in 1984 that states may force the Jaycees, a group dedicated
to developing America's future leaders, to admit women as full members. Three
years later, the court ruled that states may force Rotary International to admit
women as members.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, the court said New York City can bar discrimination against women
and minorities by clubs with more than 400 members.
</P>
<P>
	   None of those decisions dealt with gay rights, however, an issue the court
has visited on a few occasions in the last two decades but never seemed eager to
tackle. For example, the justices repeatedly have turned away challenges to
President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.

<HEADLINE> Commission To Probe Kohl Scandal  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- The head of Germany's conservatives appointed a high-ranking
independent commission Friday to investigate the financing scandal plaguing
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party.
</P>
<P>
	   The parliament also moved forward with its own investigation into the
allegedly illegal campaign donations to the Christian Democrats. The ruling
Social Democrats said Friday it wants to question 26 party bosses and aides --
topped by Kohl, Germany's leader for 16 years until he lost the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
	   The slow trickle of new revelations ``shows that the claimed desire of the
Christian Democrats and its new leadership to clarify the issue is in
considerable doubt,'' the Social Democrats, who are led by Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The list of witnesses was to be approved when the parliament committee holds
its first working meeting Thursday. Kohl has said he would like to testify as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigating committee also has asked for government files on the
delivery of tanks to Saudi Arabia in 1991 and the privatization in former East
Germany of the Leuna refinery and Minol gas station business -- deals which have
been questioned in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Christian Democrats' own investigation will be led by former President
Roman Herzog, former German central bank President Hans Tietmeyer and former
federal constitutional Judge Paul Kirchhof. Herzog and Tietmeyer belong to the
CDU; Kirchhof is close to the party.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel will base its report on an audit of the party's finances being
prepared by accounting firm Ernst and Young. Party chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble
said he wants its recommendations presented at the Christian Democrats'
convention in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Further damaging the party Friday was the admission of former Hesse state
chairman Manfred Kanther at a meeting near Frankfurt that the party for years
had a secret foreign account eventually worth $8.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1989 and 1996, $6.8 million was transferred back to the state as
contributions for campaign finances, Kanther said. He admitted the party used
what he called ``incomplete accounting reports.''
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Kohl admitted accepting up to $1 million from donors who
demanded anonymity -- in violation of a party financing law passed while Kohl
himself was chancellor. Bonn prosecutors are investigating whether to charge
Kohl with breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble, who is party chairman and head of the parliament faction, faces
pressure of his own, including calls to give up after admitting he accepting
$52,000 cash from a businessman at the center of the scandal. He apologized for
not properly reporting the money, but insisted he did nothing wrong and would
not resign.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadian-German businessman who handed Schaeuble the money said it was
intended to support construction of an armored vehicle factory for a subsidiary
of the Thyssen industrial conglomerate in Canada. Karlheinz Schreiber told ZDF
television Friday that he made the donation because he ``felt sorry'' for
Schaeuble after a 1994 fundraising meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He had an election campaign coming up and had to beg for money,''
Schreiber said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at Record High 11,722.98  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today, boosted by a strong earnings
report from high-tech bellwether Intel and comments from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan that indicate interest rates will be rising only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones rose 140.55 to a new closing record of 11,722.98, easily
topping yesterday's record. The new closing high was the third this week and the
fourth since the start of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market measures also finished with solid gains. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 107.28 to 4,064.49.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks led the Dow and the Nasdaq, with industry leaders Intel
and Microsoft accounting for a major portion of the market's advance.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to have money coming into the market, and money managers are
deciding that technology offers the opportunity for the biggest gains," said
Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker, rose sharply after
announcing better than expected earnings late Thursday. The company cited a
surge in sales of personal computers during the back-to-school and holiday
shopping period.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's strong report and optimistic outlook lifted rival chip maker
Applied Materials. PC makers like Dell and IBM also advanced as investors
anticipated strong profit reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft rose a day after Bill Gates' decision to relinquish his chief
executive job to company president Steve Ballmer. Analysts said the move will
assure continuity in the company's leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks also benefited from rising confidence that inflation is not rising
sharply. A speech by Fed Chairman Greenspan Thursday night convinced many
investors the Fed is likely to raise rates no more than a quarter-percentage
point at the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Feb. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Although rate increases are usually troublesome, market watchers said they
were impressed that Greenspan indicated he won't let inflation get in the way of
a surging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has demonstrated that he understands the world has changed and
that he doesn't intend to do anything scary to the market," said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities."We are comfortable
with Greenspan's comments because it shows he is not behind the curve, and won't
let inflation raise its mighty head."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest economic data released today once again showed inflation remains
under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in December,
slightly below forecasts. Excluding energy prices, the gain was just 0.1
percent. The report was the latest confirmation that fears about accelerating
inflation remain unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's financial stocks rose following the report. American Express and
J.P. Morgan gained.
</P>
<P>
	   Optimism about earnings extended beyond the technology sector. Lands' End
rose after a Wall Street analysts noted that in spite of slumping sales in the
eight-week holiday shopping season, profits improved.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent Technologies declined in heavy trading amid rumors that the
Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company's accounting
practices. Lucent officials said they were unaware of any investigation and the
SEC would not confirm or deny an inquiry.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Costs May Hike Airline Fares  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Sharply rising fuel expenses and the potential for costly
labor contracts have raised new speculation that airlines may soon introduce
another fare hike to try to keep profits from falling.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry watchers, however, said airlines will be cautious about applying
any across-the-board increase immediately when they're still trying to recover
business lost to Y2K jitters and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't want to scare anybody off at a time when they're trying to build
back up capacity," said Tom Parsons of Bestfares.com magazine, who still
predicts a fare increase within weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines may be contemplating new fare hikes as the result of a combination
of factors highlighted Thursday when the parent company of United Airlines, the
world's largest carrier, announced its year 2000 earnings will be less than
expected.
</P>
<P>
	   UAL Corp., based in the Chicago suburb of Elk Grove Village, said it
anticipates that a 6 percent increase in costs -- primarily fuel and labor hikes
-- will outweigh a projected 2 percent to 4 percent gain in revenues.
</P>
<P>
	   Its stock plummeted 13 percent on the news, and other airlines' stocks also
fell, though less precipitously. The sector recovered on Friday but reported
only slight gains.
</P>
<P>
	   UAL, for example, was trading up 12 1/2 cents to $65 on the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "The airlines don't like to see their stocks get beat up like that," said
Randy Petersen, editor of Inside Flier, a consumer magazine for frequent fliers.
"They tend to want to do something about that, and the way to do it is raise
fares."
</P>
<P>
	   Labor issues could strongly influence their decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Contract talks are pending with United pilots, machinists, customer-service
workers and other employees this year, and chairman James Goodwin told analysts
he now foresees big wage hikes that will result in a $780 million increase in
labor costs, instead of the previously projected $480 million. Other airlines
will be under pressure to match those increases.
</P>
<P>
	   But the key may be the cost of jet fuel. A year after fuel costs went up 24
percent, United said it sees another 25 percent increase in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts are skeptical about United's estimate of average fuel
costs at 71 cents a gallon -- several pennies higher than they, and most other
airlines, anticipate.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of other airlines think fuel levels will start coming down this
month," said Ray Neidl, an analyst for ING Barings. "The winter stock-up season
will be over, Y2K glitches have passed, and there could be political pressure on
OPEC to lower oil prices."
</P>
<P>
	   But crude oil prices rocketed over $28 a barrel to a nine-year high Friday,
and if they keep rising, fuel costs will too.
</P>
<P>
	   "That would put very strong pressure on airlines to raise prices,"
acknowledged Neidl.
</P>
<P>
	   Even with a fare increase, leisure travelers likely still will be able to
benefit from deep discounts now being offered to lure them back to the skies.
</P>
<P>
	   "Once demand starts picking up for March, April, May and summer travel, the
airlines will be a little more confident, and that's when they'll sneak in a
fare hike," Parsons predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines imposed six fare hikes last year for leisure travelers and raised
business fares three times, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But those fare hikes "don't mean anything if you can fly for 198 bucks," he
noted, citing current round-trip deals for Boston-Los Angeles or New
York-Europe.

<HEADLINE> Men in Ku Klux Klan robes appear as King Day controversy continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) - In this town, where Ku Klux Klan activity has
simmered up from time to time, the reappearance of men wearing robes and hoods
has intensified the controversy over town leaders' refusal to make Martin Luther
King Day a holiday.
<P>
	   Police said three men, including one in a crimson Klan robe, were shouting
at cars on the street late Wednesday night. The other two men put on white robes
and hoods when police questioned them, but they then disbanded.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was really an insignificant event," said police Lt. Thomas Curran. "I
really don't know what they were up to. There's no reason for anyone in the
community to be alarmed at all."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the men, Harry Pender, 20, of Wallingford, claimed to a member of the
Klan. He said Wallingford seems like the kind of town where the Klan would be
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a mostly white town, and people are already looking at it as racist,
and there's the Martin Luther King thing," Pender told the Record-Journal of
Meriden.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he and the other men acted out to see how people would react. "It
was kind of like just for fun," Pender said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor William Dickinson, who is at the center of the King controversy, said
the Klan is not welcome in town, but he does not think the group has a presence
in Wallingford.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson said the Martin Luther King Day controversy is about labor and
benefits, not about race. Dickinson wants town workers to swap another holiday
for King Day, instead of closing town offices and giving workers a 13th paid
holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The town instead observes King Day by co-hosting a celebration at a church
to honor the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been a lot of publicity over the Martin Luther King issue, and
there are these groups that get attracted to it," Dickinson said. "I think it's
unfortunate the community honors the life of a great man, and happens to do it
different than everyone else, so immediately we're targeted for suspicion."
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Leikind, the director of the Connecticut office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the King Day controversy contributes to an unfair
image of the town but may provide an excuse for people with hate-filled messages
to act out.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wouldn't be surprising if people saw this as an opportunity to advertise
their hatred," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Town residents were split on the issue, and were not happy to see the Klan
presence, no matter how small, pop up again.
</P>
<P>
	   Colleen Chapman, who has lived in Wallingford for 40 years, recalls seeing
Klan demonstrations in town from time to time, often by the railroad station.
She had some choice, unprintable words for the Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they just do it because they don't have anything better to do,"
Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she supported a holiday for workers because, "it's part of our
history."
</P>
<P>
	   Helene Ozycz, a Wallingford resident for 13 years, stood by the mayor's
decision that an extra paid holiday for workers would hurt the budget. She said
workers should be able to trade King Day for another holiday if they want to
observe it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sticking by Mayor Dickinson, and I think he should not be embarrassed
to stick to his guns," Ozycz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallingford over the past 20 years has seen Ku Klux Klan and other racist
activities pop up, including formal Klan demonstrations and leafleting, marches
outside a synagogue, mailings and graffiti.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Klan leaders claimed to have a group of members called a
Klavern based in Wallingford. In a 1993 newspaper article, Klan leaders offered
to distribute Christmas hams to the needy.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the Klan activity was broken up in 1994, after a federal sting
netted six arrests of Klansmen on illegal weapons and drug charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has seen a small increase in activity lately from people who claim
to be Klan members, Leikind said, but he said their activities are "more symbol
that substance."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is certainly the right of people in the Klan to lawfully present their
ideas, and that should be protected," he said. "Perhaps most important public
service they provide is to remind everyone hate does exist in our world, and
none of us should be glib about it."

<HEADLINE> More public Hillary Clinton agrees to appear at satire show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In yet another sign she is leaving the White House
cocoon that has shielded her for the past seven years, Hillary Rodham Clinton
agreed Friday to take the stage at the nation's longest-running political
gridiron show.
<P>
	   The first lady, fresh from her star turn on the "Late Show with David
Letterman" and set to formally enter New York's Senate race next month, accepted
an invitation to be part of the 100th annual Legislative Correspondents
Association show on June 10 in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll have to get the home office in Chappaqua working overtime on this,"
Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign committee, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who had never lived or worked in New York before, recently
moved into a house in Chappaqua in Westchester County just north of New York
City to establish New York residency for her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's expected opponent for the Senate race, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has also been invited to appear at the LCA show. There was no
immediate response Friday from the mayor on whether he planned to attend.
</P>
<P>
	   As a featured guest, Republican Giuliani did a lengthy monologue at the
LCA's 1991 show.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, as she draws closer to formally entering the Senate race,
the notoriously media-shy Mrs. Clinton has begun conducting regular
question-and-answer sessions with reporters during campaign stops. She mixes
easily with people who happen to show up at her events. The first lady is also
planning a series of in-depth interviews in the days leading up to her early
February campaign kickoff.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a far cry from her early forays onto the New York political stage
last year when she rarely left the security of her Secret Service detail and
contact with the public generally involved little more than some handshaking
along a rope line. Questioning by reporters was rare.
</P>
<P>
	   That is in sharp contrast to Giuliani, who holds a "media availability"
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown the mayor leading the first lady among New York
voters and some of her aides have been advising a more open approach to
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to appear at the LCA show, Mrs. Clinton is accepting what has
become almost a rite of passage in New York politics for major candidates. In
1998, then-U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer took a turn. Five months later, Democrat
Schumer defeated Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato in that year's U.S. Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, once the reporters have finished skewering the politicians
with songs and skits, the governor and two guests, one Republican and one
Democrat, are invited to offer responses - generally humorous speeches or more
elaborate skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfson said Friday that he wasn't yet sure what Mrs. Clinton would do.
</P>
<P>
	   The black-tie, $175-a-person dinner and show raises money for charity and to
support LCA operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the Hillary Clinton campaign team appeared to have rejected the
LCA's invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 10 letter to LCA President David Hepp, co-host of the "Inside
Albany" television show, Mrs. Clinton's scheduling director, Paul Rivera, had
written that "Mrs. Clinton's official schedule will not permit her to accept the
invitation."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the rejection, Wolfson had said Thursday that he believed there
had been a mistake. By this morning, Hepp had a new letter in hand from Rivera
stating that the first letter "was sent in error."
</P>
<P>
	   "Please be assured that we plan to participate in the show," Rivera wrote in
the second letter.

<HEADLINE> Clearasil inventor Ivan Combe dead at 88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - Ivan DeBlois Combe, the inventor of Clearasil,
the acne cream that helped millions of pimply-faced baby boomers get through the
awkward teen-age years, has died at 88.
<P>
	   Combe died Tuesday in Greenwich Hospital as the result of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, Combe got the idea for Clearasil after talking to teen-agers and
pharmacists about the need for an acne product that actually worked. He asked a
chemist to create a formula that would dry up pimples, then cover them with a
flesh-colored cream.
</P>
<P>
	   He named the product "Clearasil" to capitalize on every teen-ager's dream of
having clear skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe peddled the new product himself to drug stores across the country, but
store owners were reluctant to buy another acne product when so many others had
failed. Finally, Combe gave out free tubes of Clearasil to store owners in
exchange for a promise to order more if the product sold. It did.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales skyrocketed after Combe began advertising Clearasil on the popular
teen-age dance show "American Bandstand" in 1957.

<P>
	   Dick Clark, the rock 'n' roll icon who hosted the television show from 1952
to 1989, remembers reading dozens of different Clearasil advertisements in the
early days of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "We became sort of synonymous - Dick Clark, Bandstand and Clearasil - we
were tied together," Clark said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said Clearasil tapped into a huge market of teen-agers eager to try
something new to get rid of pimples.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was pretty much it on the market then," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As adults we say, 'Don't worry, your face will clear up,' but it really is
an emotional and sometimes stressful thing for kids."
</P>
<P>
	   Combe's son, Chris, said his father received hundreds of letters over the
years from grateful teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
	   "They'd say, 'I became a cheerleader because of Clearasil' or 'I got invited
to the prom because of Clearasil,' " he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1960, Vick Chemical bought the Clearasil business from Combe's company,
Combe Inc. Procter &AMP; Gamble bought Clearasil in 1985. Today, the company sells a
line of 25 different Clearasil products, including the traditional acne cream,
as well as soap, astringent and cleansing pads.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe began rebuilding his business by finding a niche in products used to
help embarrassing health and beauty problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1960s, Combe acquired Grecian Formula 16, the men's haircoloring
product, and Lanacane, the itch cream. In the '70s and '80s, he introduced
Odor-Eaters foot care products, Vagisil feminine care products and Just for Men,
the men's hair color product.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was always a great student of human nature and always trying to start
with the need rather than the product. He would say, 'What need can I fill
that's not being filled?' " said Chris Combe, who is now president of Combe
Inc., a health and beauty products company based in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivan Combe was born April 21, 1911, in Fremont, Iowa. He was raised in
Greenville, Ill., where he was a high school tennis champion, and graduated from
Northwestern University in 1933. He had lived in Greenwich since 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe is survived by his wife Mary, three children and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service was scheduled for Saturday in Greenwich.

<HEADLINE> Cable Rates Up Despite Competition  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the growing popularity of competing services such
as satellite broadcast, cable TV providers last year continued to raise prices
faster than most American businesses, the government said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A study released by the Federal Communications Commission found that between
June 1998 and June 1999, cable rates increased 3.8 percent. That's nearly double
the Consumer Price Index, which measured general price increases of 2 percent
during the same period.
</P>
<P>
	   The big jump in prices occurred even as direct-broadcast satellite companies
and other companies snagged customers away from local cable TV providers. As of
last June, 82 percent of TV viewers who received multichannel video programming
got it from cable companies, compared with 85 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   But cable customers -- almost 67 million of them -- still far outnumber the
14 million households subscribing to other services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Competition is the best way to reduce cable rates for consumers,'' said
FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. ``Americans still need more competition and choice in
multichannel video.''
</P>
<P>
	   The difference between the rise in cable rates and inflation was smaller in
the period covered by Friday's study than in years past. For example, between
June 1997 and June 1998, cable prices rose a staggering 7.3 percent, compared to
a 1.7 percent increase in the CPI -- despite the fact that cable rates were
subject federal price regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   Cable companies said they tried to be more moderate in raising their rates
this year, even absorbing costs as they upgrade systems to support high-speed
Internet and phone services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This reflects a sensitivity on our part to our customers' reaction to
price increases,'' said Mike Luftman of Time Warner, which has 13 million cable
TV customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The average price for the company's customers who get an expanded basic
package is in the mid-$30 range.
</P>
<P>
	   But consumer advocates argue that cable companies exercised restraint during
parts of the period covered by the study to ward off the threat of being
regulated again. The FCC stopped regulating most cable TV services in March,
following the directive of a 1996 law.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was clearly a concerted effort by the industry to dampen rate
increases, while Congress was focusing attention on whether to extend regulatory
authority,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union. ``If history is any guide, rates will spike up again when
policy makers are not watching as closely.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some cable providers already have announced rate raises for the year. Time
Warner plans a 5 percent increase. Cablevision is boosting its prices by a
little more than 5 percent, and MediaOne is raising its basic cable TV rates by
up to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators and lawmakers have expressed hope that satellite television
companies would become stronger rivals to cable -- and thus serve as a check on
cable pricing -- after Congress passed a law in November allowing satellite
companies to beam local channels into subscribers' homes. Satellite companies
had long-cited the inability to offer local channels as a hurdle to attracting
customers.
</P>
<P>
	   As soon as that barrier was removed, satellite companies started seeing the
benefits. The nation's largest satellite TV provider, DirecTV, had a record
month in December, acquiring 225,000 new customers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The full impact of local channels will be realized this year,'' said Bob
Marsocci of DirecTV.
</P>
<P>
	   Some consumers could also benefit as cable companies begin offering packages
that include cable TV, high-speed online connections and telephone service.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You will get a better value the more you bundle,'' said Mark Siegel of
AT&AMP;T, one of the nation's top cable companies.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, in test promotions, AT&AMP;T has given customers receiving
long-distance and digital cable TV service 10 percent off each bill for a
year.

<HEADLINE> Bitter cold follows snowstom into upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - If your car wouldn't start in the pre-dawn gloom, or
your furnace seized as the wind chill fell into negative digits, you were not
alone.
<P>
	   Much of upstate New York struggled on Friday to cope with the first
significant blast of winter this season.
</P>
<P>
	   The upstate landscape was snow-covered for the first time this winter on
Friday with up to a foot of snow reported in Albany. High temperatures in the
single digits were forecast for eastern New York, combined with winds gusting to
30 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the National Weather Service, wind chill temperatures were
expected to be as low as 35 below zero in some parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all about not going out, and then not staying out unless you have to,
or unless you're covered up extremely well," Glenn Wiley, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service said. "It's been a rather boring winter with fairly
mild temperatures but now I think we're getting a good taste of what you learn
to expect from winters in upstate New York."
</P>
<P>
	   A frigid forecast on Friday meant that commuters were forced to face a
challenge in just starting their cars and getting to work. Salt and other
deicers became less effective as temperatures plummeted, making bridges and
ramps especially treacherous. Strong winds brought the added danger of forcing
cleared-away snow back onto roads where it could hide icy patches and reduce
visibility.
</P>
<P>
	   In Schenectady, Dennis Kugler with the Holmes and Kugler towing service was
forced to make some people wait for as long as two hours for a jump start.
</P>
<P>
	   "We took about 85 calls this morning from people needing some kind of
assistance that ranged from being towed or a jump start for their car," said
Kugler.
</P>
<P>
	   In Buffalo, Danny Knoll, owner of the Auto Rescue Team, said that he took
about 100 calls from motorists.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had double the normal amount of calls this morning," Knoll said. "It
takes a lot more voltage to fire a car when it's really cold, so if your spark
plugs and everything aren't in good order, your cars isn't going to go in
9-degree weather."
</P>
<P>
	   In central New York, temperatures hovered around zero on Friday morning,
making life difficult for 67 homeless men at the Syracuse Rescue Mission.
</P>
<P>
	   Randall Waters, a 45-year-old transient from Flagstaff, Ariz., checked into
the Rescue Mission. Waters said the temperature dip was not unexpected, but the
wind chill was a bitter surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "(The wind) blows the snow everywhere. It sneaks around city alleys, as soon
as you open your door, it blows snow right in," Waters said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Jurewicz, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in
Binghamton, said Thursday was a prelude to more winter-like conditions. "It
looks like we are going to be in a typically colder winter pattern until next
week," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bitter cold was expected to continue through the weekend with low
temperatures as extreme as 20 below forecast for portions of northern New York
and from -5 to 5 degrees elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany heating repair specialists were also busy.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had 30 technicians on all of last night and we were quite busy," Don
Cootware, a service manager with Crisafully Brothers. "Friday and Saturday night
should be even worse."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Cootware, homeowners in older dwellings are especially
vulnerable. Older buildings are more drafty and less well insulated, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whenever the furnace is forced to run more or less continuously for up to
five hours, then you're going to have problems," Cootware said.

<HEADLINE> Men in Ku Klux Klan robes appear as King Day controversy continues  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) - In this town, where Ku Klux Klan activity has
simmered up from time to time, the reappearance of men wearing robes and hoods
has intensified the controversy over town leaders' refusal to make Martin Luther
King Day a holiday.
<P>
	   Police said three men, including one in a crimson Klan robe, were shouting
at cars on the street late Wednesday night. The other two men put on white robes
and hoods when police questioned them, but they then disbanded.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was really an insignificant event," said police Lt. Thomas Curran. "I
really don't know what they were up to. There's no reason for anyone in the
community to be alarmed at all."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the men, Harry Pender, 20, of Wallingford, claimed to a member of the
Klan. He said Wallingford seems like the kind of town where the Klan would be
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a mostly white town, and people are already looking at it as racist,
and there's the Martin Luther King thing," Pender told the Record-Journal of
Meriden.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he and the other men acted out to see how people would react. "It
was kind of like just for fun," Pender said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor William Dickinson, who is at the center of the King controversy, said
the Klan is not welcome in town, but he does not think the group has a presence
in Wallingford.
</P>
<P>
	   Dickinson said the Martin Luther King Day controversy is about labor and
benefits, not about race. Dickinson wants town workers to swap another holiday
for King Day, instead of closing town offices and giving workers a 13th paid
holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The town instead observes King Day by co-hosting a celebration at a church
to honor the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been a lot of publicity over the Martin Luther King issue, and
there are these groups that get attracted to it," Dickinson said. "I think it's
unfortunate the community honors the life of a great man, and happens to do it
different than everyone else, so immediately we're targeted for suspicion."
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Leikind, the director of the Connecticut office of the
Anti-Defamation League, said the King Day controversy contributes to an unfair
image of the town but may provide an excuse for people with hate-filled messages
to act out.
</P>
<P>
	   "It wouldn't be surprising if people saw this as an opportunity to advertise
their hatred," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Town residents were split on the issue, and were not happy to see the Klan
presence, no matter how small, pop up again.
</P>
<P>
	   Colleen Chapman, who has lived in Wallingford for 40 years, recalls seeing
Klan demonstrations in town from time to time, often by the railroad station.
She had some choice, unprintable words for the Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they just do it because they don't have anything better to do,"
Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she supported a holiday for workers because, "it's part of our
history."
</P>
<P>
	   Helene Ozycz, a Wallingford resident for 13 years, stood by the mayor's
decision that an extra paid holiday for workers would hurt the budget. She said
workers should be able to trade King Day for another holiday if they want to
observe it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm sticking by Mayor Dickinson, and I think he should not be embarrassed
to stick to his guns," Ozycz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wallingford over the past 20 years has seen Ku Klux Klan and other racist
activities pop up, including formal Klan demonstrations and leafleting, marches
outside a synagogue, mailings and graffiti.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Klan leaders claimed to have a group of members called a
Klavern based in Wallingford. In a 1993 newspaper article, Klan leaders offered
to distribute Christmas hams to the needy.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the Klan activity was broken up in 1994, after a federal sting. Six
men were arrested, including two admitted Klansmen, on drug charges and charges
of illegal possession of weapons and explosives.
</P>
<P>
	   The state has seen a small increase in activity lately from people who claim
to be Klan members, Leikind said, but he said their activities are "more symbol
that substance."
</P>
<P>
	   "It is certainly the right of people in the Klan to lawfully present their
ideas, and that should be protected," he said. "Perhaps most important public
service they provide is to remind everyone hate does exist in our world, and
none of us should be glib about it."

<HEADLINE> New York colleges send students to study and work in Vietnam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Guided by a Vietnam War veteran, the State
University of New York is sending students into the heart of former enemy
territory to attend college and join in Vietnamese community projects helping
street children, flood victims and lepers.
<P>
	   None of the first batch of seven students was alive when the war ended in
1975, but their adventure will serve as one small step in "closing the circle on
the war," Kenneth Herrmann Jr., a social work professor at State University
College at Brockport, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Herrmann, an infantry sergeant who helped resettle refugees in central
Vietnam during a one-year tour of duty in 1968-9, said the residential-education
program he developed is the only overseas project of its kind in Vietnam that
mixes academic study and community service.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since I came up with this idea 16 months ago, the Vietnamese have made it
very clear to me they think the time is opportune now, on the 25th anniversary
of the end of the war, to heal wounds that have not yet been healed," Herrmann
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've also made it clear the only way to do that is through youth, so
that there's ... an emotional connection made between the 75 percent of their
population who were born after the war and the 75 percent of ours born after the
war."
</P>
<P>
	   One graduate and four undergraduate students from the State University of
New York, plus two students from the University of Maryland and Swarthmore
College in Pennsylvania, depart Saturday for a four-month semester in Da Nang in
central Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know it will not be plush or easygoing, but that's the attraction,"
Jessica Morris, 22, a SUNY graduate completing a master's degree at American
University, told the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. "This is not a tourist
deal. This will be a real immersion in the culture and the society."
</P>
<P>
	   The SUNY network of public universities around New York will operate three
semesters a year in Da Nang.
</P>
<P>
	   Students will attend classes and seminars at the University of Da Nang, the
Duy Tan People-Founded University or the School of Politics in Da Nang, and
assist instructors teaching English.
</P>
<P>
	   At least four days a week, their community work will include developing
activities for homeless children, creating a festival for a leprosy colony and
distributing food and clothing to nearby mountain villages ravaged by flooding
late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   In exchange, Herrmann wants to bring poor students from the region to study
in Brockport, 25 miles west of Rochester, and create a distance-learning
curriculum linking Da Nang with Brockport.
</P>
<P>
	   At his wife's urging, Herrmann made his first trip back to Vietnam in 1998
to carry out research into illegal adoptions there. He revisited the village of
Hiep Duc, 35 miles southwest of Da Nang, where he had served as a liaison
between the 196th Light Infantry and U.S.-allied South Vietnamese forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Da Nang was the scene of the initial U.S. military buildup in 1965 and, by
the end of the decade, Herrmann said the region "saw the heaviest fighting of
the war." The two countries normalized diplomatic relations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising money from foundations and corporations to support the academic
program has been an uphill struggle.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unfortunately, Vietnam is still a word that's connected with a war, not a
country," Herrmann said, vowing to "drive these people crazy until I finally get
the money I need."

<HEADLINE> Smart Appliances Connect Household  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL LA CORTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- An alarm clock that shuts off the electric blanket and tells
the coffee maker when to start brewing. A mixer that has a built-in measuring
device. A blood-pressure monitor that charts progress and e-mails updates to a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
	   These products and other "smart appliances" are being showcased by companies
at the International Housewares 2000 Show in Chicago this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boca Raton-based Sunbeam Corp. is just one of many manufacturers vying
to attract consumers by making appliances that act more like personal assistants
than machines.
</P>
<P>
	   The show, which runs Sunday through Wednesday, will feature the nine
prototypes from Sunbeam, including a kitchen console and a personal digital
assistant that would control household devices and connect with the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're dealing with very low-cost items that are usable and
understandable," said Jerry W. Levin, Sunbeam's chairman and chief executive
officer. "All you have to do is plug it in."
</P>
<P>
	   The products will be available in specialty stores this year but won't be
widely available until early 2001, Levin said. Most of the products range
between $50 and $80.
</P>
<P>
	   The technology behind the technology, Home Linking Technology, could be used
to control all -- or most -- of the appliances in each home, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunbeam has created a new company, Thalia Products, Inc. to produce smart
appliances and services and to license HLT to other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the products to be showcased this weekend are Internet-ready: the
HomeHelper Kitchen Console, HandHelper Personal Digital Assistant and TimeHelper
Alarm Clock.
</P>
<P>
	   All three interact with the appliances.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, the clock can be used as a regular alarm clock, but also allows
the other products -- including the smoke alarm, electric blanket and coffee
maker -- to "talk" to each other automatically, without wires or any special
programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Eventually one type of communications network could be used to control all
or most of the appliances in each house. The hope is that other manufacturers
would use the Sunbeam system so that different products from different companies
can still work together, Levin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunbeam's appliances are just the latest innovations as companies work bring
advanced technology into other parts of the house.
</P>
<P>
	   Separately Friday, Iowa-based Maytag Corp. and Microsoft Corp. announced
they are joining forces to develop "smart home" appliances that will talk to
each other via computer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Imagine watching a cooking program on your interactive TV," Maytag chairman
Lloyd D. Ward said in a statement. "You like the recipe so you choose to send it
to your fridge, which takes an inventory of ingredients needed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fridge sends back a list and places an order with your on-line grocer."
</P>
<P>
	   But some customers may not be willing to get rid of their working appliances
to upgrade to the newer technology, said C. Brit Beemer, chairman of America's
Research Group, a consumer behavior and strategic marketing firm based in
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   "One of the problems with new technology products is, are we pushing the
consumer beyond the envelope?" he said. "No manufacturer has made a real attempt
to educate the marketplace about what these products are about."

<HEADLINE> Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Rows upon rows of Cuban mothers -- hundreds visibly pregnant,
others carrying small children -- marched along a seaside boulevard in Havana on
Friday as Fidel Castro's government appealed to emotion in demanding the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bring back our son!'' the women cried, waving Cuban flags as they moved
slowly up the Malecon coastal highway to the American diplomatic mission in
Havana. ``We want our son!''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in what it
called the ``March of the Combatant Mothers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protest marked a return to the larger demonstrations of early December,
when hundreds of thousands of people rallied in some of Cuba's biggest
gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that brought Castro to power 41
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, the boy at the center of the international dispute, was found
clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother,
stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been
staying with relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday was the U.S. government's original deadline for Elian return to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
earlier ruled that only the father can speak for Elian on immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in
Miami a chance to fight for the boy in federal court. Reno said this week that
only a federal court has jurisdiction in the case and rejected a Florida state
judge's order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments by his
American relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   A sign outside the American diplomatic mission in Havana on Friday showed a
portrait of the first-grader behind a chain-link fence, underscoring Cuba's
position that the boy has been ``kidnapped'' by relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's young stepmother, Nelsy, was at the head of the massive march,
pushing his half-brother in a stroller. She was flanked by Elian's two
grandmothers and Vilma Espin, head of the Cuban Federation of Women and wife of
Raul Castro, the president's brother and armed forces minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Red, white and blue Cuban flags fluttered amid the sea of women stretching
for blocks down the Malecon as choppy ocean waves splashed against the coastal
wall. A few men and children also joined the march.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his sea rescue, Elian has been increasingly referred to in Cuba as
``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long ideological
battle with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a clash between two governments,
the dispute over Elian is a battle between Cubans of differing political views
living on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with ABC's ``Nightline,'' Gonzalez, 31, expressed
growing rage and frustration over his separation from his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, expressed her own despair in
recent days, saying that her dead daughter will not rest until Elian is back in
Cuba. Elisabeth Brotons, Elian's mother, was among 11 people who died when their
boat sank off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is fighting to keep the boy
with him in Miami, saying he can give the child a better life outside Cuba. He
and others who oppose the boy's return to Cuba say that Brotons died to give the
boy freedom in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Saying that keeping Elian there out of respect for my daughter's will is a
bunch of lies,'' Rodriguez told Cuban journalists this week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can see that none of them know her,'' she said, referring to the
statements made by Elian's relatives in Miami about her daughter. ``I was her
mother and I knew her better than anyone.''

<HEADLINE> High Court Takes on Gays in Scouts  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking on emotional issues of free speech and
homosexuality, the Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether the Boy Scouts
of America can exclude gays as members and troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will decide whether the organization had a
constitutional right to oust a young troop leader after learning he is gay. The
court is expected to hear arguments in April and issue a decision by July.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's highest court ruled last summer that the Boy Scouts' denial of
membership to homosexual boys and leaders violated a state law banning
discrimination in public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Scouts' lawyer contends that law violated the organization's rights
of free speech and free association under the Constitution's First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Scouting adheres to a moral belief ... that homosexual conduct is not
moral,'' the Scouts' lawyer, George A. Davidson, said after the high court
granted review Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   An openly gay person would not be a proper Scout role model, Davidson said,
adding, ``Boy Scouting is really all about sending messages. The message is that
you should be morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the attorney for James Dale, the former assistant scoutmaster whose
leadership role was revoked, said opposition to homosexuality is not one of the
Scouts' main purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As gay people we know how important the First Amendment is,'' said lawyer
Evan Wolfson of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``Their First
Amendment rights are not being interfered with. The members did not join the Boy
Scouts for bigotry in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dale was 20 and an assistant scoutmaster of a Matawan, N.J., troop when in
1990 he was identified in a newspaper article as co-president of a campus
lesbian and gay student group at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
	   He previously had attained the rank of Eagle, which only 2 percent of all
Scouts achieve, and had been elected to the Order of the Arrow, a Scouting honor
society.
</P>
<P>
	   The Scouts' Monmouth Council revoked Dale's registration as an adult leader.
Dale was told the Boy Scouts ``does not admit avowed homosexuals to membership
in the organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dale sued the Monmouth Council and the national organization in 1992,
contending they violated the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. His lawsuit
seeks reinstatement and monetary damages.
</P>
<P>
	   A state trial judge threw out the case, ruling that the Boy Scouts is not a
place of public accommodation and therefore is not covered by the law. But an
appeals court and the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled for Dale.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court rejected the organization's argument that accepting
homosexuals would violate the Scout Oath's commitment to remain ``morally
straight'' and the Scout Law's commitment to remain ``clean.''
</P>
<P>
	   Its decision added: ``The Boy Scouts' expulsion of Dale is based on little
more than prejudice and not on a unified Boy Scout position.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Scouts' appeal to the nation's highest court said the New Jersey court
decision leaves many organizations vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Almost any organization could find itself a victim of a court's desire to
foster social change by forcing social private associations to conform to its
idea of egalitarian values,'' the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal relied on a 1995 decision in which the justices said the sponsor
of Boston's St. Patrick's Day Parade should not be forced to let a group of gays
and lesbians participate. The court said parades are ``a form of expression''
and private sponsors cannot be forced to include ``a group imparting a message
the organizers do not wish to convey.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Dale's lawyers contend his case should be governed by a series of
Supreme Court decisions dealing with state public accommodations laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The court ruled in 1984 that states may force the Jaycees, a group dedicated
to developing America's future leaders, to admit women as full members. Three
years later, the court ruled that states may force Rotary International to admit
women as members.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, the court said New York City can bar discrimination against women
and minorities by clubs with more than 400 members.
</P>
<P>
	   None of those decisions dealt with gay rights, however, an issue the court
has visited on a few occasions in the last two decades but never seemed eager to
tackle. For example, the justices repeatedly have turned away challenges to
President Clinton's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military.

<HEADLINE> Indians: Ruling Can't Be Challenged  </HEADLINE>
   By MATT KELLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backing a judge's decision to personally oversee reform
of a $500 million trust fund system for Indians, lawyers for the Indians told an
appeals court Friday that the Justice Department does not have the authority to
challenge that ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled last month that the Interior and
Treasury departments had badly mismanaged more than 300,000 trust accounts for
decades. He ruled that the departments' plans to fix the problems could work,
and he kept for himself the job of overseeing the reform efforts to ensure they
succeed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court Jan. 3 to hear a
challenge to that ruling, arguing that Lamberth did not have the power to watch
over reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the Indians responded Friday by arguing that the Justice
Department has no authority to appeal a ruling for the two other departments if
they do not object to it. Interior and Treasury officials had hailed Lamberth's
ruling because he did not put the troubled trust system into receivership.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is no business of Justice to appeal a decision which Interior and
Treasury are plainly satisfied with and indeed say they 'welcome,''' the
Indians' lawyers told the appeals court in a document filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bureau of Indian Affairs head Kevin Gover had said the decision ``is going
to help us fix the system,'' and a joint Interior-Treasury-Justice statement
said officials were ``gratified that Judge Lamberth is allowing the federal
government an opportunity to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department spokeswoman Christine Romano said Friday there was no
conflict between those statements and the request for an appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of Indians sued the Interior and Treasury departments in 1996 over
more than a century of mismanagement of the trust funds. The accounts include
proceeds from leases of Indian lands for farming, grazing, oil drilling and the
like.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamberth ruled the accounts were so mismanaged that the government cannot
say precisely how many there are or how much money should be in them. He ordered
the departments to send him progress reports every three months on their reform
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Drug Execs May Seek Medicare Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton called a pledge by drugmakers to
cooperate on a new Medicare prescription benefit for senior citizens "a very
good first step," but said he's not going to let them dodge questions about high
drug prices.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think what they're worried about is the fact that if the government
becomes a big buyer that we'll be able to bargain for lower prices at greater
volume." Clinton said Friday. "I don't think that's a bad thing. I think what
they ought to do is come sit down with us and see if we can agree on a common
approach."
</P>
<P>
	   Drug industry leaders told Clinton administration officials at a White House
meeting Wednesday that they want to try to work out a compromise on a Medicare
drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no indication that the companies are changing their fundamental
position, which has been to support improved drug coverage for the elderly
through the private sector, not directly from the government. The industry has
been worried that a government-run program could lead to price controls.
</P>
<P>
	   However, they said for the first time that they would be willing to support
drug-coverage legislation separate from a wholesale redesign of Medicare in
which more senior citizens would get all of their health care through private
health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton has proposed having the government run a Medicare drug benefit by
contracting with the same drug-purchasing management firms used by many private
health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Friday drug companies should explain why they sell drugs at lower
prices in other countries, when the U.S. government is providing them with
grants and tax credits for research.
</P>
<P>
	   "Someone should ask them how they can possibly justify the fact that
American senior citizens are now being carried across the border to Canada to
buy drugs produced in America," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Drug companies say they have no choice under government-run medical systems
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to have very serious concerns ... about the president's plan,"
said Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
of America, who was at the White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry leaders did pledge, however, to tone down negative rhetoric against
the administration proposal -- including now-famous commercials featuring an
elderly woman named Flo, who insists on keeping the government "out of my
medicine cabinet."
</P>
<P>
	   "In terms of our advocacy, including any advertising we might be involved
in, we intend to be very positive and constructive in our support of bipartisan
solutions," said Holmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether Congress and the White House can agree on the design of a Medicare
drug benefit and enact it this year remains doubtful. Congress has a shortened
session and the two political parties are looking to emphasize their differences
as elections near.
</P>
<P>
	   "The outlook for Medicare reform in 2000 remains almost as cloudy and
overcast as before the statement put out by the pharmaceutical industry," said
Marty Corry, lobbyist for the AARP, the nation's largest organization of older
adults.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to cover drug costs for patients who are not in hospitals is
considered a serious gap in Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   There is growing concern that senior citizens are being left behind as more
new drugs to treat diseases of aging are introduced, but prescription costs are
rising by more than 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic polling has found Americans of all ages are concerned about
rising drug prices, and Clinton has expressed anger at the hard line drug
companies were taking against his Medicare proposal and the negative tone of
their ads. He has promised a government study of drug pricing and is expected to
feature the issue in his State of the Union address, scheduled Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders, meanwhile, have said they support helping the elderly
pay for drugs but don't want to displace the private coverage some now have
through retirement benefits or HMOs. They have promised hearings in Congress
this year.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Georgia Open Pipeline Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS MEIXLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) -- Turkey made fresh moves Friday to show that it can
be a counterweight to Moscow, with President Suleyman Demirel meeting his
Georgian counterpart to push forward an oil deal that would bypass Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Demirel arrived in Tbilisi on Friday with more than 100 officials and
businessmen for two days of talks that will also focus on Russia's war in nearby
Chechnya. That issue is highly emotional for Georgia -- the only foreign nation
to border the breakaway republic -- and for Turkey, where some 10 percent of the
population traces its heritage to Caucasus areas like Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   Demirel and Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze met and discussed plans
to build a 1,080-mile pipeline that would start in Azerbaijan and bring oil and
gas from the rich fields of the Caspian Sea through Georgia to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil and gas would be intended for shipment to Western markets. Russia
has balked at the deal and is believed to be pressuring Georgia to slow down any
progress toward building the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   Demirel hinted that such pressure would be opposed by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turkey will continue to work for this region's integration with Europe,''
he said shortly after his arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   Turks and Russians have for centuries vied for power in the Caucasus
Mountains. That competition has started again since the fall of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil deal is worth billions of dollars. It has angered Russia, which
fears the deal will increase Western influence in an area Russia has dominated
for decades. Russia has proposed that the oil should instead flow through its
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey, though, is still pressing for the deal. The project would help
augment Turkish power in a region which is largely populated by ethnic Turks and
which Turkey considers its natural sphere of influence. Turkey also could earn
billions of dollars from the deal in pipeline construction costs and other fees.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal comes at a time when Russia is trying to batter guerrillas in
nearby Chechnya into submission. It also comes as an increasingly powerful and
prosperous Turkey is beginning to try to extend its power eastward into central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has military agreements with Azerbaijan and Georgia. Turkey's private
NTV television reported that Turkish officials expect to sign a deal shortly to
train Georgian military pilots in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   The pipeline deal is strongly supported by Washington. President Clinton
witnessed the signing in Istanbul of the initial agreement to build the
pipeline, a move clearly designed to showcase Washington's support.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey, however, always has been extremely cautious in dealing with Russia,
its far more powerful northern neighbor. Analysts said that caution makes the
pipeline project far from a done deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turkey is not going to do something unnecessarily provocative toward
Russia,'' said Alan Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in Chechnya has further jeopardized the project, highlighting
instability in the region and forcing refugees into an already impoverished
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Turkey is not strong enough to protect Georgia and Azerbaijan ... and the
two countries are not strong enough to do it themselves,'' said Michael Radu of
the Foreign Policy Research Institute of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Russia has a very strong economic and political incentive to prevent the
building of that pipeline,'' Radu said. He said the project ``is not going to
get anywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Up But Down Vs. Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against European currencies Friday after
another report showing that a strong U.S. economy still hasn't produced rapid
inflation. But the dollar retreated vs. the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0143, down from $1.0254
at the same point on Thursday. The British pound fell to $1.6345 compared with
the prior day's quote of $1.6466.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second straight day the dollar advanced amid signs that U.S.
inflation remains tame, prompting hopes the Federal Reserve won't boost interest
rates sharply to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that prices at the wholesale
level rose a modest 0.3 percent in December. On Friday, the agency said consumer
prices rose by just 0.2 percent for the month.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, in a speech Thursday night, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan delivered
many of the usual warnings about the inflationary risk posed by rising stock
prices, but struck a tone that investors failed to find alarming.
</P>
<P>
	   In yen-dollar trading, the dollar also rose at first on Friday, but
retreated to 105.70 yen by late afternoon, down from 106.13 a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5910 Swiss francs, up from 1.5720 on
Thursday, and 1.4488 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4500.
</P>
<P>
	   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Friday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9283 German marks, up from 1.9073 on
Thursday; 6.4671 French francs, up from 6.3968 the prior day; and 1,908.97
Italian lire, up from 1,888.21.

<HEADLINE> Judge refuses to grant delay in civil lawsuit over 1998 turnpike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state Superior Court judge on Friday refused to
grant any delays in the civil trial of two troopers who shot at four minority
men on the New Jersey Turnpike in April 1998.
<P>
	   Judge Paulette Sapp-Peterson ordered lawyers for state agencies and for the
two troopers implicated in the shooting to begin producing documents and
scheduling legal interviews, or "depositions," as requested by attorneys who
filed a civil right lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the men, three of whom were wounded by the gunfire, contend
their clients were stopped because they were minorities, a practice known as
"racial profiling." They accuse the State Police of teaching troopers on patrol
to use racial profiling, and state officials of condoning it, for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspended troopers in the case, John Hogan and James Kenna, have been
indicted for attempted murder for the shooting. In an unrelated indictment, they
are accused of falsifying traffic stop records to conceal racial profiling in
other traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
	   Sapp-Peterson said she would carefully monitor the so-called "discovery"
proceedings to ensure that Hogan and Kenna are not forced to answer questions
that could harm their ability to defend themselves at their criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
	   But the judge said the civil trial would not begin until well into 2001 at
the earliest even if discovery begins now, and she could not condone further
postponement. "It can't be said that the criminal case is proceeding forward at
a sufficient pace," the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sapp-Peterson said her ruling in part was based on a significant public
interest in the case as it has a bearing on the racial profiling controversy
embroiling the State Police. "The court cannot say the public has no interest in
the resolution of these issues," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Cole, an attorney for the state and the State Police, said the
recent legal settlement between Attorney General John Farmer and the U.S.
Justice Department regarding discrimination ended any need to address the public
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   The work in preparing for the civil trial would include taking depositions
from Hogan and Kenna. Lawyers for the four men could question the troopers about
the shooting and about their training, practices and supervision.
</P>
<P>
	   The troopers' lawyers wanted these sorts of proceedings put off until after
the criminal indictments are resolved by trial or plea bargain.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for state agencies named in the civil lawsuit also sought a delay
because they also need to question Kenna and Hogan to prepare their defense.
</P>
<P>
	   "The fact that we can't ask those questions at depositions very much
concerns us," Cole said. "Our case might be that they were acting outside the
scope of employment, so we would want to have the ability to do that. If we
don't have that ability, we are hurt."
</P>
<P>
	   One of the wounded men, Danny Reyes, was in the courtroom to listen to the
lawyers argue technical points that will determine when he gets his day in
court.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm glad to see that the case can go forward because it's been a long time.
It's going to be two years, and I hope it doesn't have to be another two years
to have to go to court," Reyes said. "It's like I've almost put my life at a
standstill, because I can't move on."
</P>
<P>
	   The legal team representing the four men is headed by Johnnie Cochran and
Barry Scheck, although neither celebrity lawyer appeared in the Trenton
courtroom Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Aside from Hogan and Kenna, the civil lawsuit names and seeks monetary
damages from the state government, New Jersey State Police, four former State
Police superintendents and the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's courtroom action concerned the request to postpone discovery
proceedings, but it also provided the first full court hearing on the matter.
Attorneys for the four men made it clear they intend to put on trial the entire
State Police and, through them, the state officials responsible for monitoring
their activities.
</P>
<P>
	   One attorney, Peter Neufeld, said 95 percent of the information he is
seeking from the state involves training and management practices, not sensitive
details of the shooting incident that could impugn Hogan and Kenna.
</P>
<P>
	   Another attorney, David Ironman, said, "Certainly, it is going to be an
essential part of the case, more particularly, their training, their
supervisors, when they learned to do what they did and how they learned how to
do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Ironman said the recent settlement with the U.S. Justice Department does not
satisfy him that adequate measures are in place to protect black and Hispanic
motorists from discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   "The consent decree didn't work before. Why do they think it is going to
work this time," Ironman said. "Maybe the only way to change it is if the state
of New Jersey gets hit over the head with a large money verdict."

<HEADLINE> Report cites state, Ocean County for Barnegat Bay preservation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BARNEGAT, N.J. (AP) - A new report by a national conservation
organization cites Barnegat Bay as a prime example of how land conservation can
be used to help keep drinking water clean.
<P>
	   The report by the Trust for Public Land calls New Jersey a national leader
in conservation and says federal, state and county money has helped buy 120,000
acres for protection, creating natural barriers that block pollutants from
reaching the Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   While the report does not quantify the amount of drinking water protected by
conservation, it says the natural barriers protect not only the Bay itself, but
also nearby fresh water sources.
</P>
<P>
	   "Building Green Infrastructure: Land Conservation as a Watershed Protection
Strategy," which was published with money supplied by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, cites four communities where the preservation of watersheds
has helped preserve water quality.
</P>
<P>
	   The others are Austin, Texas; Mountain Island Lake, N.C., and Indian River,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnegat Bay, which is about 40 miles long and one to four miles wide, is
particularly sensitive to pollution because it is shallow and shielded from the
ocean by barrier islands.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the low rate of "tidal exchange," it takes 50 days for the
water to turn over completely, prolonging the amount of time that pollutants
remain in the bay, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the pollutants: wildlife waste, power boat discharge, septic systems
and more distant sources such as lawn pesticides and motor oil deposited from
highways.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Ocean County voters approved a Natural Lands Trust tax that raises
about $4 million annually for protection of watersheds and farmlands.
</P>
<P>
	   The Trust for Public Land, meanwhile, has worked with property owners and
the government to protect 31 properties totaling over 5,500 acres within the
Barnegat Bay watershed, according to the report, which was released this week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not just putting it out to say how great we are," said Mark
Goodenough, a Trust for Public Land field representative in Morristown. "We're
putting it out so groups can read it, think about it and tailor what we did here
and in the other places to their specific needs."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the goal of such efforts is to balance growth with conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The message here is that reasonable growth can coexist nicely with natural
legacies and natural values. Ocean County has a booming population, between the
Parkway and the retirement communities and the beaches," Goodenough said. "We're
not looking to stop development, we're just making sure that the pieces that are
the most important, from a watershed protection standpoint, get protected."

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Weighs Partial Birth  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reclaimed center stage in the legal and
moral war over abortion Friday by agreeing to decide whether states may ban a
surgical procedure opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for
doctors to perform such abortions. A federal appeals court has blocked
enforcement of that law, calling it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly identical laws have been enacted by 30 states, but courts have
blocked enforcement of most of them. Congress enacted a federal ban on
partial-birth abortions but President Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
	   The court has not issued a major abortion ruling since 1992 when it
reaffirmed the core holding of its 1972 decision in a case called Roe vs. Wade.
That landmark decision said women have a constitutional right to end their
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the legal controversy swirls around a specific procedure, far more
may be at stake. Abortion-rights advocates say the court's eventual decision
could broadly safeguard -- or dramatically erode -- abortion rights, depending
on what state legislatures can consider when regulating abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear arguments in the Nebraska case in April. A decision is
expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgical procedure involves partially extracting a fetus, legs first,
through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining its contents.
Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the method dilation
and extraction, or D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
	   In unanimously striking down the Nebraska law, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said the law's wording could also outlaw a more common procedure called
dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of women to choose
whether to have an abortion,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after the Nebraska law was struck down along with those in Iowa and
Arkansas, nearly identical abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin were upheld
by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   That created a direct conflict legal experts predicted would require the
Supreme Court's final word.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A constitutional crisis is calling out for a remedy,'' said
abortion-rights advocate Janet Benshoof of the Center for Reproductive Law &AMP;
Policy. ``What's at issue is whether a woman's interest in her health can be
trumped by a state legislature's moral and political statement about a fetus.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns said, ``I feel strongly that states should
have the right to legislate in the area of partial-birth abortion. It's a
barbaric procedure that I hope is brought to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Don Stenberg agreed, adding, ``It shocks the
conscience that in the United States of America a human child can be literally
pulled from the womb and cruelly killed by having his or her skull punctured and
brain suctioned out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stenberg's Supreme Court appeal was bold. He not only urged the court to
reinstate the ban on the D&AMP;X procedure but also asked the justices to reverse
past rulings and give states a free hand to more stringently restrict, or even
outlaw, all abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The brief order issued by the court Friday indicated the justices will not
consider that request.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers representing a doctor who performs abortions in Nebraska urged the
justices to reject Stenberg's appeal because the appeals court correctly
concluded that the law would interfere with most abortions performed after a
woman's third month of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, reached by a 5-4
vote, upheld partial-birth abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin by
``rewriting'' the state laws in an attempt to limit their impact.
</P>
<P>
	   The 7th Circuit court said state abortion laws can be motivated by ``moral''
revulsion to some procedures so long as they ``do not harm women's legitimate
interests.'' An abortion law can pass constitutional muster even if it outlaws
procedures that may be the safest method of ending a small number of women's
pregnancies, that court said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case granted Friday is Stenberg vs. Carhart, 99-830.

<HEADLINE> Engine Blamed in Libya Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The pilot of a Swiss plane that crashed into the
Mediterranean Sea said the engines failed and he had no option but to attempt an
emergency landing off the coast of Libya, a Swiss airline official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The twin-engine propeller plane struck the water near an oil refinery in
Marsa el-Brega on Thursday, killing at least 17 people. The Libyan pilot and 18
other people survived the crash. Five people were missing.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilot reported that both engines cut out in quick succession as the
plane came in to land, said Eddy Meyer, head of flight operations for
Zurich-based Avisto AG air services company, which owns the plane.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In such a situation it's as if you are flying into a wall,'' Meyer told
reporters Friday in Oberglatt, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was good at the time of the crash, and the crew was experienced,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash was not immediately clear. An investigation was to
begin Saturday, when British crash experts were to arrive in Libya.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swiss Transportation Ministry said Friday that the Libyan General Civil
Aviation Authority will lead the investigation. The Libyans are to be helped by
British and Swiss experts, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, salvage workers were preparing to recover the wreckage of the
plane, which is resting in 165 feet of water, Swiss officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   All 38 passengers, mostly Britons or Libyans, were employees of a Libyan oil
company, said Avisto chairman Franz Fassbind. Libyan media identified the
company as the state-run oil firm Sirte. There also were three crew members.
</P>
<P>
	   One Briton who survived suffered a broken leg and a broken toe, his wife
said. Richard Dalton, Britain's ambassador to Libya, said the other six British
survivors sustained minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,000 Britons work in Libya's oil industry, with many based at the
center in Marsa el-Brega, 280 miles east of the capital, Tripoli. The plane was
flying from Tripoli to Marsa el-Brega. There were no Americans on the plane.

rates will be rising only slightly. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 140.55 to a new closing high of 11,722.98, easily
topping yesterday's record. The new closing high was the third this
week and the fourth since the start of 2000. Broader market
measures also finished with solid gains. The Nasdaq composite index
rose 107.28 to 4,064.49. Technology stocks led the Dow and the
Nasdaq, with industry leaders Intel and Microsoft accounting for a
major portion of the market's advance. Intel was up 12 at 103 1/16;

	   Prices Jump 2.7 Percent in 1999
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices rose 2.7 percent last year,
the biggest increase in three years. Energy prices were largely
responsible. The Labor Department, announcing the figure, noted
that not counting energy and food, the ``core'' rate of inflation
was only to 1.9 percent last year. For December, the Consumer Price
Index was up 0.2 percent, less than many analysts were forecasting.

	   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at First Union Corp.
fell 15 percent compared to the same quarter in 1998, though the
bank met Wall Street expectations. The nation's sixth-largest bank
reported operating earnings of $846 million in the three months
ended Dec. 31, compared to $993 million in the last quarter of
1998. Per-share profit -- excluding merger-related and restructuring
charges -- dipped to 86 cents, which was in line with the estimate
of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. Earnings per share were $1
in the year-ago quarter. For 1999, the bank reported operating net
income of $3.48 billion, or $3.60 a share, compared to $3.69
billion, or $3.77 a share, for 1998.

	   Glaxo, SmithKline Renew Talks

<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- British pharmaceutical heavyweights Glaxo Wellcome
PLC and SmithKline Beecham PLC said today that they've resumed
merger talks. If successful, a union between them would create the
world's largest drugmaker. Talks collapsed two years ago over
differences between their top executives. The renewal highlights
the pressure that even the biggest pharmaceutical firms are under
to consolidate with industry rivals as a way to afford the rising
costs of developing and selling new medicines. The announcement
came just a day after Pfizer Inc. emerged as the likely winner in
the battle for U.S. drugmaker Warner-Lambert Co.

designing a Medicare prescription benefit for senior citizens. He
said a very good step was the drug makers' statement that they are
ready to work with the government on providing affordable optional
drug coverage and making sure older people have access to the
highest quality medications. Now, he added, positive action by the
drug firms and Congress is needed.

into print today, another step in the nation's farewell to one of
the world's strongest and most successful currencies. In less than
two years, the mark will disappear when Germany and 10 other
countries introduce the new euro currency as cash on Jan. 1, 2002.
German central bank chief Ernst Welteke, who gave the go-ahead at
the printing presses, said the final run of purple 10-mark bills
``ended a chapter of German currency history.''

	   Mannesmann Argues Against Vodafone

	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German telecom Mannesmann AG took its
case to shareholders today with detailed graphs and charts meant to
persuade them that going alone would generate higher stock prices
than if they sold out to British rival Vodafone AirTouch PLC.
Mannesmann's 47-page defense document was intended to demonstrate
that the German telecom company was strong enough to withstand the
biggest hostile takeover bid in history. Vodafone chief Chris Gent
described the move as ``desperate.'' He added it offered nothing
new to the debate about whether Mannesmann shareholders should
accept his company's all-stock, $137.6 billion bid. Shareholders
have until Feb. 7 to reply to the offer from Vodafone.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are drafting the rules to
spell out how consumers' personal information will be protected as
barriers between financial businesses come down. Legislation
enacted in November allows banks, investment firms and insurance
companies to get involved in each other's businesses. But it's less
widely known that the law's privacy provisions also reach a variety
of ``money'' businesses including consumer finance companies,
department stores that issue credit cards, money transmitters and
money-order businesses, debt collection agencies, credit bureaus

	   Studios Unaware of Anti-Drug Plan
</P>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The bosses of several studios that
produce prime-time TV shows said today they were angry that the
networks had been working with President Clinton's drug policy
adviser to insert anti-drug messages in programs. Five studio
heads, responsible for shows like ``ER,'' ``The Drew Carey Show''
and ``The Simpsons,'' all said they were unaware the networks were
offered financial incentives by the government if certain programs
preached against drugs. Gail Berman, president of Regency
Television, which makes ``Malcolm in the Middle'' and ``Roswell,
said ``It's inappropriate for government to participate in this way
in the production of television.'' Clinton's drug advisers said
they had consulted with ``ER'' writers.

	   Treasury Dept. Redeeming 1975 Bonds
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is redeeming $4.2 billion of
30-year bonds issued in 1975 to help pare down interest payments on
the national debt, the Treasury Department announced today. It's
the first bond redemption by the government since 1996. The
national debt stands at $5.76 trillion. Redeeming the bonds, which
carry an interest rate of 8 1/4 percent, before they reach maturity
will save the government around $800 million in interest payments.
The bonds' maturity date is May 15, 2005. In a separate move, the
Clinton administration said yesterday that it has adopted rules
allowing the government to buy back up to $30 billion of the
national debt this year.

<HEADLINE> Clearasil inventor Ivan Combe dead at 88  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) - Ivan DeBlois Combe, the inventor of Clearasil,
the acne cream that helped millions of pimply-faced baby boomers get through the
awkward teen-age years, has died at 88.
<P>
	   Combe died Tuesday in Greenwich Hospital as the result of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, Combe got the idea for Clearasil after talking to teen-agers and
pharmacists about the need for an acne product that actually worked. He asked a
chemist to create a formula that would dry up pimples, then cover them with a
flesh-colored cream.
</P>
<P>
	   He named the product "Clearasil" to capitalize on every teen-ager's dream of
having clear skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe peddled the new product himself to drug stores across the country, but
store owners were reluctant to buy another acne product when so many others had
failed. Finally, Combe gave out free tubes of Clearasil to store owners in
exchange for a promise to order more if the product sold. It did.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales skyrocketed after Combe began advertising Clearasil on the popular
teen-age dance show "American Bandstand" in 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   Dick Clark, the rock 'n' roll icon who hosted the television show from 1952
to 1989, remembers reading dozens of different Clearasil advertisements in the
early days of the show.
</P>
<P>
	   "We became sort of synonymous - Dick Clark, Bandstand and Clearasil - we
were tied together," Clark said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Clark said Clearasil tapped into a huge market of teen-agers eager to try
something new to get rid of pimples.
</P>
<P>
	   "That was pretty much it on the market then," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
	   "As adults we say, 'Don't worry, your face will clear up,' but it really is
an emotional and sometimes stressful thing for kids."
</P>
<P>
	   Combe's son, Chris, said his father received hundreds of letters over the
years from grateful teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
	   "They'd say, 'I became a cheerleader because of Clearasil' or 'I got invited
to the prom because of Clearasil,' " he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1960, Vick Chemical bought the Clearasil business from Combe's company,
Combe Inc. Procter &AMP; Gamble bought Clearasil in 1985. Today, the company sells a
line of 25 different Clearasil products, including the traditional acne cream,
as well as soap, astringent and cleansing pads.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe began rebuilding his business by finding a niche in products used to
help embarrassing health and beauty problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1960s, Combe acquired Grecian Formula 16, the men's haircoloring
product, and Lanacane, the itch cream. In the '70s and '80s, he introduced
Odor-Eaters foot care products, Vagisil feminine care products and Just for Men,
the men's hair color product.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was always a great student of human nature and always trying to start
with the need rather than the product. He would say, 'What need can I fill
that's not being filled?' " said Chris Combe, who is now president of Combe
Inc., a health and beauty products company based in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivan Combe was born April 21, 1911, in Fremont, Iowa. He was raised in
Greenville, Ill., where he was a high school tennis champion, and graduated from
Northwestern University in 1933. He had lived in Greenwich since 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe is survived by his wife Mary Elizabeth, three children and seven
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   A memorial service was scheduled for Saturday in Greenwich.

<HEADLINE> Police shooting victim's family files complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The family of a hammer-wielding man killed by police
filed a complaint Friday charging officers with firing at Gary Busch while he
fled and accused Police Commissioner Howard Safir of making false statements to
justify the shooting.
<P>
	   "He didn't attack anybody ... and never had," Busch's mother, Doris Busch
Boskey, said before filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
"They knew that he wasn't a threat, they knew he posed no danger. ... He was
trying to get away. Why would anyone go toward six or more police officers?"
</P>
<P>
	   The family said Safir and other police officials distorted the truth in
public statements after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "He specifically first demonized my brother," said Glen Busch, Gary's
brother. "This starts from the top and works its way down."
</P>
<P>
	   Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, did not respond to a call seeking
comment. A Brooklyn grand jury concluded in November that the shooting was
justified because it was reasonable for the patrolmen to believe that Busch was
a threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Safir has said that decision shows the grand jury did not find any conflict
in the officers' stories or actions and that they acted within the law and NYPD
guidelines on physical force.
</P>
<P>
	   Busch's death on Aug. 30, 1999, prompted street protests in Borough Park,
Brooklyn, the predominantly Orthodox Jewish neighborhood where he lived, and
raised questions about how police deal with emotionally disturbed people.
</P>
<P>
	   Police came to Busch's home after receiving reports that he was threatening
people with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
	   The department said that when officers ordered Busch, 31, out of his
basement apartment, he flew into a rage and charged up the stairs swinging an
11-inch hammer. One officer tried - but failed - to stop him with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
	   His family's CCRB complaint charged the officers involved in the shooting
with excessive force and abuse of authority.
</P>
<P>
	   It asked the board to investigate whether the officers followed department
guidelines on dealing with the emotionally disturbed. If their actions were
within NYPD rules, then the rules must be changed, said New York Civil Liberties
Union executive director Norman Siegel, representing the family.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel said the officers' use of pepper spray on the already agitated Busch
only provoked him further.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just ... creates a crisis situation when in most of these instances if
you just wait it out you can deal with the person," Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that even though the grand jury had found the officers did not act
criminally, the board could still determine that the shooting was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   The day after the shooting, Safir said the four officers who fired the 12
shots that hit Busch used deadly force only after he refused to drop his hammer
and stop attacking two other officers. The commissioner, who cited seven
non-police witnesses, said Busch was pummeling a fallen sergeant when he was
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The family disputes that account, and accused Safir and his subordinates of
distorting the truth in public statements after Busch's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an immediate cover-up, there were stories, they had to justify
this shooting which should never have happened," Mrs. Boskey said.
</P>
<P>
	   The family's complaint asks the CCRB to investigate Safir's actions and find
out what basis he had for saying there were seven independent witnesses
confirming that police acted appropriately. Investigators were reportedly unable
to find any of the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint also asks whether the officers involved truthfully answered
questions about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Boskey, who said she had spoken to many witnesses and seen photos of
the scene, said her son was trying to get away from police when he was shot. She
described his hammer as a religious item inscribed with Hebrew writing.
</P>
<P>
	   He was trying to get away from police and find an open space to recover from
the pepper spray when he was shot, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was afraid," Mrs. Boskey said. "They had guns drawn."

<HEADLINE> Feds Urging Pilots To Report Errors  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton told airline pilots and mechanics
Friday that they will be protected if they go to the Federal Aviation
Administration as whistle-blowers on safety problems. ``Everyone must focus on
fixing problems, not fixing blame,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton appeared at the White House with officials from the FAA, the
Transportation Department, pilots unions, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines
to announce the deal. He said the plan allows airlines, labor and federal
regulators to work on aviation safety issues ``as partners, not adversaries,''
for the benefit of the flying public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Already, there is less than one fatal crash for every one million
commercial flights,'' Clinton said. ``But we know we can do better still. Any
accident, any death in the air, is still one too many.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the Aviation Safety Action Program, a public-private partnership will
be created to accept from aviation workers reports of safety problems or
concerns before they worsen, Clinton said. In turn, those who report problems
will be protected from possible reprisal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They'll be encouraged to share their valuable insights about doing a job
more safely,'' Clinton said. ``They will be freed from the fear of being
disciplined for admitting that something went wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA's ability to handle deliberate aviation rules violations, criminal
activity or drug and alcohol use will not be affected, Clinton said. ``The
experts will get the data they need to stay in front on safety, to solve
problems, evaluate existing safety systems and propose new ones,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is the result of more than a year of discussions between the
airlines, the pilots and the Clinton administration and are an outcrop of the
work done by an aviation safety commission headed by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   It aims to improve understanding of errors that cause accidents, which might
go unreported by pilots or crew members fearing reprisals or punishment for
violating FAA regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots at American Airlines and ground crew members of the Transport Workers
Union already are experimenting with safety committees that share information
among workers, airline officials and government regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the expanded deal, unionized pilots from American Airlines,
Continental Airlines and members of the Air Line Pilots Association, which
represents 50,000 pilots at 51 airlines, and others will participate in the
safety program.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilots, mechanics and other airline personnel can go to committees
established by the program with problems they observe or even errors they
themselves commit. The aim is to increase the pool of safety information to try
to stop accidents from happening.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope we'll be able to follow their example and open this program to all
the people who make airplanes fly -- flight attendants, mechanics,
dispatchers,'' Clinton said. ``When it comes to safety, everyone has a
responsibility. We want everyone on the team.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Mull Partial Birth  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reclaimed center stage in the legal and
moral war over abortion Friday by agreeing to decide whether states may ban a
surgical procedure opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for
doctors to perform such abortions. A federal appeals court has blocked
enforcement of that law, calling it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly identical laws have been enacted by 30 states, but courts have
blocked enforcement of most of them. Congress enacted a federal ban on
partial-birth abortions but President Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
	   The court has not issued a major abortion ruling since 1992 when it
reaffirmed the core holding of its 1972 decision in a case called Roe vs. Wade.
That landmark decision said women have a constitutional right to end their
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the legal controversy swirls around a specific procedure, far more
may be at stake. Abortion-rights advocates say the court's eventual decision
could broadly safeguard -- or dramatically erode -- abortion rights, depending
on what state legislatures can consider when regulating abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear arguments in the Nebraska case in April. A decision is
expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgical procedure involves partially extracting a fetus, legs first,
through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining its contents.
Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the method dilation
and extraction, or D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
	   In unanimously striking down the Nebraska law, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said the law's wording could also outlaw a more common procedure called
dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of women to choose
whether to have an abortion,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after the Nebraska law was struck down along with those in Iowa and
Arkansas, nearly identical abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin were upheld
by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   That created a direct conflict legal experts predicted would require the
Supreme Court's final word.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A constitutional crisis is calling out for a remedy,'' said
abortion-rights advocate Janet Benshoof of the Center for Reproductive Law &AMP;
Policy. ``What's at issue is whether a woman's interest in her health can be
trumped by a state legislature's moral and political statement about a fetus.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns said, ``I feel strongly that states should
have the right to legislate in the area of partial-birth abortion. It's a
barbaric procedure that I hope is brought to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Don Stenberg agreed, adding, ``It shocks the
conscience that in the United States of America a human child can be literally
pulled from the womb and cruelly killed by having his or her skull punctured and
brain suctioned out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stenberg's Supreme Court appeal was bold. He not only urged the court to
reinstate the ban on the D&AMP;X procedure but also asked the justices to reverse
past rulings and give states a free hand to more stringently restrict, or even
outlaw, all abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The brief order issued by the court Friday indicated the justices will not
consider that request.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers representing a doctor who performs abortions in Nebraska urged the
justices to reject Stenberg's appeal because the appeals court correctly
concluded that the law would interfere with most abortions performed after a
woman's third month of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, reached by a 5-4
vote, upheld partial-birth abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin by
``rewriting'' the state laws in an attempt to limit their impact.
</P>
<P>
	   The 7th Circuit court said state abortion laws can be motivated by ``moral''
revulsion to some procedures so long as they ``do not harm women's legitimate
interests.'' An abortion law can pass constitutional muster even if it outlaws
procedures that may be the safest method of ending a small number of women's
pregnancies, that court said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case granted Friday is Stenberg vs. Carhart, 99-830.

<HEADLINE> Summers Calls on U.S. Allies  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN CRUTSINGER AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States, which served as the locomotive of
world growth during the two-year Asian crisis, is now looking to Japan and
Europe to make greater efforts to spur the global economy, Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A welcome consequence of the recent upturn in conditions outside the
United States is that it is moving us away from a time when we found ourselves
to be the main engine of global growth,'' Summers said, previewing the agenda
for a Jan. 22 meeting in Tokyo of top finance officials of the world's seven
richest industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Achieving sustained and stable growth with increasing balance in the
pattern of expansion ... will and must be the first item on the G-7 agenda,''
Summers told an audience at the Institute of International Economics, a
Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will represent the
United States at the Tokyo discussions.
</P>
<P>
	   While the U.S. economy is enjoying the lowest unemployment in three decades
and an expansion that next month will become the longest on record, one blot on
that performance has been a soaring trade deficit, which has led to growing
trade frictions between the United States and its major trading partners, Europe
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said now that Asian crisis countries were recovering and Japan's
economy had rebounded from recession, it was time to emphasize more balanced
global growth. He called on both Japan and Europe to promote ``strong
domestically generated growth.''
</P>
<P>
	   This would help lower America's soaring trade deficit, he said, both by
promoting greater sales of U.S. exports.
</P>
<P>
	   Europe and Japan could improve economic performance by cutting government
red tape, Summers said, citing statistics from the Paris-based Organization for
Economic Co-operation and Development that showed it takes 12 times longer to
set up a new business in Europe than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers noted that the Japanese government has ``committed itself to
maintaining a supportive fiscal stance'' regarding tax cuts and increased
government spending to keep the recovery alive until private demand strengthens.
</P>
<P>
	   Another issue G-7 officials will discuss in Tokyo will be the search to find
a successor to Michel Camdessus, the International Monetary Fund's managing
director who has announced plans to step down in February.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress heavily criticized the IMF for its handling of the Asian financial
crisis and Summers last month signaled that the administration plans to push for
major reforms of IMF operations.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to a question, Summers said Friday that it was important for the
IMF to have ``strong leadership,'' but he refused to reveal whether the United
States had a favorite candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany has been pushing German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser
while Japan would like to see Eisuke Sakakibara, a former top official in
Japan's Finance Ministry, become the first Asian to head the IMF.
</P>
<P>
	   It is unlikely the deadlock will be resolved at the Tokyo G-7 discussions
and it is possible that Camdessus' deputy, Stanley Fischer, a former
Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, could serve until the dispute
is resolved.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers indicated another discussion item will be a search for ways to
launch a new round of global trade liberalization talks. The World Trade
Organization failed to get the talks started last month at a Seattle meeting
marked by violent street protests against globalization.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers said
</P>
<P>
	   One important lesson of the Seattle failure was that ``just as war is too
important to be left to generals, trade is too important to be left to trade
negotiators,'' Summers said. A much greater effort must be made to increase
political support for free trade by showing the broad benefits a country gains
by lowering barriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the Jan. 22 meeting, Summers was scheduled to travel to India and
Indonesia for meetings with top government officials. He was leaving Washington
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   India strongly opposed U.S. negotiating proposals in Seattle, while
Indonesia was one of the countries hardest hit by the Asian crisis.

<HEADLINE> First Union Meets Expectations  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL NOWELL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Fourth-quarter earnings at First Union Corp. fell 15
percent compared to the same quarter in 1998, though the bank met Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's sixth-largest bank reported operating earnings of $846 million
in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared to $993 million in the last quarter
of 1998. Per-share profit -- excluding merger-related and restructuring charges
-- dipped to 86 cents, which was in line with the estimate of analysts surveyed
by First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Earnings per share were $1 in the year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   For 1999, the bank reported operating net income of $3.48 billion, or $3.60
a share, compared to $3.69 billion, or $3.77 a share, for 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The Charlotte-based banking company said net income for the year included
nonrecurring gains of 20 cents a share related to the sale of its interest in
Electronic Payment Services Inc. and the sale of factoring assets. Excluding the
one-time gains, earnings amounted to $3.3 billion, or $3.40 a share.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of 1999, First Union had assets of $253 billion and stockholders'
equity of $17 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   First Union's earnings were down throughout 1999 as the company has
struggled to deal with tripling its size in recent years through acquisitions
such as CoreStates Financial Corp. of Philadelphia and The Money Store.
</P>
<P>
	   First Union lost 20 percent of CoreStates' 2 million customers since First
Union completed the acquisition in April 1998. Many of the customers said they
were frustrated with the bank's handling of basic services as well as the bank's
lack of commitment to lending to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   First Union provides banking services to 16 million retail and corporate
customers throughout the East Coast and the nation. The company operates
full-service banking offices in 12 East Coast states and the District of
Columbia and full-service brokerage offices in 41 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of First Union, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, rose 87 1/2
cents to $34.87 1/2 a share as of 5:30 p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart CEO David Glass Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Glass, the man who turned Wal-Mart Stores Inc. into
the world's biggest retailer from a chain catering to small-town America,
stepped down Friday in a move that was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Glass, 64, succeeded Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton as CEO 12 years ago. Lee
Scott, who has been the company's chief operating officer and vice chairman for
the past year, is taking over as CEO and president.
</P>
<P>
	   "Glass had a global vision for this company that catapulted Wal-Mart to grow
in ways that most never anticipated it could," said Walter Loeb, who runs the
New York-based retail consulting firm Loeb Associates. "Lee Scott, just like
David Glass, really understands this company, and Wal-Mart won't miss a beat as
it moves forward."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors took Friday's announcement in stride, with New York Stock
Exchange-listed Wal-Mart slipping 62 1/2 cents to $64.50 a share as of 5:30 p.m.
EST. Wal-Mart is one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott was tapped about a year ago to succeed Glass, who will remain with
Wal-Mart for at least the next year as chairman of the executive committee of
the board of directors. After that, Glass plans on devoting more time to
baseball, "a great passion all my life," and his association with the Kansas
City Royals.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second time in as many days that a chief executive of a
world-class corporation stepped down. On Thursday, Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, unexpectedly promoted company president Steve Ballmer to the additional
job of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Glass' greatest achievements was taking Wal-Mart out of middle
America and making it a global brand. It now is one of the biggest corporations
in the world, rivaling giants like General Motors and Ford.
</P>
<P>
	   The first Wal-Mart opened in Rogers, Ark., in 1962 by Walton and his brother
James "Bud" Walton, who saw a demand for discount stores in small towns that
were underserved by larger chains.
</P>
<P>
	   The foundation of their business: Keep prices low and never falter on
customer service.
</P>
<P>
	   Those principles haven't changed. Today, Wal-Mart is more price competitive
than ever before and that smiley-face service still is found throughout the
company, starting with the bubbly "greeters" who stand at the entrance of each
store.
</P>
<P>
	   When Glass took the helm in 1988, the company had 1,200 stores and was the
nation's third-largest retailer. Sales totaled $16 billion that year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Walton died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, Wal-Mart now operates more than 2,485 Wal-Mart discount stores and 456
Sam's Clubs wholesale stores in the United States, plus about 1,000 stores
around the globe. Wal-Mart is expected to bring in $165 billion in sales for the
fiscal year ending Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 100 million people shop at Wal-Mart each week, and the company
employs about a million people.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sam Walton steered clear of certain challenges. He conquered the
countryside but left the cities alone," said Burt Flickinger, managing director
of Reach Marketing in Westport, Conn. "But there was no competitive risk that
steered David away, and that aggressiveness obviously paid off for the company."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides his growth initiatives in the United States and around the world,
Glass is credited with helping build Wal-Mart's inventory and distribution
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   Vendors can exchange invoices, purchase orders and other documents with
Wal-Mart electronically. Stores are linked to the company's headquarters via
satellite, which helps them replenish and reorder inventory only when needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Its systems are so advanced that Wal-Mart knows how to position items in its
stores to achieve the best sales or quickly transfer sluggish products to stores
where they will sell.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Glass, the company also developed in the early 1990s its successful
Supercenter concept, which combines discount stores with grocery operations, and
recently began the test of its Neighborhood Markets, a stand-alone grocery
chain.
</P>
<P>
	   "They are ready to make a brutal attack on the food industry, that's their
next step for growth," said Daniel Binder, an analyst at the New York investment
firm Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said that Scott will likely continue the programs Wal-Mart has in
place, including the company's efforts on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the company announced that it was partnering with a Silicon
Valley venture capital firm to form a separate Web company called Wal-Mart.com.
In December, Wal-Mart signed a deal with America Online to create an Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
	   Online sales can only add to the company's aggressive plans going forward.
Flickinger believes that Wal-Mart's sales will hit $250 billion by 2003, which
he said will exceed the combined revenues of the next six to seven global
competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott's experience at Wal-Mart is vast.
</P>
<P>
	   He began his career in 1979 in the logistics department, and eventually
helped build the company's distribution centers. Five years ago, he moved into
the merchandising and store side of the business, and in 1998, he was named
president and CEO of the Wal-Mart stores division.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Anti-Drug Efforts  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The bosses of several studios that produce
prime-time TV shows said Friday they were angry that the networks had been
working with President Clinton's drug policy adviser to insert anti-drug
messages in programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Five studio heads, responsible for shows like "ER," "The Drew Carey Show"
and "The Simpsons," all said they were unaware the networks were offered
financial incentives by the government if certain programs preached against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's appalling," said Gail Berman, president of Regency Television,
which makes "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Roswell." "It's inappropriate for
government to participate in this way in the production of television."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's drug advisers said they had consulted with "ER" writers, and even
said they believed a recent episode in which a teen-ager came into the emergency
room suffering from alcohol abuse was a result of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Roth, president of Warner Brothers Television, which makes "ER" for
NBC, said neither he nor "ER" producer John Wells was aware of the government's
efforts. Roth said he would never demand his producers or writers reflect a
particular point of view on a social issue, even if there were a financial
benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton denied that his drug office was trying to rob TV networks of
creative freedom through the policy.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no attempt to regulate content or tell people what they had to
put into it," he said Friday. "Of course, I wouldn't support that."
</P>
<P>
	   The government spends millions of dollars each year to buy ads on network TV
for anti-drug public service announcements. Recently, it has been forfeiting
some of the time it had bought if the networks could prove they inserted
anti-drug messages into programs. That enables the networks to make more money
by selling ad time to other clients.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and the WB have all acknowledged letting the White House
press office review the scripts of some of their programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said he'd like all elements of popular
culture to join the effort to send a strong message about the dangers of drugs,
especially to children.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just think it's important to get the anti-drug message out in as many
ways as we can," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from Clinton's drug office were in Pasadena on Friday to release a
study that concludes television generally does better than movies or music when
it comes to depicting drug, alcohol and tobacco use responsibly. The study
encompassed a period in which the officials were quietly working with the
networks to get their message across.
</P>
<P>
	   David Kissinger, president of Studio USA, who oversees production of "Law &AMP;
Order" and "Xena: Warrior Princess," said he believed the cooperation between
the government and networks is both wrong and destined to be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
	   "The best way for television shows to reflect values the society regards as
important is for the producers to actually care about them and not for the
government to impose it on them," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Newman, president of 20th Century Fox and responsible for "The
Simpsons" and "Ally McBeal," said he was unaware of the government's efforts and
opposed to them, as did Steve McPherson, executive vice president of Touchstone
Television, which produces "Sports Night" and "Felicity."

<HEADLINE> Police shooting victim's family files complaint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The family of a hammer-wielding man killed by police
filed a complaint Friday charging officers with firing at Gary Busch while he
fled and accused Police Commissioner Howard Safir of making false statements to
justify the shooting.
<P>
	   "He didn't attack anybody ... and never had," Busch's mother, Doris Busch
Boskey, said before filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
"They knew that he wasn't a threat, they knew he posed no danger. ... He was
trying to get away. Why would anyone go toward six or more police officers?"
</P>
<P>
	   The family said Safir and other police officials distorted the truth in
public statements after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   "He specifically first demonized my brother," said Glen Busch, Gary's
brother. "This starts from the top and works its way down."
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy police chief Thomas Fahey said in a statement that the matter had
been fully investigated and that both the police department and the Brooklyn
district attorney found the officers involved in the shooting acted properly. He
declined through a spokesman to respond specifically to the allegations about
Safir's statements.
</P>
<P>
	   A Brooklyn grand jury concluded in November that the shooting was justified
because it was reasonable for the patrolmen to believe that Busch was a threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Busch's death on Aug. 30, 1999, prompted street protests in Borough Park,
Brooklyn, the predominantly Orthodox Jewish neighborhood where he lived, and
raised questions about how police deal with emotionally disturbed people.
</P>
<P>
	   Police came to Busch's home after receiving reports that he was threatening
people with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
	   The department said that when officers ordered Busch, 31, out of his
basement apartment, he flew into a rage and charged up the stairs swinging an
11-inch hammer. One officer tried - but failed - to stop him with pepper spray.
</P>
<P>
	   His family's CCRB complaint charged the officers involved in the shooting
with excessive force and abuse of authority.
</P>
<P>
	   It asked the board to investigate whether the officers followed department
guidelines on dealing with the emotionally disturbed. If their actions were
within NYPD rules, then the rules must be changed, said New York Civil Liberties
Union executive director Norman Siegel, representing the family.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel said the officers' use of pepper spray on the already agitated Busch
only provoked him further.
</P>
<P>
	   "It just ... creates a crisis situation when in most of these instances if
you just wait it out you can deal with the person," Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that even though the grand jury had found the officers did not act
criminally, the board could still determine that the shooting was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   The day after the shooting, Safir said the four officers who fired the 12
shots that hit Busch used deadly force only after he refused to drop his hammer
and stop attacking two other officers. The commissioner, who cited seven
non-police witnesses, said Busch was pummeling a fallen sergeant when he was
shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The family disputes that account, and accused Safir and his subordinates of
distorting the truth in public statements after Busch's death.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was an immediate cover-up, there were stories, they had to justify
this shooting which should never have happened," Mrs. Boskey said.
</P>
<P>
	   The family's complaint asks the CCRB to investigate Safir's actions and find
out what basis he had for saying there were seven independent witnesses
confirming that police acted appropriately. Investigators were reportedly unable
to find any of the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The complaint also asks whether the officers involved truthfully answered
questions about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Boskey, who said she had spoken to many witnesses and seen photos of
the scene, said her son was trying to get away from police when he was shot. She
described his hammer as a religious item inscribed with Hebrew writing.
</P>
<P>
	   He was trying to get away from police and find an open space to recover from
the pepper spray when he was shot, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was afraid," Mrs. Boskey said. "They had guns drawn."

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall Despite Low Inflation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices finished lower Friday after an early rally
evaporated on lingering worries about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended with a loss of 7/16
point, or $4.37 1/2 per $1,000 in face value, in abbreviated trading. Its yield,
which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.69 percent from 6.65 percent
late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bond prices got an early lift from the government's report that consumer
prices rose an unexpectedly low 0.2 percent in December. Analysts had been
expecting a 0.3 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
	   For the year, consumer prices were up 2.7 percent last year. The 1.9 percent
increase when energy costs were excluded was the best annual showing in 34
years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the rally began eroding by midmorning on a report of a big increase in
the University of Michigan's latest gauge of consumers' economic expectations.
</P>
<P>
	   A rally in the stock market and a rise in oil prices also worried some
traders that the Federal Reserve may move interest rates higher in a move to
preempt a rise in inflation, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bond prices, since bonds pay a fixed rate of
return.
</P>
<P>
	   Trading in the bond market ended by midafternoon as traders got a head start
on a three-day weekend in observance of the late Martin Luther King Jr.'s
birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities were off by
between 1/16 point and 9/32 point, and intermediate maturities were off  3/8
point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.40 percent as the discount
gained 0.01 percentage point to 5.25 percent. Six-month yields were 5.66
percent, as the discount held at 5.43 percent. One-year yields were 6.10 percent
as the discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks,
traded at 5.44 percent from 5.63 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index for municipal bonds was unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Gallardo-Domas Sings Violetta in NY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cristina Gallardo-Domas, who is singing Violetta for the
first time at the Metropolitan Opera, suffered from a sinus infection her
opening night. But she ended the opera in radiant-sounding vocal health.
</P>
<P>
	   Gallardo-Domas' major problem Thursday night in Act 1 was that she isn't a
coloratura soprano, which is called for in the famous "Sempre libera" aria.
</P>
<P>
	   However, most of Violetta's music is written for a lyric soprano and
Gallardo-Domas excelled there. The soprano, who made her Met debut in 1996 in
"La Boheme," has a lovely tone and the ability to shade her voice emotionally.
</P>
<P>
	   Roberto Aronica sang Violetta's lover Alfredo with clarity of tone but
without a sense of personality. This may have been partly because Roberto
Abbado's conducting slowed some tempos and didn't provide the expected sense of
urgency and passion in the orchestral music.
</P>
<P>
	   Vladimir Chernov sang the elder Germont. In the past, he has been criticized
as being too softhearted. On Thursday, he was stern and serious. He sang the
part with tonal beauty and got the character just right.
</P>
<P>
	   This production is by Franco Zeffirelli, replacing one he did in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Schiffer pleads guilty in officer's killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A Pennsylvania man admitted to murder Friday in
the 1958 killing of a Rahway police officer and agreed to testify against his
cousin, who he says committed the crime.
<P>
	   Theodore Schiffer, 61, of Blakeley, Pa., could serve less than three years
in prison for the crime under 1958 sentencing guidelines and a plea agreement
reached by Union County prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   He agreed to testify against Robert Zarinsky, a convicted murderer charged
last month with the Nov. 28, 1958, killing of Rahway Police Officer Charles
Bernoskie, a 30-year-old father of six who was shot three times while trying to
stop the robbery of a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, officers had no leads in the case, other than the statements of
two witnesses who saw two white men flee the scene, and unidentified
fingerprints. The witnesses are now dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, however, Zarinsky's sister, Judith Sapsa, came forward to
implicate Zarinsky and Schiffer in the officer's killing, saying she watched as
a child while her mother removed a bullet from Zarinsky's buttocks and heard
Zarinsky say that he had shot the officer after Bernoskie fired his weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer told Superior Court Judge John Triarsi that he helped Zarinsky
break into a Miller Pontiac dealership, but that Zarinsky had the gun and fired
the weapon. Schiffer said he ran from the dealership after he heard someone
coming.
</P>
<P>
	   "After I started running, I heard shots fired," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer's lawyer, Joseph D'Andrea, said Schiffer had not planned the
robbery with Zarinsky. He merely went along after getting in a car for a drive
with his cousin, D'Andrea said.
</P>
<P>
	   He never told anyone about the killing, not his brother or his three
children who appeared in court Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was terribly afraid of his cousin," D'Andrea said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarinsky is serving a 98-year prison term for the 1969 murder of a
17-year-old girl. Investigators also suspect him in the unsolved killings of
four other women between 1969 and 1974, although he hasn't been charged with
those crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer, who last saw his cousin in 1960, has no information that could
help those investigations, D'Andrea said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the only thing he knows about," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors recommended a 15-year sentence for Schiffer, which the judge
said he would impose after Zarinsky is tried to ensure his cooperation. Schiffer
could be free in less than three years on parole.
</P>
<P>
	   The plea agreement also recommends that Schiffer serve his sentence at
Lackawanna County Jail in Scranton, Pa. D'Andrea said Schiffer wanted to be
close to his family and was afraid of serving time in the same prison as
Zarinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   "Thank you, thank you," Elizabeth Bernoskie, the officer's widow, said as
she left the courtroom. She watched Schiffer's plea with some of her children
and several officers who worked on the case, including the detective who found
Bernoskie's body in 1958.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm so relieved it's over," said a tearful John DeStefano, who continued
working on the case after he retired from the Rahway Police Department in 1977.
"They got a lucky break."
</P>
<P>
	   Judith Sapsa came forward after her husband was charged with stealing money
from an inheritance fund in Zarinsky's name. Police charged Schiffer after
matching his fingerprints to prints they lifted from antifreeze cans in 1958.

<HEADLINE> Builders Celebrate Housing Boom  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Bob White, who has been building houses for nearly 40 years,
says today's market is as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This gray hair lets you know I've seen cycles that just quit," White said
Friday, referring to historic boom-and-bust patterns in the housing market. "But
I can't see anything scaring us now."
</P>
<P>
	   Like others gathered in Dallas for the nation's biggest convention of home
builders, White thinks home sales will probably decline a bit but remain strong
through 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose this week to 8.18
percent this week, according to Freddie Mac, the federally chartered mortgage
company. They haven't been higher since September 1996. A year ago, they were
below 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, most economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term
interest rates again early this year -- probably more than once. But even that
prospect didn't seem to faze the crowd at the National Association of Home
Builders convention.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't feel the rates are going to escalate enough to affect us," said
Richard Moody of the Johnson Group, a developer-builder company in Port Orange,
Fla., as he toured the exhibit hall with a colleague. "As long as we don't see 8
1/2 to 9 percent, we think it'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone seems to be making money, and they still want to buy houses,"
Moody said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Seiders, chief economist for the home builders' group and a former Fed
economist, said housing is less sensitive to interest rates, partly because of
the variety of mortgages available today, including fixed-rate, adjustable,
hybrids and balloon loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Seiders is predicting an 8 percent decline in the number of single-family
homes placed under construction this year, but he blamed that more on an
expected overall economic slowing than on higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "This looks like a pause in 2000, not an old-fashioned housing recession at
all," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are seeing a bit of a slowing in housing, but it's from exceptional
levels -- very close to all-time highs in some markets," added Mark Vitner, vice
president and economist for First Union Bank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists predict that the prices of new homes will continue to outstrip
inflation. Freddie Mac predicts a 4 percent increase in 2000, down from about 6
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of talking about interest rates and the Federal Reserve, builders at
the convention commiserated about rising labor costs -- Florida builder said
framers' pay rose more than 50 percent this year, and a North Texas survey by
the Associated Builders And Contractors said brick layers' pay rose 20 percent
and carpenters' pay nearly 10 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some builders said that because of competition from other builders, they
haven't been able to pass those increases on to home buyers.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Has Quintuple Bypass  </HEADLINE>
    By SHARON L. CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Late Show" host David Letterman underwent emergency
quintuple bypass surgery Friday after a test found one of his arteries was
seriously constricted.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's fine," spokesman Steven Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, had an angiogram because of what he said was high cholesterol
and a history of heart disease in his family. The test, during which a flexible
tube is inserted into an artery and dye is injected, found the constricted
artery.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. O. Wayne Isom, who performed the procedure at New York Presbyterian
Hospital, said it went smoothly. He predicted a rapid recovery. "Dave has the
heart muscle of a 20-year-old," Isom said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubenstein said the "Late Show" would show reruns until Letterman recovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else, Letterman has made a long-running joke of his health,
starting years ago when he discovered he had high cholesterol. For a month he
went on an oat-bran diet, complaining nightly about the taste and consistency of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman disclosed he was going to have the angiogram during a taping of
the CBS program with guest Regis Philbin. The segment was to air Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The host turned momentarily serious when he asked Philbin about his own
successful emergency angioplasty at age 59 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason I'm bringing this up is that I have very high cholesterol, and I
also have a history of this," said Letterman, whose father died of a heart
attack in his 50s.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman returned to jokes when Philbin asked him how high the cholesterol
level was.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's borderline ... 680," Letterman wisecracked. Doctors usually recommend
people keep their cholesterol levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman said the worst-case scenario would be to "open Daddy's rib cage
... and I don't want that."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman broke into network TV on CBS in 1978 as a guest on Mary Tyler
Moore's variety show, "Mary." He later made appearances on "The Tonight Show"
starring Johnny Carson and guest hosted "Tonight" numerous times.
</P>
<P>
	   After a brief stint as the host of daytime's "The David Letterman Show," his
after-dark career took off with "Late Night with David Letterman." It premiered
on NBC in 1982 in the time slot following Carson.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman moved to CBS in 1993 shortly after Carson retired and NBC gave the
coveted "Tonight" host position to rival Jay Leno.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nursing Home Probes  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House proposed spending an extra $16 million to
improve oversight of nursing homes, but a GOP congressional leader said that
won't fix the flawed system for monitoring care.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton will ask Congress for the extra money in his 2001 budget
plan to pay to train inspectors, conduct surprise inspections and crack down on
the 100 worst facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, campaigning for president in New Hampshire,
announced the proposal Friday at a meeting with the National Council of Senior
Citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of a Senate Special Committee on
Aging, said more money won't guarantee better quality at nursing homes because
the U.S. government does a poor job of making sure that state inspectors enforce
federal nursing home laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under this system we could quadruple enforcement money with no guarantees
of success,'' said Grassley. ``It's like throwing cash into a river.''
</P>
<P>
	   Grassley said the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers
the enforcement funds, should assure taxpayers they are getting their money's
worth before increases are approved.
</P>
<P>
	   And a nursing home group said what's needed is more money for staffing, not
monitoring. Medicare and Medicaid, which finances bills of most nursing home
residents, pay too little for facilities to recruit and keep highly qualified
staff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Quality of life and quality of care is not being measured,'' said Linda
Keegan, vice president of the American Health Care Association. ``If the
administration is going to look at investing more in long-term care, it should
look at staffing.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration proposal would bring total funds for nursing care
oversight to $70 million, an increase of close to 30 percent from last year.
Most of the money goes to state agencies responsible for inspecting 16,700
nursing homes providing care for about 1.6 million older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, money would be earmarked for:
</P>
<P>
	   --Training inspectors to file computerized reports on nursing home
compliance that will make it easier to identify problem homes, track whether
they are improving and provide information for surveyors visiting the
facilities. The reports are made available to consumers on a World Wide Web
site.
</P>
<P>
	   --Inspecting nursing homes during evenings and weekends to ensure that
facilities, where staff know that inspections normally occur during the day,
aren't hiding substandard practices.
</P>
<P>
	   --More inspections of at least 100 homes with the worst compliance records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that those entities are inspected more frequently,''
said Chris Jennings, Clinton's health policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings also said the administration would launch a $10 million campaign to
inform elderly Americans about what long-term care Medicare covers, how to
evaluate long-term care policies and how to get information on community-based
services.

<HEADLINE> Young Women's Breast Cancer Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Younger women with the earliest form of breast cancer may
have less tissue removed when doctors cut out the tiny tumor than older women
do, says a new study that questions whether cosmetic concerns leave younger
women more at risk for relapse.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is "ductal carcinoma in situ," or DCIS, a tumor that forms inside
milk ducts in the breast and usually is discovered by mammography. This is the
earliest, highly curable form of breast cancer, and women typically receive a
lumpectomy -- removal of the tumor -- followed by radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   The new study, published Saturday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology,
analyzed the long-term outcomes of 146 Michigan patients who had lumpectomies
and radiation between 1980 and 1993. Younger patients had a significantly
greater rate of cancer recurrence than older women -- 26 percent in women under
age 45 vs. 9 percent of older women.
</P>
<P>
	   Then researchers looked at 95 of the patients more closely and found a
surprise: Younger patients frequently had less breast tissue removed during
their lumpectomies than older women did.
</P>
<P>
	   When younger women had adequately sized lumpectomies, however, they fared as
well as the older women, said the lead researcher, Dr. Frank Vicini, of the
William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to do bigger surgeries to make sure you got all the cancer cells,"
Vicini concluded, saying post-surgery radiation can't compensate for a too-small
cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Why did some younger women get smaller lumpectomies? Vicini's theory: "There
may be simply in these younger patients more concern for cosmetic results."
</P>
<P>
	   Younger women are much more likely to have smaller breasts, for whom a
bigger lumpectomy can be more noticeable, agreed Dr. Kimberly Van Zee of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She said Vicini's study confirms her own
research that younger DCIS patients may get smaller surgeries and thus are at
greater risk of recurrence.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors have long known that invasive breast cancer is more likely to be
aggressive in younger women. Whether the less threatening, noninvasive DCIS
posed a similar age concern has been controversial.
</P>
<P>
	   Younger women have more milk ducts for DCIS to infiltrate, Vicini noted.
</P>
<P>
	   DCIS patients whose cancer recurred often were successfully treated -- just
one died during the study. But "you're talking about the potential need for a
mastectomy," he explained. "If we can avoid that, we'd like to."
</P>
<P>
	   Surgeons aim to remove enough tissue to include a centimeter-wide
cancer-free ring around any breast tumor, said Dr. Charles Balch of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology. Pathologists analyze the tissue after surgery to
check these "margins." Typically, doctors don't do repeat surgery unless the
cancer-free margin is 10 times narrower than that goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some surgeons may feel they can be not as aggressive, as radical with their
treatment when it's noninvasive cancer as they would be for invasive cancer,"
Balch said. But Vicini's study "makes an even more compelling case for trying to
achieve" that centimeter-wide margin.
</P>
<P>
	   "You need a buffer zone," Van Zee added. "There's more and more data
stacking up that a wide margin, ... getting out all the DCIS, is really
important."
</P>
<P>
	   For women, the study means "don't push your surgeon too far" in demanding a
small operation, said Dr. LaMar McGinnis of the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
	   But he cautioned that DCIS patients today also can use the drug tamoxifen to
further lower their risk of cancer recurrence, a treatment not used during the
years of Vicini's study.

<HEADLINE> Haitians See Double Standard  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRADE CHERFILS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The furor over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez has dramatized what
the large Haitian community in Miami says is a cruel and racist double standard
in U.S. immigration policy: Cubans are embraced and almost automatically offered
citizenship, while Haitians are sent back.
</P>
<P>
	   The disparities inspired a protest this week in downtown Miami by hundreds
of Haitians and American blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   They pointed to the plight of a pregnant Haitian woman whose children were
sent back this month while she remained in Miami for medical treatment. The
government ultimately said the children can be with their mother.
</P>
<P>
	   One protester, Marie Benite Pierre, said American officials ``care more for
dogs than for Haitians.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It boils down to racism,'' said Marleine Bastien, president of Haitian
Women of Miami. ``It's been going on too long.''
</P>
<P>
	   Illegal immigrants caught trying to get to the United States are sent back
to their home countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1966 Cuban Readjustment Act, however, Cubans who actually reach
U.S. soil can stay. There is no such law for Haitians and others who arrive here
illegally -- they are sent back unless they can prove a ``credible fear'' of
persecution in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   David Abraham, an immigration law professor at the University of Miami, said
Cubans are in a special situation because of the nature of the United States'
relationship with the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If ever Haitian-Americans become as well-organized and influential as
Cuban-Americans, they will receive greater attention,'' Abraham said. ``But I
cannot imagine there ever being something like the Cuban Adjustment Act for
Haitians.''
</P>
<P>
	   Legally and politically, the 150,000 Haitians in South Florida don't have
the clout that the Cubans do.
</P>
<P>
	   Cubans, who account for 35 percent of Miami-Dade County's 2.1 million
people, dominate local politics, running the city and the county. They have a
growing influence in state politics and two representatives in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Haitians made their biggest political gain in December when residents of El
Portal, a small village that borders Miami, elected three Haitians to its
five-member council. It is the first municipality in the United States to have a
Haitian majority.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the political gains, activists say Haitians are routinely returned
to Haiti without being allowed to request a hearing to prove they fear
persecution at home. They criticize the ``wet foot, dry foot'' exemption for
Cubans who reach Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The wet foot, dry foot policy is inconsistent. It's arbitrary. It's
capricious. It's subjective,'' said Gepsie Metellus, director of public affairs
for Miami-Dade County Commissioner Barbara Carey-Shuler. ``When you've got those
kinds of qualifications in a policy, they naturally lead to discrimination, to
racism and to favoritism.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been living with relatives in Miami since surviving a Thanksgiving
Day boat trip in which his mother, stepfather and nine others drowned. The
controversy over where the boy should live has sparked large protests in Cuba
and Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service had said the boy must be returned
to his father in Cuba by Friday, but Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the
deadline. Elian's Miami relatives are expected to go to federal court to fight
for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Haitians contrast Elian's case with that of Marc Dieubon, 9, and
Germanie Dieubon, 8, who were separated from their mother on New Year's Day
after a 60-foot wooden boat carrying 411 people, mostly from Haiti, ran aground
about two miles off Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Their mother, Yvena Rhinvil, was brought ashore for medical treatment, while
the children were returned to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they weren't told Rhinvil's children were with her and
would have let the children stay if they had known. On Thursday, the government
decided to allow the children to be reunited with their mother in Florida while
her political asylum claim is weighed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is one step towards mending the many different wounds this community,
especially the Haitian community, has suffered,'' said Aude Sicard, a member of
the Haitian-American Grassroots Coalition. ``We will continue with the fight to
establish our position in terms of equal treatment and due process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ramon Saul Sanchez, who heads the anti-Castro Democracy Movement in Miami,
said Cuban activists have supported the Haitians in their cause for equality. He
said the two Haitian children probably wouldn't have been reunited with their
mother had it not been for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Next for the Haitian activists is a rally Saturday in Miami to denounce
officials for going to Washington on the behalf of Elian while ``not saying a
word about Haitians.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Haitians and blacks are members of this community, too. We deserve to be
represented,'' Bastien said. ``We will ask them to put an end to ethnic
politics. We will remember in November.''

<HEADLINE> More public Hillary Clinton agrees to appear at satire show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In yet another sign she is leaving the White House
cocoon that has shielded her for the past seven years, Hillary Rodham Clinton
agreed Friday to take the stage at the nation's longest-running political
gridiron show.
<P>
	   The first lady, fresh from her star turn on the "Late Show with David
Letterman" and set to formally enter New York's Senate race next month, accepted
an invitation to be part of the 100th annual Legislative Correspondents
Association show on June 10 in Albany.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll have to get the home office in Chappaqua working overtime on this,"
Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign committee, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton, who had never lived or worked in New York before, recently
moved into a house in Chappaqua in Westchester County just north of New York
City to establish New York residency for her Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's expected opponent for the Senate race, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, has also been invited to appear at the LCA show.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do not anticipate the mayor will be in the show," spokeswoman Sunny
Mindel said. "He is however participating, as he has every year since he's been
mayor, in the New York City press corps show."
</P>
<P>
	   As a featured guest, Republican Giuliani did a lengthy monologue at the
LCA's 1991 show.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, as she draws closer to formally entering the Senate race,
the notoriously media-shy Mrs. Clinton has begun conducting regular
question-and-answer sessions with reporters during campaign stops. She mixes
easily with people who happen to show up at her events. The first lady is also
planning a series of in-depth interviews in the days leading up to her early
February campaign kickoff.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a far cry from her early forays onto the New York political stage
last year when she rarely left the security of her Secret Service detail and
contact with the public generally involved little more than some handshaking
along a rope line. Questioning by reporters was rare.
</P>
<P>
	   That is in sharp contrast to Giuliani, who holds a "media availability"
almost daily.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls have shown the mayor leading the first lady among New York
voters and some of her aides have been advising a more open approach to
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
	   In agreeing to appear at the LCA show, Mrs. Clinton is accepting what has
become almost a rite of passage in New York politics for major candidates. In
1998, then-U.S. Rep. Charles Schumer took a turn. Five months later, Democrat
Schumer defeated Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato in that year's U.S. Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, once the reporters have finished skewering the politicians
with songs and skits, the governor and two guests, one Republican and one
Democrat, are invited to offer responses - generally humorous speeches or more
elaborate skits.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfson said Friday that he wasn't yet sure what Mrs. Clinton would do.
</P>
<P>
	   The black-tie, $175-a-person dinner and show raises money for charity and to
support LCA operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially, the Hillary Clinton campaign team appeared to have rejected the
LCA's invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   In a Jan. 10 letter to LCA President David Hepp, co-host of the "Inside
Albany" television show, Mrs. Clinton's scheduling director, Paul Rivera, had
written that "Mrs. Clinton's official schedule will not permit her to accept the
invitation."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the rejection, Wolfson had said Thursday that he believed there
had been a mistake. By this morning, Hepp had a new letter in hand from Rivera
stating that the first letter "was sent in error."
</P>
<P>
	   "Please be assured that we plan to participate in the show," Rivera wrote in
the second letter.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds To Stop Samples  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds has agreed to stop mailing cigarette samples
to non-smokers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano had demanded since November that
the Winston-Salem, N.C.,-based tobacco manufacturer stop the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   R.J. Reynolds has maintained it did nothing wrong because the samples were
sent only to people who signed up for assorted promotions and had certified that
they were over age 21.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a letter Thursday to Napolitano from Reynolds vice president and
deputy general counsel Guy M. Blynn, the manufacturer acknowledged that its
mailing system for dealing with adult smokers is "flawed" because it allows
unsolicited mail to be sent.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said because mailing problems found in Arizona and California
may not be limited to those states, it is making changes in its system
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   Effective immediately, the company said it would stop sending product
samples to people in the current program, but allow those on the mailing list to
choose whether to stay on the list or be removed.
</P>
<P>
	   R.J. Reynolds officials could not be reached by The Associated Press for
comment Friday.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Supports Low-Power Radio  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A proposal to create thousands of new, licensed low-tech
FM radio stations is getting a last-minute boost from the nation's top
broadcasting regulator.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to vote next week on a
plan that would enable ``micro'' radio broadcasters to operate with power levels
of 1 to 1,000 watts, far lower than big city stations broadcasting at 50,000
watts.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, FCC Chairman Bill Kennard expressed hope the plan would pass,
citing a range of benefits to communities, churches and schools. He noted that
students could cover school events, even air their own interviews, with such
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be a wonderful way to integrate education into technology,''
Kennard told the Educational Technology Leadership Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal, which would reverse two decades of policy opposing such
licenses, has come under fire by commercial broadcasters who fear that low-power
radio could cause significant interference with existing stations. The National
Association of Broadcasters and others have commissioned studies to document
degradation in service to listeners that could ensue if such low-power stations
are introduced.
</P>
<P>
	   The broadcasters association tried to get the commission to delay Thursday's
scheduled vote, saying it still had many outstanding questions, including
whether ownership limits would be set on the low-power stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For its entire history, the commission has had as one of its primary goals
the preservation of interference-free radio service,'' association president
Edward Fritts wrote to Kennard. ``In its low-power radio proposal, it has seemed
that the commission abandoned that goal.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard responded that he ``would never support any commission action that
would disturb the integrity of the free over-the-air radio service.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC chief also declined to push back a decision. He said
broadcasters have had ample time to make their case and ``it's time to move
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard also used Friday's conference to defend the embattled program that
helps pay for discounted Internet connections for schools and libraries. Some
lawmakers have decried the ``e-rate'' because it adds phone charges to consumer
bills to pay for the program. In 1999, members of Congress introduced six bills
to scale back or eliminate the program.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard said the program has pledged more than $3.6 billion to schools and
libraries over the past two years, helping to connect one million public school
classrooms to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is truly closing the digital divide in our country,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at Record High 11,722.98  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply Friday, boosted by a strong earnings
report from high-tech bellwether Intel and comments from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan that indicate interest rates will be rising only
slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones rose 140.55 to a new closing record of 11,722.98, easily
topping Thursday's record. The new closing high was the Dow's third this week
and its fourth since the start of 2000. For the week, the Dow rose 200.42.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market measures also finished with solid gains. The Nasdaq composite
index rose 107.06 to 4,064.27, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 15.47 to
1,465.15.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq, which dipped as much as 10 percent below its peak last week, has
rebounded smartly in the past two sessions and is now just 1.6 percent below the
record high reached Jan. 3. The S&AMP;P 500, meanwhile, is just four points below
its closing record, reached Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks led the Dow and the Nasdaq Friday, with industry leaders
Intel and Microsoft accounting for a major portion of those indexes' gains.
</P>
<P>
	   "We continue to have money coming into the market, and money managers are
deciding that technology offers the opportunity for the biggest gains," said
Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Intel, the world's leading computer chip maker, rose 12 to 103 1/16 after
announcing better than expected earnings late Thursday. The company cited a
surge in sales of personal computers during the back-to-school and holiday
shopping period.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's strong report and optimistic outlook lifted rival chip maker
Applied Materials, which gained 11 1/8 to 135 5/8. Computer makers like IBM, up
1 3/8 to 119 5/8, advanced as investors anticipated strong profit reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft rose 4 7/16 to 112 1/4 a day after Bill Gates' decision to
relinquish his chief executive job to company president Steve Ballmer. Analysts
said the move will assure continuity in the company's leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks also benefited from growing confidence that inflation is not rising
sharply. A speech by Greenspan Thursday night convinced many investors the Fed
is likely to raise rates no more than a quarter-percentage point at the next
Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Feb. 1-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Although rate increases are usually troublesome, market watchers said they
were impressed that Greenspan indicated he won't let inflation get in the way of
a surging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greenspan has demonstrated that he understands the world has changed and
that he doesn't intend to do anything scary to the market," said Charles
Pradilla, chief investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. "We are
comfortable with Greenspan's comments because it shows he is not behind the
curve, and won't let inflation raise its mighty head."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest economic data released Friday once again showed inflation remains
under control.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said consumer prices rose by 0.2 percent in December,
slightly below forecasts. Excluding energy prices, the gain was just 0.1
percent. The report was the latest confirmation that fears about accelerating
inflation remain unfounded.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's financial stocks rose following the report. American Express
gained 3 1/2 to 159 1/2 and J.P. Morgan rose 5 3/16 to 128.
</P>
<P>
	   Optimism about earnings extended beyond the technology sector. Lands' End
rose 2 7/16 to 37 5/16 after Wall Street analysts noted that in spite of
slumping sales in the eight-week holiday shopping season, profits improved.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucent Technologies declined 3 1/16 to 53 3/16 in heavy trading amid rumors
that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating the company's
accounting practices. Lucent officials said they were unaware of any
investigation and the SEC would not confirm or deny an inquiry.
</P>
<P>
	   The market's gains were broad-based. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners
by an 8-to-7 margin on the New York Stock Exchange and by a 4-to-3 margin on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.33 billion shares, compared with 1.25
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 6.37 to 507.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.7 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 3.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 1.9 percent, and France's
CAC-40 was up 2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Opposes Panel on Dam  </HEADLINE>
    By HARRY DUNPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) --The World Bank on Friday opposed the recommendation of an
independent panel that the water level be raised behind a Latin American dam it
is helping to finance, siding instead with the position of environmentalists and
some local residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Raising the water level behind the $8.5 billion Yacyreta hydroelectric plant
dam on the Argentine-Paraguayan border would end uncertainty over the project's
future, increase its earnings by expanding electric power generation and allow
for more effective flood control, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
	   But raising the water level behind the dam would have required the moving
and resettling of local residents.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists and some residents have long opposed the Parana River
project that began nearly 21 years ago, contending it violates World Bank
protocols on the environment and resettlement of people. They also maintain it
is not economically viable.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel appointed by the bank in 1998 to study the project proposed that
the water level of a reservoir behind the dam be raised from its current 250
feet above sea level to 274 feet. But the bank rejected that recommendation.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that there should be no change ... unless and until further
study is undertaken to assess the social and environmental impact as well as
extensive participatory consultation with the affected communities," said David
de Ferranti, bank vice president for Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank -- which released the report of the six experts from Brazil,
Britain, Canada, Chile and Colombia -- said the findings were presented Tuesday
to the governments of Argentina and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
	   While recognizing the risks in raising the water level, the panel said
keeping water at its existing level would have negative consequences including
economic losses and frustration in nearby communities because the flooding
danger would remain.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel also said the governments should make fundamental changes in the
dam's management, including changing the treaty that set up the project,
establishing new institutional and financial arrangements and letting the
private sector run the dam.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though the bank did not endorse the panel's key recommendation, De
Ferranti said the report should "galvanize action by stimulating discussion
among governments and groups interested in the project."

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Top $28, a 9-Year High  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Oil prices roared 5 percent higher to a new nine-year high Friday, topping
$28 a barrel for the first time since 1991 and the Gulf War. The gain came after
OPEC removed virtually all doubt it will extend its agreement on lowered
production for several more months.
</P>
<P>
	   Frigid weather in the northeastern United States also contributed to a sharp
rise in crude as well as gasoline, heating oil and natural gas futures.
</P>
<P>
	   In other markets, coffee prices sank to a six-week low and soybeans moved
significantly higher for a third consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
	   Crude climbed as high as $28.10 a barrel, the highest since Jan. 16, 1991,
before the Allied military strikes on Iraq that brought about an end to the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
	   Intermediate crude for February delivery oil settled up $1.33 at $28.02 a
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange -- jumping 16 percent for the week
and surpassing the previous nine-year high reached in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big move, and we've seen close to four dollars' gain in the last few
days," said Chris Stavros, an analyst for Paine Webber in New York. "Most of it
seems to be driven by what OPEC has come out and said clearly -- that they would
extend the cuts beyond March."
</P>
<P>
	   Meeting in Vienna, the market monitoring committee of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to strongly recommend that the
10-month-old production cutbacks be continued beyond their scheduled March 31
expiration.
</P>
<P>
	   The extension could be longer than expected, which helped accelerate the
price runup. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said he anticipates a
six-month extension, while Kuwait and Saudi Arabia indicated Thursday it could
go through 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC will vote on the length of an extension at its March 27 meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Also underpinning the rally were the season's first subnormal temperatures
in the northeastern United States, the major heating oil-consuming region. Parts
of New England saw wind-chill factor temperatures of minus 20 to 30 degrees
Fahrenheit -- conditions certain to send demand soaring.
</P>
<P>
	   After hurdling the $27 and $28 barriers in a single day, oil at $30 a barrel
may be just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
	   Stavros says it depends on whether world and U.S. oil supplies continue to
fall, since OPEC's decision on extending cuts takes the speculative factor out
of the rally.
</P>
<P>
	   "Thirty-dollar oil is going to have to be inventory-driven," the analyst
said. "The news is out on OPEC -- that's a known quantity. The unknown is what
happens in the near term with supply."
</P>
<P>
	   Key inventory reports will be released a day later than usual next week --
Wednesday and Thursday instead of Tuesday and Wednesday -- due to the Monday
observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
</P>
<P>
	   February heating oil rose 4.53 cents to 73.81 cents a gallon; February
unleaded gasoline rose 3.25 cents to 74.52 cents a gallon; February natural gas
rose 7 cents to $2.322 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, February Brent crude rose 49 cents to $25.47 a barrel on the
International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Coffee prices fell 5 percent on technically inspired trading, despite a lack
of fresh news. March coffee settled down 5.80 cents to $1.1275 a pound on the
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybean futures jumped again on the Chicago Board of Trade, buoyed by
forecasts for extreme heat and dryness in key growing regions of South America
next week. March soybeans rose 7 1/4 cents a bushel to $4.96 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Germany Delays Slave Labor Proposal  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- A proposal on how to distribute compensation to victims of
Nazi forced labor will be unveiled a week later than planned, a government
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The government had planned to present the bill to the Cabinet next week. But
spokesman Bela Anda said the presentation will be delayed until Jan. 26 because
of a ``misunderstanding.'' Anda offered no further details.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came as lawyers for the victims complained about aspects of
the proposed law.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the victims and German negotiators agreed on the basics of the
plan: German government and industry will create a $5.2 billion fund to
compensate up to 2.3 million people, mostly non-Jews from Eastern Europe, who
were forced to work under the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
	   But negotiators still must work out how the fund will be divided.
</P>
<P>
	   A chief complaint of the class-action lawyers and Eastern European
governments is that Germany is making unilateral decisions that will determine
how much money individual victims will receive.
</P>
<P>
	   The current draft, for example, reduces payments to people who already have
gotten compensation under another law. Germany has paid about $60 billion in
compensation for other Nazi crimes. The draft also would limit compensation to
workers deported to Germany under its 1937 borders, before Hitler's offensives
into Europe started.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The law, as it is drafted, is excluding big groups of victims from the
possibility to claim compensation,'' Jiri Sitler of the Czech foreign ministry
said in Prague.
</P>
<P>
	   New York lawyer Deborah Sturman said the proposal to deduct for payments
already made was an act of bad faith. She said lawyers planned to resume filing
motions on class-action lawsuits, suspended after the December agreement on the
fund's size. German firms that used slave and forced labor sought the fund
largely to receive protection from such class-action suits.
</P>
<P>
	   The German Finance Ministry is drafting the proposed law. A ministry
spokesman stressed the government is not trying to circumvent those who
negotiated the deal in the first place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those leading the negotiations must articulate want they want in the bill
proposal, and when that is articulated then that is what will be in the
proposal,'' Torsten Albig said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Mull Partial Birth  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court reclaimed center stage in the legal and
moral war over abortion Friday by agreeing to decide whether states may ban a
surgical procedure opponents call ``partial-birth abortion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices said they will review a Nebraska law that made it a crime for
doctors to perform such abortions. A federal appeals court has blocked
enforcement of that law, calling it unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly identical laws have been enacted by 30 states, but courts have
blocked enforcement of most of them. Congress enacted a federal ban on
partial-birth abortions but President Clinton vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
	   The court has not issued a major abortion ruling since 1992 when it
reaffirmed the core holding of its 1973 decision in a case called Roe vs. Wade.
That landmark decision said women have a constitutional right to end their
pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the legal controversy swirls around a specific procedure, far more
may be at stake. Abortion-rights advocates say the court's eventual decision
could broadly safeguard -- or dramatically erode -- abortion rights, depending
on what state legislatures can consider when regulating abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The court will hear arguments in the Nebraska case in April. A decision is
expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   The surgical procedure involves partially extracting a fetus, legs first,
through the birth canal, cutting the skull and draining its contents.
Partial-birth abortion is not a medical term. Doctors call the method dilation
and extraction, or D&AMP;X.
</P>
<P>
	   In unanimously striking down the Nebraska law, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals said the law's wording could also outlaw a more common procedure called
dilation and evacuation, or D&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Such a prohibition places an undue burden on the right of women to choose
whether to have an abortion,'' the appeals court ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   A month after the Nebraska law was struck down along with those in Iowa and
Arkansas, nearly identical abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin were upheld
by another federal appeals court.
</P>
<P>
	   That created a direct conflict legal experts predicted would require the
Supreme Court's final word.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A constitutional crisis is calling out for a remedy,'' said
abortion-rights advocate Janet Benshoof of the Center for Reproductive Law &AMP;
Policy. ``What's at issue is whether a woman's interest in her health can be
trumped by a state legislature's moral and political statement about a fetus.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the other side of the argument, James Bopp Jr., general counsel of the
National Right to Life Committee, said the case is important ``because it will
set the outer limit of the so-called right to abortion, but it is not a
challenge to Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
	   And Nebraska Gov. Mike Johanns said, ``I feel strongly that states should
have the right to legislate in the area of partial-birth abortion. It's a
barbaric procedure that I hope is brought to an end.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Attorney General Don Stenberg agreed, adding, ``It shocks the
conscience that in the United States of America a human child can be literally
pulled from the womb and cruelly killed by having his or her skull punctured and
brain suctioned out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stenberg's Supreme Court appeal was bold. He not only urged the court to
reinstate the ban on the D&AMP;X procedure but also asked the justices to reverse
past rulings and give states a free hand to more stringently restrict, or even
outlaw, all abortions.
</P>
<P>
	   The brief order issued by the court Friday indicated the justices will not
consider that request.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers representing a doctor who performs abortions in Nebraska urged the
justices to reject Stenberg's appeal because the appeals court correctly
concluded that the law would interfere with most abortions performed after a
woman's third month of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   They said the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, reached by a 5-4
vote, upheld partial-birth abortion laws in Illinois and Wisconsin by
``rewriting'' the state laws in an attempt to limit their impact.
</P>
<P>
	   The 7th Circuit court said state abortion laws can be motivated by ``moral''
revulsion to some procedures so long as they ``do not harm women's legitimate
interests.'' An abortion law can pass constitutional muster even if it outlaws
procedures that may be the safest method of ending a small number of women's
pregnancies, that court said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case granted Friday is Stenberg vs. Carhart, 99-830.

<HEADLINE> USDA To Publicize All Meat Recalls  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department said Friday it will notify the
public every time meat processors recall products, even when there is no health
risk involved or no way for consumers to tell whether they've purchased them.
</P>
<P>
	   The USDA move is opposed by processors, but consumer advocates think it
could force plants to cut down on incidents of contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   The department currently issues press releases only for meat that may be
contaminated and that goes to stores in its original packaging. The packages
carry numbers that can be easily checked by consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency hasn't been publicizing recalls when there is no health risk --
such as when a product has excessive water -- or when possibly tainted meat is
sold to restaurants or is repackaged by stores.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, USDA issued press releases on 41 of the 62 recalls that took
place.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've decided that erring on the side of getting more information to
consumers is the approach to take,'' said Margaret Glavin, associate
administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
	   But it will be difficult, if not impossible, for consumers to know whether
the recalls that will now be publicized affect them: USDA releases the
geographic region affected by the recall but not the names of stores or
restaurants that receive the meat. That's up to the processors to divulge
because it is considered proprietary information under government regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, the new policy ``will prevent many of the adulterations that
happen now. Everyone is getting more careful,'' said Carol Tucker Foreman,
director of the Consumer Federation of America's Food Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People pay more attention to government press releases than to industry
ones and sometimes company press releases are understated and indirect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Processors say that the additional press releases are unnecessary and may
lead to public apathy about recalls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What we're fearful of is that when you really want to send a strong
message ... then it isn't heard as well,'' said Dane Bernard, vice president of
the National Food Processors Association.
</P>
<P>
	   There's no point of publicizing recalls when consumers have no way of
telling whether they've bought the meat, and processors don't like to release
the names of the stores and restaurants where their products go for competitive
reasons, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't always want your competitors to know who your customers are. If
you're having trouble it's a tendency of the sharks in the business world to go
to your customers and say we're not having a problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   All recalls are done voluntarily by processors. As a practical matter,
however, it is difficult for companies to resist pressure from USDA to do them,
because the agency can publicize the problems on its own or even shut a plant
down.
</P>
<P>
	   Recalls vary widely in size. The smallest on which USDA issued a press
release last year involved four pounds of meat that was distributed in
Pennsylvania. The record was 25 million pounds recalled in 1997 by Hudson Foods
Co.

<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - David Letterman, late-night television's 18-year veteran
of wisecracks and after-dark celebrity interviews, was resting Friday evening
after undergoing emergency quintuple bypass surgery.
<P>
	   Spokesman Steven Rubenstein said: "He's fine. In recovery."
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to operate was made after Letterman underwent an angiogram
because of high cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family. The
test, during which a flexible tube is inserted into an artery and dye is
injected, revealed one artery was seriously constricted.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman underwent successful surgery at New York Presbyterian Hospital
where Dr. O. Wayne Isom performed the procedure. The doctor said it went
smoothly and predicted a rapid recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave has the heart muscle of a 20-year-old," Isom said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's personal physician, Dr. Louis J. Aronne, and his cardiologist,
Dr. Martin Post, said it was too early to determine how long recovery would
take.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Amarkanth Saxena, a cardiothoracic surgeon at St. Joseph's Medical
Center in Paterson, N.J., said if there are no complicating factors Letterman
should be hospitalized for three or four days, then recuperating at home for six
to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Saxena, who is not involved in Letterman's case but has performed bypass
surgery many times, said he would advise such a patient to control risk factors
like high blood pressure and cholesterol in the future, in part by avoiding
fried foods and red meat.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman also may need medication to control his cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else, Letterman has made a long-running joke of his health,
starting years ago when he discovered he had high cholesterol. For a month he
went on an oat-bran diet, complaining nightly about the taste and consistency of
the stuff. Comically, it played. Health-wise it didn't. At the end of the
experiment Dave said he hadn't improved much.
</P>
<P>
	   During Thursday night's taping of the program - set to air Friday - he joked
about it again with guest Regis Philbin, who asked about Letterman's cholesterol
level.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's borderline ... 680," Letterman quipped. Doctors usually recommend
people keep their cholesterol levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, was born in Indianapolis on April 12, 1947. He broke into
network TV on CBS in 1978 as a guest on Mary Tyler Moore's variety show, "Mary."
</P>
<P>
	   From there, it was "The Tonight Show" starring Johnny Carson, long regarded
as THE place for aspiring standup comedians to catch their big breaks. Letterman
also guest hosted "Tonight" numerous times.
</P>
<P>
	   After a brief stint as the host of daytime's "The David Letterman Show," his
after-dark career took off with "Late Night with David Letterman." It premiered
in 1982 in the time slot following "Tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   During his 11-year run on NBC, Letterman won five Emmy awards, but moved to
CBS in 1993 shortly after Carson retired and NBC gave the coveted "Tonight Show"
host position to rival Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
	   The slightly flashier, slightly softer "Late Show with David Letterman" has
continued Letterman's Emmy streak, including at least one for Outstanding
Variety, Music or Comedy program.
</P>
<P>
	   Mujibur Rahman, who runs a shop near The Ed Sullivan Theater where "Late
Show" tapes, and who has frequently appeared on the show as a straight-man for
the host, said he watched television all day in hopes of catching an update
about his friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm praying for him and his good health. I hope nothing will happen," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg James, a 27-year-old fan from Portland, Ore. who apparently shares
Letterman's sense of dark comedy, blamed the entertainer's condition on the
stress of hosting first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on the show earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess Hillary did it to him," James said. "Too much pressure."
</P>
<P>
	   Next month marks the 18th anniversary of Letterman's late-night debut as a
host.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubenstein said the "Late Show" would telecast re-runs while Letterman
recovers.

<HEADLINE> Mills agrees to let Levy serve as NYC interim school chancellor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Banking executive Harold Levy became New York City's
interim school chancellor Friday after he was granted a special waiver by the
state's top education official.
<P>
	   Levy, 47, needed a waiver of state rules from State Education Commissioner
Richard Mills before he could assume the post of interim chancellor. The rules
require an education degree, which Levy, a lawyer, does not have.
</P>
<P>
	   But "it is my judgment that, when viewed in its entirety, Mr. Levy's
education, training, background and experience are substantially equivalent to
the requirements set forth in law," Mills said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills had put together an advisory panel to help him make his decision and
that commission unanimously recommended Levy, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver of Manhattan applauded Mills' decision.
"Harold Levy possesses exceptional qualifications and has shown a dedication to
the children of New York City," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy served as a member of the Board of Regents, which runs the state
education system, until Friday. The state Board of Regents runs the state
Education Department and chooses the education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy was not New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's choice for the job and
city officials said his position on the Board of Regents presented a conflict of
interest for Mills.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Regents' question, one of the Board of Education members
who voted for Levy works for Citibank. Levy is the associate general counsel for
Citicorp., the parent company of Citibank, Salomon Smith Barney and Travelers
Insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's over," city lawyer Michael Hess said. "We have to
consider our option which include going to court. The decision was arbitrary,
capricious and ignored the fact that we raised the conflict issue in our
papers."
</P>
<P>
	   Hess had asked Mills in a letter Friday to hold off making a decision on
Levy until the investigation was completed. "There was no hint that that would
all be railroaded through in one day," Hess said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's candidate, Robert Kiley, chief executive of the New York City
Partnership, was rejected when only three of the seven board members voted in
his favor.
</P>
<P>
	   Levy has a law degree from Cornell University and a master's from Oxford
University, where he received a First Class Degree in the Honours School of
Politics, Philosophy and Economics.
</P>
<P>
	   He also is a former appellate attorney in the U.S. Justice Department Civil
Rights Division.
</P>
<P>
	   The interim chancellor will serve for about six months while the board
searches for a new full-time chancellor. The board refused to extend the
contract of the previous chancellor, Rudy Crew, in a 4-3 vote last month.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's great," said Christine Marinoni, director of the New York City
Parent Organizing Consortium, which lobbies for issues like class-size reduction
in New York City schools. "He's a good candidate because he is very informed in
these areas, even as an executive."

<HEADLINE> Air Force Major Refuses Vaccine  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DOVER, Del. (AP) -- A decorated pilot believed to be the highest ranking Air
Force officer to refuse the anthrax vaccine was charged Friday with disobeying
an order.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Sonnie Bates has said his fears that the vaccine would harm his health
grew after he saw other members of his squadron develop unexplained illnesses
after starting the series of six shots.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's got a family to care for, including a 7-year-old autistic son,'' said
Capt. William Burke, the Air Force lawyer assigned to defend Bates. ``He just
can't do that if his health is ruined.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bates could face a court-martial and up to five years in a military prison
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Maj. Frank Smolinsky, chief of public affairs at Dover Air Force Base, where
Bates is stationed, wouldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The base, home to the 436th Airlift Wing, has been a flashpoint in the
controversy over the vaccination program. In May, Col. Felix Grieder, the base
commander, temporarily halted the vaccines after airmen questioned the safety of
the shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Charles Roadman, the Air Force's surgeon general and its top
medical officer, visited the base and addressed the questions of airmen. Shortly
after, Grieder was replaced as the base commander and transferred to a job in
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
	   The Defense Department has ordered the anthrax vaccine to be administered to
all 2.4 million active duty and reserve military troops as protection against
biological warfare. More than 380,000 service members have started the six-shot
regimen.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 200 military personnel have refused to take the vaccine because
they fear its safety, Pentagon officials say.

<HEADLINE> Tribunal Sentences 5 Bosnian Croats  </HEADLINE>
   By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Ruling on its first clear-cut case of
``ethnic cleansing,'' a U.N. tribunal on Friday jailed five Bosnian Croats for
up to 25 years for a 1993 murder rampage that emptied a Bosnian village of every
one of its Muslim inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Antonio Cassese of Italy called the slaughter in Ahmici ``one of the
most vicious illustrations of man's inhumanity to man.''
</P>
<P>
	   After 16 months of hearings, the three-judge panel convicted the men for
crimes against humanity in a house-to-house assault that killed at least 103
Muslims, including 33 women and children, and sent the rest fleeing in terror on
a spring morning. A sixth defendant was released.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosnian Muslim leaders and tribunal prosecutors applauded the ruling.
Defense lawyers said they would appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the biggest trial yet at the tribunal, adding to the eight
convictions handed down since the U.N. court was set up in 1993 by the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
	   Until now, those convicted have been low-level figures in the Bosnian war.
They have included Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs who were convicted for war
crimes and crimes against humanity. No one so far has been convicted of
genocide, the most serious crime under international law.
</P>
<P>
	   The wheels of justice at the tribunal had been turning slowly until
recently. However, NATO peacekeepers have arrested several Bosnian Serb
commanders allegedly responsible for the some of the worst atrocities in the
conflict, include the siege of Sarajevo and the massacre of Muslims in
Srebrenica, which the United Nations had declared a ``safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the help of NATO forces in Yugoslavia, a total of 34 suspects are now
in custody. More than 30 of the tribunal's publicly indicted suspects remain at
large. They include Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, former Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
	   Although ethnicity was a factor in all the other completed trials, none were
an open-and-shut case of ethnic cleansing until this one -- a massacre of
helpless civilians with no strategic military purpose.
</P>
<P>
	   The term ``ethnic cleansing,'' which falls under the count of persecution at
the tribunal, was coined during the 1992-95 Bosnian war to denote the systematic
murder and terror campaigns aimed at ridding a region of a given ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
	   At daybreak on April 16, 1993, villagers were awakened by Croatian
militiamen storming into their homes. Entire families were machine-gunned and
homes were set ablaze. Many of those who survived the bullets were burned alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of a pre-attack population of 356 Muslims and 87 Croats, no Muslims were
left. Croat homes were left untouched.
</P>
<P>
	   Cassese likened the slaughter to a catalogue of atrocities ``which make all
of us shudder with horror and shame'' -- Dachau, the Nazi death camp; the Soweto
massacre under South African apartheid; and My Lai, where U.S. troops
slaughtered civilians during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial, expert witnesses described how nationalist propaganda
instilled fear and suspicion among neighbors whose children once played together
in the streets.
</P>
<P>
	   Vladimir Santic, commander of a local police battalion, got 25 years for the
murder of Musafer Puscul and for passing on superiors' orders to his men. Drago
Josipovic was sentenced to 15 years for taking part in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Brothers Mirjan and Zoran Kupreskic were given eight and 10 years,
respectively, in the murder of Naser Ahmic and his children and grandchildren.
Their cousin, Vlatko Kupreskic, got six years. Dragan Papic was acquitted for
lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Judges conceded the rank-and-file militiamen did not bear ultimate
responsibility. A verdict in the trial of Gen. Timohir Blaskic, commander of
Bosnian Croat militia in the area, has yet to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, we are one step closer to justice than yesterday,'' said Mirza
Hajric, adviser to Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim member of Bosnia's multiethnic
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Survivor of crash that killed 4 friends testifies at traffic murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANTEO, N.C. (AP) - A New Jersey teen-ager recalled Friday how a beach
outing with four friends ended with blinding speed at an Outer Banks
intersection in a wreck that killed all four 17-year-old girls.
<P>
	   Michael Horner, 17, of Indian Mills, N.J., testified at the Dare County
Superior Court trial of Melissa Marvin, a 30-year-old Kill Devil Hills waitress
charged with four second-degree murder counts and one count of assault with a
deadly weapon. She could be sent to prison for up to 40 years if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   After Horner's testimony, the defense called a handful of witnesses, ut
Marvin didn't testify. Both sides delivered closing arguments, and the judge
gave the jury instructions early Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony earlier this week showed Marvin had five midday drinks before
getting behind the wheel of her red sport utility vehicle. Prosecutors said she
ran a red light, and her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal
level.
</P>
<P>
	   The red SUV slammed into the teen-agers' car so quickly last April 6 that no
one had time to say anything, Horner testified Friday. During his matter-of-fact
account, Marvin bowed her head, rocked back and forth and wept.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner, who was knocked unconscious and later had his spleen removed, said
he and the four girls were returning from the beach when the accident occurred.
Killed in the wreck were Megan Blong, Amanda Geiger and Angie McGrady, all of
Burlington County, N.J., as well as Shana Lawler.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner said Lawler had recently moved from Burlington County to the Outer
Banks, and he and the other girls had taken a bus to town to visit her. The day
of the accident, he said, they had gone jogging, washed the car and spent time
at the beach.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to Lawler's home from the beach, Blong, who was driving, began
turning left on a green arrow at an intersection, said Horner, who said he was
in the front passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw the red SUV speeding toward us, and that's the last thing I
remembered," he said. "We were hit ... I was knocked unconscious."
</P>
<P>
	   He said when he awakened, Megan was leaning against him, and paramedics were
crowded around the car. He was placed on a stretcher and put in an ambulance
with Marvin, but remembered little of the trip to the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner said he didn't learn what happened to his friends until after he was
transported by helicopter to Albemarle Hospital in Elizabeth City and had
undergone surgery to remove his spleen.
</P>
<P>
	   After the accident, Marvin refused to submit to an alcohol breath test, so
police obtained a search warrant to draw blood. The blood sample, taken more
than four hours after the wreck, showed her to have a blood-alcohol level of
.21, nearly three times North Carolina's legal limit of .08.
</P>
<P>
	   In closing arguments, prosecutor Amber Davis said witnesses reported seeing
Marvin with a foot on her dashboard.
</P>
<P>
	   "She barrels down there, 60 miles an hour, runs right through the red light.
Cars collide. Bodies fly everywhere," she said, condemning Marvin's actions as
"selfish, willful, indifferent acts."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis also asked jurors to consider an expert witness' estimate that
Marvin's blood-alcohol level at the time of the crash was .285.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Michael Sanders urged consideration of conflicting
testimony about whether Marvin had her foot on the dashboard and apparent
discrepancies in testimony about her driving before the crash. He questioned how
much liquor was in the drinks she consumed, noting witnesses said they didn't
notice she had balance or speech problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier testimony showed Marvin had had at least five drinks before getting
behind the wheel and that she had been arrested for driving while impaired twice
before. Both times, Marvin was permitted to plead guilty to a lesser charge of
careless and reckless driving.

<HEADLINE> Letterman Has Quintuple Bypass  </HEADLINE>
    By SHARON L. CRENSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- "Late Show" host David Letterman underwent emergency
quintuple bypass surgery Friday after a test found one of his arteries was
seriously blocked.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's fine," spokesman Steven Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman, 52, had an angiogram because of what he said was high cholesterol
and a history of heart disease in his family. The test, during which a flexible
tube is inserted into an artery and dye is injected, revealed the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. O. Wayne Isom, who performed the procedure at New York Presbyterian
Hospital, said it went smoothly. He predicted a rapid recovery. "Dave has the
heart muscle of a 20-year-old," Isom said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubenstein said CBS would air "Late Show" reruns until Letterman recovers.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's personal physician and his cardiologist said it was too early to
determine how long recovery would take. Heart experts said Letterman is likely
to spend six to eight weeks recuperating at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Like everything else, Letterman has made a long-running joke of his health,
starting years ago when he discovered he had high cholesterol. For a month he
went on an oat-bran diet, complaining nightly about the taste and consistency of
the stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman disclosed he was going to have the angiogram during a taping of
his program with guest Regis Philbin. The segment was to air Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The host turned momentarily serious when he asked Philbin about his own
successful emergency angioplasty at age 59 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "The reason I'm bringing this up is that I have very high cholesterol, and I
also have a history of this," said Letterman, whose father died of a heart
attack in his 50s.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman returned to jokes when Philbin asked him how high the cholesterol
level was.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's borderline ... 680," Letterman wisecracked. Doctors usually recommend
people keep their cholesterol levels under 200.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman said the worst-case scenario would be to "open Daddy's rib cage
... and I don't want that."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman broke into network TV on CBS in 1978 as a guest on Mary Tyler
Moore's variety show, "Mary." He later made appearances on "The Tonight Show"
starring Johnny Carson and guest hosted "Tonight" numerous times.
</P>
<P>
	   After a brief stint as the host of daytime's "The David Letterman Show," his
after-dark career took off with "Late Night with David Letterman." It premiered
on NBC in 1982 in the time slot following Carson.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman moved to CBS in 1993 shortly after Carson retired and NBC gave the
coveted "Tonight" host position to rival Jay Leno.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nursing Home Probes  </HEADLINE>
   By KAREN GULLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House proposed spending an extra $16 million to
improve oversight of nursing homes, but a GOP congressional leader said that
won't fix the flawed system for monitoring care.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton will ask Congress for the extra money in his 2001 budget
plan to pay to train inspectors, conduct surprise inspections and crack down on
the 100 worst facilities.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, campaigning for president in New Hampshire,
announced the proposal Friday at a meeting with the National Council of Senior
Citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to upgrade the enforcement of standards at nursing homes so we can
make sure those standard are good,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of a Senate Special Committee on
Aging, said more money won't guarantee better quality at nursing homes because
the U.S. government does a poor job of making sure that state inspectors enforce
federal nursing home laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under this system we could quadruple enforcement money with no guarantees
of success,'' said Grassley. ``It's like throwing cash into a river.''
</P>
<P>
	   Grassley said the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers
the enforcement funds, should assure taxpayers they are getting their money's
worth before increases are approved.
</P>
<P>
	   And a nursing home group said what's needed is more money for staffing, not
monitoring. Medicare and Medicaid, which finance bills of most nursing home
residents, pay too little for facilities to recruit and keep highly-qualified
staff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Quality of life and quality of care is not being measured,'' said Linda
Keegan, vice president of the American Health Care Association. ``If the
administration is going to look at investing more in long-term care, it should
look at staffing.''
</P>
<P>
	   The administration proposal would bring total funds for nursing care
oversight to $70 million, an increase of close to 30 percent from last year.
Most of the money goes to state agencies responsible for inspecting 16,700
nursing homes providing care for about 1.6 million older Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, money would be earmarked for:
</P>
<P>
	   --Training inspectors to file computerized reports on nursing home
compliance that will make it easier to identify problem homes, track whether
they are improving and provide information for surveyors visiting the
facilities. The reports are made available to consumers on a World Wide Web
site.
</P>
<P>
	   --Inspecting nursing homes during evenings and weekends to ensure that
facilities, where staff know that inspections normally occur during the day,
aren't hiding substandard practices.
</P>
<P>
	   --More inspections of at least 100 homes with the worst compliance records.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to make sure that those entities are inspected more frequently,''
said Chris Jennings, Clinton's health policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
	   Jennings also said the administration would launch a $10 million campaign to
inform elderly Americans about what long-term care Medicare covers, how to
evaluate long-term care policies and how to get information on community-based
services.

<HEADLINE> Russia: U.S. Seeks To Weaken Russia  </HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SEWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia unveiled its new national security doctrine on Friday,
broadening the Kremlin's authority to use nuclear weapons and accusing the
United States of trying to weaken Russia and become the world's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine replaces one adopted in 1997, a time when political and
military partnership with the West were still buzzwords and many Russians
remained optimistic about the country's economic future.
</P>
<P>
	   But Russia's attitude to the West has hardened following the eastward
expansion of NATO and the alliance's intervention in Yugoslavia, and the
nation's economic reform efforts have suffered serious setbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The idea of partnership has vanished,'' said Sergei Sorkut, a military
affairs writer at the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper, which published the entire
doctrine in its weekly military supplement.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the ``Concept of National
Security'' into law on Monday, but the full document was not published in
Russian newspapers until Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The most significant change in the lengthy document, which covers two full
newspaper pages, concerns the use of Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   In a section called ``Ensuring the National Security of Russia,'' the new
doctrine would allow the country's leaders to use all existing forces
``including nuclear weapons'' to oppose any attack -- nuclear or conventional --
if other efforts fail to repel the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous doctrine stated that Russia would use nuclear weapons only in
cases when its national sovereignty was threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The level and scale of military threats is growing,'' the doctrine said,
as if to justify the new emphasis on the potential use of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Military experts say the shift was due to the tremendous weakness of
Russia's conventional forces, which might not be able to defend the country
against attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It widens the range of Russia's use of nuclear weapons,'' Sorkut said in
an interview. ``It's a guarantee that Russia won't be attacked.''
</P>
<P>
	   Following the publication of the document, the Russian military tried to
play down the significance of the nuclear aspect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Moscow is interested in expanding cooperation with the West,'' Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov, the deputy chief of the General Staff, told the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials who have seen the document
described it as having a much more aggressive and confrontational tone than its
predecessor. However, security experts have pointed out that the new stress on
nuclear weapons sounds like NATO's own doctrine.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO's policy guidelines state that nuclear arms contribute to peace in
Europe by ``making the risks of aggression against NATO incalculable and
unacceptable in a way that conventional forces alone cannot.'' The alliance's
doctrine calls for the use of nuclear weapons only as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
	   Publication of the new doctrine comes at a time when relations between the
United States and Russia have soured, with sharp differences over Washington's
desire to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to protect itself from
rogue states like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia claims that pulling back from the treaty risks upsetting the
strategic nuclear balance and could unleash a new arms race, which the new
doctrine warns against.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine identifies two ``mutually exclusive'' trends in international
relations following the end of the Cold War: one an attempt to create a
multipolar world and the other an alleged effort led by the United States to
dominate the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia, China, India and France have all opposed what they call U.S.
hegemony following the Cold War and have attempted to create a counterbalance.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine condemns alleged efforts by a series of countries, which are
not identified by name, to weaken Russian economically, politically and
militarily.
</P>
<P>
	   The document, which seems defensive about Russia's loss of international
authority, warned of the dangers of sapping Russia of its strength and reducing
its influence in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The national interests of Russia in the international sphere consist of
guaranteeing its sovereignty and consolidation of Russia's position as a great
power,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is accused of trying to decide key international problems
on its own and to bypass international law. The doctrine urges that the United
Nations and other international institutions be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctrine is frank about Russia's economic weaknesses, calling for
efforts to strengthen the economy in order for the country to remain a major
power.
</P>
<P>
	   It acknowledges that it is in Russia's interest to maintain its economic
links to the outside world and there is no suggestion that it intends to abandon
free market principles.
</P>
<P>
	   The document identifies sharp differences between rich and poor,
unemployment and poverty as obstacles to Russia's status as an important power.
</P>
<P>
	   It also voices fears of a growing number of foreign spies in Russia, and
calls for greater efforts to fight terrorism, a danger that threatens the
country's stability.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Urges Turkey-Kurdish Peace  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- As protesters called for his head, the condemned
leader of Turkey's Kurdish rebels urged the country Friday to use his temporary
reprieve as a chance to make peace.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's decision to delay Abdullah Ocalan's execution until the
European Court of Human Rights reviews the case has angered some in Turkey,
especially relatives of soldiers killed fighting Ocalan's Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Two soldiers set themselves on fire Thursday in protest, suffering minor
burns. In a new protest Friday, relatives chanting ``hang Ocalan!'' laid black
wreaths at the offices of governing parties and some demanded the government's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our enemy is to be fed and sheltered, while we have nothing but our sons'
medals,'' said Serafettin Inceturkmen, who leads a relatives' support group in
the central city of Kayseri.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement from prison, Ocalan said his reprieve should not be taken as
a defeat for one side or a victory for the other. He urged Turks and Kurds to
reconcile.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This period should not be wasted,'' he said. ``There is need for peace and
stability at home. If there are developments in that direction, PKK will respond
positively.''
</P>
<P>
	   PKK is Ocalan's rebel group, the Kurdistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan also asked the government to declare an amnesty for rebels. An offer
of reduced sentences failed to lure many guerrillas out of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey is trying to join the European Union, and executing Ocalan could
cripple its campaign. The government's decision to put the execution on hold was
applauded in Europe and by human rights activists and Kurds at home. The
European Union also wants Turkey to improve a human rights record marred by its
treatment of the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are against, I am against the death penalty and I can express only
satisfaction,'' European Commission President Romano Prodi said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Hurriyet daily newspaper, commentator Tufan Turenc begged outraged
relatives of soldiers for patience.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No doubt we feel the grief of martyr families in our hearts,'' he wrote.
``But nothing can be achieved with spite. ... Our country's interests and
children's future forces us to this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan was sentenced to death for treason and separatism for leading a
15-year war for Kurdish autonomy in the country's southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has not executed anyone since 1984, but sentiment against Ocalan runs
high. Some blame him for all 37,000 deaths in the Kurdish conflict, even though
rebels lost more than five times as many people as the army.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his arrest, Ocalan has repeatedly called on his rebels to withdraw and
ordering a cease-fire. The government has spurned talks and called the
cease-fire a ploy.

<HEADLINE> Tug-of-War Over Pearl Harbor Tug  </HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE DUNFORD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) -- The USS Hoga did heroic duty during the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, fighting oil-fed fires, maneuvering ships to
safer locations and picking up survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the 100-foot tugboat needs to be rescued itself.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoga -- the last surviving Navy vessel from the 1941 attack that plunged
the United States into World War II -- is mothballed in San Francisco Bay, salt
water thinning its steel hull.
</P>
<P>
	   The tug and its 11-man crew were credited at Pearl Harbor with helping push
the heavily damaged USS Nevada to shallow water, preventing it from sinking and
blocking the harbor's entrance.
</P>
<P>
	   It also pulled the repair ship USS Vestal away from the burning and sinking
battleship USS Arizona, and for three days poured water onto the Arizona's
flaming superstructure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoga -- the Sioux word for fish -- later spent 40 years fighting fires
for the city of Oakland, and was retired in 1989.
</P>
<P>
	   The tug, built in 1940, is considered inactive by the Navy, which wants to
scrap it. The boat is on the National Register of Historic Places and listed by
the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of the nation's 11 most
seriously endangered historic places.
</P>
<P>
	   There is interest in saving it, but there are no firm offers.
</P>
<P>
	   A Hawaii group and the National Park Service in 1995 tried to raise $500,000
to return it to the islands and refurbish it, but came up short.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy League's Fort Lauderdale, Fla., chapter would like the tug for a
floating World War II memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   The Walt Disney Co. recently expressed interest in using the Hoga for a
proposed $145 million movie about the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   And backers of the proposed Clinton presidential library in Little Rock,
Ark., have been approached about using the tug for visitor rides to the
riverside library.
</P>
<P>
	   No one, however, has formally applied to the Navy's Ships Donation Office,
which would evaluate plans for financing, mooring, maintaining and displaying
the tug before making a recommendation to the secretary of the Navy, deputy
program manager Gloria Carvalho said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want it to be a static display,'' said Carvalho, who believes Pearl
Harbor ``would be the perfect place.''
</P>
<P>
	   If it weren't for bad timing and a slow Hawaii economy, the tugboat might
today be refurbished and resting at a berth here next to other World War II
memorials that draw 1.4 million visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank McHale, a marine construction project manager, headed the Hawaii
effort that raised only $5,000. His effort was overwhelmed by the campaign to
bring the decommissioned battleship Missouri -- on which the Japanese
surrendered -- from Bremerton, Wash., this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Funding support for the Hoga was lost. It never got a fighting chance,''
said Daniel Martinez, historian at the USS Arizona Memorial Visitors Center.
``It's an opportunity missed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Without a corporate sponsor, the chance of bringing the Hoga back to Pearl
Harbor is slipping away, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's such a shame that the little vessel that did so much is not part of
the national history we have here at Pearl Harbor,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Gathers With Trump  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Reform Party leaders who were flying to the
Sunshine State to meet with Donald Trump Friday night didn't have to worry about
the $100,000 membership fee at the Mar-a-Lago Club. They were invited by the
management: the New York developer.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump asked the leaders to his tony members-only club for a fancy party with
cocktails and champagne -- and to talk about his political future. The developer
wanted their read on his chances of winning the White House on the Reform Party
ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   The event also was an exercise in reaching out to members of a party faction
left out of his appearance last week with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, the
leader of an opposing group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am focused on making a good decision regarding whether or not I should
seek the Reform Party presidential nomination,'' Trump said in a statement
Thursday, a day before he ferried some of the party's leaders to Florida aboard
his plush 727.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am anxious to talk with Reform Party leaders about whether it is
possible to achieve unity within the party and whether it is possible for a
Reform Party presidential candidate to win in 2000,'' Trump added.
</P>
<P>
	   For their part, Reform Party leaders said they were eager to meet with the
wealthy developer who considers their presidential ticket a worthy point from
which to launch his political aspirations. Russell Verney, whose post as
national chairman expired Dec. 31, said the internecine fireworks over the
party's direction and site of its convention will fizzle once the presidential
race gets going.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A campaign is separate and distinct from the party,'' Verney, who works
for party founder Ross Perot, said by telephone Thursday before hopping a plane
from Dallas to Palm Beach. Perot, he said, knew about the meeting but didn't
plan on attending.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm going to learn about Donald Trump and his position on the issues and
how he interacts with the Reform Party,'' Verney said. ``From what I've read in
his book, his positions are compatible with the Reform Party's platform.''
</P>
<P>
	   The party, moved from poolside to indoors due to wind, was at the
72-year-old Mar-a-Lago, named for its ``sea-to-lake'' spot on 18 acres between
the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built the estate in 1927, willed it to the
federal government to use as a winter White House, but its $3 million-a-year
maintenance fees were too much for the government. Trump bought it in 1985 for
$8 million of its $25 million asking price, and a decade later he turned it into
a members-only club, according to the club's Web site.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebel Chief Attends Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS POZOS, Colombia (AP) -- The leader of Colombia's largest leftist rebel
group attended peace talks Friday in a southern jungle, his first such
appearance since the peace process resumed last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Manuel Marulanda Velez, head of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, sat at the negotiating table for two hours with government
representatives in a remote jungle location 185 miles south of the capital,
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   Marulanda, believed to be in his mid-70s, had little to say to reporters,
but his mere presence could bode well for the negotiations, which have yielded
few results since beginning a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very important that Marulanda is here because it's a ratification of
the FARC's political will to keep seeking, through dialogue and negotiation, a
solution to the conflict,'' said government negotiator Fabio Valencia.
</P>
<P>
	   The FARC is one of two main rebel groups that have been fighting the
Colombian government for nearly four decades. The conflict has killed an
estimated 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived Friday in the northern
Colombian port city of Cartagena to promote a proposed $1.3 billion aid package
to help Colombia fight drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Colombians say the aid will also be used to fight rebels, since the
FARC earns much of its money through taxing drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Surrounded by a phalanx of female bodyguards, Marulanda smiled broadly
before boarding a vehicle en route to his jungle hide-out located in a vast
swath of territory evacuated by the army as a concession to peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, President Andres Pastrana signed a law banning the use of land
mines in Colombia. No one knows for sure how many such mines exist in the
country, but in one southern state alone in 1994, the army located and destroyed
17,000 of them. In the northern Colombian region of Uraba in 1997, authorities
dismantled 750 land mines in one field.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill fattening pay for lawmakers, judges, her  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Ever so quietly, Gov. Christie Whitman on Friday
signed a bill that will raise lawmakers salaries by 40 percent in two years and
give hefty increases to judges, prosecutors, and her successor.
<P>
	   Lawmakers who serve in New Jersey's part-time Legislature will take home
$49,000 a year beginning in 2002. That's $14,000 more than they earn now. But it
will be their first pay increase in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
	   The pay raise bill also means the governor who succeeds Whitman can earn up
to $175,000. Only New York's governor is paid more. Whitman now takes home
$85,000 a year, but is allowed to take as much as $130,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The pay raise bill became law just eight days after it was suddenly placed
back into play by lawmakers who were nearing the end of the 208th Legislative
Session. After years of dodging the issue for fear of voter outrage, the
Assembly and Senate passed the bill Monday without any floor debates. The
two-year legislative session ended at noon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor signed the bill Friday, listing it along with a few dozen other
bills and with no official comment. On Thursday, however, Whitman spoke about
higher pay in response to a question during the governor's monthly call-in radio
program.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Legislature determined that there's been a long time since there was
any kind of increase at all," Whitman said. "Ten years is a very long time
without an increase."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also said New Jersey was "losing some of our best judges" because of
pay. Supreme Court Chief Justice Deborah Poritz had told lawmakers that morale
in the judiciary was low due to money. The state's Superior Court judges will be
paid $141,000 after a phase-in that ends in 2002. For judges in all the
branches, the pay increase will average more than 20 percent over three years.
The chief justice will get $164,250 by 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the state constitution requires lawmakers to stand for election
before any pay raise they vote themselves takes effect, their checks won't be
fattened until 2002. All 120 lawmakers in the Assembly and Senate are up for
election in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   By today's standards, the raise would make lawmakers among the highest paid
in the nation, not taking into account potential pay raises in other states
between now and 2002. The last time their salary was raised was 1990. The
lawmaker pay package also includes health care and pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, lawmakers balked at raising their own pay for fear of voter
outrage. Senate President Donald DiFrancesco said Monday he abstained from the
pay vote because he is concerned the pay raise issue may be used against him in
the future. The Union County Republican is considering a run for governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the lawmakers set up a commission to study their pay and the pay
of other state officials. The commission, after a few sparsely attended
hearings, came up with a list of pay raise suggestions - and a recommendation
that it stay in business to review salary levels continually. Lawmakers swiftly
took action in the waning days of the legislative session. The plan breezed
through both budget committees last Thursday, and both houses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   With the bill moving so swiftly, it drew little public comment at the
Statehouse, although it became a subject of talk-radio criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the bill, county prosecutors will get $141,000 by 2002. It allows the
same salary for members of the governor's cabinet, and those on the Casino
Control Commission and the Board of Public Utilities, if the governor approves.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman stressed that she will not raise the pay of her cabinet members
until the findings of a special commission on pay in the state work force has
completed its work.

<HEADLINE> Feds Returning Land to Utes  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT GEHRKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In one of the biggest givebacks of Indian land in
U.S. history, the government is returning 84,000 acres to the Northern Ute tribe
as part of a deal to clean up millions of tons of uranium waste along the
Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
	   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson announced the agreement Friday at the
tribe's headquarters in Fort Duchesne, about 110 miles southeast of Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, which the Energy Department called the largest return of Indian
land in the Lower 48 states in a century, is subject to approval by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The land, which is believed to contain oil-rich shale deposits, was given to
the Utes in 1882. But in 1916, on the eve of the nation's entry into World War
I, the federal government took it back to create a reserve supply of oil for the
Navy fleet. The reserve was never tapped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The land is not needed for national security anymore,'' Richardson said.
``The right thing to do is turn it back. They're the rightful owners.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the agreement, the Indians can open the land to oil and gas drilling.
But they will have to pay a percentage of the royalties to the government.
</P>
<P>
	   That money will, in turn, help the government cover the $300 million cost of
relocating 10.5 million tons of radioactive rock and soil left over from the
mining of uranium during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is actually a moral issue in that the government has finally returned
to us what was taken from us without our consent,'' said O. Roland McCook,
chairman of the tribe's governing body. Also, ``it will add to our economic base
and our land base.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Energy Department estimates that the land, which is next to the 4.4
million-acre Ute reservation, holds 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, or
about 30 percent of the natural gas used in the United States during 1998. There
are no estimates of how much oil is there.
</P>
<P>
	   The royalty percentage is being negotiated but is expected to be around 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The radioactive waste sits 750 feet from the Colorado River just outside
Arches National Park. The pile is about 50 miles south of the land being
returned to the Utes.
</P>
<P>
	   A study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that toxins such as
arsenic and ammonia are leaching from the pile and contaminating the river,
threatening endangered species of fish.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., has also raised concern that the river
contamination is tainting the drinking water for 25 million people in Arizona,
Nevada and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver-based Atlas Corp., the company that operated the mine from 1962 to
1984, has declared bankruptcy, leaving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
clean up the pile. However, the cleanup bond Atlas left behind was woefully
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   The NRC planned to cover the tailings with an earthen cap and drain 500
million gallons of water from the pile. But state and federal officials and
environmentalists argued that would not stop contamination. They pressed the
Energy Department to take control of the pile and move it 18 miles north of
Moab.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a huge breakthrough and we're very heartened,'' said Bill Hedden,
chairman of the Grand Canyon Trust, an environmental group that had sued to have
the tailings moved.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the possibility of oil and gas drilling on the land makes
environmentalists uneasy. The Sierra Club is pushing to have roughly one-fourth
of the parcel protected as wilderness.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the agreement, the Utes pledged to protect a quarter-mile
corridor along 75 miles of the Green River.

<HEADLINE> GOP Leaders Acknowledge Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Republican leaders brainstorming on how to broaden
their appeal among Hispanics, blacks and women acknowledged Friday that they
have a communication problem.
</P>
<P>
	   After nearly three days of focus groups, panel discussions and closed-door
meetings on how to reach voters who normally gravitate to the Democrats, Rep.
J.C. Watts, R-Okla., put it bluntly: ``The way we communicated in 1980, we can't
do in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
	   Watts, the only black Republican in Congress, said GOP talk of such notions
as family values can alienate voters in nontraditional families.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't talk about family values in a way that you make a single mom feel
like she doesn't love her kids as much as my wife and I love our kids,'' Watts
told several hundred people at the Republican National Committee gathering.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans also have driven would-be voters away with rhetoric that focuses
too heavily on the insider workings of government, Watts said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't talk legislatively, people don't understand that,'' he said. ``We
can't talk about process, they don't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But they do understand that we're going to give you some of your money
back to buy those new tires for your car, to buy your kids some school clothes,
to buy that new furniture that you need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a series of speeches and interviews at the twice-a-year gathering, other
Republican leaders echoed Watts' assessment that while GOP ideas are right, the
party's delivery has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I see our message continually co-opted by my friends on the other side of
the aisle, so I'm not concerned about the message,'' said John McGraw, the
chairman of the California Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm concerned about our delivery, our marketing,'' he said. ``Our
marketing department hasn't been so good. We've got to fire our V.P. of
marketing and get a new marketing department.''
</P>
<P>
	   McGraw said he plans to begin a series of town hall appearances in minority
communities throughout the nation's largest state.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's open mike time,'' he said. ``A lot of people say you're crazy for
doing it, but I actually think as state party chairman in a state like this, we
really need to know why these folks have been disenfranchised from our party,
what they think we need to do to feel more welcome, how do we make our message
resonate more effectively.''
</P>
<P>
	   Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt held up Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush as examples of Republican leaders who have won over large numbers of
Hispanic voters by reaching out ``across ethnic lines and (drawn) into this
Republican Party people who have values the same as ours.''
</P>
<P>
	   The keys, he said, are ``the language that they use, the language of
understanding, the capacity to reach out to different groups.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former RNC Chairman Haley Barbour said internal surveys show blacks' and
Hispanics' values often dovetail with Republicans'.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Part of the problem is our failure to effectively communicate our message
in the community, because there is a receptive audience,'' he said in an
interview.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Reindeer Herders Want Laws  </HEADLINE>
   By KIM GAMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Reindeer herders who say they are losing valuable
animals to predators welcomed proposals that could lead to sweeping changes of
Sweden's laws on predatory animals.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals, made Friday by a government-appointed investigator, would
establish a minimum number of bears, wolves, lynxes, wolverines and golden
eagles for the first time in Sweden and make it easier to hunt the animals when
there are too many or when they threaten livestock.
</P>
<P>
	   The special investigator also recommended an increase in compensation for
reindeer killed by the wild animals and improved enforcement against illegal
hunting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swedish environmental protection agency appointed Soeren Ekstroem in
February 1998 to investigate the nation's policy toward predatory animals and
hunting after the government faced criticism over the rising number of
carnivores and the threat to livestock.
</P>
<P>
	   Ekstroem said Sweden should have a minimum of 1,500 bears, 300 wolverines,
1,000 lynxes, 200 wolves and 1,200 golden eagles.
</P>
<P>
	   While the figures gave most of the animals room to grow, Ekstroem's
suggestions would mean cutting Sweden's lynx population by a third from its
current level of 1,500 animals.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals, which were compiled in conjunction with reindeer herders,
hunters, conservationists and farmers, will be reviewed by other agencies before
the government decides whether to submit them to parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   Current rules are vague, with the environmental protection agency deciding
each year how many of the protected animals can be hunted.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sami, traditionally reindeer-herding people, have lobbied the government
to reduce the danger from predatory animals and to increase compensation for
slain reindeer. The Sami, once called Lapps, are the indigenous people of
Europe's arctic. They welcomed the proposals but said more needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a very good step to some kind of solution,'' said Per Gustav
Idivuoma, vice chairman of the National Association of Sami, which organizes
Sweden's 52 Sami villages in the northern half of the country. ``We'll see what
the politicians say about this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lynxes and wolverines especially have caused problems in recent years for
the Sami, who earn their livelihoods with the reindeer herds, Idivuoma said. At
least 20,000 reindeer -- worth about $300 each -- are killed each year, Idivuoma
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Others Faulted in Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The structure of a tanker that spilled millions of gallons of
oil off France's Atlantic coast was probably at fault in the disaster, according
to a preliminary report made public Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report by the Bureau of Inquiries of Sea Accidents said the tanker's
owner and the company responsible for doing checkups on the vessel also may
share blame for the Dec. 12 spill.
</P>
<P>
	   The Maltese-registered tanker ``Erika'' broke up and sank off the
picturesque Atlantic coast, spilling at least 3 million gallons of heavy oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The slick has been washing up on land, sullying beaches and oyster beds with
foul-smelling patches of thick, gummy oil and killing thousands of birds.
Specialists and volunteers are still scraping oil from 250 miles of beaches.
</P>
<P>
	   In its report, the accident bureau indicated that a corroded barrier between
a full oil tank and an empty one may have collapsed, eventually causing the ship
to crack in two. Although a sea storm was likely an aggravating factor, the
vessel should have been able to withstand it, the report said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said RINA, the Italian company responsible for the boat's
checkups, did not properly take into account the 24-year-old vessel's age. It
said the ship's owner should have asked RINA to do more in-depth examinations of
the ship's structure.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have not yet been able to determine who actually owns the
``Erika,'' though they have been looking into a number of companies thought to
serve as fronts for the owner.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also criticized companies that have chartered the boat.
Franco-Belgian oil company TotalFina had hired the tanker before it sank.
</P>
<P>
	   The report did not point blame at the vessel's captain or crew.
</P>
<P>
	   The document does not ``establish any penal or civil responsibilities,''
accident bureau official Georges Tourret said. A full report should be handed
over to international maritime authorities within five or six months, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the cleanup continues, oil-tainted western beaches will be clean in
time for the influx of summer tourists, the head of France's coastal authority
said in an interview published Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They will be (ready) -- but it will take a considerable amount of work,''
Francois Letourneux was quoted as saying in an interview with the French daily
La Croix.
</P>
<P>
	   Letourneux said cleanup teams are benefiting from knowledge acquired in the
wake of the huge 1978 Amoco Cadiz oil spill off the French coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are better prepared technically,'' he said. ``We won't be applying any
brutal treatment that would cause more harm than good.''

	   The 40-year-old electrical contractor was going through a bitter divorce in
November 1991 when he was shot in the head at close range as he sat in a car
outside his girlfriend's apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators say Zeihen's mother-in-law shot him, his brother-in-law
supplied the weapon, and his father-in-law drove the getaway car.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors believe the family of his wife killed Zeihen to prevent him from
gaining custody of the couple's 3-year-old daughter
</P>
<P>
	   It grew into a web of bribery, arson, aborted murder-for-hire plots and
finally a murder that stayed secret until authorities were contacted last summer
by the brother-in-law, Theil T. Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldberg, 37, told sheriff's deputies he had been troubled for years about
his parents involvement in the murder, and he was coming forward in the belief
his mother was becoming extremely dangerous again.
</P>
<P>
	   He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder Thursday after reaching a deal
with Spokane County prosecutors. They likely will request a 10-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
	   His father, Morris ``Mel'' Goldberg, 68, backed out of a plea agreement at
the last minute Thursday and was jailed for aggravated first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The same charge was simultaneously filed against his ex-wife, JoAnn Goldberg
Peterson, 62, who now lives in Moyie Springs, Idaho. She is awaiting trial in
northern Idaho on an unrelated federal charge of possessing a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeihen's wife, Orinne Goldberg, has not been charged in the case. But
investigators say they are continuing to look into any involvement she may have
had.
</P>
<P>
	   The unraveling of the case is a relief to Zeihen's family, said their
lawyer, Peter Schweda. He represented Zeihen in his divorce and later helped his
parents block Orinne Goldberg from rights to the slain man's estate.
</P>
<P>
	   During the custody dispute over their child, Orinne Goldberg accused her
estranged husband of molesting the girl. A police investigation determined the
allegation was unfounded, and court documents allege Orinne Goldberg and her
mother made it up to prevent him from gaining custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Zeihen was repeatedly harassed and threatened in the months leading up to
the divorce trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Three weeks before it was to start, he was attacked by a disguised assailant
who fired several shots after Zeihen left his apartment. Zeihen, wearing a
bulletproof vest and a holstered gun for protection, wasn't injured, but the
assailant got away.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, on Nov. 18, 1991, just over a week before the trial was to begin,
Zeihen was shot to death as he waited outside his girlfriend's apartment.
</P>
<P>
	   His mother-in-law allegedly fired a single shot from a 12-gauge shotgun at
close range, killing him instantly, court documents say.
</P>
<P>
	   She later told a friend she wanted Zeihen to recognize ``who was going to
kill him just before the fatal shot was fired,'' investigators said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``JoAnn talked about Zeihen looking directly into her eyes moments before he
died, realizing that it was her, which was exactly what she wanted to see
happen,'' sheriff's Detective Mark Henderson said in court documents.
</P>
<P>
	   Mel Goldberg drove a getaway car that had been stolen earlier that day.
</P>
<P>
	   The gun was provided by Theil Goldberg, who had taken it from neighbors,
documents allege.
</P>
<P>
	   After the neighbors, Robert Lamm and Marcie Harrington, told Mel Goldberg
they planned to contact police, their home burned in the middle of the night,
court papers say. They escaped, and the fire was thought to be arson.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Washington law, a conviction for aggravated first-degree murder
carries either capital punishment or life in prison without parole. But Deputy
prosecutor Steven Kinn said he will not seek the death penalty against the
three.

<HEADLINE> Schiffer pleads guilty in officer's killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) - A Pennsylvania man admitted to murder Friday in
the 1958 killing of a Rahway police officer and agreed to testify against his
cousin, the alleged triggerman.
<P>
	   Theodore Schiffer, 61, of Blakeley, Pa., could serve less than three years
in prison for felony murder under 1958 sentencing guidelines and a plea
agreement reached by Union County prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   He agreed to testify against Robert Zarinsky, a convicted murderer charged
last month with the Nov. 28, 1958, killing of Rahway Police Officer Charles
Bernoskie, a 30-year-old father of six who was shot three times while trying to
stop the robbery of a car dealership.
</P>
<P>
	   For years, officers had no leads in the case, other than the statements of
two witnesses who saw two white men flee the scene, and unidentified
fingerprints. The witnesses are now dead.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, however, Zarinsky's sister, Judith Sapsa, came forward to
implicate Zarinsky and Schiffer in the officer's killing, saying she watched as
a child while her mother removed a bullet from Zarinsky's buttocks and heard
Zarinsky say that he had shot the officer after Bernoskie fired his weapon,
wounding both men.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer told Superior Court Judge John Triarsi that he helped Zarinsky
break into a Miller Pontiac dealership, but that Zarinsky had the gun and fired
the weapon. Schiffer said he ran from the dealership after he heard someone
coming.
</P>
<P>
	   "After I started running, I heard shots fired," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer's lawyer, Joseph D'Andrea, said Schiffer had not planned the
robbery with Zarinsky. He merely went along after getting in a car for a drive
with his cousin, D'Andrea said.
</P>
<P>
	   He never told anyone about the killing, not his brother or his three
children who appeared in court Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was terribly afraid of his cousin," D'Andrea said.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarinsky is serving a 98-year prison term for the 1969 murder of a
17-year-old girl. Investigators also suspect him in the unsolved killings of
four other women between 1969 and 1974, although he hasn't been charged with
those crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Schiffer, who last saw his cousin in 1960, has no information that could
help those investigations, D'Andrea said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the only thing he knows about," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors recommended a 15-year sentence for Schiffer, which the judge
said he would impose after Zarinsky is tried to ensure his cooperation. Schiffer
could be free in less than three years on parole.
</P>
<P>
	   Zarinsky's attorney, Joseph Benedict, said Schiffer's negotiations for a
light sentence will shed doubt on his testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   "That kind of testimony is not very trustworthy," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plea agreement also recommends that Schiffer serve his sentence at
Lackawanna County Jail in Scranton, Pa. D'Andrea said Schiffer wanted to be
close to his family and was afraid of serving time in the same prison as
Zarinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   "Thank you, thank you," Elizabeth Bernoskie, the officer's widow, said as
she left the courtroom. She watched Schiffer's plea with some of her children
and several officers who worked on the case, including the detective who found
Bernoskie's body in 1958.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm so relieved it's over," said a tearful John DeStefano, who continued
working on the case after he retired from the Rahway Police Department in 1977.
"They got a lucky break."
</P>
<P>
	   Judith Sapsa came forward after her husband was charged with stealing money
from an inheritance fund in Zarinsky's name. Police found Schiffer in
Pennsylvania and charged him after matching his fingerprints to prints they
lifted from antifreeze cans in 1958.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed: Israel Buying 50 Jets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Lockheed Martin said Friday it received a contract
to produce 50 F-16 fighter jets for Israel in a deal valued at about $2.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Delivery of the jets will start in early 2003 and continue for about three
years, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   The contract awarded by the U.S. Department of Defense completed
negotiations that began after Israel in July selected the F-16 as its new
fighter.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale has created controversy in the Middle East, where Israel and Syria
remain far apart on negotiating a peace agreement. Syria has said it will
increase its army in response to the aircraft deal.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel also received an option to buy 60 additional F-16s, which would bring
the total value of the deal to Lockheed Martin and its subcontractors to $4.5
billion, the company said. If the option is exercised, Lockheed would deliver
jets to Israel well into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel will buy an advanced, two-seat version of the jet that includes
advanced avionics, a helmet-mounted display and advanced weapons and sensors,
the company said. The engines will be provided by Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
	   Within the past year, Lockheed has announced sales of F-16s to Greece, Egypt
and the U.S. Air Force. The company is still negotiating the sale of 80 aircraft
to the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., employs about 11,000 people at its
tactical aircraft systems facilities in Fort Worth.

<HEADLINE> Florida Allows Lethal Injection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Gov. Jeb Bush signed bills Friday that make lethal
injection the state's primary means of execution and speed up the appeals
process for death row inmates.
</P>
<P>
	   The measures were passed in a special legislative session that was called to
address executions, which have been on hold in Florida since the Supreme Court
agreed in October to hear a challenge to the state's use of the electric chair.
The state has asked for the case to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   The chair came under closer scrutiny after flames shot from the apparatus
during executions in 1990 and 1997 and blood streamed down a condemned man's
face last spring. Now only three states -- Georgia, Alabama and Nebraska -- use
the electric chair as their sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had said he wouldn't approve a switch to lethal injection without the
second bill, which limits death row inmates to two appeals in state courts in
most cases and requires second appeals be filed within six months of the first.
Currently, convicted killers must file their second appeal within one year.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers hope the change will cut the time between a death sentence and an
execution to just five years. The 44 people who have been executed in Florida
over the last two decades have lived on death row an average of more than 10
years.

<HEADLINE> Justices To Review Davidians Appeal  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court agreed Friday to review an appeal in
which five Branch Davidians challenged their sentences for using firearms during
a gun battle that began the 1993 standoff at the cult's compound near Waco,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   The court said it will hear the Davidians' argument that they could not be
given longer sentences for using machine guns, rather than some other kind of
firearms, because a jury never decided what type of weapons were used.
</P>
<P>
	   A decision is expected by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Four federal agents and six Davidians were killed during the Feb. 28, 1993,
shootout that started when federal agents tried to arrest cult leader David
Koresh. Fifty-one days later, Koresh and some 80 followers died during a fire
after agents injected tear gas into the building. Nine Davidians who escaped
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   After a trial, Jaime Castillo, Brad Eugene Branch, Renos Lenny Avraam and
Kevin A. Whitecliff were sentenced to consecutive terms of 10 years in prison
for manslaughter and 30 years for using machine guns during a violent crime.
Graeme Leonard Craddock was sentenced to 10 years for using a grenade and a
consecutive 10 years for using a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The firearm law set a five-year sentence but allowed a 10-year term if the
weapon was a semiautomatic firearm and a 30-year term for use of a machine gun
or grenade.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury was not asked to decide what type of firearm was used. The judge
made that determination during sentencing.
</P>
<P>
	   The five Davidians challenged the firearm sentences, saying the type of
weapon should be considered an element of the offense that must be submitted to
the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against them, saying the type of
weapon need not be decided by the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on Friday, the Davidians' lawyers said the firearm law's
sentence-enhancing provision was similar to one in the federal carjacking law
allowing longer sentences in cases of serious injury. Last year, the Supreme
Court decided the serious-injury issue was an element of the carjacking crime
that must be submitted to the jury.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyers acknowledged that federal appeals courts had
differed on the firearm law. But they added the law has been revised to clarify
that the type of weapon was a sentencing issue and need not be decided by the
jury.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Castillo vs. U.S., 99-658.

<HEADLINE> Political Cartoonist Sues Over Hand  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL MAULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The world's most widely published political cartoonist is
suing a surgeon and a hospital for $10 million, claiming his drawing hand was
crippled during a botched operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranan Lurie, 67, said the surgery on his right hand left his pinky finger
curved inward, making drawing awkward and painful.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I used to do eight to 10 cartoons a week; now I can hardly do four. I used
to paint my cartoons. Now I use a computer,'' Lurie said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1979, the Guinness Book of World Records has listed him as the world's
most widely syndicated political cartoonist, drawing caricatures of newsmakers
from Deng Xiaoping to Bill Gates for 1,100 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, Lurie injured a ligament in his right pinky while
in an airport in Seoul, South Korea, in 1997. He consulted Dr. Richard G. Eaton
on the recommendation of a friend, New York Yankees pitcher David Cone.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the hourlong operation under a local anesthetic, Lurie said, ``I
was left on my own. I didn't get any therapy afterward. The finger stiffened so
that it formed an inward circle, a very sharp crescent.''
</P>
<P>
	   When he returned to Eaton, Lurie said, the doctor recommended that it be
amputated.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I almost fainted. He tried to convince me that it would be a good thing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lurie said other physicians opposed amputating his finger, and another
doctor eventually performed a second operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The end result is that the finger can move,'' said Lurie. ``It's obviously
damaged, but I'm limited in what I can do.
</P>
<P>
	   Lurie's papers, filed Thursday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court, said
Eaton was ``negligent'' and the surgery was ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Annie Ting, manager of the C.V. Starr Hand Surgery Center at St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital , said only Eaton could comment on Lurie's lawsuit,
and he is out of town until Jan. 24.

<HEADLINE> Ruling on License Plates Delayed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A judge postponed decisions Friday on key
issues in a lawsuit to block sales of Florida's ``Choose Life'' license plate --
including whether Gov. Jeb Bush should be compelled to testify, and whether the
case should be moved to Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
	   Circuit Court Judge Moses Baker said he will not rule on the motion to
transfer until at least Wednesday and will not rule for at least 10 days on
whether Bush must testify about his role in getting the plates approved,
according to the plaintiffs' attorney, Barry Silver.
</P>
<P>
	   The plaintiffs argue the license plate is a state-sanctioned political
statement against abortion. Supporters say that the plate, which goes on sale
next month and costs $22 extra, is meant to promote adoption and that proceeds
will support organizations serving pregnant women who plan to give up their
babies for adoption.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver contends Bush pressured the Department of Highway Safety &AMP; Motor
Vehicles into producing the specialty plates although the department's lawyers
had decided to delay production until the litigation had been resolved.

<HEADLINE> Survivor of crash that killed 4 friends testifies at traffic murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MANTEO, N.C. (AP) - A New Jersey teen-ager recalled Friday how a beach
outing with four friends ended with blinding speed at an Outer Banks
intersection in a wreck that killed all four 17-year-old girls.
<P>
	   Michael Horner, 17, of Indian Mills, N.J., testified at the Dare County
Superior Court trial of Melissa Marvin, a 30-year-old Kill Devil Hills waitress
charged with four second-degree murder counts and one count of assault with a
deadly weapon. She could be sent to prison for up to 40 years if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   After Horner's testimony, the defense called a handful of witnesses, ut
Marvin didn't testify. Both sides delivered closing arguments,the judge gave the
jury instructions early Friday evening, and the jury began deliberations shortly
after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony earlier this week showed Marvin had five midday drinks before
getting behind the wheel of her red sport utility vehicle. Prosecutors said she
ran a red light, and her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal
level.
</P>
<P>
	   The red SUV slammed into the teen-agers' car so quickly last April 6 that no
one had time to say anything, Horner testified Friday. During his matter-of-fact
account, Marvin bowed her head, rocked back and forth and wept.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner, who was knocked unconscious and later had his spleen removed, said
he and the four girls were returning from the beach when the accident occurred.
Killed in the wreck were Megan Blong, Amanda Geiger and Angie McGrady, all of
Burlington County, N.J., as well as Shana Lawler.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner said Lawler had recently moved from Burlington County to the Outer
Banks, and he and the other girls had taken a bus to town to visit her. The day
of the accident, he said, they had gone jogging, washed the car and spent time
at the beach.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to Lawler's home from the beach, Blong, who was driving, began
turning left on a green arrow at an intersection, said Horner, who said he was
in the front passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw the red SUV speeding toward us, and that's the last thing I
remembered," he said. "We were hit ... I was knocked unconscious."
</P>
<P>
	   He said when he awakened, Megan was leaning against him, and paramedics were
crowded around the car. He was placed on a stretcher and put in an ambulance
with Marvin, but remembered little of the trip to the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner said he didn't learn what happened to his friends until after he was
transported by helicopter to Albemarle Hospital in Elizabeth City and had
undergone surgery to remove his spleen.
</P>
<P>
	   After the accident, Marvin refused to submit to an alcohol breath test, so
police obtained a search warrant to draw blood. The blood sample, taken more
than four hours after the wreck, showed her to have a blood-alcohol level of
.21, nearly three times North Carolina's legal limit of .08.
</P>
<P>
	   In closing arguments, prosecutor Amber Davis said witnesses reported seeing
Marvin with a foot on her dashboard.
</P>
<P>
	   "She barrels down there, 60 miles an hour, runs right through the red light.
Cars collide. Bodies fly everywhere," she said, condemning Marvin's actions as
"selfish, willful, indifferent acts."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis also asked jurors to consider an expert witness' estimate that
Marvin's blood-alcohol level at the time of the crash was .285.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Michael Sanders urged consideration of conflicting
testimony about whether Marvin had her foot on the dashboard and apparent
discrepancies in testimony about her driving before the crash. He questioned how
much liquor was in the drinks she consumed, noting witnesses said they didn't
notice she had balance or speech problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier testimony showed Marvin had had at least five drinks before getting
behind the wheel and that she had been arrested for driving while impaired twice
before. Both times, Marvin was permitted to plead guilty to a lesser charge of
careless and reckless driving.

<HEADLINE> Down in Iowa, Bradley Looks East  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley, confronting Al Gore's
organizational muscle in Iowa, is subtly starting to shift his attention to the
friendlier voters of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican George W. Bush's strategists are just worrying about meeting high
expectations in Iowa. Thirty-seven percent would make it a good victory, Bush
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had hoped for a ``January surprise'' by getting close to Gore in
Iowa's leadoff caucuses. He has devoted most of his campaign time to the state
and has spent heavily on television advertising. But there are signs he's having
trouble making the race close.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls in recent days have given Vice President Gore leads of anywhere from
15 to 20 percentage points with a little more than a week until the Jan. 24
caucuses. The vice president felt confident enough to send out a fund-raising
letter that said ``we feel real good about our prospects.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Polls don't amount to a hill of beans,'' Gore said at a campaign stop in
Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, on the other hand, has hired a satellite truck to beam his Iowa
interviews to New Hampshire, where the polls look better for him. He's adding a
trip back there next week, one aide said, just days before the Iowa voting.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign said the moves do not suggest a change in strategy, only that
Bradley wants to keep his focus on both states and avoid putting too many eggs
in an Iowa basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, armed with record amounts of money and lofty poll standings, was
hardly worried about losing. But he spent Friday seeking to lower expectations
for his margin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope to do as well as any Republican's done in a crowded field, which is
37 percent,'' he said. Most polls have shown Bush under 50 percent in Iowa,
while publisher Steve Forbes is around 20 percent. Some longtime caucus-watchers
have wondered aloud if Bush's backers have the passion to show up on a chilly
January night, and Bush was taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to say they're for me; it's another thing to show up,''
Bush said. ``I'm very aware of how a caucus system works, as is our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa Republican Chairman Richard Schwarm, a Bush backer and adviser, said
conservative candidates are especially capable of a surprise because they appeal
to social and religious conservatives who are sometimes passionate about their
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For them, voting is a religious duty, not just a civic duty,'' said
Schwarm.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley was running into a Gore organizational
effort in high gear.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Smith, president of the Iowa Federation of Labor, said union phone
banks will call 30,000 members -- many more than once -- before the caucuses. In
addition, 1,300 packages have been mailed to local union offices with
personalized letters to 150,000 union members.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting at Iowa's Democratic caucuses is projected at about 100,000, making
the importance of an organized turnout obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Gore campaign and the Bradley campaign took vastly different
approaches in Iowa,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. But that wasn't
necessarily by choice.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley has built a campaign organization of his own, he lacks a
natural organizational structure like labor. Gore also is getting a boost from
Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who filmed campaign commercials that are now flooding the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Harkin is occasionally controversial but is very popular among the
Democratic activists who will attend precinct caucuses. He's virtually turned
his organization over to Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has built a campaign organization of his own, but he lacks a natural
organizational base like labor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's tough,'' said Dan Lucas, who runs the Bradley caucus campaign.
``They've got a base, they've always had a base. We came in here with zero and
had to build from there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with that opposition, Bradley was giving new attention to New
Hampshire, where polls are far better for him. A senior campaign aide said
Bradley would break off the Iowa campaign trail for a day next week to head back
to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the overwhelming favorite on the Republican side, but he's facing a
well-organized and -financed challenge from Forbes. Conservatives Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes also motivate social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that for mainstream candidates there's always some falloff from
the polling,'' said Schwarm. ``You would expect a Forbes or a Bauer or a Keyes
to perform better than the polling.''

<HEADLINE> Proposed Oil Merger Headed for Court  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawyers for BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield Co. met for
nearly two hours with federal regulators Friday, but made no progress in swaying
the Federal Trade Commission to approve the two oil companies' planned merger,
sources close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies announced they would formally establish a 20-day deadline,
beginning Saturday, for completion of the merger. Normally, after such a
deadline is set, the FTC shifts from trying to reach a settlement to preparation
for challenging the deal in court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The next move is in the hands of the (FTC) commissioners,'' said BP Amoco
spokesman Tom Koch.
</P>
<P>
	   While Koch said ``the door is always open'' for further discussions, neither
the FTC nor the two companies indicated any additional talks were planned.
</P>
<P>
	   Victoria Streitfeld, an FTC spokeswoman, said by law the agency is barred
from discussing the case.
</P>
<P>
	   It has been widely known for weeks that the merger was in trouble because of
FTC staff concerns about the impact of the deal on retail competition in the
West Coast gasoline markets, which rely heavily on Alaska's North Slope crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Atlantic Richfield control about 70 percent of Alaskan oil
production. As part of the deal they have offered to cut that to about 55
percent to ease antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   However, that hasn't made the FTC staff warm up to the merger, according BP
Amoco officials, who privately expect the matter to shift to the courts in the
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what was discussed at Friday's meeting, BP Amoco spokesman Tom Koch
said, ``Most of the agenda really centered around discussion of the litigation
schedule.''
</P>
<P>
	   While the FTC commissioners have not yet voted on whether to challenge the
merger in court, it is generally the practice of the FTC to stop settlement
negotiations and prepare for a court case once merger partners trigger the
20-day clock.
</P>
<P>
	   Frustrated with the discussions with the FTC, both BP Amoco and Arco, as
Atlantic Richfield is commonly called, said earlier in the week that they
planned to proceed with the merger anyway. That forces the FTC either to let the
merger go through or attempt to block it in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Arco reportedly are prepared to argue in court that West Coast
prices are dictated by the world oil markets, not by Alaska production.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who strongly supports the deal, said Friday the
FTC's reluctance to approve the merger ``is not a reasoned position'' and stems
from political considerations in California.

<HEADLINE> Gas Explosion Kills 3 in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARLAND, Texas (AP) -- Leaking natural gas exploded early Friday, flattening
a home and killing three elderly people as they slept.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3 a.m. blast obliterated the single-story brick house, hurling
insulation for blocks and melting paint and siding off adjacent homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Albert and Lillian Holbert, both 80, and Mrs. Holbert's 83-year-old sister,
Callie Hickerson, were killed instantly. Ms. Hickerson was helping care for Mrs.
Holbert, who had recently undergone surgery, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
	   The blast broke windows on nearby homes in this Dallas suburb. Nine homes
were evacuated for about three hours while a gas line behind the Holberts' house
burned.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appears there was a gas leak in the alley, which is where the
distribution line is,'' said state Railroad Commissioner Charles Matthews.
</P>
<P>
	   The railroad commission, which regulates utility companies in Texas, is
investigating the accident along with TXU Electric and Gas. Matthews said he did
not know what ignited the blast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've been to a lot of explosions and accidents,'' Matthews said. ``I've
never seen anything quite like this. The house was leveled. There was enormous
force.''

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will have
a hard time convincing Colombians that a massive new U.S. aid plan is solely
aimed at fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in this South American nation see the two-year, $1.3 billion proposal,
which Albright was promoting Friday in the port city of Cartagena, as a weapon
to be turned on leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a scam that everybody accepts,'' said former national security
adviser Alfredo Rangel. ``This aid -- ostensibly for fighting narcotics -- is
really destined for the counterinsurgency war.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the package includes funds for economic development, Colombia's
military would get most of the aid, which must still be approved by the U.S.
Congress. The package would include attack helicopters, training and equipment
for two new army battalions whose job will be to retake rebel-dominated southern
jungles so anti-narcotics operations can proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright landed in Cartagena Friday evening and went straight to a
presidential guest house to have dinner with President Andres Pastrana and,
according to press reports, Nobel-prize winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocaine production in southern Colombia is exploding thanks to an alliance
between drug traffickers and the entrenched Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC. The guerrillas control about a third of the nation, earning
huge payoffs from protecting traffickers' operations and taxing peasants who
grow illegal drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Colombians believe it's ridiculous to say the aid is for fighting
drugs, not the rebels, given the blurred line between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who believes Madeleine Albright?'' columnist Luis Canon wrote in the
Bogota daily El Espectador. ``Nobody, of course, because the whole country knows
that the South is in the hands of the FARC.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Colombians, however, believe the U.S. aid could help rescue their
country. When asked in recent polls if they favored a U.S. military invasion to
stop the FARC, more than half said they would, if peace talks failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombians are fed up with crime, violence and the world's highest
kidnapping rate linked largely to a 35-year-long civil war that has killed more
than 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   President Pastrana is embracing the aid package, calling it a vote of
confidence for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   When he took office 17 months ago, Pastrana had a far different approach to
stemming the drug trade. He pushed for peace talks and played down military
interdiction in favor of providing alternatives to illegal crops.
</P>
<P>
	   But peace negotiations, which continued Friday with a meeting in the
southern town of San Vicente del Caguan, have moved slowly. Fighting between
rebels and security troops has been intensifying, and drug production is up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government presents this as if the United States loves us,'' said
political commentator Jose Luis Ramirez. ``But the truth is that we're getting
this money because the situation is so serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   International human rights groups oppose the aid package, worried about
granting new tools to the Colombian military -- a force long accused of backing
violent rightist militia groups.
</P>
<P>
	   A FARC rebel known as Simon Trinidad, who attended Friday's peace talks,
said the U.S. aid proposal is like ``throwing dry firewood into the bonfire that
today eats away at Colombia.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns Indonesia Military  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States warned Indonesia's military on
Friday not to overthrow the country's new president and to cooperate with
national and U.N. investigations into human rights abuses in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to cooperate will only increase pressure overseas for an
international tribunal to try those accused of carrying out a wave of terror in
East Timor, said Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   His warning came amid speculation that some of Indonesia's top generals,
angered by efforts aimed at prosecuting them for human rights abuses, may be
planning a move against President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have seen news reports about the possibility of military coups in
Indonesia,'' Holbrooke said in a conference call with U.S. and Indonesian
reporters Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We would view with the greatest possible concern any such event. It would
do Indonesia immense, perhaps irreparable damage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Wahid fired armed forces spokesman Maj. Gen. Sudradjat, who had
publicly denied that the military would carry out a ``conventional coup'' but
had confirmed that the generals intended to pressure the 3-month-old
administration to stay out of military affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Sudradjat is believed to be a close ally of Gen. Wiranto, the former
military commander and now Wahid's senior security minister.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any Indonesian army officers or any military officers who are thinking of
military adventurism have forgotten that we are now in the 21st century,'' said
Holbrooke. ``The damage to Indonesia would be unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke later told reporters at the United Nations that it was vitally
important for Wahid, Attorney General Marzuki Darusman and others to ensure that
the military generals responsible for the violence in East Timor be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Indonesian generals should know that their own efforts to thwart
internal accountability and openness and inquiry are only going to result in
greater pressure,'' for a tribunal similar to those for the former Yugoslavia
and Rwanda, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   A government human rights investigation has accused Wiranto and other top
commanders of permitting the frenzy of violence that swept East Timor in
September after the territory voted to secede from Indonesia, which had occupied
it in 1975.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate U.N. human rights commission also has submitted a report on
atrocities in East Timor, and three U.N. human rights investigators have
recommended that the Security Council establish a tribunal if Indonesia fails to
carry out effective trials.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke accused the military of hampering both probes.
</P>
<P>
	   He also cautioned pro-Jakarta militias based along the border with
Indonesian-held West Timor not to ``test'' the U.N. troops who will soon replace
the Australian-led emergency force sent to East Timor to halt the
post-referendum violence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone who tries to use the transition as an excuse to create chaos again
will suffer very severe consequences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After a briefing by U.N. officials to the Security Council, Holbrooke said
the militias continue to inflict physical terror and psychological intimidation
on the estimated 100,000 East Timorese in West Timorese refugee camps,
preventing many from returning home.

<HEADLINE> N.J. develops bailout to erase $57.6 million deficit at Newark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The state Department of Education has developed a
bailout plan to erase a $57.6 million deficit at the state-run Newark school
district, a department spokesman said Friday.
<P>
	   The deficit was amassed during the four-year tenure of former Superintendent
Beverly Hall but only discovered early this year following an audit, said the
spokesman, Bob DeSando.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall was installed by the state when it assumed control of the district in
1995. She resigned in June to become head of the Atlanta school district. Her
chief financial officer also left the district about that time.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're looking at here is a business office that was inefficient,"
state Education Commissioner David Hespe told The Star-Ledger of Newark during a
visit to Newark on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think you're going to find the kind of misspending that caused the
state to take over the district in 1995, but with the operations of a budget
this big, rebuilding the books sometimes is difficult. Still, there certainly is
no excuse why the district has a deficit," Hespe said.
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner believes a bookkeeping process in now in place that will
alert the district to deficits, DeSando said. "We're confident that this will
not happen again," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement issued Friday night, Hall said she advised the Education
Department that Newark's proposed $633 million 1999-2000 budget would have a
$100 million deficit due to state funding that had not been received.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall said she and the department agreed to review the district's "finances
and fiscal practices," and that her administration worked in "good faith" with
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The deficit represents about 12 percent of the current $472 million
operating budget for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Hespe has agreed to erase the shortfall by providing $14.8 million in
additional state aid, shifting $10 million from district accounts with a
surplus, giving $5.3 million to adjust for higher enrollment than expected, and
forgiving $4.9 million owed the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining $22.6 million will be sought in the state budget. Gov.
Christie Whitman has agreed to request that allocation, DeSando said.
</P>
<P>
	   If those actions were not taken, Newark would have cut teacher salaries and
educational programs, Superintendent Marion Bolden said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bolden, who took over in July, said she hired a new business administrator
and installed a new accounting system as part of an effort "to get a handle on
our finances."
</P>
<P>
	   "We just really had to overhaul the whole system," Bolden said.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit that uncovered the shortfall's origins was on the Newark
district's 1997-98 budget, DeSando said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hespe became commissioner in April and ordered the audit after learning the
books were not yet closed on that budget, DeSando said. That budget and
subsequent budgets were submitted as balanced, but had not been audited because
the district requested more time, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "From year to year, what the auditors found, was that the district exceeded
its spending limits," DeSando said. "It would continue to roll up a deficit."
</P>
<P>
	   "We turned around immediately to resolve the problem so it will have no
impact on the children, and so it will never happen again," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Auditors did not uncover criminal wrongdoing, Hespe told The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark is the state's largest school district, with 43,000 students. Bolden
said it will be at least another two years before it can emerge from state
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Newark was beset by low test scores, corruption and decrepit buildings it
became the third district under state control, following Jersey City and
Paterson, the next-largest cities.

<HEADLINE> Ex-SLA Fugitive's Lawyer Wants Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One of two lawyers for former Symbionese Liberation Army
fugitive Sara Jane Olson moved Friday to withdraw from her bombing conspiracy
case.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart Hanlon, who has represented Ms. Olson since her arrest, said recent
court rulings will extend the trial and take him away from his two young
children at a critical time.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanlon lost his wife to leukemia in 1997, and he said his children cannot do
without him for the four to six months the trial might last. He lives in San
Francisco and would have to relocate to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanlon filed a motion seeking to withdraw and asking for a continuance so
the defense team can regroup in his absence.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial had been scheduled to begin Feb. 7. Hanlon said he had arranged
his schedule and child care to accommodate a trial originally estimated at six
to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The scope of the case expanded Monday when Judge James Ideman ruled
prosecutors can bring in extensive evidence on the history of the SLA and crimes
with which Ms. Olson is not charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Soliah, was indicted in 1976 for
allegedly placing bombs -- which did not explode -- under police cars. She
remained a fugitive until her arrest in Minnesota last year. If convicted, she
could face life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Now frozen lines clog auto inspections; Whitman steaming again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Motorists had a new reason to steam over long lines
at auto inspection centers on Friday: Frozen hoses clogged the new emission
tests, forcing half a dozen stations to shut down operations.
<P>
	   Thousands of motorists were turned away from the stations, but by day's end,
officials with the private contractor operating the lanes announced they had
found a device that will keep the hoses frost-free.
</P>
<P>
	   But the latest twist in a soap opera's worth of woes since a tougher auto
emissions testing system was implemented a month ago left Gov. Christie Whitman
in full fume.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said if the private contractor, Parsons Infrastructure and
Technology, doesn't fix the problems, "we might have to close it down." She
later said, however, "we're still a ways" from making any decision like that.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've got to fix it. There's no question about it," Whitman said. "This
cannot go on. Yes, we need clean air. Yes, we need to move forward, but not at
this price to the motoring public."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also said Parsons "needs to do more" to steer motorists to private
garages. The company and garages recently announced they would pitch in $10 each
to cut the cost of inspections at private garages. That would bring the cost of
a private inspection to the $55 range.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman has expressed frustration with Parsons since the new emissions
system kicked off with long lines on Dec. 13. In turn, Democrats have blasted
Whitman for her decision to use a private firm for the new system after state
workers had manned DMV inspections since 1938. The state has deducted $369,000
from the contract with Parsons because of long lines at inspection stations. The
company has vowed to hire more workers to cut down on lines.
</P>
<P>
	   But each new day seems to bring a different problem. On Friday, frigid
weather froze hoses at the inspection stations, forcing officials to turn away
motorists in Lodi, Paramus, Secaucus, Deptford, Millville and Toms River. Other
stations had some lanes closed. Those turned away were given extensions on their
inspection deadlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Carl Golden, a spokesman for Parsons, said the equipment was hurt "by some
extremely cold weather."
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman said that was no excuse.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if they did all their testing of equipment in southern
California, and they forgot about the Northeast, which has cold winters," said
Whitman. "It's a cold day, and we're just heading into winter. This is totally
unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
	   Golden, said Parsons officials "watch the Weather Channel too," but noted
that "wind chills of 30-below" is cold, even by New Jersey standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden later said Parsons officials had solved this latest problem with a
device to keep the hoses warm.
</P>
<P>
	   "They found a low-wattage heating device which will be attached to the hoses
to keep the temperature sufficiently high," said Golden. He said the devices
will be immediately installed at all the inspection stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden, who was Whitman's chief spokesman during her first term, said he can
"fully understand and appreciate the governor's frustration and anger."
</P>
<P>
	   "Parsons is equally as frustrated," Golden said. "They wanted it to work,
too. Unfortunately it seems that it takes one step forward and one step back."
</P>
<P>
	   The Whitman administration last year signed Parsons to a seven-year, $400
million contract to install and operate the tougher testing system. The
emissions portion of the test is part of New Jersey's effort to comply with the
federal Clean Air Act. The new emissions test looks for compounds that create
smog, which is blamed for high asthma rates in the state.

<HEADLINE> Political Cartoonist Sues Over Hand  </HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL MAULL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The world's most widely published political cartoonist is
suing a doctor and a hospital for $10 million, claiming his drawing hand was
crippled during botched surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Ranan Lurie, 67, said the operation left his right pinky finger curved
inward, making drawing awkward and painful. His output is barely half the eight
to 10 cartoons a week he drew before the surgery, Lurie said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lurie became a cartoonist at age 16 while training to be a fighter pilot in
his native Israel. His work first appeared in The New York Times when he was 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1979, the Guinness Book of World Records has listed him as the world's
most widely syndicated political cartoonist, with his caricatures of newsmakers
from Deng Xiaoping to Bill Gates appearing in 1,100 newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the lawsuit, Lurie injured a ligament his right pinky while in
an airport in South Korea in 1997. He consulted Dr. Richard G. Eaton on the
recommendation of a friend, New York Yankees pitcher David Cone.
</P>
<P>
	   Lurie said that after the 1997 surgery, he wasn't given therapy and the
``finger stiffened so that it formed an inward circle, a very sharp crescent.''
Lurie said Eaton and proposed amputating the finger, but another doctor lessened
the damage with a second operation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The end result is that the finger can move,'' Lurie said. ``But I'm
limited in what I can do. I used to do eight to 10 cartoons a week; now I can
hardly do four. I used to paint my cartoons; now I use a computer.''
</P>
<P>
	   Annie Ting, the manager of the center where Eaton operated on Lurie, said
only Eaton could comment on Lurie's lawsuit, and he is out of town until Jan.
24.

<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Authorities have relaxed the heightened state of alert along
the U.S.-Canadian frontier that was ordered last month amid fears of a terrorist
bomb plot.
</P>
<P>
	   Security was tightened after Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian man, was arrested
Dec. 14 at Port Angeles, Wash., for allegedly trying to smuggle bomb-making
material into the United States from Canada. Ressam has pleaded innocent to
federal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days later, a Canadian woman with alleged links to a group that in turn
was allegedly linked to Ressam was arrested for immigration violations at a
border crossing in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
	   After the arrests, the Customs Service lengthened work hours and increased
staffing at key sites along the border by almost 50 percent, deploying an extra
500 inspectors and agents, spokesman Dennis Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Agents began returning to regular assignments and schedules Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Border Patrol also has removed extra officers it had put in place.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Braces for Indian Protests  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Bracing for massive protests in Ecuador's major
cities, the government on Friday deployed 35,000 soldiers and police to deal
with Indians demanding the ouster of President Jamil Mahuad and the closure of
Congress and the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the indigenous organization that represents 4 million Indians in
this Andean nation of 12 million said they expect 40,000 Indians to march into
Quito on Saturday to seize control of Congress when Mahuad makes his state of
the union address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has not had the political will to fix the country,'' said Blanca
Chancosa, one of the Indian leaders. ``Let him step aside so that the people can
designate other persons more honest and with a will to carry out a new form of
government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Government spokesman Carlos Larreategui said Indian leaders are uninterested
in dialogue. Mahuad said the Indians have a right to express their ideas and
protest peacefully but warned he would use force to protect property and
people's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians said they plan to use civil disobedience to oust Mahuad. They
plan to stage sit-ins and block highways so that farm produce does not reach the
cities.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad, a Harvard-educated centrist who took office 17 months ago, has been
the target of increasing calls from across the political spectrum to resign
because of his failure to stop Ecuador's economic decline. Inflation topped 60
percent last year, the highest in Latin America, and the economy shrank 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday he announced he was adopting the U.S. dollar as Ecuador's official
currency to halt speculation against the currency, the sucre, and stabilize the
economy. Supporters called it a bold move but skeptics characterized it as a
desperate move to save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indian organizations have come to the defense of the sucre, calling it a
symbol of national sovereignty and charging that Mahuad's plan will only
intensify poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador, which took shape
in 1980, has been gained considerable political power over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, in what the Indians called an ``Indigenous Uprising,'' hundreds of
thousands of Indians from remote hamlets in the Andean highlands and the Amazon
jungle barricaded highways for days, virtually paralyzing traffic, to demand
government services.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their growing role in politics, few Ecuadorean political leaders
understand the Indians, said Diego Bonifaz, who headed the office of Indian
affairs under President Rodrigo Borja in 1988-1992.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a problem of cultural friction that provokes misunderstanding,''
he said. ``The gentlemen in government have often seen Indians only in photos.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former President Leon Febres Cordero called the organizers of Saturday's
protest a bunch of ``clowns'' and ``idiots'' who want to seize power without
being elected.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Chancosa said, ``Leon Febres Cordero is still living in the
colonial era.''

<HEADLINE> NAACP Lobbies Bush Over Flag  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM VERTUNO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas NAACP on Friday asked Gov. George W. Bush to
support its efforts to have the Confederate battle flag removed from a plaque on
the state Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, has sidestepped a battle
over use of the flag in South Carolina, saying a decision whether to fly it over
that state's Capitol must come from voters there.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas flies the state flag under the American flag at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter, the NAACP asked Bush to state publicly that the flag is
offensive to minority groups, who contend the flag represents slavery in the old
South.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not asking you to personally condemn the flag, but to say simply
that it honestly offends a large segment of the population and therefore should
not be used as an official public symbol, particularly in a location like our
highest court where people go to try and obtain justice,'' wrote Gary Bledsoe,
president of the Texas chapter of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
	   Bledsoe wrote that the flag as become a symbol of ``hate and division.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was campaigning in Iowa Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Texas proudly flies the Texas and American flags over our state buildings
throughout our capital complex,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan.
``There are many historical representations of the six different governments
that governed Texas in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Texas is a diverse state and we are proud of our diversity and we
certainly hope people are not trying to politicize this is in the context of
presidential campaign ... He recognizes there are strong emotions on both
sides,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The building that houses the state Supreme Court and Court of Criminal
Appeals, Texas' two highest courts, has two bronze plaques inside that refer to
the Confederacy. One has the seal of the Confederacy and the other includes an
image of the stars and bars battle flag and quotes Confederate Gen. Robert E.
Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I rely upon Texas regiments in all tight places and fear I have to call
upon them too often. They have fought grandly, nobly ....'' the plaque reads.
</P>
<P>
	   Court spokesman Osler McCarthy said the building was built with money
donated from a Confederate widows fund and was commissioned in 1955. The
building is operated by the state general services department, not the court, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not the first time this has been raised,'' McCarthy said. ``The
court is sympathetic but it ain't our building.''
</P>
<P>
	   The battle flag also is used by several school districts around the state,
Bledsoe said. Nearby Hays County has been sharply divided in recent months over
use of the flag at high school football games.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Panel Proposes Evacuation Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Crucial stretches of road in Florida could be
converted to one-way evacuation routes during hurricanes, a task force has
suggested.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, Gov. Jeb Bush could order seven major evacuation routes
changed to inland-only traffic flow during a Category 4 or 5 hurricane.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force said the plan would avoid a repeat of the chaos and gridlock
during Hurricane Floyd in September, when thousands of Florida motorists were
stranded for hours on Interstate 10 between Jacksonville and Pensacola in the
biggest evacuation in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   When Hurricane Floyd veered northward, governors in South and North Carolina
changed coastal interstates to inland-only routes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had been criticized for not doing so in Florida. The task force made
its suggestions Thursday after months of public hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   The one-way routes that were proposed would evacuate populated areas such as
Miami-Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Pensacola and Tampa-St. Petersburg.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Children Still Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels have broken a pledge
made in last year's peace accord to free thousands of kidnapped children used as
sex slaves and fighters, West African intervention troops and U.N. officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a few hundred children have been released by the rebels since the July
8 peace agreement, said two senior officials of the West African force known as
ECOMOG who asked not to be identified. The Nigerian-led force has been in charge
of overall security in Sierra Leone after the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   A United Nations Children's Fund official, Johanna Van Gerpen, confirmed
Friday that by last week, just 400 children of an estimated 10,000 to 15,000
held by warring parties in Sierra Leone had reported to military demobilization
camps overseen by ECOMOG and U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of the child fighters, some as young as 6 years old, are
believed to have been kidnapped by the rebels during Sierra Leone's brutal
eight-year war to serve as fighters, sex slaves or manual laborers. However, the
pro-government Kamajor militia is also known to have used 500 to 1,000 children
as fighters.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the peace accord, all combatants are to be disarmed and all prisoners
released.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the rebel group, RUF, on Friday denied the insurgents were
holding any captives -- children or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The RUF fights for the people and doesn't hold people against their
will,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   During the war, the rebels killed thousands and raped, kidnapped and maimed
many more in a terror campaign against the government. Hundreds of children --
mostly adolescent girls -- were kidnapped during a rebel assault on the capital
of Freetown last January. Most have not returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the peace accord, banditry and lawlessness are growing in the
rebel-controlled countryside and the process of disarming fighters has been
slow, according to a report issued Wednesday by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore Improving With Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore gained some ground with Democratic
voters in a Time-CNN poll released Friday in a head-to-head matchup with GOP
front-runner George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   The national poll showed Bush and Gore comfortably ahead in the Republican
and Democratic races for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In a head-to-head matchup, Bush had a slight edge over Gore, 50 percent to
45 percent among registered voters. That's compared with 56 percent for Bush and
39 percent for Gore in an early January Time-CNN poll.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush led Bradley in a head-to-head matchup, 51 percent to 42 percent,
compared with a 55-39 lead earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What you really have is Democrats supporting Gore more than they have in
the past,'' said Hal Quinley, executive vice president of Yankelovich Partners
of Norwalk, Conn. ``Gore's the closest he's been in a while.''
</P>
<P>
	   Quinley said Gore got the support of three-fourths of Democrats against Bush
instead of two-thirds in this poll and got a slight improvement among
independents, with four out of 10 supporting him.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is at about 50 percent in most polls against the Democrats, while their
levels of support differ, according to the poll. In a Fox News poll, Gore was
behind by 15 points, while in a recent Newsweek poll he was down by 7 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and Bradley were very close in a recent CNN-USA-Today poll that showed
Bush with 49 percent and Bradley with 47 percent, a margin too close to call.
</P>
<P>
	   About half of those questioned said they know enough about Bush to decide
whether he would make a good president and half said they need to know more.
Two-thirds said they know enough about Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The Time-CNN poll of 1,564 people was taken Wednesday and Thursday and has
an error margin of plus or minus 2.5 percent, with a 3 percentage point error
margin for the 1,276 registered voters.

<HEADLINE> Hospitals Spared Medicare Cuts  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hospitals treating some of the nation's neediest patients
will be spared billions of dollars in Medicare cuts by the Clinton
administration, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals in Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, New York, Oregon,
Tennessee and Vermont are affected. Altogether, the cuts could have meant some
$2 billion over five years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is mounting a run for the Senate in
New York, has been among those pushing for money to be restored to struggling
teaching hospitals. New York's teaching hospitals train more doctors than any
other state and serve some of the state's poorest residents.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute stemmed from confusion over who counts as a Medicaid patient.
Hospitals handling a large share of low-income and often uninsured patients are
reimbursed for the care in Medicare payments. The reimbursement is based on a
complicated formula that includes Medicaid caseload.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal officials said some states had been counting certain people
erroneously. Hospital officials said they thought they had been following the
law.
</P>
<P>
	   Hospitals were initially told they would have to repay the extra $1 billion
they had received in Medicare overpayments but that changed in October due, in
part, to a vigorous lobbying effort by New York Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
and Charles Schumer as well as Rep. Charles Rangel. Mrs. Clinton sat in on a
meeting the New Yorkers had with top officials at the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement reached Friday with Health and Human Service Secretary Donna
Shalala means that the funding system will stay the same so that the hospitals
will not see a sudden dip in their Medicare payments.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospitals are still fighting the billions of dollars in cuts from the
federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997, although the administration agreed in
November to soften those cuts somewhat.

   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Oxygen masks deployed and a few passengers experienced
nausea Friday when an America West Airlines plane lost cabin pressure en route
from Seattle to Phoenix and was forced to land in Boise.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 737-300 with 134 passengers aboard landed about 11 a.m. A crew
was trying to determine what caused the decompression as the plane was cruising
at 33,000 feet, America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They didn't declare an emergency or anything until they were pretty close
to Boise -- maybe 15 miles out -- and then a couple of passengers complained of
being nauseous, probably from hyperventilating or being excited,'' said Garry
Fraise, operations manager at the Boise Air Terminal.
</P>
<P>
	   Paramedics examined passengers, including one who experienced a minor
nosebleed.
</P>
<P>
	   Another plane was sent from Seattle to pick up the passengers and fly them
to Phoenix.

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Four attorneys for an African millionaire
convicted of bribery have been subpoenaed by a House subcommittee investigating
Rep. Corrine Brown, the St. Petersburg Times reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethics subcommittee is investigating whether Ms. Brown broke
congressional rules by staying in a Miami luxury condominium owned by Foutanga
Sissoko at a time when she was urging the Clinton administration to release
Sissoko from prison so he could return to Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The testimony is scheduled for next month, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee last June began investigating whether the condo and a $50,000
Lexus given to Ms. Brown's daughter were linked to her ``actions as a member of
Congress.'' House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts in exchange for
official actions.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI and the U.S. attorney's office are investigating whether any federal
laws were broken, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Brown, a Florida Democrat, has maintained she is innocent. Calls to her
office Friday were not immediately returned. Her attorney, Robert Bauer,
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Calls to Sissoko's four lawyers Friday were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, Sissoko admitted paying $30,000 to a Customs agent to speed the
shipment of two military helicopters out of Miami without an export license. He
is believed to have returned to Africa after serving his sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Brown has never discussed her relationship with Sissoko. In her letter
on Sissoko's behalf to Attorney General Janet Reno, Ms. Brown referred to him as
a ``special envoy'' from Gambia.

<HEADLINE> Whitman signs bill giving tax deduction to open space donors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Friday gave tax breaks to
farmers and other landowners willing to donate open space to New Jersey.
<P>
	   It is an initiative Whitman hopes will bring in one of every 10 acres she
expects the state to preserve in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation is predicted to provide up to $2.9 million in tax breaks a
year, according to the Office of Legislative Services, based on a forecast of
10,000 acres donated every year for the next 10 years. That rate of land
donation would amount to 10 percent of Whitman's goal in the $1.5 billion open
space program.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax benefit would permit land owners to deduct the land value of the
donation from their taxable income, which in most cases would wipe out any taxes
owed.
</P>
<P>
	   The benefit would apply to land that was donated outright as refuge or park
for public use, and also for deed restrictions that farmers and landowners
provide voluntarily on land that would remain in private ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   For instance, the governor has donated some 200 acres of her family estate,
Pontefract, as permanent open space.
</P>
<P>
	   "We live in the most densely populated state in the nation," Whitman said as
she signed the bill at a nature center in Pennington. "This bill gives
landowners another good reason to help reach our goal of preserving one million
more acres of open space and farmland for all time."
</P>
<P>
	   At the bill-signing ceremony, Whitman acknowledged Fred and Gael Gardner,
who last year voluntarily gave up development rights on a 57-acre farm they own
in East Amwell - a step that under this bill would entitle them to a
commensurate reduction in their taxable income.
</P>
<P>
	   OLS estimated that with many landowners in the higher income-tax brackets,
donors statewide will receive a tax reduction of roughly 7 percent of the dollar
value of the land rights they have forfeited.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Rows upon rows of Cuban mothers -- hundreds visibly pregnant,
others carrying small children -- marched along a seaside boulevard in Havana on
Friday as Fidel Castro's government appealed to emotion in demanding the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bring back our son!'' the women cried, waving Cuban flags as they moved
slowly up the Malecon coastal highway to the American diplomatic mission in
Havana. ``We want our son!''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in what it
called the ``March of the Combatant Mothers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protest marked a return to the larger demonstrations of early December,
when hundreds of thousands of people rallied in some of Cuba's biggest
gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that brought Castro to power 41
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, the boy at the center of the international dispute, was found
clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother,
stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been
staying with relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday was the U.S. government's original deadline for Elian return to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
earlier ruled that only the father can speak for Elian on immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to give Elian's relatives in
Miami a chance to fight for the boy in federal court. Reno said this week that
only a federal court has jurisdiction in the case and rejected a Florida state
judge's order that Elian remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments by his
American relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man
on U.S.-Cuban relations, said Friday evening that Cuban authorities are
frustrated by Reno's failure to set a new deadline and the INS's failure to
enforce its decision that Elian be returned to his father. It is up to the U.S.
government to enforce its own decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No enforcement action was ever announced by the INS,'' said Alarcon,
former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations. ``You have a very strange
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   A sign outside the American diplomatic mission in Havana on Friday showed a
portrait of the first-grader behind a chain-link fence, underscoring Cuba's
position that the boy has been ``kidnapped'' by relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's young stepmother, Nelsy, was at the head of the massive march,
pushing his half-brother in a stroller. She was flanked by Elian's two
grandmothers and Vilma Espin, head of the Cuban Federation of Women and wife of
Raul Castro, the president's brother and armed forces minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela, told reporters that she was willing
to go to Miami to retrieve her grandson if it was assured to her that she could
pick him up and return immediately to Cuba without become embroiled in legal or
political problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would go there just for one minute to get him. To get him. Nothing
more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Red, white and blue Cuban flags fluttered amid the sea of women stretching
for blocks down the Malecon as choppy ocean waves splashed against the coastal
wall. A few men and children also joined the march.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his sea rescue, Elian has been increasingly referred to in Cuba as
``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long ideological
battle with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a clash between two governments,
the dispute over Elian is a battle between Cubans of differing political views
living on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with ABC's ``Nightline,'' Gonzalez, 31, expressed
growing rage and frustration over his separation from his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, expressed her own despair in
recent days, saying that her dead daughter will not rest until Elian is back in
Cuba. Elisabeth Brotons, Elian's mother, was among 11 people who died when their
boat sank off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, is fighting to keep the boy
with him in Miami, saying he can give the child a better life outside Cuba. He
and others who oppose the boy's return to Cuba say that Brotons died to give the
boy freedom in the United States.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds To Stop Samples  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- R.J. Reynolds has agreed to change a nationwide promotion to
ensure that nonsmokers stop getting free samples of cigarettes in the mail.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano demanded in November that the
Winston-Salem, N.C.-based tobacco company stop the promotion.
</P>
<P>
	   R.J. Reynolds had maintained it did nothing wrong because the samples were
sent only to people who signed up for promotions and had certified that they
were over 21.
</P>
<P>
	   But in a letter Thursday to Napolitano from Reynolds vice president and
deputy general counsel Guy M. Blynn, the manufacturer acknowledged that its
mailing system is "flawed" because it allows unsolicited mail to be sent.
</P>
<P>
	   R.J. Reynolds spokeswoman Jan Smith said nonsmokers in Arizona and
California inadvertently began receiving cigarette samples because
representatives hired to carry out the promotion had falsified information on
direct-mail request cards. She would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said those problems may not be limited to those states, so it is
making changes in its system nationwide. The company said it would stop mailing
anything to people on its list unless they confirm they want to be on the list.

<HEADLINE> Learjet Recorder Reveals Confusion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A transcript of the cockpit conversation between two
pilots whose plane was found three years after it crashed shows they made
several mistakes before their Learjet hit a mountain, an experienced jet pilot
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage and the pilots' remains were found Nov. 11. The cockpit voice
recorder was only slightly damaged.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilot Patrick Hayes and co-pilot Johann Schwartz were flying in the clouds
by instruments only as they tried to land at Lebanon Airport on Dec. 24, 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Hertel, a Learjet pilot for 21 years who had flown the same jet for a
previous owner, said Schwartz and Hayes apparently did not realize how little
time they had to turn and try another landing after they missed their first
approach to the airport.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots were unfamiliar with the second approach and the Learjet was
outside a 10-mile safe zone, going too fast and flying too low when it hit the
side of Smarts Mountain in Dorchester, Hertel said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They weren't prepared whatsoever to do this approach. They did it much too
quickly,'' Hertel said, after reviewing the transcript.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwartz's father has filed a lawsuit against the Federal Aviation
Administration on behalf of his son's estate, claiming faulty navigational
beacons at the airport were to blame. A preliminary report by the National
Transportation Safety Board found nothing wrong with the navigational beacons.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Boost Cigarette Prices  </HEADLINE>
    By SKIP WOLLENBERG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's two biggest tobacco companies have boosted
wholesale cigarette prices by about 7.5 percent in a move that analysts said
could add as much as 18 cents to the cost of a pack of smokes.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris, owner of the best-selling Marlboro brand, and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co., which makes Winston, Salem and Camels, surprised Wall Street with
the timing of Friday's move which appeared aimed at boosting profitability
following last year's unusually steep decline in cigarette consumption.
</P>
<P>
	   Other tobacco companies are expected to match the increases. Philip Morris
accounts for about half of U.S. cigarette sales while Reynolds share is between
20 percent and 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris USA told its wholesale customers that it was raising cigarette
prices by 13 cents a pack effective with shipments on Monday, spokesman Michael
Pfeil said. In addition to Marlboro, it makes Virginia Slims, Merit, Benson &AMP;
Hedges and Basic cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
	   Reynolds made a similar announcement but is raising prices effective with
shipments on Tuesday, spokeswoman Jan Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   David Adelman, tobacco analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said the
increase amounted to a 7.5 percent rise in wholesale prices.
</P>
<P>
	   He expects the price at retail will rise 15 cents to 16 cents a pack from
the current national average that he estimates at about $2.65 a pack.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin Feldman, who follows the industry for Salomon Smith Barney, said the
increase at retail could be 17 cents to 18 cents a pack from the current
national average, which he puts at about $2.85.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris' Pfeil said the company does not comment on its pricing
strategy for competitive reasons.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the industry last raised prices by 18 cents a pack in August 1999
after a record 45 cent-per-pack increase in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The late 1998 increase was designed to help the industry pay the initial
costs of its settlement with states seeking reimbursement for the health costs
of treating sick smokers. The state settlements are expected to cost the
industry about $246 billion over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the massive price increase drove cigarette sales down by an estimated 8
percent last year, the biggest decline in cigarette consumption since the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest price hike comes only two weeks after an 10 cent per pack
increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes went into effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Feldman said with cigarette volume declining, Philip Morris must look to
price increases to increase profits.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the timing caught wholesalers by surprise and headed off any moves
to hoard cigarettes before a price hike.
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Cohen, tobacco analyst for Goldman Sachs, said he expects the decline
in cigarette consumption to slow to more traditional levels of 2 percent to 3
percent this year even with the latest price and tax hikes.
</P>
<P>
	   "They want to make money," Cohen said. "They feel very confident about
Marlboro's ability to grow and withstand a little bit stronger price level."
</P>
<P>
	   Feldman said he expected Philip Morris would also increase its use of
promotions to reduce the impact of the price hike for some customers,
however.

<HEADLINE> Gore Objects to Bradley's Comments  </HEADLINE>
   By GENE JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore on Friday countered rival Bill Bradley's
suggestion this week that the vice president introduced race in his 1988
campaign by criticizing his opponent for a prison furlough program that released
black murderer Willie Horton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know what he sees or what he thinks he sees,'' Gore said when
asked about the comments from his Democratic presidential rival. ``I don't agree
with what he says there at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign, accusing Bradley of going negative, dug up a quote from
Bradley's book, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' in which the New Jersey senator
wrote in 1996 that Gore had been careful as a 1988 candidate to discuss the
Willie Horton case ``without racializing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with the Boston Herald published on Thursday, however,
Bradley said Gore had introduced the matter of escaped murderer Horton in his
Democratic primary campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore introduced him into the lexicon,'' Bradley said, according to the
Herald. ``It bothers me a great deal. ... I wouldn't have used Willie Horton.''
He also was quoted as saying, ``It proved in the course of the campaign to
essentially be a poster child for racial insensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane criticized Bradley for saying one thing
in his book, and then another as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once again, Senator Bradley is too quick to judge, too soon to accuse,''
Lehane said. ``Before he was a candidate for president, Senator Bradley had
quite a different view about this than he does now. Senator Bradley should stop
negative campaigning and talk about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spokeswoman Anita Dunn said his two statements ``are not
inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He did not say in the Herald interview that Gore played the race card,''
Dunn said. ``And he didn't say that in `Time Present, Time Past.' What he said
was that Gore introduced an element that the Republicans used to clobber Mike
Dukakis by dividing people with the ugliest kind of racial politics. And there
is nothing Bill finds more offensive.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, in a primary debate, Gore criticized Dukakis for the Massachusetts
furlough program, but did not mention Horton, who committed rape while on
furlough. Horton became a symbol of racially divisive campaigning in the general
election race between Dukakis and Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bradley's book, he wrote about how the ``race card was played'' in the
1988 election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oddly, the first politician to mention Horton (but without racializing it)
was not Bush, but Senator Al Gore,'' he wrote. The Republicans ``emphasized
Horton's blackness.''

<HEADLINE> Complaint Filed in NY Shooting Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The family of a hammer-wielding, emotionally disturbed man
killed by New York City police filed a complaint Friday, charging officers with
firing while he fled and accusing the police commissioner of lying to justify
the shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He didn't attack anybody ... and never had,'' Gary Busch's mother, Doris
Busch Boskey, said before filing a complaint with the Civilian Complaint Review
Board.
</P>
<P>
	   Deputy Police Chief Thomas Fahey said that the matter had been fully
investigated and that both the Police Department and the Brooklyn district
attorney found the officers involved in the shooting acted properly. A Brooklyn
grand jury concluded in November that the shooting was justified because it was
reasonable for the patrolmen to believe that Busch, 31, was a threat.
</P>
<P>
	   Busch's death on Aug. 30, 1999, prompted street protests in the
predominantly Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn where he lived, and
raised questions about how police deal with emotionally disturbed people.
</P>
<P>
	   Police went to Busch's home after receiving reports that he was threatening
people with a hammer. When officers ordered Busch out of his basement apartment,
he flew into a rage and charged up the stairs swinging an 11-inch hammer. One
officer tried -- but failed -- to stop him with pepper spray.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Says No to U.S. Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- As a U.S. Navy ship en route to Venezuela
reversed course for home, Venezuelan officials said Friday they want the United
States to change its offer of flood relief aid by sending equipment but not
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   The USS Tortuga was ordered back to Norfolk, Va., and the USS Nashville was
kept at port in Moorhead, N.C. after Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said his
country didn't need the 450 Marine and Navy engineers the ships were to
transport.
</P>
<P>
	   The soldiers were to help rebuild a key coastal highway destroyed by
mudslides and floods Dec. 15 that killed up to 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The USS Tortuga left port on Tuesday, but a day later Chavez said he didn't
want the U.S. troops in Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel on Friday released a letter
sent to the U.S. ambassador in Caracas explaining that while Venezuela could use
the bulldozers, tractors and other heavy equipment the United States planned to
send, it has no need for more relief personnel.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangel said the equipment could be operated by Venezuelans.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said earlier that the U.S. equipment cannot
be supplied without people to run it, maintain it and bring it back home after
the work is done.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said they were dismayed by Venezuela's change of position,
since Venezuelan Defense Minister Raul Salazar in a Dec. 24 letter requested the
equipment and troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Venezuela officials offered no immediate explanation for the change.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the deployment was
authorized after close coordination with Venezuelan authorities and as part of a
$25 million U.S. aid package. The government had earlier welcomed U.S. help,
including Blackhawk helicopters, C-130 cargo planes and a C-5 Galaxy cargo
plane.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. military personnel had been expected to work in Venezuela for two
months or more.
</P>
<P>
	   Bacon said U.S. relief efforts in Venezuela with four helicopters, 120 U.S.
soldiers and several water purification units would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue of U.S. troops is a sensitive one in Venezuela, where the
left-leaning Chavez last year denied a U.S. request to use Venezuelan airspace
for anti-drug reconnaissance flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez often speaks of the need to reduce U.S. influence in the world, and
has developed a close friendship with Cuba's Fidel Castro.

   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The new owners of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant
plan to turn over its security operations to an outside company next month, a
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   AmerGen, which took over operations of the plant's Unit 1 reactor last
month, will contract with Wackenhut Corp., a Florida company that provides
security at other U.S. nuclear plants, AmerGen spokesman Ralph DeSantis said.

	   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which sets security standards for the
industry, prohibits plants from disclosing the size or other details of their
security forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Mile Island's Unit 2 was the site of the nation's worst commercial
nuclear accident in 1979, when a portion of the reactor's core melted. The unit
has not operated since and remains the property of prior owner GPU Inc.

<HEADLINE> Possible Mob Victims Remains Found  </HEADLINE>
   By JAY LINDSAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOSTON (AP) -- Acting on a remarkably precise tip early Friday,
investigators digging in a Boston field unearthed the skeletal remains of two
men and a woman believed to be victims of mobsters.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigators knew exactly where to look and came upon the grave almost
immediately. U.S. Attorney Donald Stern said it was too soon to identify the
remains, but he called the discovery an important step toward unraveling the
tangled history of Boston's underworld.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people may view this as a bit of Boston history that ought not be
revisited,'' he said. ``I feel the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies are believed to be victims of reputed mobsters Stephen ``The
Rifleman'' Flemmi and fugitive James ``Whitey'' Bulger.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators found weapons Thursday during a search at Flemmi's mother's
home in South Boston, according to news reports. Stern would not say whether
that was related to the search for the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   Flemmi, who was jailed in 1995 on federal racketeering charges, worked as an
FBI informant for decades while conducting mob business.
</P>
<P>
	   Flemmi, Bulger and their FBI handler were charged in December in another
federal racketeering indictment. It alleges that former Agent John J. Connolly
Jr. protected Flemmi and Bulger from prosecution and tipped them to the earlier
indictment. Bulger has not been captured.
</P>
<P>
	   The search began Thursday afternoon, after the investigators were tipped to
the location. The Boston Herald reported the source was Kevin Weeks, a former
associate of Bulger who was arrested on racketeering charges in November. Stern
would not comment on the source.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe reported that officials were searching for the bodies of
Arthur ``Bucky'' Barrett and John McIntyre.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Barrett was one of six men who stole $1.5 million in a
1980 bank robbery. He disappeared in 1983. Bulger and Flemmi are suspected of
killing Barrett and stealing his share, the Globe reported.
</P>
<P>
	   McIntyre disappeared in 1984 after Bulger and Flemmi learned that he was
assisting federal agents investigating a botched plot to provide guns to the
Irish Republican Army, the Globe said.
</P>
<P>
	   Flemmi is also a suspect in the 1981 disappearance of his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1995 indictment charges Flemmi with killing four men in the 1960s. The
bodies of two victims -- brothers Walter and Edward Bennett -- have never been
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Walter Bennett's daughter, Susan, visited the scene Friday, hoping to learn
something about her father's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't even know why I came down here,'' she said. ``I don't usually come
to these. Something just feels funny about this one.''

<HEADLINE> Bailey Recommended Held in Contempt  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE SCHNEIDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A federal magistrate recommended Friday that attorney
F. Lee Bailey be held in contempt for refusing to turn over $2 million in legal
fees to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
	   The recommendation will be forwarded to a U.S. District Court judge, who
could order Bailey jailed if he doesn't turn over the money.
</P>
<P>
	   The disputed fees do not belong to Bailey because they were illegally earned
by his client, convicted infomercial pitchman William J. McCorkle, Magistrate
James Glazebrook said.
</P>
<P>
	   During a contempt hearing last fall, Bailey, 66, testified that most of the
money had been spent and he had less than $1,500 in assets. He said he borrowed
more than $120,000 last year to keep up his monthly payments on his home and on
a hangar for his leased airplane.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey plans to appeal the magistrate's recommendation, his lawyer Richard
Lubin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman said Bailey wouldn't comment on the recommendation. Bailey has
accused Glazebrook, a former federal prosecutor, of bias in favor of the U.S.
Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Orlando said he couldn't
comment because the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
	   McCorkle and his wife, Chantal, were sentenced last year for swindling
customers by selling them pamphlets and tapes that promised to make them rich
through real estate schemes. They are serving 24-year prison terms and were
ordered to turn over $10.6 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey, who has earned wide notice representing O.J. Simpson, Patty Hearst
and Dr. Sam Sheppard, previously has faced contempt charges over fees.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, he spent 43 days in jail for contempt of court stemming from a
dispute over $16 million in stock owned by a client and for withdrawing $3
million from a Swiss bank account established with the stock without court
permission.

<HEADLINE> Albright in Colombia for Aid Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will have
a hard time convincing Colombians that a massive new U.S. aid plan is solely
aimed at fighting drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in this South American nation see the two-year proposal, which Albright
was promoting Friday in the port city of Cartagena, as a weapon to be turned on
leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like a scam that everybody accepts,'' said former national security
adviser Alfredo Rangel. ``This aid -- ostensibly for fighting narcotics -- is
really destined for the counterinsurgency war.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the package includes funds for economic development, Colombia's
military would get most of the aid, which must still be approved by the U.S.
Congress. The package, valued by U.S. officials at $1.6 billion, would include
attack helicopters, training and equipment for two new army battalions whose job
will be to retake rebel-dominated southern jungles so anti-narcotics operations
can proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright landed in Cartagena Friday evening and went straight to a
presidential guest house to have dinner with President Andres Pastrana and,
according to press reports, Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
	   With Pastrana standing by her side before the dinner, Albright told
reporters the effort to bring down high levels of coca production in Colombia
can be won, as has been demonstrated by the successes over the past several
years in Peru.
</P>
<P>
	   But, she said, for Colombia to do the same ``will clearly take hard work and
determination.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials, briefing reporters on the flight from Washington, said the
plan includes American training for 3,000 counternarcotics military personnel
and 500 police by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   A trained, 950-member counternarcotics battalion should be ready for duty by
the end of the month, they said, and about 200 police also are being prepared.
Training of additional military personnel and police was expected to be
completed by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials, asking not to be identified, said the battalions will provide
security while police arrest drug traders, carry out crop eradication and
dismantle drug processing laboratories.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocaine production in southern Colombia is exploding thanks to an alliance
between drug traffickers and the entrenched Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia, or FARC. The guerrillas control about a third of the nation, earning
huge payoffs from protecting traffickers' operations and taxing peasants who
grow illegal drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Colombians believe it's ridiculous to say the aid is for fighting
drugs, not the rebels, given the blurred line between the two.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who believes Madeleine Albright?'' columnist Luis Canon wrote in the
Bogota daily El Espectador. ``Nobody, of course, because the whole country knows
that the South is in the hands of the FARC.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Colombians, however, believe the U.S. aid could help rescue their
country. When asked in recent polls if they favored a U.S. military invasion to
stop the FARC, more than half said they would, if peace talks failed.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombians are fed up with crime, violence and the world's highest
kidnapping rate linked largely to a 35-year-long civil war that has killed more
than 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   President Pastrana is embracing the aid package, calling it a vote of
confidence for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   When he took office 17 months ago, Pastrana had a far different approach to
stemming the drug trade. He pushed for peace talks and played down military
interdiction in favor of providing alternatives to illegal crops.
</P>
<P>
	   But peace negotiations, which continued Friday with a meeting in the
southern town of San Vicente del Caguan, have moved slowly. Fighting between
rebels and security troops has been intensifying, and drug production is up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government presents this as if the United States loves us,'' said
political commentator Jose Luis Ramirez. ``But the truth is that we're getting
this money because the situation is so serious.''
</P>
<P>
	   International human rights groups oppose the aid package, worried about
granting new tools to the Colombian military -- a force long accused of backing
violent rightist militia groups.
</P>
<P>
	   A FARC rebel known as Simon Trinidad, who attended Friday's peace talks,
said the U.S. aid proposal is like ``throwing dry firewood into the bonfire that
today eats away at Colombia.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Congressmen Charged Over Loans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A former congressman was accused by federal authorities Friday
of making false statements to obtain bank loans to finance his campaign for
state treasurer and buy a hotel and shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael J. Harrington, 63, a Massachusetts Democrat who served from 1969-79,
was charged with eight counts of making false statements to federally insured
financial institutions and four counts of making false statements to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A series of baseless charges have been brought against me after an
intensive six-year investigation of all of my personal and business affairs,''
Harrington said in a written statement. ``I am innocent and expect to be
vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington was not taken into custody and his lawyer said an arraignment
date had not been set. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison
and a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Harrington misrepresented his finances to obtain a $6.25
million loan to buy the Hawthorne Hotel in Salem, a $2.7 million loan to
purchase the Museum Place Mall in Salem, and a $20,000 personal loan to finance
his 1990 campaign for treasurer.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrington also is a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Arrests Ex-Interim Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- A Kuwaiti who was appointed by Iraq as head of an interim
government shortly after it invaded the tiny Gulf nation was arrested Friday
when he returned home after almost 10 years, the Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaa Hussein arrived at Kuwait International Airport, where he was taken
into custody, said Mohammad Sharar, the state minister for Cabinet affairs,
according to the state-run agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharar said Hussein was using a Norwegian travel document.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein apparently came to Kuwait with the intention of giving himself up.
He was accompanied by his four children, who were handed over to their
relatives. The children's ages were not known.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein was convicted of treason after the February 1991 liberation of
Kuwait and was sentenced to death in absentia. It was not immediately clear how
the Kuwaiti government will deal with him now.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein was an obscure lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army when Iraqi forces
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990. He was summoned to Baghdad, promoted to colonel,
and named prime minister of a nine-member ``Provisional Kuwait Free
Government.'' The interim government never operated.
</P>
<P>
	   One week after the invasion, Hussein was seen on Iraqi television asking
President Saddam Hussein to unite Kuwait with Iraq. Hours later, Baghdad
announced that Iraq had annexed Kuwait and Alaa Hussein disappeared from public
view.
</P>
<P>
	   The Al-Watan newspaper said Friday that Hussein was ``calm and smiling'' as
he handed his Norwegian travel document and Kuwaiti identification paper to
officers at Kuwait International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Take your time, I'm Kuwaiti and I'm coming back home,'' the paper quoted
Hussein as telling the officers. ``Arrest me, interrogate me, but let my four
children go to their relatives who are waiting at the airport.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other Kuwaitis who were appointed ministers in the puppet Cabinet chose to
return to Kuwait after U.S.-led allies liberated it from a seven-month Iraqi
occupation. They were acquitted of any wrongdoing and considered victims of
Iraqi oppression.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hussein, who had moved to Iraq, stayed in Baghdad until last year. He
then went to Turkey via Jordan. Some Iraqi dissidents said he went to a European
country after being given refugee status by the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Hussein is believed to have studied management at Baghdad University and was
a member of Iraq's ruling Baath Party.

Grandmother Willing To Retrieve Elian

	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's paternal grandmother, Mariela, told
reporters today that she was willing to go to Miami to retrieve her refugee
grandson if it was assured to her that she could pick him up and return
immediately to Cuba without become embroiled in legal or political problems.
This came after rows upon rows of Cuban mothers marched along a seaside
boulevard in Havana demanding the return of 6-year-old Elian. Today was the U.S.
government's originally scheduled deadline for the boy to be returned to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline to
give Elian's relatives in Miami a chance to fight for the boy in federal court.

Sierra Leone Children Still Held

said Friday. Only a few hundred children have been released by the rebels since
the July 8 peace agreement, said two senior officials of the West African force
known as ECOMOG who asked not to be identified. The Nigerian-led force has been

innocent to federal charges. After the arrests, the Customs Service lengthened

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Gathers With Trump  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Greeted by a boisterous crowd of Reform Party
leaders under the elegant roof of his $100,000-per-member club, tycoon Donald
Trump said he would become a ``very serious candidate'' for the presidency if
they would have him on their third-party ticket.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly two-thirds of the 170 party members gathered in the Gold and White
Ballroom of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club raised their hands when he asked who among
them would support his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've come really from being a very successful businessman to being a very
serious candidate,'' Trump told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   He told reporters earlier that he would make an announcement in
mid-February, and that the event would likely take place in New York City's
Trump Tower.
</P>
<P>
	   On-stage in the pillared ballroom, Trump reached out to supporters of party
founder Ross Perot, who were left out of his event last week with the leader of
an opposing faction, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very proud to be in the party of Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura,'' Trump
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd, pumped up by wine and hors d'oeuvres, applauded and cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot's right-hand man, former national chairman Russell Verney, said he
welcomed Trump into the race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is him reaching out to all parts of the Reform Party, and that's
good,'' Verney said. He acknowledged it's in the party's interest to encourage a
race between two marquee names -- Trump's and conservative columnist Pat
Buchanan's -- because it would build the Reform Party's base and keep it in the
headlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a rich candidate, he said, ``can reach out to the disaffected voter
unaffiliated with any party and inspire them to get back involved in politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some in the crowd greeted Trump with skeptical questions rather than
open arms, probing whether his interest in the race is an interest in the Reform
Party, or in his own future.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman pressed him on whether he would attend the Florida Reform Party's
convention next weekend in Tampa. Trump said he's ``looking at that very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another asked whether, if the party's presidential nomination went to
someone else, he would still contribute money to the Reform Party to help build
it. He hedged, saying he could not support it if it nominates Buchanan, for
example.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I agreed with an opponent and the views of an opponent who got the
nomination, I would absolutely support'' the party, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am focused on making a good decision regarding whether or not I should
seek the Reform Party presidential nomination,'' Trump said in a statement
Thursday, a day before he ferried some of the party's leaders to Florida aboard
his plush 727.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am anxious to talk with Reform Party leaders about whether it is
possible to achieve unity within the party and whether it is possible for a
Reform Party presidential candidate to win in 2000,'' Trump added.
</P>
<P>
	   For their part, Reform Party members who traveled from as far away as
Wisconsin said they were eager to meet with the wealthy developer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At first I couldn't imagine him being our president,'' said Miriam
Lancaster, 84, of Orlando. ``But if he can run our country the way he's run his
business, we'll be out of debt in no time.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyway,'' she added, ``it's Friday night! I'd rather be here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The party, moved from poolside indoors due to wind, was held at the
72-year-old Mar-a-Lago, named for its ``sea-to-lake'' spot on 18 acres between
the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built the estate in 1927, willed it to the
federal government to use as a winter White House, but its $3 million-a-year
maintenance fees were too much for the government. Trump bought it in 1985 for
$8 million of its $25 million asking price, and a decade later he turned it into
a members-only club, according to the club's Web site.

    JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines has agreed to pay Alaska
$3.5 million for dumping toxic chemicals and oil-contaminated water into the
state's waters.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement, announced Friday, follows $6.5 million in federal fines the
cruise line agreed to pay last year after it admitted dumping chemicals,
including dry-cleaning fluid, illegally into Alaskan waters.

Botelho said Friday.
</P>
<P>

to monitor cruise ship smokestack emissions.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement does not provide for onboard observers to check what ships put
into the water, as environmentalists and fishermen had demanded.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Builders Celebrate Housing Boom  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID KOENIG AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Bob White, who has been building houses for nearly 40 years,
says today's market is as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This gray hair lets you know I've seen cycles that just quit," the Dallas
builder said Friday, referring to historic boom-and-bust patterns in the housing
market. "But I can't see anything scaring us now."
</P>
<P>
	   Like others gathered in Dallas for the nation's biggest convention of home
builders, White thinks home sales will probably decline a bit but remain strong
through 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose this week to 8.18
percent this week, according to Freddie Mac, the federally chartered mortgage
company. They haven't been higher since September 1996. A year ago, they were
below 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, most economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise short-term
interest rates again early this year -- probably more than once. But even that
prospect didn't seem to faze the crowd at the National Association of Home
Builders convention.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't feel the rates are going to escalate enough to affect us," said
Richard Moody of the Johnson Group, a developer-builder company in Port Orange,
Fla., as he toured the exhibit hall with a colleague. "As long as we don't see 8
1/2 to 9 percent, we think it'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone seems to be making money, and they still want to buy houses,"
Moody said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Seiders, chief economist for the home builders' group and a former Fed
economist, said housing is less sensitive to interest rates, partly because of
the variety of mortgages available today, including fixed-rate, adjustable,
hybrids and balloon loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Seiders is predicting an 8 percent decline in the number of single-family
homes placed under construction this year, but he blamed that more on an
expected overall economic slowing than on higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   "This looks like a pause in 2000, not an old-fashioned housing recession at
all," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are seeing a bit of a slowing in housing, but it's from exceptional
levels -- very close to all-time highs in some markets," added Mark Vitner, vice
president and economist for First Union Bank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists predict that the prices of new homes will continue to outstrip
inflation. Freddie Mac predicts a 4 percent increase in 2000, down from about 6
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of talking about interest rates and the Federal Reserve, builders at
the convention commiserated about rising labor costs -- Florida builder said
framers' pay rose more than 50 percent this year, and a North Texas survey by
the Associated Builders And Contractors said brick layers' pay rose 20 percent
and carpenters' pay nearly 10 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Some builders said that because of competition from other builders, they
haven't been able to pass those increases on to home buyers.

<HEADLINE> Lee Rejects Prosecutors' Offer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE (AP) -- Federal prosecutors offered to reconsider their plan to
keep a fired Los Alamos scientist in jail until his trial on security
violations, but the scientist says he isn't interested.
</P>
<P>
	   Wen Ho Lee's attorneys have rejected the offer, which hinged on Lee
submitting to intensive FBI interviews aimed at determining what happened to
seven missing computer tapes containing nuclear weapons secrets.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyers said that in the FBI's previous interviews of Lee, agents lied
to him about his earlier polygraph tests and threatened him with references to
Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, the only Americans ever executed for espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In light of these tactics, it should come as no surprise that Dr. Lee does
not trust the FBI to deal with him fairly and honestly,'' attorneys John Cline
and Nancy Hollander said in a letter to acting U.S. Attorney Bob Gorence dated
Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   The tapes Lee is accused of creating are said to contain top-secret weapons
information. Experts have testified the information could be used to build
sophisticated high-yield weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee's attorneys have said Lee destroyed the tapes when he lost his security
clearance as a computer scientist at the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   But federal prosecutors and FBI agents have said they would require solid
proof that the tapes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee's attorneys hope the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver will
overturn the detention order allowing Lee to post bond so he can be free ahead
of his trial, which could be a year away.

than a dozen clinics, agencies and a school by sending envelopes with a gritty
substance and a note saying, ``This is anthrax and you will die.''
</P>
<P>
	   None of the 14 envelopes received this week contained anthrax, a deadly
livestock disease that can be transmitted to humans, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Micky A. Sauer, 23, of Kenosha was arrested after a letter carrier
discovered another suspicious envelope in a street corner mail box in Kenosha on
Thursday and called investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday morning, FBI agents said they saw Sauer mail an envelope in the same
box. The handwriting on the only envelope in the box was similar to that on all
the threatening letters, an affidavit by FBI agents said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sauer was charged Friday in U.S. District Court with mailing a threatening
communication, which carries a penalty of up to 5 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters were sent to several abortion clinics in Milwaukee, a Christian
pro-life pregnancy counseling office in Racine, a private adoption agency in
Manitowoc, and a middle school and a social services building in Kenosha. All
are in eastern Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   In each case, people who came in contact with the envelope were put through
a decontamination cleansing and hospital tests, and emergency personnel and the
FBI were called to investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   In court documents, the FBI said it had reviewed 13 of the 14 envelopes and
all contained a message such as, ``This is anthrax and you will die. Have a
happy death.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to an FBI affidavit, the postal carrier who alerted authorities
had noticed similar letters in the same box, including one with a white gritty
substance.

<HEADLINE> Gore Objects to Bradley's Comments  </HEADLINE>
   By GENE JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Al Gore on Friday countered rival Bill Bradley's
suggestion this week that the vice president introduced race in his 1988
campaign by criticizing his opponent for a prison furlough program that released
black murderer Willie Horton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know what he sees or what he thinks he sees,'' Gore said when
asked about the comments from his Democratic presidential rival. ``I don't agree
with what he says there at all.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign, accusing Bradley of going negative, dug up a quote from
Bradley's book, ``Time Present, Time Past,'' in which the New Jersey senator
wrote in 1996 that Gore had been careful as a 1988 candidate to discuss the
Willie Horton case ``without racializing it.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with the Boston Herald published on Thursday, however,
Bradley said Gore had introduced the matter of escaped murderer Horton in his
Democratic primary campaign against Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Gore introduced him into the lexicon,'' Bradley said, according to the
Herald. ``It bothers me a great deal. ... I wouldn't have used Willie Horton.''
He also was quoted as saying, ``It proved in the course of the campaign to
essentially be a poster child for racial insensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane criticized Bradley for saying one thing
in his book, and then another as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once again, Senator Bradley is too quick to judge, too soon to accuse,''
Lehane said. ``Before he was a candidate for president, Senator Bradley had
quite a different view about this than he does now. Senator Bradley should stop
negative campaigning and talk about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spokeswoman Anita Dunn said his two statements ``are not
inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He did not say in the Herald interview that Gore played the race card,''
Dunn said. ``And he didn't say that in `Time Present, Time Past.' What he said
was that Gore introduced an element that the Republicans used to clobber Mike
Dukakis by dividing people with the ugliest kind of racial politics. And there
is nothing Bill finds more offensive.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 1988, in a primary debate, Gore criticized Dukakis for the Massachusetts
furlough program, but did not mention Horton, who committed rape while on
furlough. Horton became a symbol of racially divisive campaigning in the general
election race between Dukakis and Vice President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   In Bradley's book, he wrote about how the ``race card was played'' in the
1988 election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Oddly, the first politician to mention Horton (but without racializing it)
was not Bush, but Senator Al Gore,'' he wrote. The Republicans ``emphasized
Horton's blackness.''
</P>
<P>
	   On the campaign trail Friday, Gore disappointed some seniors at a health
care forum by telling them he would not support price controls for prescription
drugs. He said increased competition from companies that produce generic drugs
is the best way to cut the prices of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I favor stricter competition, more vigorous competition,'' Gore said.
``What we have now is a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Hoar, president of the New Hampshire Association for the Elderly, said
he supports a bill that would force drug companies to offer seniors the same low
prices they give to large insurers and the federal government. ``We've got to
talk to him about it,'' Hoar said of Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign starting airing a new radio ad in New Hampshire Friday with
Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., promoting Gore as the best candidate on the issues of
health care and education. ``For years I've fought for universal health care and
I believe Al Gore has the best plan to get us there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, meanwhile, drew one his best crowds yet in Iowa with an
open-to-the-public speech that filled the auditorium at Johnston High School. He
campaigned with Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey and Bradley's daughter, Theresa Anne,
was tagging along but shied away from any attention.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley broadly outlined his agenda for America: ``What we must do today is
take a national problem -- absence of health care, too many people paying too
much for health care, guns in our schools, too many children in poverty, too
much money in politics -- take a national problem, turn it into a public issue
and then engage the idealism of the American people to resolve that problem.''
</P>
<P>
	   These same priorities were sketched in a new TV ad that Bradley began airing
Friday in New Hampshire. ``This campaign is being run under the radical premise
that you can go out and tell people what you believe -- and win,'' Bradley said
in the commercial.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party leaders gather at Trump's Florida compound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Greeted by a boisterous crowd of Reform Party
leaders under the elegant roof of his $100,000-per-member club, tycoon Donald
Trump said he would become a "very serious candidate" for the presidency if they
would have him on their third-party ticket.
<P>
	   Roughly two-thirds of the 170 party members gathered in the Gold and White
Ballroom of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club raised their hands when he asked who among
them would support his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've come really from being a very successful businessman to being a very
serious candidate," Trump told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   He told reporters earlier that he would make an announcement in
mid-February, and that the event would likely take place in New York City's
Trump Tower.
</P>
<P>
	   On-stage in the pillared ballroom, Trump reached out to supporters of party
founder Ross Perot, who were left out of his event last week with the leader of
an opposing faction, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very proud to be in the party of Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura," Trump
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd, pumped up by wine and hors d'oeuvres, applauded and cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot's right-hand man, former national chairman Russell Verney, said he
welcomed Trump into the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is him reaching out to all parts of the Reform Party, and that's
good," Verney said. He acknowledged it's in the party's interest to encourage a
race between two marquee names - Trump's and conservative columnist Pat
Buchanan's - because it would build the Reform Party's base and keep it in the
headlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a rich candidate, he said, "can reach out to the disaffected voter
unaffiliated with any party and inspire them to get back involved in politics."
</P>
<P>
	   But some in the crowd greeted Trump with skeptical questions rather than
open arms, probing whether his interest in the race is an interest in the Reform
Party, or in his own future.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman pressed him on whether he would attend the Florida Reform Party's
convention next weekend in Tampa. Trump said he's "looking at that very
seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   Another asked whether, if the party's presidential nomination went to
someone else, he would still contribute money to the Reform Party to help build
it. He hedged, saying he could not support it if it nominates Buchanan, for
example.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I agreed with an opponent and the views of an opponent who got the
nomination, I would absolutely support" the party, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am focused on making a good decision regarding whether or not I should
seek the Reform Party presidential nomination," Trump said in a statement
Thursday, a day before he ferried some of the party's leaders to Florida aboard
his plush 727.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am anxious to talk with Reform Party leaders about whether it is possible
to achieve unity within the party and whether it is possible for a Reform Party
presidential candidate to win in 2000," Trump added.
</P>
<P>
	   For their part, Reform Party members who traveled from as far away as
Wisconsin said they were eager to meet with the wealthy developer.
</P>
<P>
	   "At first I couldn't imagine him being our president," said Miriam
Lancaster, 84, of Orlando. "But if he can run our country the way he's run his
business, we'll be out of debt in no time."
</P>
<P>
	   "Anyway," she added, "it's Friday night! I'd rather be here."
</P>
<P>
	   The party, moved from poolside indoors due to wind, was held at the
72-year-old Mar-a-Lago, named for its "sea-to-lake" spot on 18 acres between the
Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built the estate in 1927, willed it to the
federal government to use as a winter White House, but its $3 million-a-year
maintenance fees were too much for the government. Trump bought it in 1985 for
$8 million of its $25 million asking price, and a decade later he turned it into
a members-only club, according to the club's Web site.

Cape Breton Miners Vote To End Strike
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GLACE BAY, Novia Scotia (AP) -- Miners at the Cape Breton Development Corp.
voted overwhelmingly Friday to end a two-week wildcat strike sparked by anger
over a pension package they say is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   Mine union official Steve Drake said miners would be back on the job as soon
as management gives the word.
</P>
<P>
	   That includes 10 men who ended their occupation of the Prince mine in Point
Aconi, Nova Scotia, shortly after the vote was announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Since last Sunday, the men had been deep within Cape Breton's last working
colliery, a move they made to draw attention to the dispute. On Friday, they
were embraced by family members and grateful comrades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're heroes,'' said Robert, a miner who would only give his first name.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the strikers say they fear repercussions for their part in the
illegal strike.
</P>
<P>
	   Ralph Goodale, the federal minister responsible for Devco, said officials
with the Crown agency will have to decide if there are any legal ramifications.
</P>
<P>
	   Union officials and the corporation will now enter a process of
renegotiating the pension deal, which could ultimately wind up in the hands of
an arbitrator. ------ Saskatchewan, Manitoba Quit Farm Meetings
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Saskatchewan and Manitoba walked out of a meeting of
agriculture ministers Friday, complaining Ottawa isn't giving enough attention
-- or money -- to cash-strapped Prairie farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They (farmers) feel very, very slighted and hurt,'' Dwain Lingenfelter,
agriculture minister for Saskatchewan, said as he left mid-way through the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When it comes to Western Canada, particularly Manitoba and Saskatchewan,
there isn't enough emphasis on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   They say Ottawa's plan to inject another $1 billion into emergency farm aid
over the next two years falls far short of what's needed.
</P>
<P>
	   And, in a separate but related issue, they complained Ontario is trying to
unfairly grab a bigger piece of the existing farm assistance pie.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal Agriculture Minister Lyle Vanclief said he was ``very disappointed''
the pair left and he promised no province will lose money under changes to the
farm safety net program. ------ Ottawa Nearing Decision on NHL Finances
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government, after months of hesitation and false
starts, may be moving closer to a multimillion dollar aid package for
Canadian-based NHL teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Sources say Eric Maldoff, a Montreal lawyer with close ties to Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, could be named as early as next week as a federal
negotiator to help sort out the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates of how much Ottawa is willing to spend on the effort range from a
low of $12 million a year to a high of $20 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The total figure -- and how many of the six big-league hockey clubs in
Canada actually get to share it -- could depend on how many local and provincial
governments sign on to the initiative.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Agrees to Pay Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co. has agreed to pay an $82,834 fine
and perform two community service projects to resolve an Environmental
Protection Agency complaint alleging four chemical leaks, Dow and EPA officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA said Dow failed to notify emergency authorities about four leaks at
a Midland facility between November 1997 and May.
</P>
<P>
	   The chemicals released -- methyl chloride, vinyl chloride and ethylene oxide
-- could potentially cause cancer in people exposed to them, EPA spokesman James
Entzminger said.
</P>
<P>
	   Entzminger said one of the leaks was caused when a hole developed in a
piping system, while another happened when an operator opened an incorrect
valve. Two others occurred during cleaning and transport of equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Grates, media relations manager for Dow Chemical in Michigan, said the
company didn't report the leaks because it thought the amounts were lower than
reporting rules require.
</P>
<P>
	   Grates said once officials discovered they were wrong, they reported the
leaks, but were sanctioned by the EPA for late reporting.

<HEADLINE> Wis. Man Arrested in Anthrax Scares  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Police arrested a man Friday for allegedly threatening more
than a dozen clinics, agencies and a school by sending envelopes with a gritty
substance and a note saying, ``This is anthrax and you will die.''
</P>
<P>
	   None of the 14 envelopes received this week contained anthrax, a deadly
livestock disease that can be transmitted to humans, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Micky A. Sauer, 23, of Kenosha was arrested after a letter carrier
discovered another suspicious envelope in a street corner mail box in Kenosha on
Thursday and called investigators.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday morning, FBI agents said they saw Sauer mail an envelope in the same
box. The handwriting on the only envelope in the box was similar to that on all
the threatening letters, an affidavit by FBI agents said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sauer was charged Friday in U.S. District Court with mailing a threatening
communication, which carries a penalty of up to 5 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters were sent to several abortion clinics in Milwaukee, a Christian
pro-life pregnancy counseling office in Racine, a private adoption agency in
Manitowoc, and a middle school and a social services building in Kenosha. All
are in eastern Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
	   In each case, people who came in contact with the envelope were put through
a decontamination cleansing and hospital tests, and emergency personnel and the
FBI were called to investigate.
</P>
<P>
	   Threats of contamination with anthrax have affected almost every region of
the nation over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
	   The FBI said a spate of letters last year contained only a sticky substance
or a powder. Already this year, letters have been sent to abortion clinics or
government offices in several cities, including Providence, R.I., Manchester,
Conn., Fort Wayne, Ind., Toledo, Ohio, Birmingham, Ala., and Naples, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, a Texas man accused of mailing a vial of water labeled
``anthrax'' was charged with threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction.
Authorities said it was the first indictment of its kind.

<HEADLINE> Company Recalls Undercooked Turkeys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A North Carolina poultry company is recalling about
146,000 pounds of turkey breast products because some may be undercooked.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem with the Carolina Turkey products was discovered after a
consumer complained, the Agriculture Department said Friday. No illnesses have
been reported.
</P>

	   The 13 products, both under the Carolina Turkey brand and other names, are
9-pound turkey breasts in packages that say ``Est. P-7345'' inside the USDA mark

Elian's Grandmother Would Come To U.S.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- The paternal grandmother of Elian Gonzalez said today she was
willing to go to Miami to retrieve her refugee grandson if she could pick him up
and return immediately to Cuba without legal or political problems. In Havana,
rows upon rows of Cuban mothers marched demanding the return of the 6-year-old.
Today was the U.S. government's originally scheduled final date for the boy to
be returned to his father. But Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the deadline
to give his relatives in Miami a chance to fight for the boy in federal court.

	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas NAACP today asked Gov. George W. Bush to
support its efforts to have the Confederate battle flag removed from a plaque on
the state Supreme Court building. In a letter, the group asked Bush to state
publicly that the flag is offensive to minority groups, who contend the flag
represents slavery in the old South. Bush, the Republican presidential
front-runner, has sidestepped a battle over use of the flag in South Carolina,
saying a decision whether to fly it over that state's Capitol must come from

Albright in Colombia for Aid Plan

	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is seeking
to convince Colombians that a massive new U.S. aid plan is solely aimed at
fighting drugs. Many see the two-year proposal, which Albright was promoting
today in the port city of Cartagena, as a weapon to be turned on leftist
guerrillas. Although the package includes funds for economic development,
Colombia's military would get most of the aid. It would include attack
helicopters, training and equipment for two new army battalions whose job will
be to retake rebel-dominated southern jungles so anti-narcotics operations can

Feds Returning Land to Indians
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- In one of the biggest givebacks of Indian land in
U.S. history, the government is returning 84,000 acres to the Northern Ute tribe
as part of a deal to clean up millions of tons of uranium waste along the
Colorado River. The deal is subject to approval by Congress. The land, which is
next to the 4.4 million-acre Ute reservation, is believed to contain oil-rich
shale deposits. It was given to the Utes in 1882, but in 1916, on the eve of the
nation's entry into World War I, the federal government took it back to create a
reserve supply of oil for the Navy fleet. Under the agreement, the Indians can
open the land to oil and gas drilling. But they will have to pay a percentage of
the royalties to the government.

club. Perot's Hillwood Development will become a minority owner in the team, but
Perot will continue to lead development and construction of the new American
Airlines Center near downtown Dallas. Perot's group bought the Mavericks less
than four years ago from Donald Carter, paying about $125 million. The sale will
be complete upon formal approval by the NBA.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rico Gov. Subpoenaed  </HEADLINE>
   By RICARDO ZUNIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Lawyers have subpoenaed Puerto Rico's governor
to testify a second time about accusations his 1992 gubernatorial campaign
accepted $250,000 in stolen federal funds, part of a fraud case that has shaken
this U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Court officials tried to deliver the subpoena to Gov. Pedro Rossello's
hospital room earlier this week as he underwent treatment for two kidney stones,
Rossello spokesman Alfonso Aguilar confirmed late Friday. They later left it
with lawyers at the governor's residence.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers want Rossello to testify about a prosecution witness' claim
that Rossello's campaign accepted the alleged illegal donation from
administrators who were convicted in June of stealing $2.2 million from the San
Juan AIDS Institute. As a witness during the administrators' trial, Rossello
denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
	   On trial are two of the institute's board members, Luis Dubon and Jorge
Garib, who are charged with being involved in the scheme. They deny the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Rossello will likely testify on Jan. 24, Aguilar said. The 55-year-old
governor underwent surgery to remove the kidney stones Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   In court Friday, the star witness in the fraud case came under fire for an
apparently contradictory account of the alleged donation to Rossello's campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination, former AIDS Institute comptroller Angel Corcino
admitted he had not personally heard Rossello ask for the $250,000, as Corcino
had told a grand jury. Corcino could not give a clear explanation for the
differing accounts under questioning by defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, three administrators, including the consultant who founded the
institute, Yamil Kouri, were convicted of concocting the scheme.

<HEADLINE> Texas NAACP Lobbies Bush Over Flag  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM VERTUNO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The Texas NAACP on Friday asked Gov. George W. Bush to
support its efforts to have the Confederate battle flag removed from a plaque on
the state Supreme Court building.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, has sidestepped a battle
over use of the flag in South Carolina, saying a decision whether to fly it over
that state's Capitol must come from voters there.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas flies the state flag under the American flag at the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter, the NAACP asked Bush to state publicly that the flag is
offensive to minority groups, who contend the flag represents slavery in the old
South.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not asking you to personally condemn the flag, but to say simply
that it honestly offends a large segment of the population and therefore should
not be used as an official public symbol, particularly in a location like our
highest court where people go to try and obtain justice,'' wrote Gary Bledsoe,
president of the Texas chapter of the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
	   Bledsoe wrote that the flag as become a symbol of ``hate and division.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was campaigning in Iowa Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Texas proudly flies the Texas and American flags over our state
buildings,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Scott McClellan. ``Throughout our
capital complex, there are many historical representations of the six different
governments that governed Texas in the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Texas is a diverse state and we are proud of our diversity and we
certainly hope people are not trying to politicize this is in the context of
presidential campaign ... He recognizes there are strong emotions on both
sides,'' McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The building that houses the state Supreme Court and Court of Criminal
Appeals, Texas' two highest courts, has two bronze plaques inside that refer to
the Confederacy. One has the seal of the Confederacy and the other includes an
image of the stars and bars battle flag and quotes Confederate Gen. Robert E.
Lee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I rely upon Texas regiments in all tight places and fear I have to call
upon them too often. They have fought grandly, nobly ....'' the plaque reads.
</P>
<P>
	   Court spokesman Osler McCarthy said the building was built with money
donated from a Confederate widows fund and was commissioned in 1955. The
building is operated by the state general services department, not the court, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not the first time this has been raised,'' McCarthy said. ``The
court is sympathetic but it ain't our building.''
</P>
<P>
	   The battle flag also is used by several school districts around the state,
Bledsoe said. Nearby Hays County has been sharply divided in recent months over
use of the flag at high school football games.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Shifts Attention to N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley, confronting Al Gore's
organizational muscle in Iowa, is subtly starting to shift his attention to the
friendlier voters of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican George W. Bush's strategists are just worrying about meeting high
expectations in Iowa. Thirty-seven percent would make it a good victory, Bush
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had hoped for a ``January surprise'' by getting close to Gore in
Iowa's leadoff caucuses. He has devoted most of his campaign time to the state
and has spent heavily on television advertising. But there are signs he's having
trouble making the race close.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls in recent days have given Vice President Gore leads of anywhere from
15 to 20 percentage points with a little more than a week until the Jan. 24
caucuses. The vice president felt confident enough to send out a fund-raising
letter that said ``we feel real good about our prospects.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Polls don't amount to a hill of beans,'' Gore said at a campaign stop in
Concord, N.H.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, on the other hand, has hired a satellite truck to beam his Iowa
interviews to New Hampshire, where the polls look better for him. He's adding a
trip back there next week, one aide said, just days before the Iowa voting.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign said the moves do not suggest a change in strategy, only that
Bradley wants to keep his focus on both states and avoid putting too many eggs
in an Iowa basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, armed with record amounts of money and lofty poll standings, was
hardly worried about losing. But he spent Friday seeking to lower expectations
for his margin.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope to do as well as any Republican's done in a crowded field, which is
37 percent,'' he said. Most polls have shown Bush under 50 percent in Iowa,
while publisher Steve Forbes is around 20 percent. Some longtime caucus-watchers
have wondered aloud if Bush's backers have the passion to show up on a chilly
January night, and Bush was taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's one thing to say they're for me; it's another thing to show up,''
Bush said. ``I'm very aware of how a caucus system works, as is our
organization.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, at a rally in Pella, Iowa, said he's counting on undecided voters to
swing his way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we're going to show this is an open race, that voters are not
going to be corralled like cattle into a coronation conducted by the Republican
insiders,'' he said Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa Republican Chairman Richard Schwarm, a Bush backer and adviser, said
conservative candidates are especially capable of a surprise because they appeal
to social and religious conservatives who are sometimes passionate about their
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For them, voting is a religious duty, not just a civic duty,'' said
Schwarm.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley was running into a Gore organizational
effort in high gear.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Smith, president of the Iowa Federation of Labor, said union phone
banks will call 30,000 members -- many more than once -- before the caucuses. In
addition, 1,300 packages have been mailed to local union offices with
personalized letters to 150,000 union members.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting at Iowa's Democratic caucuses is projected at about 100,000, making
the importance of an organized turnout obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Gore campaign and the Bradley campaign took vastly different
approaches in Iowa,'' said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. But that wasn't
necessarily by choice.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley has built a campaign organization of his own, he lacks a
natural organizational structure like labor. Gore also is getting a boost from
Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who filmed campaign commercials that are now flooding the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Harkin is occasionally controversial but is very popular among the
Democratic activists who will attend precinct caucuses. He's virtually turned
his organization over to Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has built a campaign organization of his own, but he lacks a natural
organizational base like labor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's tough,'' said Dan Lucas, who runs the Bradley caucus campaign.
``They've got a base, they've always had a base. We came in here with zero and
had to build from there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with that opposition, Bradley was giving new attention to New
Hampshire, where polls are far better for him. A senior campaign aide said
Bradley would break off the Iowa campaign trail for a day next week to head back
to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the overwhelming favorite on the Republican side, but he's facing a
well-organized and -financed challenge from Forbes. Conservatives Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes also motivate social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that for mainstream candidates there's always some falloff from
the polling,'' said Schwarm. ``You would expect a Forbes or a Bauer or a Keyes
to perform better than the polling.''

<HEADLINE> 2 U.N. Employees on Hunger Strikes  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Two employees at the U.N.'s cultural arm have gone on
hunger strikes to protest a review of dozens of last-minute promotions they and
others were granted by the outgoing head of the agency, U.N. sources and an
internal memo say.
</P>
<P>
	   The former director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization, Federico Mayor of Spain, is reported to have granted
up to 60 promotions just before he was replaced in November by Japan's Koichiro
Matsuura. Matsuura promptly suspended the promotions and ordered a review.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the protesting employees, Bruno de Padirac, a 23-year veteran of
UNESCO, wrote his co-workers at UNESCO in an e-mail last month, insisting that
his promotion was justified.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The outgoing director-general had nothing to gain by giving me a promotion
since he was leaving his job,'' said de Padirac in an email dated Dec. 14 that
was obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   De Padirac and an unidentified Canadian woman, believed to be a temporary
worker who was told her contract wouldn't be renewed, have been on a hunger
strike for several days, sources said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   During Mayor's 12-year term as head of UNESCO, the agency, which puts out an
annual list of World Heritage Sites and runs educational programs around the
world, was hobbled by a reputation for excessive spending and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and Britain left UNESCO in 1984 and 1985, charging that
the organization was corrupt and mismanaged. Britain returned in 1997 but U.S.
President Bill Clinton has said budget constraints prevent the United States
from rejoining.
</P>
<P>
	   Matsuura has pledged to reform the agency.

<HEADLINE> Populist Becomes Guatemala President  </HEADLINE>
   By ALFONSO ANZUETO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY -- A one-time professor of Marxism who is closely allied to a
former rightist military dictator became the president of Guatemala Friday,
reaching out to all sides of the politically divided country to heal the wounds
of a 36-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidential sash was placed on Alfonso Portillo by the former dictator,
Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, who heads Portillo's party and is the new president of
congress.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My government is going to act with decisiveness and courage in the
building of a civil order in which we all feel that we are participants and are
represented,'' Portillo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo won a runoff election last month with 68 percent of the vote, more
than any presidential candidate has received in 50 years. He may need that
popularity to help govern a country still troubled by violence and divisions in
the wake of the civil war that ended in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo often has been overshadowed within his own party by Rios Montt, who
led Guatemala for 17 months after taking power in a 1982 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights groups claim that the army under Rios Montt carried out
widespread massacres during a scorched-earth campaign against leftist rebels in
northern Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
	   But Portillo has tried to escape that shadow, criticizing past rights abuses
by the military and even naming as culture minister Otilia Lux Coti, an Indian
activist who headed a major investigation into civil war crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo claims that his own past as a leftist has helped the party broaden
its populist appeal beyond its right-wing origins.
</P>
<P>
	   In his inaugural address, he committed himself to create ``conditions for
the full development of the indigenous and the eradication of racism and
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo has said he will probably have differences with Rios Montt, whose
supporters are a majority in the new congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Portillo survived a campaign revelation that might have torpedoed other
candidates: reports that he killed two men while in Mexico in 1982. Portillo
claimed the killings were in self-defense, though relatives of the men have
disputed that in recent Mexican newspaper interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges against Portillo were eventually dropped in Mexico because the
statute of limitations had expired.

<P>
	   Iowa Republican Chairman Richard Schwarm, a Bush backer and adviser, said
conservative candidates are especially capable of a surprise because they appeal
to social and religious conservatives who are sometimes passionate about their
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   "For them, voting is a religious duty, not just a civic duty," said Schwarm.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Democratic side, Bradley was running into a Gore organizational
effort in high gear.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Smith, president of the Iowa Federation of Labor, said union phone
banks will call 30,000 members - many more than once - before the caucuses. In
addition, 1,300 packages have been mailed to local union offices with
personalized letters to 150,000 union members.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting at Iowa's Democratic caucuses is projected at about 100,000, making
the importance of an organized turnout obvious.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Gore campaign and the Bradley campaign took vastly different approaches
in Iowa," said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane. But that wasn't necessarily by
choice.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley has built a campaign organization of his own, he lacks a
natural organizational structure like labor. Gore also is getting a boost from
Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, who filmed campaign commercials that are now flooding the
state.
</P>
<P>
	   Harkin is occasionally controversial but is very popular among the
Democratic activists who will attend precinct caucuses. He's virtually turned
his organization over to Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has built a campaign organization of his own, but he lacks a natural
organizational base like labor.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough," said Dan Lucas, who runs the Bradley caucus campaign. "They've
got a base, they've always had a base. We came in here with zero and had to
build from there."
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with that opposition, Bradley was giving new attention to New
Hampshire, where polls are far better for him. A senior campaign aide said
Bradley would break off the Iowa campaign trail for a day next week to head back
to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is the overwhelming favorite on the Republican side, but he's facing a
well-organized and -financed challenge from Forbes. Conservatives Gary Bauer and
Alan Keyes also motivate social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that for mainstream candidates there's always some falloff from the
polling," said Schwarm. "You would expect a Forbes or a Bauer or a Keyes to
perform better than the polling."

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Authorities briefly evacuated part of the Sacramento
International Airport on Friday after a man in a business suit ran past a
security checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
	   Terminal A, which contains Southwest Airlines, was evacuated from the
checkpoint to the airline gates for about two hours so security officers could
search the concourse, said airport spokesman Greg Weissenfluh.
</P>
<P>
	   The man ignored a security officer's order to stop and blended into the
crowd, sheriff's spokesman Rick Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities did not locate the man, but reopened the area after determining
there was no threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 travelers, including some who had already boarded flights, were
forced to wait in the main terminal area. Weissenfluh said he did not know how
many flights were delayed.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian: No Peace Deals Yet  </HEADLINE>
   By DANA BUDEIRI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians have not agreed on
any aspects of a final status accord only one month before a deadline for a
framework on the agreement, a Palestinian negotiator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to overcome differences in the talks on the most contentious
issues between the sides, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat will meet in Washington on Jan. 20, an Israeli minister
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians complain that Israel is being sluggish in the talks and has
neglected them for the peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no agreement on anything,'' said Ahmed Qureia, who is also
speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council. ``The gap between the sides is
very wide, in such a way that there is nothing that can be written on paper.''
</P>
<P>
	   The sides set Feb. 13 as a deadline for the framework agreement and
September for the final peace accord between them, which will deal with the most
contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat's Cabinet said in a statement after a meeting in the West Bank city
of Ramallah late Friday that the sides may not be able to stick to the February
deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The continued lack of seriousness from the Israeli side over final status
issues will make it difficult'' to meet the deadline, said the release put out
by the WAFA Palestinian news service. ``Lack of progress could inflict great
damage to the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an apparent attempt to appease the Palestinians, Israeli Deputy Minister
Ephraim Sneh said Friday that the neighborhood of Abu Dis east of Jerusalem
might be included in a final status agreement on the disputed city.
</P>
<P>
	   The comment suggested that the Palestinians may receive more control in the
sector they want as a capital, but only in later talks. The Palestinians had
demanded they receive some West Bank areas around east Jerusalem as part of the
next Israeli withdrawal, slated for Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that the issue of Jerusalem has to be solved not by dividing
Jerusalem, but by its expansion,'' Sneh told Israel radio. ``The Palestinians
have to understand that they cannot get as part of these percentages things that
are part of final status issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem in 1967, declaring the sector part of its
indivisible capital. Barak has insisted Israel will not agree to divide the city
as part of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said Friday that the
neighborhoods around east Jerusalem are part of the West Bank and thus should be
included in the next withdrawal, which will include 6.1 percent of the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israelis have refused to include the areas east of the city in the
withdrawal in intense meetings to try to work out a compromise, Erekat told
reporters after the Cabinet meeting.

<HEADLINE> Psychologist May Testify on Diallo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four police officers accused of murdering an unarmed West
African immigrant want an expert in human perception to help convince a jury
they made a tragic -- but honest -- mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   Psychologist and Columbia University professor Lynn Cooper would testify how
the eyes can play tricks on the brain, according to defense papers filed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Cooper, who has examined the officers and visited the scene of the fatal
shooting, would explain ``why the perception that caused them to shoot was
reasonable and not `depraved indifference,''' attorney Bennett Epstein said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense papers were filed in response to a prosecution motion last week
that urged Justice Joseph Teresi to bar the psychologist and other expert
witnesses from voicing opinions on whether the shooting was justified.
</P>
<P>
	   Teresi had no immediate response.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon, Richard Murphy and Kenneth Boss were
indicted on second-degree murder charges in March after they fired 41 bullets at
Amadou Diallo during a search for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo, struck 19 times, died at the scene. Attorneys for the officers
claimed their clients mistakenly believed the street vendor was reaching for a
gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection in the trial is set to begin Jan. 31.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Renews Cease-Fire Commitment  </HEADLINE>
   By MOHAMED OSMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan's government has renewed its commitment to the
civil war cease-fire, the official newspaper Al-Anba reported Friday, a day
after the southern rebels reaffirmed the truce.
</P>
<P>
	   The renewals of the cease-fire, which was due to expire Saturday, will allow
humanitarian organizations to transport aid to people suffering shortages of
food and medicine in southern and eastern Sudan. Nearly 2 million people have
died from war and attendant famines since the insurgency began in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail met the director of the U. N.
World Food Program in Sudan, Mohammed Saliheen, and ``renewed the government
commitment to boosting the international effort for the delivery of relief to
the affected persons (and) underlined again the constant stand of the Sudan
(government) toward a comprehensive cease-fire,'' the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The government has been saying it observes a comprehensive cease-fire in the
country and urges the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army to do the same.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the rebel group announced its commitment to the three-month
cease-fire but made it specific to the southern areas of Bahr el Ghazal, Western
Upper Nile and Central Upper Nile.
</P>
<P>
	   The newspaper said Saliheen told the foreign minister that this year's food
production in the south was ``far less than last year's, particularly in Bahr el
Ghazal state.''
</P>
<P>
	   The reduced harvest required ``the cooperation of all parties so that food
relief could reach the affected persons,'' the paper quoted Saliheen as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. officials were not available for comment on the food shortage.
</P>
<P>
	   Rebels in the predominantly Christian and animist south seek increased
autonomy and development for their region, which has been traditionally
neglected under the government in the Muslim and Arab north.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Ivan DeBlois Combe, the inventor of Clearasil, the
acne cream that helped millions of pimply-faced baby boomers get through the
awkward teen-age years, died Tuesday after a stroke. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
	   He named the product ``Clearasil'' to capitalize on every teen-ager's dream
of having clear skin.
</P>
<P>
	   Combe peddled the new product to drug stores across the country, but store
owners were reluctant to buy another acne product when so many others had
failed. Finally, Combe gave out free tubes of Clearasil to store owners in
exchange for a promise to order more if the product sold. It did.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales skyrocketed after Combe began advertising Clearasil on the popular
teen-age dance show ``American Bandstand'' in 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1960, Vick Chemical bought the Clearasil business from Combe's company,
Combe Inc. Procter &AMP; Gamble bought Clearasil in 1985.

</P>
<P>
	   As the flight safety officer, Forte often commented on airline crashes and

roster included Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, David Niven, Richard Burton,
Fredric March and Barbara Stanwyck, died Monday. He was 98.
</P>
<P>
	   Also a producer whose movies included ``Born Free,'' Jaffe became a movie
mogul by the age of 22.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Reform Party leaders gather at Trump's Florida compound  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) - Greeted by a boisterous crowd of Reform Party
leaders under the elegant roof of his $100,000-per-member club, tycoon Donald
Trump said Friday that he would become a "very serious candidate" for the
presidency if they would have him on their third-party ticket.
<P>
	   Roughly two-thirds of the 170 party members gathered in the Gold and White
Ballroom of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club raised their hands when he asked who among
them would support his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've come really from being a very successful businessman to being a very
serious candidate," Trump told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   He told reporters earlier that he would make an announcement in
mid-February, and that the event would likely take place in New York City's
Trump Tower.
</P>
<P>
	   On-stage in the pillared ballroom, Trump reached out to supporters of party
founder Ross Perot, who were left out of his event last week with the leader of
an opposing faction, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very proud to be in the party of Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura," Trump
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd, pumped up by wine and hors d'oeuvres, applauded and cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot's right-hand man, former national chairman Russell Verney, said he
welcomed Trump into the race.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is him reaching out to all parts of the Reform Party, and that's
good," Verney said. He acknowledged it's in the party's interest to encourage a
race between two marquee names - Trump's and conservative columnist Pat
Buchanan's - because it would build the Reform Party's base and keep it in the
headlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a rich candidate, he said, "can reach out to the disaffected voter
unaffiliated with any party and inspire them to get back involved in politics."
</P>
<P>
	   But some in the crowd greeted Trump with skeptical questions rather than
open arms, probing whether his interest in the race is an interest in the Reform
Party, or in his own future.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman pressed him on whether he would attend the Florida Reform Party's
convention next weekend in Tampa. Trump said he's "looking at that very
seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   Another asked whether, if the party's presidential nomination went to
someone else, he would still contribute money to the Reform Party to help build
it. He hedged, saying he could not support it if it nominates Buchanan, for
example.
</P>
<P>
	   "If I agreed with an opponent and the views of an opponent who got the
nomination, I would absolutely support" the party, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am focused on making a good decision regarding whether or not I should
seek the Reform Party presidential nomination," Trump said in a statement
Thursday, a day before he ferried some of the party's leaders to Florida aboard
his plush 727.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am anxious to talk with Reform Party leaders about whether it is possible
to achieve unity within the party and whether it is possible for a Reform Party
presidential candidate to win in 2000," Trump added.
</P>
<P>
	   For their part, Reform Party members who traveled from as far away as
Wisconsin said they were eager to meet with the wealthy developer.
</P>
<P>
	   "At first I couldn't imagine him being our president," said Miriam
Lancaster, 84, of Orlando. "But if he can run our country the way he's run his
business, we'll be out of debt in no time."
</P>
<P>
	   "Anyway," she added, "it's Friday night! I'd rather be here."
</P>
<P>
	   The party, moved from poolside indoors due to wind, was held at the
72-year-old Mar-a-Lago, named for its "sea-to-lake" spot on 18 acres between the
Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built the estate in 1927, willed it to the
federal government to use as a winter White House, but its $3 million-a-year
maintenance fees were too much for the government. Trump bought it in 1985 for
$8 million of its $25 million asking price, and a decade later he turned it into
a members-only club, according to the club's Web site.

Grandmother Willing To Retrieve Elian

<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's paternal grandmother said today she would
come to the United States to pick up her grandson if it meant he could come back
to Cuba. The U.S. government's originally scheduled today as the final date for
the boy's return to his father. But Attorney General Janet Reno lifted the
deadline to give his relatives in Miami a chance to fight for the boy in federal
court. Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point
man on U.S.-Cuban relations, said that Cuban authorities are frustrated by
Reno's failure to set a new deadline and the INS's failure to enforce its
decision that Elian be returned to his father.

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Police arrested a man today for allegedly threatening more

substance and a note saying, "This is anthrax and you will die." None of the 14
envelopes received this week contained anthrax, a deadly livestock disease that
can be transmitted to humans, authorities said. Micky A. Sauer, 23, of Kenosha
was arrested after a letter carrier discovered another suspicious envelope in a
street corner mail box in Kenosha on Thursday and called investigators. Sauer
was charged Friday in U.S. District Court with mailing a threatening

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Democrat Bill Bradley, confronting Al Gore's
organizational muscle in Iowa, is subtly starting to shift his attention to the

by getting close to Gore in Iowa's leadoff caucuses. He has devoted most of his
campaign time to the state and has spent heavily on television advertising. The
campaign said the moves do not suggest a change in strategy, only that Bradley
wants to keep his focus on both states and avoid putting too many eggs in an

Land To Be Returned To Northern Utes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The government is returning 84,000 acres to the
Northern Ute tribe as part of a deal to clean up millions of tons of uranium
waste along the Colorado River, one of the biggest givebacks of Indian land in
U.S. history. The deal is subject to approval by Congress. The land, which is
next to the 4.4 million-acre Ute reservation, is believed to contain oil-rich
shale deposits. It was given to the Utes in 1882, but in 1916, on the eve of the
nation's entry into World War I, the federal government took it back to create a
reserve supply of oil for the Navy fleet. Under the agreement, the Indians can
open the land to oil and gas drilling. But they will have to pay a percentage of
the royalties to the government.

high cholesterol and a history of heart disease in his family. The test, during

Oil Prices Top $28, a 9-Year High

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil prices roared 5 percent higher to a new nine-year high
today, topping $28 a barrel for the first time since 1991 and the Gulf War. The
gain came after OPEC removed virtually all doubt it will extend its agreement on
lowered production for several more months. Frigid weather in the northeastern
United States also contributed to a sharp rise in crude as well as gasoline,
heating oil and natural gas futures. Crude climbed as high as $28.10 a barrel,

Ballroom of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club raised their hands when he asked who among
them would support his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've come really from being a very successful businessman to being a very
serious candidate,'' Trump told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   He told reporters earlier that he would make an announcement in
mid-February, and that the event would likely take place in New York City's
Trump Tower.
</P>
<P>
	   On-stage in the pillared ballroom, Trump reached out to supporters of party
founder Ross Perot, who were left out of his event last week with the leader of
an opposing faction, Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very proud to be in the party of Ross Perot and Jesse Ventura,'' Trump
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd, pumped up by wine and hors d'oeuvres, applauded and cheered.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot's right-hand man, former national chairman Russell Verney, said he
welcomed Trump into the race.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is him reaching out to all parts of the Reform Party, and that's
good,'' Verney said. He acknowledged it's in the party's interest to encourage a
race between two marquee names -- Trump's and conservative columnist Pat
Buchanan's -- because it would build the Reform Party's base and keep it in the
headlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Even a rich candidate, he said, ``can reach out to the disaffected voter
unaffiliated with any party and inspire them to get back involved in politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   But some in the crowd greeted Trump with skeptical questions rather than
open arms, probing whether his interest in the race is an interest in the Reform
Party, or in his own future.
</P>
<P>
	   One woman pressed him on whether he would attend the Florida Reform Party's
convention next weekend in Tampa. Trump said he's ``looking at that very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another asked whether, if the party's presidential nomination went to
someone else, he would still contribute money to the Reform Party to help build
it. He hedged, saying he could not support it if it nominates Buchanan, for
example.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I agreed with an opponent and the views of an opponent who got the
nomination, I would absolutely support'' the party, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am focused on making a good decision regarding whether or not I should
seek the Reform Party presidential nomination,'' Trump said in a statement
Thursday, a day before he ferried some of the party's leaders to Florida aboard
his plush 727.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am anxious to talk with Reform Party leaders about whether it is
possible to achieve unity within the party and whether it is possible for a
Reform Party presidential candidate to win in 2000,'' Trump added.
</P>
<P>
	   For their part, Reform Party members who traveled from as far away as
Wisconsin said they were eager to meet with the wealthy developer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At first I couldn't imagine him being our president,'' said Miriam
Lancaster, 84, of Orlando. ``But if he can run our country the way he's run his
business, we'll be out of debt in no time.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyway,'' she added, ``it's Friday night! I'd rather be here.''
</P>
<P>
	   The party, moved from poolside indoors due to wind, was held at the
72-year-old Mar-a-Lago, named for its ``sea-to-lake'' spot on 18 acres between
the Atlantic Ocean and Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
	   Marjorie Merriweather Post, who built the estate in 1927, willed it to the
federal government to use as a winter White House, but its $3 million-a-year
maintenance fees were too much for the government. Trump bought it in 1985 for
$8 million of its $25 million asking price, and a decade later he turned it into
a members-only club, according to the club's Web site.

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Isaiah Rider scored 13 of his 24 points in the third
quarter, and his 15-foot jumper with 45 seconds left sealed the Atlanta Hawks'
89-83 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory snapped a seven-game road losing streak for the Hawks. They
hadn't won on the road since beating Portland on Dec. 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Jackson added 18 points for Atlanta despite sitting out all but eight
minutes of the first half in foul trouble. Alan Henderson was the only other
Hawk in double figures with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Lorenzen Wright's hook shot gave Atlanta a 75-64 lead with 7:07 left, but
Chris Anstey got the Bulls back into the game by scoring nine points to spark a
13-4 run that cut Atlanta's lead to 79-77 with 3:20 left.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest shot of the run came from Matt Maloney, who'd been struggling
all night. He hit a 3-pointer, his first basket of the night, with 3:48 left to
bring the Bulls within 79-75.
</P>
<P>
	   Elton Brand's layup with 1:04 left made it 83-81, and that's when Rider
decided he'd had enough. He hit a 15-foot jumper from the left wing, his first
basket of the fourth quarter, and the Bulls couldn't get any closer.
</P>
<P>
	   Anstey scored a season-high 19 points on 7-of-11 shooting. Toni Kukoc also
had 19, and Brand added 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Rider's stats weren't impressive -- he was 9-of-24 from the floor --
he came through when the Hawks needed it most. Trailing by 7 at the start of the
third quarter, Rider took over the game. He hit two 3-pointers in a row as
Atlanta went on a 12-5 run, tying the game at 51 on Rider's layup with 6:38 left
in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Jackson combined to score all but two of Atlanta's last 14 points in
the third quarter, and Jackson opened the fourth with two more baskets to give
the Hawks a 69-61 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta hadn't played since last Saturday and the Bulls had been off since
Tuesday -- their game Wednesday against Charlotte was canceled after Bobby
Phills was killed -- and both teams looked sluggish in the first half. There
were bad passes, turnovers and baskets that looked like something out of a
Globetrotters game.
</P>
<P>
	   It didn't help that the Hawks played most of the half without Jackson, who
picked up his third foul with 3:54 left in the first quarter.

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Authorities briefly evacuated part of the
Sacramento International Airport on Friday after a man in a business suit ran
past a security checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
	   Terminal A, which contains Southwest Airlines, was evacuated from the
checkpoint to the airline gates for about two hours so security officers could
search the concourse, said airport spokesman Greg Weissenfluh.
</P>
<P>
	   The man ignored a security officer's order to stop and blended into the
crowd, sheriff's spokesman Rick Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities did not locate the man, but reopened the area after determining
there was no threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 300 travelers, including some who had already boarded flights, were
forced to wait in the main terminal area. Weissenfluh said he did not know how
many flights were delayed.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Mothers Seek Elian's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Rows upon rows of Cuban mothers -- hundreds visibly pregnant,
others carrying small children -- marched along a seaside boulevard in Havana on
Friday as Fidel Castro's government appealed to emotion in demanding the return
of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bring back our son!'' the women cried, waving Cuban flags as they moved
slowly up the Malecon coastal highway to the American diplomatic mission in
Havana. ``We want our son!''
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban authorities estimated that 100,000 women participated in what it
called the ``March of the Combatant Mothers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The protest marked a return to the larger demonstrations of early December,
when hundreds of thousands of people rallied in some of Cuba's biggest
gatherings since the triumph of the revolution that brought Castro to power 41
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian, the boy at the center of the international dispute, was found
clinging to an inner tube Nov. 25 off the coast of Florida after his mother,
stepfather and others died in a failed attempt to reach U.S. shores. He has been
staying with relatives in Miami who do not want to send him back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday was the U.S. government's original deadline for Elian return to his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
earlier ruled that only the father can speak for Elian on immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno said this week that only a federal court has
jurisdiction in the case and rejected a Florida state judge's order that Elian
remain in Miami until March 6 to hear arguments by his American relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly and Castro's point man
on U.S.-Cuban relations, said Friday evening that officials here are frustrated
by Reno's failure to set a new deadline and the INS's failure to enforce its
decision that Elian be returned to his father. It is up to the U.S. government
to enforce its own decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No enforcement action was ever announced by the INS,'' said Alarcon,
former Cuban ambassador to the United Nations. ``You have a very strange
situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   A sign outside the American diplomatic mission in Havana on Friday showed a
portrait of the first-grader behind a chain-link fence, underscoring Cuba's
position that the boy has been ``kidnapped'' by relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's young stepmother, Nelsy, was at the head of the massive march,
pushing his half-brother in a stroller. She was flanked by Elian's two
grandmothers and Vilma Espin, head of the Cuban Federation of Women and wife of
Raul Castro, the president's brother and armed forces minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's paternal grandmother, Mariela, told reporters that she was willing
to go to Miami to retrieve her grandson if she was assured that she could pick
him up and return immediately to Cuba without becoming embroiled in legal or
political problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would go there just for one minute to get him. To get him. Nothing
more,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Red, white and blue Cuban flags fluttered amid the sea of women stretching
for blocks down the Malecon as choppy ocean waves splashed against the coastal
wall. A few men and children also joined the march.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his sea rescue, Elian has been increasingly referred to in Cuba as
``our son,'' a boy hero symbolizing the government's decades-long ideological
battle with Cuban exiles in Miami. Rather than a clash between two governments,
the dispute over Elian is a battle between Cubans of differing political views
living on both sides of the Florida Straits.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with ABC's ``Nightline,'' Gonzalez, 31, expressed
growing rage and frustration over his separation from his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarcon said that while Cuba has not prohibited Gonzalez from going to Miami
to retrieve Elian, American attorneys -- and even American officials -- have
counseled against it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have gotten the same message from U.S. officials, in private, several
times that it is not advisable for this man to appear in U.S. territory,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The concern in Cuba always has been that if Gonzalez goes he will
immediately become involved in political and legal problems that will prevent
his speedy return.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the frustration, Alarcon said Cuba appreciates recent moves by U.S.
officials to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they are trying to appeal to the sensibility, to the
consciousness'' of Elian's Miami relatives, he said.

    	   MANTEO, N.C. (AP) - A North Carolina woman was convicted on Friday of
four counts of second-degree murder and one count of assault with a deadly
weapon in a drunken driving accident that killed four New Jersey teen-agers and
seriously injured another.
<P>
	   Jurors deliberated for 4 1/2 hours before reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   Melissa Marvin, 30, of Kill Devil Hills, showed no emotion as the guilty
verdict was announced, even though she cried through much of the trial's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Marvin ran a red light on an Outer Banks highway last April
and that her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal level. Her
S-U-V slammed into a car carrying five teen-agers. Megan Blong, Amanda Geiger
and Angie McGrady, all of Burlington County, N.J. and Shana Lawler, who had
recently moved to North Carolina from New Jersey, were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Marvin faces up to 40 years in prison. The sentencing hearing is scheduled
to begin Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   During testimony Friday afternoon, Michael Horner, 17, of Indian Mills,
N.J., recalled how a beach outing with four friends ended with blinding speed at
an Outer Banks intersection in a wreck that killed all four 17-year-old girls.
</P>
<P>
	   After Horner's testimony, the defense called a handful of witnesses, but
Marvin didn't testify. Both sides delivered closing arguments,the judge gave the
jury instructions early Friday evening, and the jury began deliberations shortly
after 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony earlier this week showed Marvin had five midday drinks before
getting behind the wheel of her red sport utility vehicle. Prosecutors said she
ran a red light, and her blood-alcohol level was nearly three times the legal
level.
</P>
<P>
	   The red SUV slammed into the teen-agers' car so quickly last April 6 that no
one had time to say anything, Horner testified Friday. During his matter-of-fact
account, Marvin bowed her head, rocked back and forth and wept.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner, who was knocked unconscious and later had his spleen removed, said
he and the four girls were returning from the beach when the accident occurred.
Killed in the wreck were Megan Blong, Amanda Geiger and Angie McGrady, all of
Burlington County, N.J., as well as Shana Lawler.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner said Lawler had recently moved from Burlington County to the Outer
Banks, and he and the other girls had taken a bus to town to visit her. The day
of the accident, he said, they had gone jogging, washed the car and spent time
at the beach.
</P>
<P>
	   On the way to Lawler's home from the beach, Blong, who was driving, began
turning left on a green arrow at an intersection, said Horner, who said he was
in the front passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I saw the red SUV speeding toward us, and that's the last thing I
remembered," he said. "We were hit ... I was knocked unconscious."
</P>
<P>
	   He said when he awakened, Megan was leaning against him, and paramedics were
crowded around the car. He was placed on a stretcher and put in an ambulance
with Marvin, but remembered little of the trip to the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Horner said he didn't learn what happened to his friends until after he was
transported by helicopter to Albemarle Hospital in Elizabeth City and had
undergone surgery to remove his spleen.
</P>
<P>
	   After the accident, Marvin refused to submit to an alcohol breath test, so
police obtained a search warrant to draw blood. The blood sample, taken more
than four hours after the wreck, showed her to have a blood-alcohol level of
.21, nearly three times North Carolina's legal limit of .08.
</P>
<P>
	   In closing arguments, prosecutor Amber Davis said witnesses reported seeing
Marvin with a foot on her dashboard.
</P>
<P>
	   "She barrels down there, 60 miles an hour, runs right through the red light.
Cars collide. Bodies fly everywhere," she said, condemning Marvin's actions as
"selfish, willful, indifferent acts."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis also asked jurors to consider an expert witness' estimate that
Marvin's blood-alcohol level at the time of the crash was .285.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Michael Sanders urged consideration of conflicting
testimony about whether Marvin had her foot on the dashboard and apparent
discrepancies in testimony about her driving before the crash. He questioned how
much liquor was in the drinks she consumed, noting witnesses said they didn't
notice she had balance or speech problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier testimony showed Marvin had had at least five drinks before getting
behind the wheel and that she had been arrested for driving while impaired twice
before. Both times, Marvin was permitted to plead guilty to a lesser charge of
careless and reckless driving.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Two earthquakes killed at least three people, injured 34 and
collapsed hundreds of buildings in a quake-prone region of southwest China early
Saturday, officials and state media said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yao'an county in Yunnan province was hit first by a 6.0-magnitude quake that
sent people scurrying out of their homes, followed 1 1/2 hours later by an
aftershock with a magnitude of 6.5, said a county seismologist who gave just his
surname, Su.
</P>
<P>
	   Three people were killed, 34 people were injured and 447 buildings
collapsed, said an official surnamed Ma at the State Seismology Bureau in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
	   The main compound of Yao'an's government headquarters was seriously damaged,
the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. Power in the area also was cut, it added.
</P>
<P>
	   In the town of Guantun, 18 miles from Yao'an, the early morning quakes woke
tens of thousands of people and sent residents flocking into the streets, Xinhua
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A strong tremor also was felt in the provincial capital Kunming, some 125
miles to the east of Yao'an, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yao'an was also hit by a 6.5-magnitude quake in 1962 and a 5.6-magnitude
quake on August 14, 1993, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yunnan's Seismology Bureau said it sent an investigative team to the area.

<HEADLINE> 76ers 102, Magic 100  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Snow's 20-foot jumper with 14 seconds left gave
the Philadelphia 76ers a 102-100 victory over the Orlando Magic on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen Iverson led the Sixers with 35 points and had no turnovers, while Theo
Ratliff had a big night in his second game back from another leg injury with 18
points, 14 rebounds and five blocks. Snow had 10 points and 11 assists to lead
Philadelphia back from an 18-point second-quarter deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow, who earlier in the game encouraged Iverson to pass the ball, took a
bounce pass from Iverson and calmly hit the game-winner from the top of the key
-- holding his shooting hand in the air while backpedaling downcourt.
</P>
<P>
	   Darrell Armstrong missed a running jumper, but the Magic got the ball out of
bounds with 3.6 seconds left. Armstrong took the inbounds pass and juked Snow
with a between-the-legs dribble, but his 29-foot jumper to win it bounced off
the front rim.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Doleac, who tied it at 100-all with a thunderous putback dunk, had
18 points and 13 rebounds as the injury-depleted Magic lost their fifth straight
and 10th in 11 games. Chris Gatling had 18 points and 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Chucky Atkins, a 25-year-old rookie who spent the last two years winning
championships in Croatia, had 15 points and keyed Orlando's 27-4 run spanning
the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow started a 17-5 run with a running jumper and capped it with a layup off
a steal by Iverson to cut it to 92-91 with 3:55 left. Snow had four points and
three assists during the run.
</P>
<P>
	   Iverson hit a hanging one-hander to tie it at 94-all, then hit a jumper to
give Philadelphia its first lead since the second quarter, 98-96 with 2:11 to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron McKie hit two free throws in between two baskets by Doleac to set up
the thrilling finish.
</P>
<P>
	   Facing the same lineup of Orlando subs that nearly blew them out of the
building in the second quarter, the Sixers went on a 10-2 run to cut it to 89-84
with 6:55 left. Iverson was on the bench for four of Philadelphia's five baskets
-- one by Snow, two by McKie, one by Matt Geiger and a putback jumper by
Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point while the Sixers tried to come back, Snow bumped chests with
Iverson, who thought he was being congratulated because George Lynch got to the
foul line after Iverson's wild miss. But Snow raised his hands in the air, as if
to point out that Iverson should have passed to a wide-open Lynch.

<HEADLINE> Heat 92, Nuggets 87  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Alonzo Mourning scored 28 points and Voshon Lenard came off
the bench to score 24, fueling a fourth-quarter rally that gave the Miami Heat a
92-87 win over the Denver Nuggets on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heat, extending their winning streak over Denver to eight games, came
back from a seven-point deficit midway through the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
	   Lenard scored 14 points and Mourning 11 in the final period as Miami
outscored Denver 19-7 over the last 6:33.
</P>
<P>
	   Mourning added 13 rebounds and six blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Antonio McDyess had 26 points and 15 rebounds for Denver, which played
without injured point guard Nick Van Exel.
</P>
<P>
	   Cory Alexander's 3-point basket and George McCloud's two free throws gave
Denver an 80-73 lead with 6:44 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lenard promptly hit a 17-foot jumper and a 3-pointer, triggering an 8-0
run as Miami took the lead for the first time since the opening quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Two free throws by McDyess put Denver ahead 85-82, but Mourning countered
with a basket and Lenard made another 3-pointer with 1:09 left. Mourning's two
free throws made it 89-85 with 55 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
	   On five straight possessions in the final two minutes, Denver missed two
shots and had three turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   McDyess and Ron Mercer each had eight points in the first quarter as Denver,
which outshot Miami 57 percent to 40 percent, took a 32-20 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Scoring 13 fastbreak points in the quarter compared to Miami's none, the
Nuggets used a 17-4 run to open up a 25-14 lead. Keon Clark sank a 73-foot shot
from the opposite free-throw line at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Lenard's pair of 3-pointers early in the second quarter helped the Heat
close the gap. A slam by Mourning, who had 11 points in the period, cut the
deficit to 44-41 with 4:27 left in the period, but the Nuggets padded the lead
to 53-47 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
	   After a defensive third quarter that saw neither team shoot better than 32
percent, Denver carried a 69-62 lead into the final period.

Wis. Man Arrested After Anthrax Scares
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- A Wisconsin man was arrested Friday for allegedly
threatening more than a dozen clinics, agencies and a school by sending
envelopes with a gritty substance and a note saying, "This is anthrax and you
will die." None of the 14 envelopes received this week contained anthrax, a
deadly livestock disease that can be transmitted to humans. Micky A. Sauer, 23,
of Kenosha was arrested after a letter carrier discovered another suspicious
envelope in a street corner mail box in Kenosha on Thursday and called
investigators. Sauer was charged Friday in U.S. District Court with mailing a
threatening communication, which carries a penalty of up to 5 years in prison.

	   BEIJING (AP) -- Two earthquakes killed at least three people, injured 34 and
collapsed hundreds of buildings in a quake-prone region of southwest China early
Saturday, officials and state media said. Yao'an county in Yunnan province was
hit first by a 6.0-magnitude quake that sent people scurrying out of their
homes, followed 1 1/2 hours later by an aftershock with a magnitude of 6.5, said
a county seismologist who gave just his surname, Su. Three people were killed,
34 people were injured and 447 buildings collapsed, said an official surnamed Ma
at the State Seismology Bureau in Beijing.

Sudan Renews Cease-Fire Commitment

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- Sudan's government has renewed its commitment to the
civil war cease-fire, the official newspaper Al-Anba reported Friday, a day
after the southern rebels reaffirmed the truce. The renewals of the cease-fire,
which was due to expire Saturday, will allow humanitarian organizations to
transport aid to people suffering shortages of food and medicine in southern and
eastern Sudan. Nearly 2 million people have died from war and attendant famines
since the insurgency began in 1983.

Indian Land To Be Returned
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The government is returning 84,000 acres to the
Northern Ute tribe as part of a deal to clean up millions of tons of uranium
waste along the Colorado River, one of the biggest givebacks of Indian land in
U.S. history. The deal is subject to approval by Congress. The land, which is
next to the 4.4 million-acre Ute reservation, is believed to contain oil-rich
shale deposits. It was given to the Utes in 1882, but in 1916, on the eve of the
nation's entry into World War I, the federal government took it back to create a
reserve supply of oil for the Navy fleet. Under the agreement, the Indians can
open the land to oil and gas drilling. But they will have to pay a percentage of
the royalties to the government.

Oil Prices Reach 9-Year High
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oil prices roared 5 percent higher to a new nine-year high
Friday, topping $28 a barrel for the first time since 1991 and the Gulf War. The
gain came after OPEC removed virtually all doubt it will extend its agreement on
lowered production for several more months. Frigid weather in the northeastern
United States also contributed to a sharp rise in crude as well as gasoline,
heating oil and natural gas futures. Crude climbed as high as $28.10 a barrel,
the highest since Jan. 16, 1991, before the Allied military strikes on Iraq that
brought about an end to the Gulf War.

	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Isaiah Rider scored 13 of his 24 points in the third
quarter, and his 15-foot jumper with 45 seconds left sealed the Atlanta Hawks'
89-83 victory over the Chicago Bulls on Friday night. The victory snapped a
seven-game road losing streak for the Hawks. They hadn't won on the road since
beating Toronto on Nov. 30. Jim Jackson added 18 points for Atlanta despite
sitting out all but eight minutes of the first half in foul trouble. Alan
Henderson was the only other Hawk in double figures with 14 points.
