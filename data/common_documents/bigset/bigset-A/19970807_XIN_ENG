<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy to Meet Taliban Leaders Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 6 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Special Envoy
Nobert Holl will hold talks on Thursday with the leaders of the
Afghan Islamic Taliban militia to continue his mediation mission
for peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be held in Kandahar, the stronghold of the
Taliban in southern Afghanistan, about 450 kilometers southwest of
Kabul.
Holl's visit will be his second to the war-torn country in just
three days.
</P>
<P>
Holl is expected to brief the Taliban about the outcome of his
latest talks with the anti-Taliban alliance led mainly by Uzbek
warlord Abdul Malik and Afghanistan's former military chief Ahmad
Masood.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Holl visited Mazar-e-Sharif, the base of the
anti-Taliban alliance some 300 kilometers northwest of Kabul, and
held talks with the leaders of the alliance on peace proposals
including the formation of a political commission and exchange of
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Malik ruled out the possibility of releasing
the prisoners of the Taliban militia before a negotiated
settlement of the Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
Malik, who had briefly sided with the Taliban by allowing them
into northern Afghanistan in May, detained some 1,000 Taliban men
when he broke rank with the militia and chased them out of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance has proposed to set up a joint
political commission to address issues including cease-fire and a
broad-based government.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia have been persistent in demanding the
release of their prisoners while advocating that the political
commission should be broad-based with representation from all
Afghan groups, not just the northern alliance.

<HEADLINE> Strong Pound to Push Industry into Recession, CBI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The strong pound has sent
Britain's export-dependent regions into deep gloom and threatens a
nationwide recession in manufacturing, the Confederation of
British industry (CBI) warned.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing orders stagnated or fell in five out of the UK's
11 regions in the four months to July, according to the CBI's
latest regional survey.
</P>
<P>
The hardest-hit region was Wales, which a year ago was leading
a manufacturing renaissance. Business assessment fell sharply on
the back of a steep drop in orders.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts warned that manufacturing is in danger of
tipping back into recession, after official figures showed that
output in the sector is basically flat.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported Tuesday a 0.1
percent fall in manufacturing production between the first and
second quarters of this year.
</P>
<P>
About half of all manufacturing sectors saw production fall in
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Production of cars fell by 3.1 percent between the first and
second quarters, leading to an overall decline of 1.1 percent in
durable goods output.
</P>
<P>
Output of non-durable goods output also fell by 1.1 percent,
with clothing, footwear and food all showing significant declines.
</P>
<P>
Marian Bell, treasury economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland,
said manufacturing was suffering from the "sterling effect" and
being hit by imports.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Loynes, of HSBC markets, said: "There must be a real
danger of a further fall in output in the next quarter, putting
manufacturing technically back into recession."

<HEADLINE> Egypt Tops World Computer Growth Ranking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's personal computer market
has grown at the world's fastest rate for the second year in a
row, according to a leading industry monitor and consultant.
</P>
<P>
New figures from the International Data Corp. (IDC) show that
Egypt saw shipment of nearly 84,000 units worth 150 million
U.S. dollars in 1996, registering growth rates of 43 percent and
49 percent in shipments and value respectively.
</P>
<P>
The nation's installed base reached 311,886 units in 1996, up
by 34 percent over the previous year, according to the figures
published by the latest issue of Business Monthly, the journal of
the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"The growth rate is phenomenal," says Abdel Aziz Ismail,
managing director of IDC Egypt. Momentum thus far has come from an
explosion in the individual and "SoHo" (small-office, home-office)
segments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Despite widespread skepticism about the sustainability of such
advances, the IDC is forecasting continued strong growth for the
near future.
</P>
<P>
The firm expects to see five-year average annual growth of 38
percent in shipments, 43 percent in value and 37 percent in
installation through the year 2000, at which point the firm
predicts the value of personal computers shipments for Egypt will
top 600 million dollars, an estimate it calls conservative.
</P>
<P>
By that time, the IDC said, Egypt will have installed more than
one million computers.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Egypt recorded shipment of just 24,000 units, and had
an installed based of just 100,000.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Asks EC to Re-probe into GSP Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will ask the European
Commission (EC) to send another delegation to Dhaka to
re-investigate the certificate cases under the General System of
Preference (GSP), according to official sources here.
</P>
<P>
The EC imposed some restrictions on Bangladesh's export of
ready-made garments late last year on a plea that thousands of
forged GSP certificates were issued to some exporters who did not
abide by the rules of origin.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been enjoying the GSP facilities in the European
Union countries since 1986 with duty-free entry without any quota
restrictions. But the products must be made of indigenous
materials to get the facilities.
</P>
<P>
The EC on Sunday said in a letter to Dhaka that it will accept
some derogation from the rules of origin in importing Bangladeshi
garment products only on condition of canceling the erroneous GSP
certificates issued between 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government, however, wants further
investigation into the matter, saying the grounds on which the EC
is demanding cancellation of some certificates are not convincing.
</P>
<P>
"Most exporters are the victims of misunderstanding," said an
official of the Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Tofail Ahmed will send the request letters,
which cite the social implications likely to be created following
the ban on the export of ready-made garments, to the EC for a
sympathetic consideration, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The main victims will be the female garment workers because
the ban will lead to closure of at least 100 garment units,"
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 270,000 million garment workers, about
130,000 female workers will lose jobs immediately, he added.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijian Oil, Gas Products Fall Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5.2 million tons of
oil and 3.5 billion cubic meters of natural gas were producted by
the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijian Republic (SOCAR) in the
first seven months of 1997. The gas's production represents a drop
of 3.3 percent compared with the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Wednesday from Baku,
Capital of Azerbaijan, since the start of the year, the country's
Caspian offshore fields have produced 4.3 million tons of oil
and 3.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas, meeting plan targets.
</P>
<P>
Deliveries of crude oil for refining totaled 5.1 million
tons, down 1.1 percent from the same period last year; for gas
the corresponding figure was 2.9 billion cubic meters, 7.8 percent
less.
</P>
<P>
Overall, SOCAR drilled 85,500 meters, 18.5 percent less than
planned but 12.8 percent more than in the same period last year.
In the January-July period it drilled 39,000 meters at offshore
sites and 46,500 on land.
</P>
<P>
It said that in 1996, Azerbaijan produced 9.1 million tons of
oil and 6.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Lowers Key Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank said
today it will further cut its overnight borrowing rate from 20 to
18 percent Thursday considering a gradually-stabilizing foreign
currency market.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth time for the Central Bank to cut its key
borrowing rate on one-day reverse repurchase papers (RRPs) since
July 11 when it allowed the effective depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
The RRPs are debt papers used by the Central Bank to mop up
excess money in the financial system. It is an agreement that the
Central Bank can borrow money from banks using its inventory of
government securities and buy them back at a premium sometime in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also decided to cut its overnight lending rate
from 25 to 22 percent effective Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank hiked its overnight borrowing rate to a
two-and-a-half-year high of 32 percent on July 10 in a bid to
repulse speculative attacks on the peso.
</P>
<P>
The country's commercial banks are expected to follow the
Central Bank to cut their hefty interest rates, which economists
warned would imperil sustained economic growth if kept unchanged
for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The weighted average exchange rate between the peso and the
U.S. dollar was pegged at 28.512 pesos to one dollar today at the
Philippine Dealing System (PDS), the electronic inter-bank
currency exchange system. The rate is much higher than its record
low of 29.45 registered on July 11 at the PDS.

TEHRAN, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati said here today that the Afghan issue should be
resolved through peaceful means, adding that Iran is ready to
cooperate with the neighboring states on the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Velayati made the remarks at the meeting with visiting
Pakistani Deputy Foreign Minister Iftikhar Morshed.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan crisis has become the bone of contention in
Tehran-Islamabad relations.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said the current situation in Afghanistan has
negative and adverse impact on the national security of the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister said Iran supports establishment
of a broad-based government of Afghanistan and resolving the
Afghan crisis through peaceful means which is possible in case of

</P>
<P>
Velayati was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying
"Iran is ready to cooperate with the neighboring states in this
respect."
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the Afghan issue should not have negative
impact on Tehran-Islamabad friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Morshed outlined his country's efforts to
encourage the Islamic militia Taliban in Afghanistan to sit at
the negotiating table to solve the plight of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Morshed, also Pakistani special representative for the Afghan
affairs, voiced at the meeting Islamabad's willingness to
cooperate with Tehran in order to bring closer the views of the
belligerent parties in Afghanistan and help resolve the Afghan
crisis.

KATHMANDU, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and Indonesia have been
selected as the sites for carrying out an experiment on integrated
management of childhood illness (IMCI), World Health Organization
(WHO) representative to Nepal Harry Feirmann said here today.
</P>
<P>
Feirmann made the remarks when addressing the 12-day
Inter-Country Training for Consultants of Integrated Management of
Childhood Illness, jointly organized by the WHO and the Nepali
Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
About 31 doctors from Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Bhutan,
Indonesia, Sweden and Ethiopia are participating in the training.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO estimates, more than 115,000 Nepalese children
die before their fifth birthday and 70 percent of them succumb to
diarrhea, pneumonia, malnutrition, malaria and measles.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Nepali Health Ministry Sriram Poudel said the
IMCI program would be helpful in improving the performance of the
health workers.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Health Minister Radha Krishna Mainali said one of the
major targets of the Nepali government is to reduce the infant
mortality rate from 79 to 50 per thousand and the under-age-five
mortality rate from 118 to 70 per thousand by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Reducing deaths caused by diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, malaria
and malnutrition is an essential part of this endeavor, he added.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Reconfirms General Election Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho government
today denied claims by opposition parties that the general
election date had been shifted from January to September next
year.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to hold this general elections by January,
particularly in that month because the day is long and it's warm.
This is done to avoid people standing in long queues in winter
months," acting Constitutional Affairs Minister Monyane Moleleki
said in Maseru, capital of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, the end of the five-year term of Lesotho's
National Assembly is June 3, 1998, and the constitution provides
that an election should be held within this term.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Malebo, spokesman for opposition parties, said earlier
that the newly established party, Lesotho Congress for Democracy
(LCD) headed by Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle was very much likely to
delay the election date.
</P>
<P>
As LCD needed enough time to set up its structures and prepare
for the election, "we believe that they want to stretch the
election date to September," Malebo said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mokhehle in June quit the ruling Basutoland
Congress Party and continued to rule through his new party, LCD.
Lesotho's opposition parties have strongly denounced Mokhehle's
action and demanded for early general elections to change the
situation.

<P>
MANILA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
insurgent leftist National Democratic Front (NDF) have made
significant progress in their stormy peace talks held in the Dutch
city of The Hague, local television reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the NDF and the government have reached an
agreement on the humanitarian law in the Philippines, Jose Sison,
consultant of the NDF peace panel, told the local Sky Cable
television by telephone from The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Sison said the two sides had solved their differences over
humanitarian law and human rights, adding that the signing of the
agreement paved the way for forging a final peace agreement
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But at his weekly press conference today, President Fidel Ramos
said he had not yet received an official report from the
government panel on the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, however, expressed optimism that the NDF and the
government will soon enter into negotiations for a final
settlement of the group's 28 years of insurgency in the country.
</P>
<P>
The NDF is a leftist alliance led by the Communist Party of the
Philippines, which was chaired by Sison. Sison exiled himself to
the Netherlands after military setbacks the NDF suffered in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
The NDF's military wing, the New People's Army, has fought the
government for about 28 years. The strength of the New People's
Army has been reduced to about 50,000-80,000 people after the
military launched massive operations against it in the 1980s.

ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish fighters today bombarded
the camps and bases of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
in northern Iraq, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the Turkish army had launched air raids
on five PKK camps which were recently set up in northern Iraq
and the PKK had suffered great losses during the air operation.
</P>
<P>
However, the agency did not give details of the PKK losses
following the air raids by the Turkish air force this morning.
</P>
<P>
The operation was the first reported use of air power against
PKK rebels since a cross-border offensive in northern Iraq was
launched to crack down on rebel bases there in May.
</P>
<P>
The agency also said that the Turkish security forces launched
attacks on Herekol and Kato mountainous areas in Hakkari
province near the Iraqi border.
</P>
<P>
More than 27,000 people, including PKK militants, civilians
and government troops, have been killed in conflicts since the
PKK started a separatist war for autonomy in eastern and
southeastern Turkey in August 1984.

</P>
<P>
With one lap to go, the three Kenyans broke away from the other
chasers and fought toughly for the gold. Kiptanui couldn't maintain
his fast tempo but Kipketer just changed to a higher gear on the home
straight for his first major win.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Host International Conference on Nazi Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The British government announced
here this afternoon that it would host an international conference
this December in an effort to resolve problems about millions of
dollars of gold seized by the Nazis during the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
today that the conference, which is expected to attract delegates
from 25 countries, would take place in London from 2 to 4 December
to look into the question of compensation for individual victims
of Nazi persecution.
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased to say that we and our U.S. and French partners
in the Tripartite Gold Commission have agreed that the
International Conference on Nazi Gold will take place in London,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"The (British) government shares the concern of the
international community about the origins and disposal of Nazi
gold," Cook said, adding "I hope that the London conference will
pool international knowledge and reach conclusions on this
important issue."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Tripartite Commission has always
maintained that all of the gold it is holding was looted from the
central banks of countries occupied by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
But Jewish groups have argued that between five and 10 percent
of the Nazi gold belonged to private individuals.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Northern Cyprus Sign Agreement on Partial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and northern Cyprus today
signed an agreement to establish a Partnership Council in a bid to
provide partial integration on security, defense and foreign
policy and full integration on economy and finance.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Nicosia by northern Cyprus
official Taner Etkin and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, who
paid a one-day working visit to the region, according to a report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktash described the agreement
as a "historical decision" and stressed the importance of the
agreement for northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Cem said that the establishment of the
Partnership Council was important and that they brought Turkey's
respect and guarantee before the second round direct talks
between Denktash and Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides in the
Swiss town of Montreux.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a joint statement issued after the talks between
Turkish and northern Cyprus officials said the European Union (EU)
Commission's recent decision about its membership expansion had a
negative effect on a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission announced last month that Cyprus was
included in the ranks of the prospective EU membership
candidates, triggering strong reaction from Turkey and northern
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that solution process should be based on
political equality of Turkish Cypriot side and equal sovereignty,
stressing that the balance, stemming from the 1960 agreement
signed between Turkey and Greece, should be preserved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a breakaway
state" the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which
has only been recognized by Turkey. At present, about 30,000
Turkish troops are stationed in northern part of the island to
safeguard the security of the Turkish Cypriots there.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash met last month at Troutbeck near New York
in the first round of direct talks sponsored by the U.N. for the
first time in nearly three years.

<HEADLINE> Tajik President: Situation in Afghanistan Treats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The worsening situation in
Afghanistan is posing a threat to Tajikistan's national security,
Tajik President Emomali Rakhamonov stated in Dushanbe on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Tajikistan's Capital Dushanbe, the
president expressed the anxiety about his country's security
during the talks with U.S. Senator Charles Robb, who is on a tour
of nine Caucasian and Central Asian states, including Pakistan and
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It said that the result of his tour will be used to work out
recommendations on the United States' cooperation with those
countries in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Tajik presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov quoted president
Rakhamonov as saying that the situation in Afghanistan is that
country's internal affair, but "we will be glad if the
reconciliation process in Afghanistan proceeds on the basis of the
Tajik scenario."
</P>
<P>
Rakhamonov noted that the scale of the illegal drug trade is
making a threat to Tajikistan's national security."It is a very
serious threat," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that international organizations and the
United States will help Dushanbe to combat the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
"We don't grow drugs legally and don't want to become a
trans-shipping point for international drug traders, who are making
use of instability in Afghanistan and our temporary problems in a
bid to attain their dirty goals," Rakhamonov emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Airport Strikers Refuse to Resume Work, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The crisis facing Kenya's air
transport industry got worsen as the air traffic controllers in
main airports ignored a governmental order to resume work and
went on their go-slow on the fifth day today.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior airport official told Xinhua that the
go-slow will wind up soon as discussions between the controllers
and the government have been underway.
</P>
<P>
"A comprise is coming soon," said the official who refused to
be identified. But the government will not meet the controllers
50-fold wage hike demand, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
"They (the controllers) are asking an enormous figure," he
said. The strikers asked the authorities to raise their monthly
pay from about 90 U.S. Dollars to around 5,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official also denied any relations between the on-going
go-slow and the national strike set for Friday, saying Kenyan
airport staff launch go-slow almost every year. The last one
lasted only a few days in December, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The government last night declared illegal the go-slow by air
traffic controllers and employees of the Meteorological
Department. Later, Labor Minister Philip Masinde directed the
employees to resume work immediately.
</P>
<P>
But the strikers said they will continue the go-slow and even
step up their action until their demands are met.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of flights continued to be canceled, delayed, re-routed
or rescheduled in the airports at capital Nairobi, the Indian
Ocean port city of Mombasa, Kisumu ashore Lake Victoria and the
tourist resort of Malindi, 125 kilometers north of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
The controllers, who gave the government a two-day ultimatum
to effect the salary increment on Monday, rejected resolutions
reached in a meeting between their managers and officials from
the Office of the President on the following day.
</P>
<P>
In view of the deteriorating situation, the national carrier,
Kenya Airways, was forced to cancel most of its international and
domestic flights.
</P>
<P>
Airport sources said flights due to land in Nairobi were being
diverted to neighboring airports in Tanzania and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Flights into Kenya were delayed in the skies for one to two
hours before they were allowed to land. Departing flights were
delayed for anywhere between three and 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
Tour operators, hotel managers and taxi drivers said they were
losing business as a result of the go-slow. Cargo and tourist
carriers are specially hard hit, with flowers for export stuck
with no chance of getting connections to their markets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The go-slow increased pressure on the government hit by the
International Monetary Fund on Thursday halting a 205-million-Dollar
aid package to Kenya.

ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece's annual inflation dropped
slightly from 5.5 percent in June to 5.4 percent in July, the

</P>
<P>
The consumer price index fell 1.9 percent in July, compared to
a 1.7 percent reduction in the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed the only slight fall in inflation mainly to
the vegetable prices which did not drop as much this year as in
1995, when they reduced by 20 percent.

ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hicham El Guerroui of Morocco hit the
front with 600 meters to go to win the men's 1,500 meters final with a
time of three minutes and 35.83 seconds at the 6th World Athletics
Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Fermin Cacho of Spain kicked over world record holder Noureddine
Morceli of Algeria on the final stretch to win the silver in 3:36.63.
Reyes Estevez, also from Spain, nipped Morceli at the line for the
bronze in 3:37.26. Morceli finished a disappointed fourth in 3:37.37.
</P>
<P>
Guerroui, world silver medallist who keeps the year's best of
3:29.30, followed the early rabbit after two laps. Morceli stayed at
the fifth and didn't make his move until the last 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
Guerroui changed gear at the bell with Morceli chasing second and
Cacho third.
</P>
<P>
Cacho, a little-known runner in the world, opened a big kick on the
final curve and caught up with Morceli to everyone's surprise. The
three times world champion Algerian had no strength left at the end,
nipped by Estevez at the line. It was Moceli's first major failure
in the important meets.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana said he is pleased with the evolution of Russian-NATO
relations following the signing of the Founding Act on mutual
relations this Spring, the Interfax reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Signing of the Founding Act was a landmark, Solana said, the
act calls for the setting up of a joint permanent council which
will serve as tool for consultations, coordination and, as far as
possible and needed, for joint decision and activities in security
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
According to Solana, the council has held its first meeting in
Brussels, and another meeting, at the level of foreign ministers,
will be held in New York in September during a U.N. General
assembly session, when Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov
representing Russia and Solana - NATO will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
NATO wants every field covered by the act discussed with
Russia, Solana said and hoped to early open a NATO information
office in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Moscow last Saturday with his wife, son and
daughter on a 10-day private visit at the invitation of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He said that the private visit offers him the opportunity to
establish informal personal relations with Russian leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering cutting the drink-drive limit as part of a range of
options to improve road safety, according to the Department of
Transport.
</P>
<P>
The current limit is 80 milligrams of alcohol per 100
milliliters of blood, allowing most people to drink about two pint
of beer. This can be cut by almost half to only 50 milligrams,
equivalent of just one pint of beer.
</P>
<P>
The cut, which could be implemented by Christmas, signals the
most drastic attack on drink-driving since the limit was
introduced in 1967.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Department of Transport said that Australia
and France were two of the countries the government was looking
at. Both have reduced their limit to 50 milligrams per 100
milliliters.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that an average of 540 people die each year in
Britain in drink-related accidents, and the government's move
follows an 18 percent increase in the number of drink-drivers
detected last Christmas.

LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- London, the UK capital, moved up
14 places to have become the 14th most expensive city in the
world, according to a latest cost-of-living survey of 150 cities
all over the world, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing the twice-yearly survey by the Corporate Resources Group
(CRG), a Geneva-based consultancy firm, press reports said that
the strength of the pound and high housing costs appear to be the
main reasons for London's high jump.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that despite the depreciation of the Japanese
yen, Tokyo remains the world's most expensive city.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and St Petersburg are the only two European cities in
the top 10, ranking the third and 10th respectively. The others
are all in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is second, Osaka fourth, and Beijing fifth, followed
by Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the dollar drove New York up the list from 38th
to 31st. However, it still ranks below such places as Paris,
Cairo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Hanoi, Tel Aviv and Kiev.
</P>
<P>
The survey uses a basket of more than 200 items, including
rents, food, clothing, beverages, household supplies and
equipment, leisure and entertainment, etc.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British European Minister
Doug Henderson today discussed with Greece's Foreign
Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their two-hour talks, Henderson
said that if the Cyprus issue had been resolved through a
negotiated settlement, Nicosia's accession path towards the
European Union (EU) would be much smoother.
</P>
<P>
In response, Kranidiotis said that the decision taken for the
commencement of negotiations for EU accession with the Cyprus
government six months after the inter-governmental conference must
be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that this did not mean efforts should not be
made in the meantime for a just and viable solution of the Cyprus

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriots to Exchange Visits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 600 Greek Cypriots will
visit the Monastery of Apostolos Andreas, patron saint of the
island at the Turkish-controlled northern part of Cyprus, on
August 15, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Presidential Commissioner for
Humanitarian Affairs Takis Christopoulos said that some 400
Turkish Cypriots will come to the southern government-controlled
areas to visit the village of Kokkina on the north-western
coast of the island.
</P>
<P>
Christopoulos said both sides will take necessary measures to
make sure that the visits take place without any problems.
</P>
<P>
He also said a second visit to the Monastery of Apostolos
Andreasfor, one of the most important religious pilgrimages in
the Greek Orthodox Church, could take place on Saint Andreas'
day, November 30.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press today, government spokesman Manolis
Christofides said the visits were agreed by Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash during
their recent meetings in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had two meetings in Nicosia last week, under
auspices of U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel, to discuss humanitarian issues and reached an agreement
on missing persons during the event of Turkish military
intervention in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said "things seem to be running smoothly so
far."
</P>
<P>
The announcement of exchange of visits is seen here as a
goodwill gesture expressed by the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides just a week before the second round of direct talks will
take place in Switzerland from August 11 to 16.
</P>
<P>
Last April, a trip to Apostolos Andreas had to be canceled
after the Turkish Cypriot side insisted on vetting the list of
persons wishing to visit the Monastery.
</P>
<P>
But some 450 Turkish Cypriots crossed to southern
government-controled areas in April for a pilgrimage to Hala
Sultan Tekke mosque in Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island following
a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The people from the two sides have been prohibited to cross
the U.N.-controlled buffer zone which separates the island into
two parts.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Maintain Trade Sanctions on Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will maintain
trade sanctions imposed on Burundi by its neighbors, which will
be lifted only when the military junta of Pierre Buyoya initiates
unconditional return to democracy in that country.
</P>
<P>
This was said today by a senior official from the Ministry for
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation here while
commenting on the words that Dar es Salaam has lifted the
sanctions on Burundi's cargo.
</P>
<P>
"No lift has been made by the government on those sanctions,
apart from the decision made by leaders of the Great Lakes region
to ease the trade sanctions," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Trade sanctions have been imposed on Burundi since July of
1996 by its neighboring countries after Buyoya took power in a
coup.
</P>
<P>
However, leaders of the Great Lakes region met in Arusha,
northern Tanzania this April and eased the sanctions to alleviate
the suffering of the vulnerable group -- women, children and the
elderly. Goods which qualify to cross to Burundi from Dar es
Salaam include fertilizers, medicines, farm implements and milk.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the Sanction Committee is expected to
meet soon to review the imposed trade sanctions on Burundi.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today issued a presidential statement, calling
upon the military junta in Sierra Leone to take immediate steps to
restore the democratically elected government of President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its deep concern about the situation in the country,
which endangered peace, security and stability in the whole
region, the Security Council condemned the overthrow of the
democratically elected government and underlined the need to
implement the Abidjan Agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed its appreciation to the
Committee of Four Foreign Ministers of the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS) for their efforts to negotiate with
the representatives of the military junta on a peaceful resolution
to the crisis and reiterated its support for the objectives of
this mediation.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also called upon the junta to renounce its
declared intention to remain in power and to resume negotiation
with ECOWAS Committee of Four Foreign Ministers without delay.
</P>
<P>
Urging the military junta to cease all interference with the
delivery of humanitarian assistance to the people of Sierra Leone,
the Council condemned the continuing violence and threats of
violence by the junta towards the civilian people, foreign
nationals and personnel of the ECOWAS monitoring group.
</P>
<P>
The Council also expressed its concern at the effects of the
continuing influx of refugees into neighboring countries due to
the crisis in the country. It called upon all states and relevant
international organizations to provide help to these countries in
dealing with the problem.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Central Bank to Intervene in Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
will intervene in the foreign exchange market whenever the need
arises, the CBK Governor Micah Cheserem said today.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here today, Cheserem said that the speed
at which the Kenyan Shilling was falling had caused great concern
following the decision by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
to halt an aid package to Kenya last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The statement stated, "The Shilling exchange rate to the
U.S. Dollar opened at a mean rate of 64 and rapidly depreciated
to a selling rate as low as 69."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that several importers were rushing to pay
their foreign bills in order to minimize exchange losses while
exporters were holding back Dollars in anticipation of further
Shilling losses.
</P>
<P>
Cheserem noted that foreign investors in government treasury
bills and stocks were in the market following the IMF move,
buying foreign exchange to repatriate their investments.
</P>
<P>
The combination of the above forces has caused the current
turbulence in the foreign exchange market, the CBK governor said.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to participants in the foreign exchange market to
be calm as "the government has already committed itself to managing
its expenditure within available resources".
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Shilling has depreciated by over 10 percent since
last Friday when the market received the news that the IMF
suspended the three-year Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
to Kenya, amounting to 215 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Palestinians Should Be Prepared for Big </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat today called on the Palestinian people to prepare
carefully for a big battle with Israel, believing that the
hardline Israeli government is bent on burying the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat issued the call in a statement released by the Palestine
News Agency Wafa in Gaza. He told the people to prepare themselves
and plan each stage of the forthcoming struggle.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Arafat appears to be growing more and more
disillusioned about the peace process as a result of the
intransigent policies of the rightwing Israeli government and
particularly the harsh security measures taken following the
double suicide bombings in Jewish west Jerusalem last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bombings killed 13 Israeli civilians and wounded
170 others.
</P>
<P>
The statement came amid reports in the Gaza Strip and West Bank
saying the strangling measures imposed by the Israeli government
are beginning to bite.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian laborers who worked in
Israel before the total closure, remain at home. Also causing
economic destruction is the internal closure, under which the
Israeli troops and a net of roadblocks have prevented the
Palestinians from traveling within the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
As the economic life in the major West Bank cities depend on
contacts with villages in the surrounding area, once the link is
cut off commercial activity is virtually at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
On top of this, the Israeli decision to withhold tax revenue
collected from the Palestinian workers, to the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), has caused the PNA to sustain a
critical shortage of funds.
</P>
<P>
Consequently tens of thousands of Palestinians employed by PNA
may not receive their salaries.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials and Arab leaders have sounded an alarming
bell that the Israeli hardline government is deliberately
undermining the position of Arafat and the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi accused Israel
of refusing to transfer 145 million U.S. dollars it owes to the
PNA. He observed that the Israel action is leading to an economic
and social earthquake in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned, this will also boomerang against
Israel.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Warns on Violation of Sanctions Against S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force known as ECOMOG today warned all ships and aircraft to keep
off Sierra Leone as its full sanctions against the troubled
country has begun.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG statement from Monrovia, the Liberian capital, said
any attempt of ships and planes to enter the territorial waters
and airspace of Sierra Leone will be regarded as violation of the
warning.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional force will take reprisal to any ship or
aircraft that challenge the blockade, according to the warning,
which was effective from today.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone,
the warning came after the reported arrival of ships with rice
and fuel in the troubled country over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG has taken actions to tighten economic embargo and
sanctions against Sierra Leone following the call of General Sani
Abacha, chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) and Nigerian head of state.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha announced "full scale embargo" on Sierra Leone
last Saturday after the collapse of talks between ECOWAS foreign
ministers and the junta's delegation in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire,
to seek ways for the junta to hand over power to the civilian
government toppled in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The junta's strong-man, Major Johnny Koroma, announced last
Thursday that the military would not step down until 2001, which
enraged ECOWAS and led to the collapse of the talks.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC broadcasting monitored here, the United
Nations Security Council today nodded specified sanctions against
Sierra Leona's coup leader Koroma, which diplomats said could
lead to arms and travel ban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leadership of Sierra Leone's Kamajours in
Monrovia said fighting between its militiamen and soldiers loyal
to Koroma was continuing at a town in southeastern Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The military regime has sent reinforcement of men and
artillery to the area six miles west of the Liberian border.

JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 traditional
leaders in Lesotho today called on the country's monarch, King
Letsie the Third, to summon his top advisers for political reason
as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
In a letter issued to the public, the chiefs said the King
should call the State Council to discuss the mounting political
crisis in the southern African kingdom, a report reaching here
from Maseru said.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho has been gripped by a political crisis since June 9
when Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle ditched his Basutoland Congress
Party and formed a new organization ruling the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's move has prompted debate on whether or
not it is in line with the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The State Council met late last month to discuss the formation
of an Independent Electoral Commission to prepare for the
forthcoming general elections set for early next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Hicham El Guerroui of Morocco hit the
front with 600 meters to go to win the men's 1,500 meters final with a
time of three minutes and 35.83 seconds at the 6th World Athletics
Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Fermin Cacho of Spain kicked over world record holder Noureddine
Morceli of Algeria on the final stretch to win the silver in 3:36.63.
Reyes Estevez, also from Spain, nipped Morceli at the line for the
bronze in 3:37.26. Morceli finished a disappointed fourth in 3:37.37.
</P>
<P>
Guerroui, world silver medallist who keeps the year's best of
3:29.30, followed the early rabbit after two laps. Morceli stayed at
the fifth and didn't make his move until the last 500 meters.
</P>
<P>
Guerroui changed gear at the bell with Morceli chasing second and
Cacho third.
</P>
<P>
Cacho, a little-known runner in the world, opened a big kick on the
final curve and caught up with Morceli to everyone's surprise. The
three times world champion Algerian had no strength left at the end,
nipped by Estevez at the line. It was Moceli's first major failure
in the important meets.
</P>
<P>
"It was a classic example of a sit and kick race, with anybody
having his chance. My surge was devastating and after it was just a
matter of controlling the race," said Guerrouj after his triumph.
</P>
<P>
Bronze medallist Estevez said:"It is a feam for me which became
even bigger by beating Morceli!"

ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya made a clean sweep in the men's
3,000-meter steeplechase final at the 6th World Athletics
Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Wilson Kipketer finished first in 8:05.84, ahead of Moses Kiptanui,
8:06.04, and Bernard Barmasai, also 8:06.04.
</P>
<P>
World record holder and defending champion Kiptanui led the pace
and passed the first 1,000 meters in 2:45.86, followed by Barmasai and
Saad Al Asmari of Saudi Arabia. Kipketer lured at rear comfortablely.
</P>
<P>
With one lap to go, the three Kenyans broke away from the other
chasers and fought toughly for the gold. Kiptanui couldn't maintain
his fast tempo but Kipketer just changed to a higher gear on the home
straight for his first major win.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer said after the final:"Tonight we surprised even ourselves.
Moses Kiptanui is still good, I respect him a great deal. This is the
first time I have run in the world championships and so I didn't
believe it would be me. The Kenyan team is unbeatable at this event."
</P>
<P>
Kiptanui said at the press conference:"To run with a slightly sore
throat isn't the best tactic for a final like this. Barmasai ran a
brave race, and I wasn't the most certain over the last hurdle."
</P>
<P>
Barmasai was just happy about the clean sweep, exclaiming:"What we
haved done today is fantastic!"

KAMPALA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A national immunization campaign
against cattle diseases of rinderpest and bovine pleuropneumonia
(CBPP) started today throughout Uganda, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
Kezimbira Muyingo, minister of state for agriculture, animal
husbandry and fisheries, was quoted as asking the public to

<P>
Only 100 shillings (about 10 U.S. Cents) will be charged for
each animal for two injections, and the vaccination campaign will
last two months, Muyingo noted.
</P>
<P>
Rinderpest is an infectious virus disease which affects cattle
and wild game like buffalos, while CBPP affects the lungs of the
animal. The two diseases are highly infectious killer diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's economy will grow 3.5
percent this year and 3.7 percent next year, Bank of Montreal
predicted today.
</P>
<P>
The economy is posting its strongest sustained growth of the
1990s and will continue to outperform in an environment of low
interest rates and low inflation, Canada's third largest bank said
in its mid-year economic review.
</P>
<P>
While exports will remain important, the domestic sector,
especially consumer spending, will be the dominant force in
Canada's economic performance, it noted.
</P>
<P>
At least 700,000 jobs will be created this year and next,
reducing the unemployment rate to an average of 8.7 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
While low interest rates will continue to provide stimulus to
interest-sensitive areas of the economy, short-term rates will
rise slightly, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The undervalued Canadian dollar will appreciate through the
rest of 1997 and 1998, even though it remains supportive of
Canadian exports, it added.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Former Warlord Promises Coop With New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Roosevelt Johnson, a key former
warlord in Liberia's civil war, today promised to cooperate with
President Charles Taylor in the country's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who fought Taylor bitterly only last year, was
appointed minister of rural development in the new cabinet of
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC, he said he will develop cordial
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
"I think we all realized that there is no need to continue
destroying the lives and property of this country. I expect to
have a very cordial relationship with Mr. Taylor," said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing that makes him respect Taylor is his
promise that all Liberians will have equal opportunities and
there will be no witch-hunting and revenge.
</P>
<P>
"I respect him for that and I hope we all live together to
improve the nation," he added.
</P>
<P>
As for his new appointment, Johnson said, "We are not
interested in the job. We are eager to serve the people."
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson, the job as minister of rural development
is a challenge one especially when the country was destroyed in
the seven years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to do something to prove to the people that
we are committed to the reconstruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Taylor named a 15-member cabinet last week. At least
three of his former rivals, including Johnson, are among the
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Although Taylor's government has been taking shape, many
observers are still watching how broad-based it will be.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A legal status for the Caspian Sea
coordinated with all of the Caspian states could simplify the
solution of many problems, including the utilization of the
Caspian mineral resources, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of problems around the Caspian Sea "are
caused by the absence of its legal status."
</P>
<P>
The Caspian theme is likely to figure prominently during talks
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Turkmen President
Saparmurat Niyazov in Moscow on August 7, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier, Turkmenistan expressed a resolute
protest against the production-sharing agreement on the Serdar
(Kyapaz) off-shore oil field, claimed by Turkmenistan, which was
signed by Russian oil companies LUKOIL and Rosneft, and the State
oil Company of the Azerbaijian Republic (SOCAR).
</P>
<P>
Niyazov told Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov in
Ashgabat at the end of July that his country would not conduct
talks on the status of the Caspian Sea until the Russian side
annulled the agreement on the development of this oil field
jointly with Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Ashgabat does not hold any grudges against
Moscow "except in relation to this misunderstanding."
</P>
<P>
The Russian side assured Turkmenistan that Russian government
was not informed of the drafted agreement on Kyapaz, and said that
the document had been signed by Russian companies, not by
representatives of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The managers of these Russian oil companies have stated that
they will not take any steps in the Caspian Sea without
consultations with the Russian Foreign Ministry, Nesterushkin
said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Aiding Ugandan Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sudan today denied press
reports that it is providing assistance to Ugandan opposition
forces, describing them as completely unfounded.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen, Minister of Information and Sudanese
government spokesman Al Tayeb Ibrahim Mohammed Khier said the
reports were made up within the framework of Uganda's relentless
escalation of hostility towards the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Khier pointed out that the Sudan was committed to the
agreements signed with Uganda to cease information campaigns and
to move towards a settlement of bilateral differences through
dialog.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese-Ugandan relations are undergoing a state of
tension whereby each is accusing the other of supporting their
respective opposition forces across their common borders.
</P>
<P>
Iran has endeavoured to mediate between the two parties, but
seemed to have failed in making progress.

<HEADLINE> Gebreselassie Retains Men's 10,000m World Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia
unleashed a devastating surge one lap from home to win the men's
10,000 meters world title at the 6th World Athletics Championships
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic and defending champion clocked 27 minutes 24.58
seconds, ahead of Paul Tergat of Kenya's 27:25.62 and Salah Hissou of
Morocco's 27:28.67.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie, who beat the 5,000m world record last month and
changed his mind in competing here, didn't plan to challenge his own
world record tonight. He just sat at second place and outkicked Tergat
easily for an expected win.
</P>
<P>
"This track has been a little better, not as hard as the one in
Atlanta. I am proud to have done a triple and I don't care anymore
about the world championships," the winner said after the race.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie had said that he wouldn't take part in the meet
because of the hard track. He beat the world 10,000 meters world
record last month.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian added:"If someone beats my world record I will start
to train again. I am not a person from another world, I am a human
being."
</P>
<P>
Tergat told the press:"I have the silver but it is never easy to
run in this sort of company. This is the first time for me at the
championships and so it is a great moment for me."
</P>
<P>
Hissou, Olympic bronze medal winner and the year's second fastest
time setter, promised at the press conference that he would attempt to
break the world record in Brussels on August 22.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Islamic Organization Raided by Turkish Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish police today raided
offices and buildings of a pro-Islamic organization throughout the
country in search for fundamentalism-related evidence.
</P>
<P>
The raid was reportedly carried out under an order of the
Ankara-based State Security Court.
</P>
<P>
Police searched the headquarters and branches of the National
Youth Foundation (MGV) which is well-known for its affinity with
the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP), according to Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Some videotapes recording speeches given by RP's former
outspoken parliamentary deputy Sevki Yilmaz were seized together
with a number of magazines in southern cities of Adana and Antalya.
</P>
<P>
In his speeches, Yilmaz attacked the eight-year compulsory
education reform bill proposed by the Education Ministry, which is
termed by the RP as a move directed against Islamic followers and
now is under a white hot debate in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The education reform bill has drawn strong opposition from the
RP and other conservative Islamists because of possible closure of
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
The police searched six MGV offices in the capital of Ankara,
but they declined to say if any criminal evidence had been found.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
and his administration are now tightening grip on some
organizations having close relations with pro-Islamic RP led by
former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military, which forced the June 18 resignation of the
Erbakan coalition government, and other secularists have always
been accusing the RP of conniving at the fundamentalist force in
the country.

ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Tomas Dvorak of Czech Republic won the
men's decathlon gold medal here tonight at the 6th World Athletics

His winning total was 8,837 points, ahead of Eduard Hamalainen of

favourite Chris Juffins of the United States pulled out of the battle
after the world leader this year fouled three times in javelin.
</P>
<P>
Dvorak, Olympic bronze medal winner, said after winning the tough
battle:"During the whole competition I was playing safe, never
experimenting, just looking to capitalize on my very focussed
preparation for the meet. Six personal bests in a decathlon like this
is quite an achievement."
</P>
<P>
Hamalainen said:"I had some problems with my hand but to achieve in
such a short time a second Finnish record is an extra thrill."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today announced the completion of a 48 million
U.S. dollar syndication for a 72 megawatt barge-mounted power
plant--"Doctor Bird" near Kingston, Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
The plant is Jamaica's first independent power project and has
facilitated the development of a private power market. The project
sells its output to the national utility, Jamaica Public Services
Company (JPS). Fuel is supplied under a 21-year agreement by
Petrojam Limited, another Jamaican company. The plant began
commercial operations in October 1995, alleviating energy
shortages caused by the loss of capacity from a June 1994
explosion of two generating units owned by JPS.
</P>
<P>
IFC's total financing package is some 72 million dollars, which
consists of a loan for its own account of 22 million dollars, an
equity investment of 2 million dollars and a syndicated loan of 48
million dollars. The co-underwriters of the syndicated loan are
Merita Bank of Finland and ING Bank of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
IFC is a member of the World Bank and also the largest
multilateral source of equity and loan financing for private
sector in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
To date, IFC has invested about 900 million dollars equivalent
in 16 power projects in Latin America and the Caribbean, including
about 400 million dollars for IFC's own account and approximately
500 million dollars for the account of participants.

PARIS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- France today appealed to the
Cambodian government to offer amnesty to its opponents, which it
said is essential for holding a "free and fair" general election
as is planned in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry, Yves Doutriaux,

Minister Norodom Ranariddh with Ung Huot, the country's foreign
minister.

But the spokesman stressed that "it is a constant practice to
recognize the states and not the governments."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the Cambodian government make
efforts to let next year's general election to be held "under
conditions of freedom and incontestable fairness."
</P>
<P>
"In respect of this, the free expression of the opposition is
essential and the measures allowing the return in all security of
the parliamentarians who left the country after the recent events
are necessary," said the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> European Shares up, London Hits New Milestone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe surged strongly and ended higher Wednesday, with London
hitting a new milestone, rising through the important 5,000-point
level.
</P>
<P>
Leading shares on the London market, Europe's largest, raced
ahead strongly today, with the FTSE 100 index storming to a new
record closing high, up 65.5 points at 5026.2.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that an unsettled opening on Wall Street failed to
dent London's enthusiasm, which was boosted by the pound's drop
and strong company results.
</P>
<P>
Sterling, which has kept on rallying recently, dropped four
pfennigs against the mark today and was also down to 1.60 US
dollars, a five-month low. This will benefit UK exporters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, traders believed that the chances of rates rising
Thursday had receded because of complaints from exporters badly
hit by the pound's strength.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt also made healthy gains although
activity was undermined by worries about a possible German
interest rate rise. The DAX-30 index ended up 32.71 points at
4,335.39, having shown little reaction to a larger than expected
rise in the July jobless total.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed 52.99 points higher at
3037.09, supported by strength in dollar stocks, notably oils, and
gains in financials.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Stresses Arab's Refusal of Unserious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri said here today that Arab countries will not agree to
hold "unserious" talks with Israel, and urged Washington to take
a "definite position" on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Hariri made the remarks when talking on an upcoming shuttle
mission in the region of Dennis Ross, the U.S. special envoy to
the Middle East peace process, the official Lebanon News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab leaders have concluded that it is a loss of time to
hold talks which are only aimed at talks and which are not
serious," the prime minister stressed in an interview with an
Egyptian television, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government should take a definite position on the
necessity to continue (its mediation) until the end of its efforts
which should be based on the previously announced principles," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hariri attributed the current stalemate in the Arab-Israeli
negotiations to the intransigent stance of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, saying that the Israeli government "does not
believe in peace."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese prime minister accused Netanyahu's government of
attempting to abolish all agreements which Israel had signed with
the Arab sides, and all outcomes of negotiations which had been
achieved, and trying to force the Palestinians to accept
everything imposed by Israel on them.
</P>
<P>
"The negotiations should be resumed from where they had
stopped," Hariri underlined, "Israel should withdraw from the
occupied Lebanese and Syrian lands and implement the agreements
which have been signed."
</P>
<P>
In another interview with Egypt's Middle East News Agency, the
Lebanese premier called for an Arab unity, noting that "the Arabs
can do a lot of things if they put their hands together."
</P>
<P>
"What we are now witnessing is because of a disintegration of
the Arab world from which Israel is benefiting," the Lebanese
leader said.
</P>
<P>
The interviews were made on the eve of a two-day official
visit to Lebanon by Egypt's Prime Minister Kamal Ahmed
El-Ganzouri.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that he will hold talks with Ganzouri, who will
arrive in Beirut Thursday morning heading the Egyptian delegation
to meetings of the Lebanese-Egyptian Highest Common Council, on
cooperation and coordination between the two countries in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
Hariri reiterated Lebanon's support for the establishment of
an Arab common market, which was blueprinted by Egypt, but noted
that before this goal is achieved big efforts should be exerted
in order to overcome the difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Chief Prosecutor Calls for Outlawing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief Prosecutor today
launched a new judicial initiative for the closure of the
pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) led by former prime minister
Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
In his 80-page document submitted to the Constitutional
Court, Vural Savas, chief prosecutor of Court of Appeals, called
on the supreme judicial body again to outlaw the RP.
</P>
<P>
Describing the RP as a center force to connive at
fundamentalists, Savas said that this was an important step for
saving Turkey's democracy and secularism.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey was facing a danger of the
resurrection of the rule of Shariah, or Islamic law, which would
challenge the country's secularist system.
</P>
<P>
The RP should hold responsibility for the rapid growth of the
fundamentalist force in the secular country, the chief prosecutor
added.
</P>
<P>
Savas filed his RP-closure case with the Constitutional Court
in May this year, triggering anger from the RP and its
followers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his RP parliamentary deputies Tuesday, Erbakan
threatened that he would call for judgement of the European
Court of Human Rights if his party is closed on grounds of
anti-secularism charge.
</P>
<P>
The RP had submitted a 215-page petition, containing its
preliminary defense, to the court, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to the legal procedure, the RP will have one month
to file its final defense with the Constitution Court. The party,
however, has reportedly applied for an extension of that period.
</P>
<P>
Once the RP prepares its final defense, the court will set a
date for both Savas and Erbakan to give their verbal statements.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military, with support of other secularist force,
forced the resignation of the Erbakan government on June 18.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and his RP have long been criticized for their
reluctance to take tough measures against the rapidly expanding
fundamentalists in the secular republic.

<HEADLINE> Greece Condemns Turkish-Northern Cyprus Pact on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece today strongly condemned an
agreement signed between Turkey and northern Cyprus which provides
for their partial integration.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
and northern Cyprus official Taner Etkin in Nicosia today, calls
for a Partnership Council to work towards the partial integration
on security, defense and foreign policy and full integration on
economy and finance.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that Turkey chose this particular moment to sign such
an agreement shows that despite its change in government it
insists in maintaining an internationally unique behavior towards
the world, disregarding laws and rules which it signs only to
transgress on them depending on its own interests," the Greek
Foreign Ministry said in a statement today.
</P>
<P>
The integration agreement came just a few days before the start
of a second round of U.N.-sponsored talks between Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to
resolve the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The statement concluded that Greece would defend Cyprus'
freedom in cooperation with the Cyprus government on the basis of
U.N. resolutions and international law.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened it will unite with northern Cyprus if the
Cyprus government begins membership talks with the European Union
(EU). The EU has invited Cyprus to begin accession talks early
next year.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro- Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, the Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a
breakaway state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", which
has only been recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 30,000 Turkish troops are stationed in
northern Cyprus to safeguard the security of the Turkish Cypriots
there.

<HEADLINE> UN Authorizes Mission in Central African Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
today authorized the member states taking part in the
Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the Bangui
Agreements (MISAB), and those states providing logistical support,
to ensure the security and freedom of movement of their personnel.
</P>
<P>
In resolution 1125 adopted unanimously today, the council
decided that the authorization is for an initial period of three
months. It was acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.
</P>
<P>
The MISAB was set up last January at the request of the Central
African Republic following some army rebellions. The mission of an
800-man force was deployed in Bangui on February 8.
</P>
<P>
At the Security Council meeting today, it had before it letters
from the presidents of the Central African Republic and of Gabon.
In the letter dated July 4, President Ange-Felix Patasse of the
Central African Republic requested for the Security Council to
provide a political and legal framework for the state members of
the Inter-African force by authorizing them to restore peace and
security in his country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the request is justified by the grave crisis in
his country stemming from the army rebellions, which left a large
supply of arms in the hands of former rebels and militiamen. He
persisted that tensions in his country could affect regional
stability and threaten international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
President Omar Bongo of Gabon also asked the council to
authorize the mission. The mission, under the political authority
of President Bongo, consists of troops from Burkina Faso, Chad,
Gabon, Mali Senegal and Togo while France will provide a
logistical command unit and financial support.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council asked the member states participating in
the MISAB to report to the UN secretary-general at least every two
weeks. After three months, the council will again assess the
situation on the basis of those reports.
</P>
<P>
Expressing welcome to the efforts of the member states
participating in the MISAB, the council approved the MISAB's
continued conduct of the operation in a neutral and impartial way
to facilitate the return to peace and security by monitoring
implementation of the Bangui Agreements. Those efforts include
supervising the surrender of arms by former mutineers, militias
and all others unlawfully bearing arms.

<P>
OTTAWA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- A team of Russian military experts
are in Canada this week to conduct a trial overflight under the
terms of the Open Skies Treaty, the Canadian government said
today.
</P>
<P>
The treaty between the countries of NATO and the former Warsaw
Pact allows the parties to conduct short-notice overflights of one
another's territory to collect information on military forces and
their deployment.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the treaty, Russia is entitled to photograph
anything it considers of military interest using only equipment
that cannot register objects of less than 30 cm across.
</P>
<P>
"This overflight is a new and encouraging dimension of the
ongoing cooperation between Canada and Russia in building
Euro-Atlantic security," said Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister
Lloyd Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"We hope this signals that Russia will soon complete its
ratification of this important confidence-building mechanism," he
added.

<P>
Before the Canadian trials, the Russian team held similar
flights over the United States.

UNITED NATIONS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. oil experts today
sent Iraq's new pricing plan to the Security Council sanctions
committee, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. overseers have submitted to the committee the new oil
pricing formula which they received from Iraq and which will
govern the sale of Iraqi oil," said the spokesman.
</P>

"The Security Council sanctions committee has 48 hours to
examine the formula. If there are no objections by 11 a.m. EDT
(1500 GMT) Friday, the prices become valid," he said.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program allows Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and
other goods for its people to ease the effects of U.N. sanctions
imposed seven years ago when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.
</P>

An oil-for-food plan went into effect last December and was
renewed for another six months on June 8.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Vows to Fight Financial Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)
and the police have expressed concern over the activities of
advance fee frauds in the country and vowed to expose the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Alhaji Mahe
Rasheed, CBN's director of foreign operations, said that owing to
the unscrupulous activities of the frauds, CBN had been exposed
in 30 fraud cases all over the world.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the frauds operated by shady transfer of
funds through over-invoicing, selling crude oil below market
prices and posing as government officials while abroad.
</P>
<P>
The frauds solicited foreign businessmen through telex, forged
official-looking documents, companies' letter-heads and invoices.
</P>
<P>
They often used names and photographs of the CBN governor and
other top executives to support their false claims.
</P>
<P>
The CBN has been sending some of its staves to courts overseas
to defend its name in some of the cases.
</P>
<P>
Although some of the cases have been decided in favor of CBN,
the advance fee fraud, widely known as a total of 419 activities,
has seriously damaged the country's image abroad, said Victor
Moore, head of the legal unit of CBN.
</P>
<P>
The figure "419 is a cancer-like disease that continues to
grow at an alarming proportion and poses a veritable source of
embarrassment to the Nigerian business community," said Rasheed.
</P>
<P>
An average of 1,000 forged letters were seized annually by CBN
with the aid of the Nigerian postal service, he added.
</P>
<P>
To curb the fraud activities, Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha has appointed a special adviser on narcotics and
advance fee fraud, while the police set up a special fraud unit.
</P>
<P>
The government has also established a money laundering
surveillance unit and enacted a decree on advance fee fraud and
control.
</P>
<P>
In her address, Victoria Waziri, commissioner of police for
special fraud unit, disclosed that 25 advance fee fraud cases are
currently being handled by the miscellaneous offenses tribunal
with 80 persons standing trial.
</P>
<P>
Another 30 cases involving 100 suspects are before the
magistrate courts in Lagos, while five more cases are pending at
the Lagos High Court, she said.
</P>
<P>
Although the individuals involved in such cases are very rich
and influential, the police is determined to combat the crime,
she noted, adding that the cases of 419 have reduced
considerably.

<HEADLINE> US President Announces Smaller Deficit Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that the U.S. federal deficit in fiscal 1997 could be
as low as 37 billion dollars, smaller than expected and the lowest
in 23 years.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton announced the latest forecast on the federal
deficit figures from his Office of Management and Budget at an
outdoor White House news conference. The current fiscal year will
end on September 30.
</P>
<P>
The new deficit projection for fiscal 1997 would be the lowest
federal deficit since 1974, when the government shortfall was 6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He also asserted that not only would the budget be balanced in
five year, but there would be a surplus of 20 billion dollars in
2002.
</P>
<P>
"These past months have been a remarkably fruitful time for
bipartisan actions in the national interest," Clinton said a day
after he signed bills to balance the federal budget in five years
and to provide the biggest tax cut since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. federal deficit was as high as 290 billion dollars in
1992 and the deficit has been cut by a great margin in he past
four years after President Clinton took office in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Gebreselassie and Sotomayor Chalk up Big Wins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 6 (Xinhua) -- World record holders Haile
Gebreselassie of Ethiopia and Javier Sotomayor of Cuba claimed big
wins while Kenya's Moses Kipketer and Algeria's Noureddine Morceli
tarnished their names at the 6th World Athletics Championships here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States still lead the medal table with three golds,
three silvers and four bronzes, followed by Kenya, 2-2-1, and Germany,
2-0-2.
</P>
<P>
The day's other three golds were snatched by Hicham El Guerrouj of
Morocco in the men's 1,500m, Wilson Kipketer of Kenya in the men's
3,000m steeplechase and Tomas Dvorak of Czech Republic in the men's
decathlon.
</P>
<P>
Gebreselassie, defending champion and Olympic winner who improved
his own world record in the 25-lap event last month, played a
sit-and-kick game in the 10,000m final to win the world title three
times in a row in 27.24.58, yet well outside his world record.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian, who didn't want to compete in the meet because of
the hard track and joined in the force at the last minute, opened a
devastating kick 500 meters from home for an easy victory. Paul
Tergat of Kenya upset Olympic bronze medal winner Salah Hissou of
Morocco for the silver in 27:25.62.
</P>
<P>
"This track has been a little better, not as hard as the one in
Atlanta. If someone beats my world record, I will take it back. I
don't care anymore about the world championships," said a comfident
Gebreselassie.
</P>
<P>
Sotomayor, who was narrowly beaten into second place at the
previous meet, dominated the high jump final completely, leaping over
a year's best of 2.37 meters, but gave up the tries after failing one
time at 2.41m.
</P>
<P>
Artur Partyka of Poland and Timothy Forsyth of Australia wound up
second and third, both at 2.35m.
</P>
<P>
The biggest upset today came in the men's 1,500 meters final, which
saw world record holder Morceli cruise home without a medal.
</P>
<P>
Guerrouj, silver medallist in 1995, kicked brilliantly to win the
title in 3:35.83, ahead of Spain's Fermin Cacho and Reyes Estevez,
both little-known in the world before the race.
</P>
<P>
"It was a classic example of a stay and kick race, with anybody
having his chance. My surge was fast and after it was just a matter of
controlling the pace, " said Guerrouj after his triumph.
</P>
<P>
Three Kenyans brought the packed crowd to their feet when Kipketer,
 Kiptanui and Bernard Barmasai made a clean sweep of the medals
in the men's 3,000m steeplechase final.
</P>
<P>
Kipketer burned up world record holder and three times world
champion Kiptanui on the home straight for a 8:05.84 win. Kiptanui,
who had planned to shatter the world record at the meet, led most of
the way but couldn't fend off the killing speed of Kipketer near the
finish. He was almost nipped by Barmasai at the line. They both
clocked 8:06.04.
</P>
<P>
"Tonight we surprised even ourselves. Kiptanui is still good, I
respect him a great deal. This is the first time I have run in the
championships and so I didn't believe it would won by me. The Kenyan
team is unbeatable at this event," exclaimed Kipketer.
</P>
<P>
The multi-event decathlon was won by Dvorak with a total of 8,837
points. Eduard Hamalainen of Finland collected 8,730 for the silver
ahead of Frank Busemann of Germany, 8,652. The hot favourite and the
world leader this year Chris Juffins of the United States had to pull
out of the battle after chalking up no marks in the ninth event -
javelin.
</P>
<P>
Dvorak, Olympic bronze medallist who improved his personal bests in
six events during the two-day fight, said:"During the whole
competition I was playing safe, never experimenting, just looking to
capitalize on my very focussed preparation for the meet. Six personal
bests in a decathlon like this is quite an achievement."
</P>
<P>
The day also saw Patrick Konchellah of Kenya, the third best in the
world this year, lost one of his shoe in the men's 800 meters heat.
The unlucky man said:"Losing my shoe right on the bell meant to run
without balance. Please find my shoe. I have got another pair but the
set I am running in today is the fastest."
</P>
<P>
So far after five days of competition, a total of 11 world
champions and Atlanta Olympic winners have either slumped out in the
qualifications or finished without a medal. Many new faces stormed
right at the occasion to achieve victories.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's biggest city
Johannesburg, also the industrial, economic and financial center,
has been rated out of the 145 countries worldwide as the cheapest
big city to live in, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a twice-a-year survey by the Swiss-based
Corporate Resources Group, Johannesburg is the world's cheapest
big city with reference to the cost of a basket of more than 200
products and services including housing, food and alcohol,
utilities, clothing, transport and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
The survey, widely believed to be a snapshot of the relative
cost of living around the world, said Asia had taken up the
world's 10 most expensive cities, including China's Hong Kong,
Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo of Japan.
</P>
<P>
It said Moscow of Russia kept its place as Europe's most
expensive city for the second year running, while the cities of
North America were rated among the most affordable to live.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Africa, the survey said Cairo of Egypt ranked as
the most expensive city in the continent, followed by Brazzaville
of Congo and Libreville of Gabon, while Harare of Zimbabwe was
Africa's second cheapest city after Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
However, Africa's highest climber in rating was Nairobi of
Kenya, which leapt 40 places from last year's survey to rank 75th
on this year's list.

<HEADLINE> EU Forecasts Rise in Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Some two million new jobs will
be created in the European Union over the next two years as
economic growth picks up, the European Commission forecast today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest issue of The European Economy available today,
the executive body of the European Union (EU) forecast an EU-wide
growth rate of 2.4 percent this year as against 1.6 percent for
1996, driven mainly by export growth. The growth forecast for
1998 remains unchanged at 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Growth will also be helped by reduced inflation. Despite the
fact that 5.6 percent inflation in Greece pushed the EU's annual
inflation rate up slightly in June, average inflation is expected
to fall to 2.2 percent this year and to stay at that level for
1998.
</P>
<P>
The average deficit-to-GDP ratio in the EU is also expected to
fall from 4.3 percent in 1996 to 2.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Only two countries are forecast to have a ratio higher than the
3 percent limit set as a criteria for joining Economic and
Monetary Union in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
Among the other critera is a 60 percent debt to GDP ratio.

criteria, the European Economy reported.

<HEADLINE> UN Climate Conference on Emissions Ends in Bonn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The week-long United Nations climate
conference on a new greenhouse gas emission accord concluded here
today, failing to agree on new targets and timetables for
emissions reduction by developed countries after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the seventh round of talks on new commitments by
developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gases after 2000.
Again, the rich nations shied away from any commitment.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan were largely blamed for the lack of
progress at the meeting, said conference sources. Neither of them
proposed anything, and the U.S. delegation said it would do the
same at the next negotiating session here scheduled for 20-31
October.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans are calling for reducing key greenhouse gases by
at least 7.5 percent from their 1990 levels by 2005. Earlier, some
rich countries had proposed a 15 percent reduction of emissions
from 1990 levels by 2010.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the conference today said that the
over 600 delegates from 145 nations were diverted from the central
question of precise targets and timetables during working on the
draft text of the new agreement under the UN Climate Change
Convention.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, it quoted Ambassador Raul Estrada-Oyuela of
Argentina, the Chairman of the Ad hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate
(AGBM), as saying that various options were fully articulated and
clarified at the meeting, ready for governments to choose at the
October session.
</P>
<P>
Michael Zammit Cutajar, the Convention's Executive Secretary,
voiced concern in the press release about the slow progress at
this meeting. There is only a short time left to build necessary
political will for producing an effective agreement in Kyoto, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement is due to be finalized at the Kyoto
conference scheduled for 1-10 December.
</P>
<P>
The AGBM was established to negotiate new commitments by
developed countries to reduce emissions after 2000 and to promote
the implementation of existing commitments by both developed and
developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Major Events Since Last Party National Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua New Agency today released
the first part of a retrospective article by the CPC Central
Committee Party Literature Research Center covering the major
events which have taken place since the Party's 14th National
Congress in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
In accompanying editor's notes, Xinhua says that Deng
Xiaoping's tour of south China and the Party's 14th National
Congress propelled the nation into a new historical period of
reform, opening and modernization.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China has maintained social stability
by holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhering to all
aspects of the Party's basic line, balancing relations between the
reform, development and stability, and accelerating development.
</P>
<P>
This has in turn enabled the nation to record tremendous
achievements in economic growth, the enhancement of ethical and
cultural progress, national defense, science and technology, as
well as in promotion of democracy and the introduction of a legal
system, national reunification and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China has risen to a great new height in terms of social
productivity, comprehensive national strength and people's living
standards," according to the editor's notes. "Facts prove the
correctness of the Party's line adopted during the 14th National
Congress."
</P>
<P>
The notes stressed the necessity for reviewing the glorious
historical process since the the 14th Congress in order to ensure
that all Party members join people of all ethnic groups in working
harder to score even greater achievements to greet the
convocation of the forthcoming 15th Party's National Congress.

<HEADLINE> Last Body Removed From Australia Landslide Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia's ski resort Thredbo
breathed a sign of sadness and relief today after the last body
was retrieved from the site of the landslide that devastated
Thredbo a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, rescue workers pulled the 18th body from
the ruins, accounting for all those believed to be sleeping in the
two lodges crushed in the disaster. The tiny ski resort is 150 km
southeast of Canberra, capital of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen people died in the tragedy. The only survivor was ski
instructor Stuart Diver, whose wife Sally today was formally named
among the dead.
</P>
<P>
"I think the feeling that you pick up around the village is
just one of relief that it is finally over," Thredbo Alpine
Village Managing Director David Osborn told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The massive rescue operation, which involved thousands of
police, ambulances, fire brigades and mines rescue staff and State
Emergency Service volunteers, was being scaled down today as snow
clouds loomed.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether rescue workers had regrets about the
initial delay in the search of victims, Charlie Sanderson, the
police officer in charge of the rescue, said he and other rescue
workers had no regrets about the delay.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims were heard calling for help from beneath
the rubble just after the landslide late last Wednesday night, the
Australian Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
But locals and tourists from neighboring lodges were forcibly
restrained from rescue attempts for fear of triggering more
landslides and killing any survivors, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"At this point in time, there is no significant matter that I
can tell you that we would do differently," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The rescue on Saturday of Stuart Diver, suffering only minor
cuts and frostbite after 65 hours pinned between concrete slabs,
was a proof that the rescuers had taken the right approach,
Sanderson said.
</P>
<P>
The ski resort seems to have recovered from the week-long shock
as business in the village is starting to pick up, with numbers of
people skiing on Monday back to the same level as the day before
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
David Osborn said 2,500 people were on the slopes on Monday and
yesterday the number climbed to 3,000.
</P>
<P>
"People are ringing up, making bookings for later in the
season," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ski resort of around 300 people plans to turn the massive
landslide scar on the mountainside into a park with a memorial to
the 18 dead.
</P>
<P>
Snow clouds gathering over Thredbo lifted hopes of further
snowfalls to lure skiers back to the slopes.

<HEADLINE> King Sihanouk Agrees to Appoint New First PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk today agreed to acting head of state Chea Sim signing a
decree appointing Foreign Minister Ung Huot as first prime
minister to replace Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Chea Sim, Sihanouk said, "I wish to express my
deepest thanks and wish to inform you about the request for a
decree to appoint a new first prime minister. If Your Excellency
thinks that it should be done, you can sign the decree."
</P>
<P>
Under Cambodian law, the appointment of a new first prime
minister would be illegal without a formal decree by the head of
state or his deputy.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said last month that he would not recognize Ung Huot,
who was nominated by Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party as his
replacement, as first prime minister because an election carried
out by an incomplete parliament would be illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot, who was supported by 86 of the 99 legislators present
in the National Assembly Wednesday to succeed Ranariddh, said this
afternoon that he, along with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and
Chea Sim, would meet the king soon.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot, insisting his appointment was democratic and
credible, said the three-man group would seek the king's
support for the new government.

<HEADLINE> Australian Government to Monitor Hanson's Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The federal government was
determined to see controversial Independent MP Pauline Hanson "off
the stage," Acting Prime Minister Tim Fischer said today.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the establishment of a special unit in the Foreign
Affairs and Trade Department to deal with Hanson's impact in Asia
was part of a wider response.
</P>
<P>
"It reflects a government getting on with the job of seeing
Hanson off the stage," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said that a small cross-divisional unit has
been established to monitor Hanson's impact in Asia and seek
opportunities to push the government's message that her views on
race are not typical of Australians.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that Australia enjoyed good relations with Asian
countries and the unit was part of "internal changes in government
to further fine tune the effort to deal with those elements who
would sabotage, divide and destroy these trading relations."
</P>
<P>
Bruce Baird, managing director of the Tourism Council of
Australia, said positive images of Australia, particularly in
Asia, were essential to the nation's continued growth.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is hard to quantify the effects that Hanson has
had on the tourism industry, recent figures show a decline in
growth in the number of Asian visitors to Australia," He said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Growth in visitors from Asia had fallen from 16 percent in the
1995-96 financial year to 5 percent in the 1996-97 financial year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is a fastest-growing industry in Australia and earned
more than 53 billion Australian dollars (40 billion U.S. dollars)
each year for the country, while the main source of visitors is
coming from Asia.
</P>
<P>
Hanson hit the headlines with her maiden speech to parliament
last September when she called for a halt to all immigration to
prevent Australia from being "swamped by Asians."

<HEADLINE> EU Suspends WTO Action Against US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today
suspended its complaint against the United States at the World
Trade Organization after the U.S. agreed to change its rules on
textile imports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration formerly classified the origin of
finished textile products according to the source of the raw
materials. So, Italian scarves, German furnishings and British
cotton goods were classified as "Made in India" or "Made in China."
</P>
<P>
But the European Commission challenged these rules at the WTO
under a new instrument known as Trade Barriers Regulation, which
has been designed to improve market access for exporters.
</P>
<P>
The EC claimed the U.S. rules harmed top European designers and
manufacturers by undermining quality European labels as a selling
point among American consumers.
</P>
<P>
The EC also complained these products would come under quota
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
But after the U.S. agreed to modify the rules and guaranteed
that European exports would not be affected, the EC dropped the
complaint.

JAKARTA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- In the year 2020, ASEAN will
gradually be consolidating and benefiting from the various
economic cooperation schemes launched two decades earlier,
president of ASEAN Chambers of Commerce and Industry (CCI)
Aburizal Bakrie said here today.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's economies will continue to grow in the next millennium,
although at a slower rate, with most member countries enjoying a
reasonable standard of living, Bakrie said at the press launch of
the "Private Sector Salute to ASEAN," which was organized by the
CCI.
</P>
<P>
He also said it is time for ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) to formulate an economic vision which will position
ASEAN well into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN should build upon the prevailing peace in the region and
its expanded membership to enhance its global competitiveness so
that it will be able to compete successfully in a world of free
trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat of ASEAN and the CCI today also announced a
series of activities by the public sector to celebrate the 30th
anniversary of ASEAN's founding.
</P>
<P>
A private sector salute to ASEAN's anniversary will be held on
December 14-16 this year in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as a major
event in conjunction with an informal summit of ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia was
supposed to join the grouping, but its entry was delayed due to
the political turmoil in the country.

SEOUL, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's 200-nautical-mile
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) went into force today, the Ministry
of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries said.
</P>
<P>
From today, the South Korean government will exercise its right
over resources and control foreign fishing operations in the zone,
the ministry said.

<P>
To protect its fishery resources and for safety, the government
also decided to delimit designated areas inside its territorial
waters, in which foreign vessels will be forbidden to conduct
fishing operations.
</P>
<P>
However, in a bid to publicize the new law, foreign fishing
vessels will still be permitted to enter its EEZ waters until
November 7, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese fishing vessels will be dealt with under the existing
South Korea-Japan Fisheries Agreement, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
In view of the talks between South Korea and China over a
fisheries agreement, Chinese fishing boats will be exempt from the
law until August 7, 1998, the ministry added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Two aviation companies singed
an agreement with the Hong Kong Airport Authority (AA) here today
to construct a new office building at the new airport now under
construction at Chek Lap Lok, a reclaimed island west of Hong Kong
Island.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, China National Aviation Corporation
(Group) Limited (CNAC) and Hong Kong Dragon Airlines Limited
(Dragonair) will work together to build a complex with two
six-story office towers, involving a total investment of 1.4
billion HK dollars (180 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Scheduled to be completed in December, 1999, the building will
serve as a new headquarters and training facility for Dragonair
and offices for CNAC. The two firms will own the twin office
towers separately and share a common atrium, car park and
recreational facilities under the same roof.
</P>
<P>
AA's vice chairman Lo Chung-hing said at the signing ceremony
today: "This (the partnership) shows that all parties involved
recognize the importance of the new airport."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xian Lin, vice president of CNAC Group echoed Lo's
remarks, saying that: "Our investment in the building demonstrates
our confidence in Hong Kong's new airport as well as in the future
of Hong Kong's aviation industry."
</P>
<P>
He added that CNAC Group had already invested in aircraft
maintenance, air cargo terminal, fuel, flight kitchen and ground
handling services at the new airport.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the new headquarters at Chek Lop Kok,
Dragonair, a regional airline based in Hong Kong, will for the
first time put all its operations ranging from pilot training to
management under one roof.
</P>
<P>
CNAC Group purchased around a 36 percent stake of Dragonair in
April, 1996 to become the largest shareholder of the airline,
whose Airbus fleet of 12 craft now flies to 25 destinations in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Chek Lap Kok new airport, one of the largest infrastructure
projects in the world, is slated to open its first runway in April
1998.

</P>
<P>
Sihanouk said last month that he would not recognize Ung Huot,
who was nominated by Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party as his
replacement, as first prime minister because an election
carried out by an incomplete parliament would be illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot, who was supported by 86 of the 99 legislators present
in the National Assembly Wednesday to succeed Ranariddh, said this
afternoon that he, along with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and
Chea Sim, would meet the king soon.
</P>
<P>
Ung Huot, insisting his appointment was democratic and
credible, said the three-man group would seek the king's
support for the new government.

MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian customs officers today
uncovered 106,000 U.S. dollars in undeclared currency aboard the
Professor Vize motor ship bound for Turkey, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The customs bureau said it suspected the ship was involved in
currency smuggling as the owner of the money was not on board.
</P>
<P>
Currency smuggling is rife in Russia. An Azeri citizen was
found trying to smuggle 13,200 dollars out of Sheremetyevo airport

<HEADLINE> Macao Governor Urges Security Officers to Work Harder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira
has urged security officers and prosecutors to work harder to
maintain good security in the territory, the Macao Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The governor told the head of security forces and the chief
procurator that he was dissatisfied with their work and that they
should work more efficiently following a recent wave of
triad-related violence in the territory, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He urged them to eradicate "corrupt elements" in the forces and
improve procuratorial work so as to make a breakthrough in the
fight against crimes.
</P>
<P>
The report said the governor made these remarks on Tuesday
while meeting a group of representatives of the Macao Association
of Neighborhood Committee, one of the largest non-governmental
grassroots organizations in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The representatives expressed their concern at a sluggish
economy and a worsening security situation, saying it is the wish
of all residents that the government take effective measures to
boost economic growth and maintain a good social order.
</P>
<P>
The governor said he fully understood their concern and that he
 pays as much attention to the problems as they do. He stressed
that Macao's economy grew in 1997 although it is vulnerable to
outside factors.
</P>
<P>
"The government is determined and also capable of boosting the
economy and maintaining security," he was quoted as saying. "All
residents should have confidence in the security forces and the
judiciary organs, and support their work."
</P>
<P>
Triad-related crimes over the past several months have marred
Macao's reputation, which in turn has hurt its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Following a two-year-long slowdown, Macao's economy has showed
signs of recovery since late last year. But it is believed to have
suffered a blow after tourist arrivals have dropped sharply in the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and gambling income contribute to about half of the
revenue of the territory, which has an area of some 21 square
kilometers and a population of 420,000.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pledges to Help Mediate Abkhazia Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States will help
mediate in the conflict between Georgia and the breakaway region
of Abkhazia, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman, John Shalikashvili, said in Tblisi today.
</P>
<P>
The United States supports the peaceful restoration of
Georgia's territorial integrity, the Interfax news agency quoted
the general as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russia also plays an important role in mediating the conflict,
Shalikashvili told reporters at the airport after a three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
Abkhazia, a rich Black Sea province, declared independence from
Georgia in July, 1992. Fighting began the following month when
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze sent troops into the region.
</P>
<P>
Separatists drove out the Georgian army in 1994 and agreed on a
ceasefire. Russian peacekeepers were deployed to prevent renewed
fighting between the two sides. But in spite of negotiations,
Abkhazia and Georgia have yet to find a formula to settle the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the Russian peacekeepers expired on July 31 this
year, but troops will stay on until a decision on their future is
taken at a summit of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent
States in the fall.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations has decided to extend its unarmed
observer force in Georgia until January 31.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the U.S. general held talks with President
Shevardnadze and Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibaidze on military
cooperation between the two countries. Shalikashvili said the
U.S. will offer help in training Georgian military personnel.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Jordan Coordinate Stances on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Jordan today called for
immediate actions to alleviate the escalating tensions between the
Palestinians and Israelis and salvage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh and his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa made the appeal at a joint press conference
following an enlarged Egyptian-Jordanian session of talks in
Egypt's northern port city of Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh was accompanying Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan to
have arrived in the Mediterranean city earlier today for a
few-hour visit to Egypt following their talks with Israeli leaders
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Hassan conveyed a message from King Hussein of
Jordan to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged information about their recent contacts
with the Israeli government and the Palestinian National
Authority. Moussa said Tarawnh and he share the view that the
current situation is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
He urged Israel to lift its sanctions against the Palestinian
people following last week's double suicide bombings in Jewish
west Jerusalem which killed 13 Israelis and wounded 170 others.
</P>
<P>
"Theoretically or practically, the Israeli collective
punishment of the Palestinians are unacceptable," Moussa said,
adding that these measures would only aggravate the conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept violence against innocent people, just as we
cannot accept the embargo against the Palestinian people," Moussa
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh noted that the grudges between the Palestinians and
Israelis go beyond the security issue. "They seriously differ over
the some political issues that have a direct bearing on the peace
talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
To deter the situation from going out of control,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's announced visit to
the Mideast by the end of this month would be most welcome, said
the Jordanian foregin minister.
</P>
<P>
Albright, when announcing earlier she would visit the Mideast
at the end of August, criticized activities that could aggravate
misunderstandings, without naming Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan are reportedly working with the U.S. to
formulate an initiative which might be the basis for the
resumption of the stalled peace talks ahead of a visit by
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to the region on the weekend
to defuse growing tension.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked since
Israel began the construction of a Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
After Israel decided to stop the plan of building another new
Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem, the two sides agreed to return
to the negotiating table on July 28.
</P>
<P>
But two days later, Israel immediately announced that it will
not resume the peace talks with the Palestinians after the deadly
Jerusalem double suicide bombings.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Unemployment Rises In July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Official figures released today
underlined continued weak jobs growth in Australia with the number
of unemployed people climbing in July.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said the official
unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percent to 8.7 in July compared to
8.5 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Financial market participants watched today's data carefully
for signs of weakness to hint at whether the Reserve Bank would
consider cutting interest rates further to speed up economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Employment Minister Amanda Vanstone said in a statement that
"The (jobs) outlook for coming months is positive, however, with
the effects of the most recent interest rates cut yet to be felt".
</P>
<P>
"The economic fundamentals for sustained growth are extremely
positive, inflation is fully under control, the budget balance is
being restored and business investment is growing strongly," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
earlier this week, Treasurer Peter Costello also said
unemployment would fall to around eight percent by the end of the
current financial year ending June next year.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Refuses to Comment on Ung Huot's Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is withholding
comment on the latest developments in Cambodia until the outcome
of a special meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers next Monday, a
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said today.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on Ung Huot's election Wednesday as first
prime minister to replace ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the
spokeswoman said, "Singapore has noted this development.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that the ASEAN ministers will discuss the latest
developments in Cambodia, including the proceedings of the National
Assembly yesterday on the election of Mr. Ung Huot, as well as the
next steps for ASEAN," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Singapore will therefore await the outcome of the Special
ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting of 11 August 1997."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's National Assembly voted to appoint the FUNCINPEC
party's Ung Huot as first prime minister, replacing the party's
previous First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, who was ousted by
his rival, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on July 6 after fighting
between troops loyal to the two men.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly also voted to strip the prince of his
legal immunity on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a secret ballot, out of 99 members present in the 120-seat
assembly, 86 voted in favor of Ung Huot's nomination.

<HEADLINE> Lanzhou Active in Reforming Housing System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Lanzhou, capital city of
northwestern China's Gansu Province, is launching a comprehensive
housing system reform by gradually raising rent, selling
publicly-owned houses and establishing housing accumulation fund.
</P>
<P>
The city started housing system reform in 1993, later than
other regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Housing rental fees, which were rising slightly every year
because of the less developed local economy and the residents' low
income, are expected to go up by 2.6 percent annually to reach the
final goal of 15 percent of a family's average income by the year
2000, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
The raising of rent for publicly-owned houses will effectively
alleviate the shortage of funds for house maintenance, and further
promote the socialization and commercialization of residential
housing.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 51 percent of the city's publicly-owned houses
have been sold to individual residents.
</P>
<P>
The city also made a breakthrough in raising housing
accumulation fund in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Kabila's Visit Opens New Chapter in Angola-DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The first visit by President
Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to
Angola has been hailed as opening a new chapter in the history of
the relations between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, Kabila paid a two-day visit to Angola from August 5-6,
his first visit to Angola since Kabila assumed presidency of the
DRC in May this year.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Angola, Kabila held discussions with dos
Santos and exchanged views on their domestic affairs, the
prospect of bilateral cooperation and international issues of
common interest.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents discussed situation in the African
continent, especially the political situation in central Africa.
They welcomed all efforts made by international community,
particularly the United Nations and the Organization of African
Unity to solve problems in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kabila and dos Santos expressed their welcome to the newly
established African Economic Community, believing that it will
help promote Africa's development in the economic, scientific and
technological fields and push friendly contacts between African
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to step up cooperation between the two
countries to promote their prosperity, peace and sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed cooperation accords in the fields of
petroleum, mines, education, health, culture, transport and
fishery, which are bound to promote full development of bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Kabila's visit to Angola is a
successful one, which has ended the long-standing tension between
the two neighbors, arising mainly from the support by Former
Zaire's Mobutu government for the Angolan opposition UNITA (the
national union for the total independence of Angola ) in the
protracted Angolan civil war.
</P>
<P>
Just as a joint communique issued at the end of Kabila's visit
put it, the visit "opened a new chapter in the history of
relations between the two countries and their peoples".
</P>
<P>
The improved relations between them will promote stability in
the region and their economic development will also push the
regional economic development, observers concluded.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Immediate Restoration of S. Leone's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council has urged Sierra Leone's military junta to renounce its
intention to remain in power and unconditionally restore the
elected civilian government it overthrew in the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
In a presidential statement released on Wednesday, the council
reiterated its "deep concern" over the developments in Sierra
Leone, noting that the crisis in the troubled country has
affected peace, security and stability of the west African
sub-region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the necessity to abide by the agreement
reached between the junta's delegation and the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, last
month.
</P>
<P>
Describing the conditions proposed by the junta led by Johnny
Koroma for the restoration of the toppled civilian government as
"unacceptable", it called on the junta to resume peace talks with
ECOWAS immediately.
</P>
<P>
The council expressed welcome to the efforts of ECOWAS towards
resolving the Sierra Leonean crisis and support to the objectives
of ECOWAS' mediation initiative.
</P>
<P>
It demanded the junta immediately stop its threat by force on
Sierra Leoneans and foreign nationals in that country and do
nothing to disturb the international community's efforts to
provide humanitarian aid.
</P>
<P>
Noting the influx of Sierra Leonean refugees into neighboring
countries, the statement called on all countries and
international organizations concerned to help these countries
settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
The talks between an ECOWAS committee and representatives of
the junta collapsed on July 31 following Koroma's announcement
that the junta would stay in power until a presidential election
is held at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeeping force of ECOWAS, known as ECOMOG, has
tightened economic sanctions and embargo against Sierra Leone at
the call of ECOWAS chairman, Nigeria's Head of State Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
An ECOMOG statement warned on Wednesday that it would take
reprisal against any ship or aircraft attempting to enter the
territorial waters and airspace of Sierra Leone.  Endidtem

The delegation will hold talks with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and other senior officials on the current Israeli-Syrian
relations, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Abed Inbitawi, spokesman for the Israel Arab leadership's
monitoring group, said that while the group wouldn't be relaying
any government-to-government message, "we hope we will have the
chance to help lessen the recent tension between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Inbitawi said a number of Israeli groups had asked to relay
messages, among them the United Kibbutz Movement which wants to
organize a meeting of Israeli and Syrian youths on the
Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
He said he had already looked into the possibility, but such a
meeting would be contingent on participants agreeing to a full
withdrawal from the Golan, as Syria has demanded in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Tourism Minister Moshe Katzav, who is also in charge of
Arab affairs, welcomed Wednesday the week-long mission, saying he
hoped it signaled the start of a new era for Israeli-Syrian
relations.
</P>
<P>
Katzav hoped that representatives would seek permission for
the widow and brother of Eli Cohen, who was executed in Damascus
on charges of spying for Israel 32 years ago, to visit Cohen's
grave.
</P>
<P>
Other delegation members included Labor Party member of
Kenesset (Parliament) Salah Tarif and Nawaf Massalha, as well as
United Arab List lawmakers Abdel Malik Dahamsha and Abdul Wahab
Darawshe.
</P>
<P>
The Hadash (Democratic Front for Peace and Equality) party and
Sons of the Village movement pulled out of the delegation over
political differences.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked since
early last year, and showed no sign of resumption following the
rising to power of the current Likud government in Israel.
</P>
<P>
While Israel repeatedly called for resuming the talks without
any conditions, Syria demanded Israel's promise to withdraw from
whole Golan Heights before returning to the negotiating
table.

<P>
LIMA, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Peru's Sporting Cristal played to a
goaless draw with Brazil's Cruzeiro in the first leg of the final
of South America's premier club competition, the Libertadores Cup
here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The giant-killing Cristal harried from the outset, with
strikers Julinho and Bonnet running tirelessly but failing to make
much headway against the more highly-rated Brazilian club's cool
defence.
</P>
<P>
Cheered by a capacity 45,000 home crowd at Lima's National
Stadium, the Peruvians almost took the lead in a last-minute
goalmouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
But it was Cruzeiro who cut out the best chances in fast breaks
from the back, forcing several dramatic one-on-one saves from
Cristal goalkeeper Julio Cesar Balerio.
</P>
<P>
The winner of the Libertadores Cup will represent South America
in the Intercontinental Cup against Germany's Borussia Dortmund,
winners of the European Cup.

FUZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China has installed an offshore
communications network to aid ships in distress.
</P>
<P>
The network enables onshore facilities and vessels within a
range of 50 nautical miles to receive SOS signals. It can also
provide the exact location of endangered vessels and facilitate
related rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
Facilities in Liaoning, Hebei, Jiangsu and Fujian provinces,
and Tianjin and Shanghai municipalities are currently linked to
the network.
</P>
<P>
Accidents involving fishing vessels account for over 60 percent
of China's total maritime accidents, with small- to medium-sized
vessels accounting for approximate 90 percent of the former
figure. Some 100 Chinese fishermen are killed in maritime
accidents each year.

PARIS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The peace-keeping Operation Alba staged by 11 countries in
Albania was concluded on Wednesday as the last contingent of
French troops returned home from Albania. The result of this
operation was modest. Sixty people were killed last week in
Albania in lingering incidents of violence and the country is
still under the control of gangsters and mafias.
</P>
<P>
-- Situation remains tense in the Indian Ocean nation of the
Comoros as the chief of the separatists in the Comoran island of
Anjouan, Abdullah Ibrahim, chaired on Wednesday the first "cabinet
meeting." Meanwhile, the Comoran government has put its troops on
alert and has set up a crisis team to get in touch with the
separatists.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. dollar continued to rise on Wednesday and attained
6.37 francs and 1.885 German marks, registering a 22 percent rise in
exchange rates with the two European currencies since January. In
France as well as in Germany, exports, which serve as the motor of
economic growth, will benefit from a better competitiveness which
results from the rise of the green back. But it is bringing about
the rise of gas price in France and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Fifty years after Jawaharlal Nehru declared independence of
India, the regional power which calls itself "the biggest
democracy in the world" is experiencing a 7 percent economic
growth, has the fourth largest armed forces in the world, has
attained self-sufficiency in food and is practicing a politically
alternative way.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Deficit Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China expects strong growth in
fiscal revenue and restrictions of expenditures to yield a 10
billion yuan deficit reduction in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently released State Information Center
report, revenue are expected to account for a greater share of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Major factors contributing to solid growth in revenue income
include a significant increase in stamp revenue, improved taxation
measure, huge growth in tariff taxes, and increased income taxes
collected from profitable enterprises and individuals.
</P>
<P>
According to recent projections, state revenue will climb by 17
percent on a year-on-year basis, and in so doing will raised the
revenue to GDP proportion 0.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, growth in budgeted expenditures will be held
at 14.7 percent annually as a result of reductions in state
government administrative spending and the cancellation or
postponement of construction of nonessential office buildings.
</P>
<P>
This year's low level inflation has helped to reduce state
subsidies and greatly reduced pressure on state spending.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a coastal city in
Northeast China, has attracted more foreign investors than most of
the other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the city approved 360 foreign
investment projects, involving contractual foreign capital of
nearly 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far, Dalian has signed contracts with foreign investors to
establish 6,336 enterprises, involving a total of foreign fund of
11.8 billion dollars. As a result, the city ranks third, only
after Shanghai and Tianjin, in attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Dalian takes some new ways of utilization of foreign
capital. State-owned enterprises attracted foreign capital by
issuing B share or transaction of property rights.
</P>
<P>
This year, the city has placed emphasis of attracting foreign
investment on boardering countries and regions. In the first half
of the year it sent delegations to Thailand, Indonesia, the
Republic of Korea (ROK) and Japan for business talks. In ROK
alone, the city signed 53 contracts on joint ventures, attracting
380 million dollars worth of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is working hard to improve its investment
environment. It has earnestly implemented relevant regulations and
held symposiums to solicit opinions from foreign investors. It has
also simplified procedures for the establishment of foreign-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By June this year, more than 3,000 foreign-funded enterprises
have gone into operation, accounting for about half of the
projects which have gained approval for the establishment.

<HEADLINE> Advanced Buses Begin Service in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Starting from this Friday, Macao
will inaugurate ten Germany-made advanced public buses, which will
provide more comfortable and safer services than the previous ones.
</P>
<P>
The new buses, the first group of European tourism buses to be
used as public buses in the region, has cost the Transmac Bus
Company more than 10 million patacas (about 1.27 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 45-seat bus (10.3 m by 2.4 m by 3.16 m) reduces the steps
at the entry to only one, making it more convenient for children
and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
In addition, sensors have been installed at both gates of entry
and exit. Upon touching hard objects, the gate will open
automatically, and unless the exit door is fully closed, the bus
cannot be started, an engineer of the bus company said.
</P>
<P>
The newly-imported buses will be in service between the Hong
Kong-Macao Port Terminal and the Border Gate adjoining Zhuhai
City, south China's Guangdong Province, a leading route in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has two public bus companies, with dozens of bus
lines. Buses remain the most convenient and most popular form of
transportation for local residents. The Transmac Bus Company now
has more than 300 vehicles.

ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Chioma Ajunwa of
Nigeria looked set to beat big names in the women's long jump when she

here today at the 6th World Athletics Championships.
</P>

The Nigerian got the longest leap of the round on her second

Marion Jones of the United States, the newly-crowned world fastest

</P>
<P>
Another American legand Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the world champion in
1987 and 1991, qualified in equal 10th position with a 6.62m attempt.
The world heptathlon champion Sabine Braun of Germany, whose best jump
was 6.76 this year, didn't make it to the final, only managing 6.20.
</P>
<P>
However, Heike Drechsler of Germany, the 1992 Olympic champion and
world title winner in 1983 and 1993, was in a better form. She jumped
6.80 on her second outing, good enough to enter Saturday's final.

<P>
CAIRO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and visiting Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan held talks today on the
latest developments on the Palestinian-Israeli arena, the Egyptian
MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During their talks in Egypt's port city of Alexandria, they
also discussed Egyptian and Jordanian efforts to mediate the
resumption of the peace process and easing of the sufferings of
the Palestinians following the suicide Jerusalem bombings.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Presidential Cabinet
chief Zakareya Azmi and Presidential political advisor Osama
el-Baz attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian crown prince was accompanied by Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali and Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh. He held
talks on Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
but failed to pursuade him to ease restrictions on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt are reportedly working with the U.S. to
formulate an initiative which might be the basis for the
resumption of the stalled peace talks ahead of a visit by
U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross to the region on the weekend
to defuse growing tension.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks which had been deadlocked since
Israel's construction of a new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem
in March suffered another fatal blow when the deadly Jerusalem
bombings claimed 15 lives on July 30.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment in Northeast China's Province Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The inflow of overseas
investment in northeast China's Jilin Province had amounted to
6.27 billion US dollars by June, setting up more than 3,000
overseas-invested enterprises locally.
</P>
<P>
The province has economic cooperation with some 150 countries
and regions, a remarkable increase over the former figure, and
this gives a big boost to local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two-thirds of the overseas spendings, or some 2.28
billion US dollars, are involved in industrial projects. And the
majority of the remainder is invested on local agriculture,
telecoms and transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, local overseas-funded businesses generated more than
10.07 billion yuan in output value and yielded 1.03 billion yuan
in pre-tax profits. The enterprises provided more than 100,000
people with new job opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Railway to Open Ahead of Opening of HK New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Airport Chairman Wong
Po-yan has expressed his confidence that the airport railway could
be completed in April next year, two months ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
This would bring the railway's completion forward to the
opening of the airport at Chek Lap Kok, South China Morning Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's new airport is due to open next April while the
airport railway is scheduled to be completed in June.
</P>
<P>
Wong's remarks are in response to the doubts raised over
whether the airport could open on time, due to problems in the
construction of a cargo terminal.
</P>
<P>
He said the airport and the cargo terminal would be ready on
time.
</P>
<P>
The cargo terminal at the new airport is to be run by Hong Kong
Air Cargo Terminals Limited with a smaller cargo terminal run by a
German consortium.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Ousted President in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah, ousted in the May 25 coup led by Major Johnny
Koroma, is in the Nigerian capital of Abuja for talks with
government officials.
</P>
<P>
There was no official confirmation of his visit up to last
night, but today's local paper, The Guardian, quoted sources as
saying that Kabbah, who has stayed in neighboring Guinea since
the coup, arrived early this week.
</P>
<P>
Altough the agenda of the talks is unknown, sources believe
that efforts to restore his presidency is the focus of
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Report of Kabbah's trip to Nigeria came together with actions
by the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG to tighten
sanctions against Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG warned Wednesday that it would take reprisal against
any ship or aircraft attempting to challenge its blockade.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG warning, which became effective Wednesday, urged
all countries to impose "full sanctions and economic blockade
against the junta in Sierra Leone".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council Wednesday
threatened unspecified sanctions against the troubled west
African country, which might lead to an arms and travel ban to
force the junta to relinquish power to Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, which holds the chairmanship of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), has also initiated
moves to get the UN to impose full sanctions on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Security Council president Tuesday, Nigerian
Ambassador to the UN Alhaji Ibrahim Gambari formally brought to
the council's attention a policy statement made on the sanctions
by ECOWAS Chairman General Sani Abacha last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abacha's announcement was made following the July 30 collapse
of the Abidjan talks between an ECOWAS committee and the junta's
delegtion.
</P>
<P>
"We want to inquire what the Security Council may now wish to
do, taking note of the ECOWAS chairman's policy statement,
particularly in reference to full-scale application of sanctions
and embargo," Gambari said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He also used the meeting to propose an amendment to the
council's draft presidential statement on Sierra Leone to reflect
the ECOWAS initiative.
</P>
<P>
If approved, the presidential statement will, among others,
blame the Koroma-led military government for the breakdown of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
The statement, the third by the council since the coup, will
also call on the soldiers to withdraw their conditions for the
restoration of President Kabbah, renounce their declared
intention to remain in power and signal their readiness to resume
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Koroma has announced the junta will not hand over until a
presidential election is organized at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS foreign ministers have agreed to use a combination of
three measures to dislodge the soldiers -- dialogue, sanctions
and a possible use of force.

<HEADLINE> Korzeniowski Tops Men's 50km Walk in World Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Poland's Robert Korzeniowski, the 1996
Olympic champion, proved to be the toughest in the men's 50-kilometer
walk field when he returned home first to win the gold medal at the
6th World Athletics Championships here today.
</P>
<P>
He braved the hot sun to take the victory in three hours, 44
minutes 46 seconds. The heat (30 degrees) was the biggest obstacle for
all the walkers, but Korzeniowski didn't seem to be bothered and won
Poland's first gold at the meet.
</P>
<P>
Spain's Jesus Angel Garcia, the 1993 world champion and 1997 World
Cup winner, was second, 13 seconds behind the winner. Mexico's Miguel
Angel Rodriguez finished third in 3:48:30.
</P>
<P>
Korzeniowski and Carcia pulled away from Russia's Oleg Ishutkin
before reaching the 35th kilometer, and walked together in the next 10
kilometers. Korzeniowski made his decisive move and shaked off Garcia
after that for his first championships victory.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez caught Ishutkin in the final kilometers and maintained
his pace to the end.
</P>
<P>
The top three medallists walked the last 10 kilometers with two
warnings each, so they were very careful of not to make any more
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
Garcia was carried out of the stadium on a stretcher, but he only
had muscle cramps. After crossing the finish line he said that he had
never felt the heat like that.
</P>
<P>
The defending world champion Finland's Valentin Kononen, didn't
have a good day and only finished 9th. Five walkers including China's
Zhao Yongsheng, the 1993 World Cup winner, didn't finish the tough
race.

</P>
<P>
The Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG),
the Olympic Co-ordination Authority (OCA) and the local Waverley
Council voted Wednesday night for Bondi Beach over nearby Coogee
Beach.
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been Bondi, people internationally would have
been quite surprised," said Knight, who is also SOCOG president.
</P>
<P>
Beach volleyball, which became an Olympic sport at the 1996
Atlanta Games, will be staged from September 16-27, 2000 with 84
men and women competing.
</P>
<P>
Matches will be staged in a four hectare secure area embracing

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Spokesman on Turkey's Accord with Denktash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N.-led direct talks aimed
at a Cyprus settlement should continue in spite of Turkey's
attempts to partially annex the Turkish-controlled northern
Cyprus, Government spokesman Manolis Christofides said here today.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Wednesday's agreement on "partial
integration" between Ankara and the Turkish Cypriot regime on the
northern third of the east Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
and visiting Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, calls for
"gradual economic and financial integration and partial
integration on security, defense and foreign policy matters"
between Turkey and the self-styled "Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Christofides told Cyprus radio that the signing of the
agreement was in line with Turkey's "routine political tactics of
creating problems," whenever hopes for a Cyprus solution are
looming.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "our European course is of vital importance
and we will take all necessary measures to safeguard it."
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot government will make representations to
international fora about the accord.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that Turkey has a huge military
machine in Cyprus, and if it is concerned with Cyprus' military
buildup, "all it has to do is to accept President Clerides'
proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side declared unilaterally a breakaway
state in 1983 which was only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Takes Measures to Curb Road Accidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
determined to launch a massive road safety campaign to cut down
road deaths by half in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here today, Justice Minister Nicos
Koshis said with a population of merely 600,000, this eastern
Mediterranean island's road casualty rate is staggering.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents kill an average of 130 people each year in the
country, making Cyprus the second worst in Europe in terms of
accident fatality rate.
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1997, a total of 2,100 people lost their
lives in road accidents in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Koshis believed that introducing tougher measures can save at
least 60 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that although road deaths are down by 30
percent for the first six months of this year compared to 1996,
there is more room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
Traffic policemen have been sent to Britain and Sweden to learn
about new techniques in road accident prevention, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the police showed around 100,000 out of
the island's 400,000 drivers are booked for traffic offenses
each year.
</P>
<P>
Until June this year, police had recorded over 60,000 traffic
offenses, nearly 8,000 more than in the same period in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Garments and textile exports
amounted to 1.72 billion U.S. dollars in the Philippines as of the
end of July this year, a 10 percent growth over the same period
last year, data from the country's Garments and Textile Export
Board showed today.
</P>
<P>
According to the data, increased demand from traditional
markets and continuing emergence of buyers from non-quota areas
pushed up the exports revenue.
</P>
<P>
Exports to quota countries accounted for 77.78 percent of the
total shipments with the income reaching 1.34 billion dollars. On
the other hand, shipments to non-quota areas went up by 8.8
percent as earnings rose to 382 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States, the biggest market among quota nations,
stepped up its purchases in the first seven months, garnering 62
percent of the total shipments. It was followed by European
countries and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Among non-quota countries, Japan was the biggest importers of
the Philippine garments, followed by the United Arab Emirates and
Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert on Human Rights Dialogues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese human rights expert Fan
Guoxiang said here today that there are at least three subjects for
human rights dialogues.
</P>
<P>
Fan, one of the expert members in the Sub-Commission on
Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities under
the United Nations Human Rights Committee, made the remarks at the
sub-commission's 49th session. The current session meets between
August 4-29.
</P>
<P>
He said that in dialogues among those sharing the same view and
those holding different and even diametrically opposed ideas, at
least the following three subjects should be talked about:
</P>
<P>
- To exchange views and experiences for a better understanding
and to change an abnormal exercise of reaching conclusions prior
to talks. Well-organized attacks with a view to forcing political
country-wise resolutions run counter to the objective of promoting
human rights. Arbitrary accusations should be replaced by
strengthened cooperations.
</P>
<P>
- To seek common points. It is admirable to engage in
discussions on questions, for example, the universality and
specificity of human rights; the status, scope and focus of human
rights in the contemporary world as compared to their features in
various historical periods; ties between the economic, social and
cultural rights and the civil and political rights; birth and
development of conceptions and practices about human rights in
different regions and countries, and problems they are facing;
impacts on human rights by various historical background and
cultural heritage; relations between human rights on the one hand
and the maintenance of international peace and security and the
cooperation of the economic development on the other; individual
freedom and aggregate interest of the community; rights to be
enjoyed and duties to be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
- To adopt a reasonable attitude toward divergences. One
should not be surprised by existing differences. The problem is
how to deal with them. Shouldn't we, on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, calmly explore the origin and scope of different
views? Are there any opportunities and conditions for any
progress, even partially and temporarily? If the answer is in the
affirmative, we are happy. If not, we can wait. Anyhow, this
approach will prove to be much more positive than an endless human
rights arm-twisting.
</P>
<P>
Fan said that talks should be serious but not cosmetic, with
patience but not in a rush, in order to reach a gradual and
realistic common acknowledgment, either on substantive issues, or
on procedural matters.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coffee Body to End Auction Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) --The Coffee Board of Kenya has
announced plans to introduce a multi-auctioneering system for
coffee in October and thus end the current auction monopoly, the
Daily Nation newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The overall operations of the new auction system will be under
the Nairobi Coffee Exchange as an agent of the board, said the
board in a circular issued to planters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the auctioneers will be required to
prepare a sales catalogue in liaison with the board and the
exchange on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis.
</P>
<P>
The auctioneers will also fix the reserve prices for their
clients. They will also negotiate fees and commissions which will
be deducted by the board and remitted directly to the
auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
The board also warned farmers not to sell coffee to companies
which are not licensed by the board.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, coffee futures prices soared above two U.S. Dollars
a pound for the first time in two months Tuesday on a report that
new Latin American supplies of mild Arabica beans could be months
late in arriving for roasters' use during the peak fall
consumption period.
</P>
<P>
Arabica coffee beans for September delivery rose nearly five
percent, or 9.35 cents, to 2.031 Dollars a pound, the highest
since June 17.
</P>
<P>
About 99.4 percent of Kenyan coffee is Arabica coffee.

<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Internal Trade
has worked out an ambitious plan on the development of chain
stores in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, China will set up three chain-store
enterprises with an annual sales volume of over one billion yuan
each, 50 chain-store firms with a yearly sales volume of over 100
million yuan each and 30 chain-store companies possessing over 50
shops each.
</P>
<P>
China will also establish several large trans-regional
chain-store groups.
</P>
<P>
Minister Chen Bangzhu said at a recent meeting that
chain-stores have developed quickly in China these years and have
brought about obvious economic and social benefits.
</P>
<P>
Chain-store development hereafter will be focused on expanding
the scale and improving management, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chain stores started to develop in China in the early 1990's,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, by the end of 1996, there
were more than 700 chain-store enterprises in the country, with
over 10,000 shops.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, chain stores accounted for 1.2 percent of the total
turnover of the retailers in the country.
</P>

A survey shows that the prices of goods for daily use sold in
chain stores are five percent lower than in department stores.

</P>
<P>
More than 30 projects with a total investment of 375 million US
dollars have been started in the zone. Overseas-funded businesses
account for 60 percent of the projects, and five of them have an
investment of some 50 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The 1.96-sq-m-zone is installed with water supply, sewage
disposal, power and heat supply, telecommunications, and transport
facilities. Moreover, it has a customhouse, and a public bonded
warehouse.
</P>
<P>
Some projects in the zone cater especially for the nearby
airport. The biggest of them is the 70-million-US-dollar
CASC-Airbus Training and Service Center, which is also the largest
project in the Asia-Pacific Region by the European consortium
Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, five of the 30 projects became operational, yielding
an output value of 450 million yuan (54 million US dollars). This
year 15 to 18 businesses are expected to go into operation,
producing a total output value from 1.5 to two billion yuan (181
to 241 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the zone will focus on hi-tech, high
value-added and low-pollution industries with more foreign
currency returns.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Adventurer Crosses Lop Nur in Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese explorer has walked
across the Lop Nur, the so called "zone of death" in China's
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, this summer alone.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongsheng, a 35-year-old adventurer, is the first man known
to have survived the dangerous walk across the massive desert in
summer.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the regional tourism bureau, Li
set out from Korla in the southern part of Xinjiang on May 18 and
took 40 days to complete the expedition.
</P>
<P>
Temperatures were above 60 degrees centigrade in June and Li
had to walk at night and rest during the day. On two extremely
difficult occasions, Li survived by drinking his own urine.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion when he was on the verge of death, he was
rescued by some people from an oil exploration team.
</P>
<P>
The Lop Nur once had oases on the legendary Silk Road, but the
sand began to cover it when the course of the Tarim River, which
had nurtured it, shifted. And the flourishing trade route began to
decline about 1,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1900s, a Swedish explorer discovered a
2,000-year-old city, Loulan, in the sand. And many archeologists
and amateur adventurers have been attracted by its mysteries,
ignoring its dangers. In 1981, Peng Jiamu, a noted scientist from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was reported missing in the
region and Yu Chunshun, 48, a well-known explorer, was found dead
in the desert in June, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Yu had ventured into the desert alone on June 12 and a gale hit
and the temperatures rose to 70 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Li Yongsheng, who is a graduate from the Central Academy of
Fine Arts, started a trek to visit all of China's 56 national
minorities in March 1989. Thus far, he has walked 94,000
kilometers and visited 30 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions. He also walked across the Taklimakan Desert, the "Sea of
Death," in April 1992.
</P>
<P>
During his 40 days trek on the Lop Nur, Li studied the desert
ecology and the ruins of Loulan, and took many lovely
photos.

<HEADLINE> Bavaria Continues to Support Ukraine's Medical System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Bavaria will continue to aid Ukraine
in developing a sound medical care system, Bavarian State Minister
for Health Care Frau Stamm said today.
</P>
<P>
Stamm arrived in Kiev earlier today with medicine worth 450,000
deutsche marks (about 240,000 U.S. dollars) and a minibus for
disabled children in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Stamm, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister for Labor and Social Policies Mykon Beoblotsky praised
Bavaria as Ukraine's most generous donor.
</P>
<P>
Bavaria's aid to Ukraine over the past six years totaled 8.5
million marks (about 4.524 million dollars), about 60 percent of
which went for improving Ukraine's medical system.
</P>
<P>
Almost 100 Bavarian-Ukrainian joint medical projects are
underway in this east European country.
</P>
<P>
The Volkswagen company, in particular, built a medical center
in Ukraine for the rehabilitation of young people suffering from
nerve disorders at a cost of 2 million marks (about 1.1 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The center has been in operation since September 1996.

<P>
Active international economic exchanges also improved China's
foreign trade. The country's status among the world traders is up
from 15th in 1992 to 11th for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
China's trade went from 165.5 billion US dollars worth in 1992
to 289.9 billion dollars worth last year, a 75 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
A number of Chinese products have established a reputation on
the international market. Last year, machinery and electronics
goods exports earned 48.2 billion dollars, 32 percent of the total
exports.
</P>
<P>
Certain other industries are also geared to the international
market. Ship builders have entered the Japanese and Korean
markets, the world's top two ship-building giants. The orders for
a number of China's leading ship-yards are reported to run to 1999
and into the next century.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is another economic index of the opening-up. China had
50 million overseas visitors last year, becoming the fifth largest

<HEADLINE> Chinese Municipality Seeks Balanced Growth in Urban, Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- With a heavily populated rural
area, Chongqing, which became China's fourth municipality early
this year, has been called "the largest village in China."
</P>
<P>
The city is located in southwest China on the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River. It covers 82,000 sq.km. and has a population of
30.2 million, 24 million of that in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The total rural population of China's other three
municipalities -- Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin -- is only half
that of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
For more balanced growth, Chongqing is looking for a new
economic strategy to develop both urban and rural areas
simultaneously, and plans to quadruple the income of local
residents by the year 2010 from 1995's figure.
</P>
<P>
That means Chongqing will increase per capita income of urban
residents to 7,000 yuan from 4,643 yuan and that of rural people
to 2,350 yuan from 1,435 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing municipal government also plans to help 3.66
million poor people in rural areas live better by the end of this
century and to resettle one million residents of areas affected by
the giant Three Gorges Hydro-electric Power Project.
</P>
<P>
Lei Hengshun, a Chongqing University professor and government
advisor, says that the new economic strategy, called the
"Chongqing Model," has been worked out in keeping with the city's
special conditions and is important to China, with its large rural
population.
</P>
<P>
According to the municipality's Outline of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) and the Long-Rang Objectives for Economic and
Social Development through the year 2010, it will build a
modernized city composed of towns of various sizes.
</P>
<P>
Liao Yuanhe, a local economist, says that the proposed city
will cover all 43 big and small towns in Chongqing Municipality
and form a large market for urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy will be helpful for spreading the use of
technology, information, and funds from urban areas to rural ones,
which have abundant resources for simultaneous and balanced
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, Chongqing will further develop trade,
restaurant, tourism, and service sectors, and relocate a large
number of factories, mainly those in supplementary industries with
outmoded technology, to the countryside to help local township-
and village-based enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is one of six oldest industrial bases in the country,
and has many kinds of industries. To take advantage of this, it
will try to turn agriculture into a modern market-oriented
business by developing farm-based enterprises, agricultural
production bases, and individual farms in rural areas .
</P>
<P>
It will also improve its communications, telecommunications,
and information network.

<HEADLINE> Housing Reform Gains Momentum in North China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Shijiazhuang city in north
China has been successful with the housing reform, with handsome
returns from marketing commodity housing to be used for the
construction of more apartments.
</P>
<P>
For decades, urban residents in China used to live in public
housing with low rents, and they are now encouraged to purchase
their own apartments with the aim to step up housing construction
and meet the needs of the growing population.
</P>
<P>
After years of reform, things have changed greatly, especially
in 35 pilot housing reform cities, including Shijiazhuang city,
provincial capital of Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 16.04 million sq m of residential housing, 80
percent of the total in the city, built with state funds, have
been sold to individual families.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the city government has issued a series of
policies to encourage individual families to purchase their own
residential apartments, such as increasing rents and setting
reasonable housing prices affordable to local residents.

<P>
SHANGHAI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest research center
on respiratory diseases has been set up in Shanghai, a leading
base for treatment of such diseases and for taking precaution
measures against and control of tuberculoses in the country.
</P>
<P>
The research center comprises doctors and researchers from five
hospitals in the municipality -- the Zhongshan Hospital, Huashan

most prominent for treatment of lung diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is the fifth such research facility in the country, after
four others in Shenyang, Beijing, and Guangzhou cities.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory diseases are the No.1 killer in China. With the
increasing incidence of chronic and obstructive lung diseases,
asthma, lung cancer, and non-tuberculous lung infection, more
attention has been called for to enhance research on such
diseases.

<HEADLINE> Drug Problem Threats National Security: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today warned that the illicit drug problem is considered a threat
to national security and, if left unchecked, could undermine the
political structure of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ramos painted this grim possibility during a dialogue with
members of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the
Philippines in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
"I'm warning the people about this (the drug menace to the
national security)," the President said as he called for everybody
to join the crusade to stamp out the drug problem once and for all
in the country.
</P>
<P>
To effectively address the problem, the government has
mobilized its entire machinery to fight an all-out war against the
illegal drugs that have hounded the country for so many years, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos admitted that drug lords could, through their money,
maintain influence and connections in high places of business and
government in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he vowed that the current anti-drug campaign would
focus on masterminds including the drug lords and their financiers
and that no let-up would be allowed in the drive.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he urged Congress to pass the
anti-racketeering bill that would give law enforcers the power to
freeze and confiscate laundered money owned by drug lords.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has become a key transshipment point by drug
lords because of its strategic position in Asia.
</P>
<P>
With over 7,100 islands scattered all over the vast archipelago
and its closeness to "the gold triangle" lying on the borders of
Thailand, Laos and Myanmar, it is easy to smuggle drugs into the
country, Ramos said.

</P>
<P>
In the message, Jiang highly praised the achievements by the

</P>
<P>
He said that The Southeast Asian region has maintained a sound
momentum of economic growth and has seen considerable progress in
cooperation of various forms thanks to concerted efforts by ASEAN
member states.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased to see ASEAN admit new members on its
thirtieth anniversary. Its enlargement and development conform to
the trend toward multipolarization in the world and conduce to a
lasting peace and development in the Asia-Pacific, " the Chinese
president said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's New Municipality Attracting More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Isuzu Motors,
Thailand's Chia Tai Group, and a British multinational have
decided to spend 120 million US dollars more in Chongqing, part of
the 50 percent increase in overseas investment in the first half
of the year.
</P>
<P>
This influx is mainly attributed to Chongqing's status being to
that of a municipality, in March, China's fourth, after Beijing,
Shanghai, and Tianjin, and to its development potential with
favorable central government policies.
</P>
<P>
The new municipality covers a total of 82,000 sq km and has
more than 30 million people, and has the possibility of becoming
another popular investment spot after Shanghai's Pudong New Area,
according to economists.
</P>
<P>
Its new status has drawn the growing attention of overseas
business people. Two Japanese banks have opened offices in the
city, and other banks have begun to do feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
"As a municipality directly under the State Council, or the
central government, Chongqing will play an increasingly important
role in China's social and economic activities. Therefore, my
group has decided to shift investment priority in China to this
interior city," said Kim Gao Choong, chief representative of
Korea's Hyundai Group in China.
</P>
<P>
The central government has granted the municipality with the
same favorable policies as Pudong, Vice-Mayor Xu Zhongmin noted.
These include: the state gives priority to overseas-funded banks,
department stores, and supermarkets in Chongqing; the city's
enterprises enjoy advantages in issuing H-shares and B-shares
overseas; the state will provide more loans to the city; and
income tax of overseas businesses will be reduced from 33 to 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
The municipality also plans to put 250 billion yuan into fixed
assets during the Ninth Five-Year period (1996-2000), and to
utilize some 3.5 to four billion US dollars in overseas capital,
an increase of over 100 percent over the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that living expenses for urban and rural
residents will increase by 24 billion yuan at the end of the
century, giving the municipality potential as a consumer goods
market.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is the largest economic center in southwest China and
on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and is widely
considered to be a mjor force for China's two 21st century
strategies, namely, to opening up the Yangtze River valley and the
westward shift in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing straddles China's east-west juncture and is part of
the westward trend in economic development, and will try to link
the capital and technology of the east to the resources in the
west. And the Three Gorges Dam has provided still more
opportunities for overseas investment and businesses.

BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- In a review of China's opening-up
drive of the past five years, Guangming Daily today said it has
brought more overseas investment and trade opportunities and
energy and expertise into an emerging economy.
</P>
<P>
After coastal regions became the beneficiaries of the first
round of opening up, the vast interior, which contains some of
China's most backward regions, looked for its own channels to
contact the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River, with Shanghai at its east end, was designed
to carry the economic growth for an area where two-thirds of
China's people live. Wuhan, a trade and transport hub in central
China, and Chongqing, China's newest and largest municipality, and
six other cities along the river, were designed as strategic
outlets of growth.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen border cities were also allowed to increase economic
ties with neighboring countries. And, the opening of inland
provincial capitals, which were mostly old industrial bases, into
bases for overseas capital, technology, and expertise.
</P>
<P>
By now, 359 Chinese cities and counties with a population of
300 million and an area of 500,000 square kilometers have opened
to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Open coastal regions have become a major force in China's
economy, 12 of which were pioneers in last year's drive,
attracting 88 percent of the overseas investment in China. Their
combined GDP accounted for 58 percent of China's total, and their
trade volume for 89 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's five special economic zones, which were experimental
refrom areas, have all had more than 30 percent annual growth in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Start Anti-Polio Campaign Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan Health Ministry is
scheduled to launch the second national anti-polio campaign
tomorrow in a bid to eradicate polio in the country.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which started last year in the country, will be
divided into two rounds this year in order to cover wider area,
according to Health Minister Jackson Mulinge.
</P>
<P>
The first round will take place on August 9 and 10 and the
second one on September 13 and 14.
</P>
<P>
A total of 89 stations have been set up at health centers,
schools, markets and other accessible places throughout the East
African country.
</P>
<P>
Mulinge said that the government had set targets to immunize
more than five million children below the age of five during the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is one of more than 30 countries in Africa which will
participate in this year's anti-polio campaign sponsored by the
World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
According to global statistics, as of April this year, only
about 3,400 cases of polio were reported last year in the world,
representing a 90 percent decline from the 35,000 cases reported
in 1988 when the campaign started.
</P>
<P>
The African continent has the highest polio cases in 1996 with
1,670 cases reported, accounting for 49 percent of the global
total.
</P>
<P>
However, a ray of hope exists in the African continent as
polio free zones are emerging in the southern, northern and
eastern parts of the continent.

a relationship that is geared toward the 21st century. We are
satisfied to see friendly relations and cooperation between China
and ASEAN countries grow in strength. The China-ASEAN relations
are developing smoothly with the establishment of a full dialogue
partnership between the two sides and increasingly closer
consultation and cooperation between them in regional and
international affairs. Cooperation between the two sides in
various fields holds out broad prospects. The relationship between
China and ASEAN is now entering a new phase of an all-round
development. China stands ready to work with ASEAN countries to
develop friendly and good-neighborly relations, expand mutually
beneficial co-operation and bring about a lasting peace and
development in the region and the world at large.

<HEADLINE> Fuzhou Promotes Cross-Strait Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Fuzhou, capital city of east
China's Fujian Province, has made it a point to promote trade
across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security recently authorized Fuzhou to
issue Temperary Resident Cards for visiting Taiwan residents. The
move will facilitate inter-flows between the two sides of the
straits and help with cross-strait business transactions.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou, facing Taiwan across the straits, has one of the two
direct shipping lines between the two sides. And it only takes
half an hour to fly to the island from the city's Changle
International Airport, if direct flight is in operation.
</P>
<P>
Government support and geographical advantage have made Fuzhou
an ideal place for Taiwan investment. Some major Taiwan
enterprises like the Pacific Electric Wire and Cable Co. Ltd. have
set foot in Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 1,177 Taiwan-funded enterprises in Fuzhou,
involving a total investment of 2.93 billion US dollars. Another
2.62 billion US dollars can be expected in accordance with
agreements signed.
</P>
<P>
The investment covers the fields of textiles, shoe-making,
plastics, precision instruments, electronics, chemicals,
automobiles and motorcycles.

<HEADLINE> China To Make Further Efforts To Reduce Automobile Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- China will take further steps to
cut automobile pollution to improve the urban environment, says
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environment
Protection.
</P>
<P>
Since the country adopted the reform and opening-up policy in
the late 1970s, the number of automobiles has increased
rapidly. More than 50 percent of the air pollution in many big
cities comes from automobile exhaust.
</P>
<P>
Xie notes that the country will first take steps to deal with
fuel. China has been trying to stop the use of lead-containing gas
before the end of the century, and its gas production can meet
this goal.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin have decided to sell only
lead-free petrol by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The country will also inspect new automobiles and imported
cars. Those not meeting exhaust emission standards will be taken
off the market.
</P>
<P>
Old, run-down buses and trucks that cause serious pollution
will not be allowed on the streets, sources said, and other
automobiles will need exhaust emission controls.

<HEADLINE> Birds Scenery in Summer Palace Drawing visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Summer Palace, located in
Beijing's western suburbs, has become a haven for birds, as well
as a popular tourist spot. It used to be China's largest imperial
park.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that half the bird species of northern China can be
found in the Summer Palace, and tourists can enjoy swans, wild
ducks, cuckoos, and orioles in the spring.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, a project to attract birds was launched on the
park's Longevity Hill. The bird lovers of Beijing put hundreds of
birdhouses in trees where birds could rest and breed, and a large
project for removing silt from Kunming Lake has turned it into an
ideal resting place for aquatic birds.
</P>
<P>
Three years of afforestation increased the moisture level,
providing a more suitable environment for birds to live in.
</P>
<P>
The unique scene of the birds has aroused tourists' interest.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Warns Britain over Visa Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
appeal to the British government to waive the visa requirements
for Kenyans travelling to Britain, according to a "Kenya Times"
report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily paper quoted Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka
as saying at Parliament on Wednesday that the government might be
forced to reciprocate the visa requirement for British citizens
coming into the country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the visa requirements imposed on Kenyans
were stringent and made it very difficult for Kenyans to travel
to the U.K.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Parliament that a Kenyan girl was
recently denied a visa to the U.K. where she was to marry her
fiance.
</P>
<P>
The girl was asked to return to the visa section for an
interview in April 1998 to determine whether or not she would be
issued with a visa, Musyoka added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government would consult with the British
government to relax the visa requirements, adding that if failed
in the talks, Kenya might be forced to impose the same rule on
British citizens.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that many of Parliament Members came out
strongly against the visa requirements imposed by the British
government on Kenyans.

<HEADLINE> No Easy Bail for Serious Offenders in S. Africa, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's cabinet has
approved a draft legislation, which will make it virtually
impossible for hardened criminals to obtain bail.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bail law, approved Wednesday, will force
experienced court officials to hear bail applications in murder,
rape and robbery cases, local daily, Sowetan, quoted Justice
Minister Dullah Omar as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Under the legislation, courts will refuse bail for suspects
previously convicted of a serious crime, except in unusual
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Besides, bail hearing outside normal court hours for
individuals accused of serious crimes would be banned.
</P>
<P>
"If properly applied, this bill is going to make a dramatic
impact on the hearing of bail applications," Omar said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill would receive
priority and could be passed by parliament as soon as next month.

<P>
FUZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The capital of Fujian province,
east China, has begun an endeavor to stop diverting land to
non-agricultural purposes, particularly to the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
The move constitutes part of a nationwide drive to protect
arable land and check on the random use of farmland by real estate
businesses, according to officials from the city land
administration bureau.
</P>
<P>
Massive real estate development poses a major threat to
farmland in Fuzhou as well as elsewhere in China.
</P>
<P>
In its continuing check, Fuzhou has looked into 138 tracts of
land that were left idle by real estate developers and retrieved
33 tracts.
</P>
<P>
To cope with this situation, tough and strict measures,
including imposing fees on idle land and demolishing illegal
make-shift buildings, have been introduced in the city to protect
and save more farmland.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Becomes Major Producer of Farm Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, in the subtropical zone in southwest China, has made
remarkable achievements in cultivating fine farm products in the
course of rural economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is viewed with importance in the country in the
production of sugar, fruits, silkworm cocoons, aquatic products,
meat and tea.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Xu Bingsong told Xinhua that the autonomous
region, traditionally underdeveloped, injected great vitality to
the economic development through restructuring in the rural areas
which enjoy favorable natural conditions for farming.
</P>
<P>
Last year, rural industrial and service businesses generated
97.58 billion yuan in output value, or 52 percent of the total
gross domestic product in Guangxi's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises are growing fast. They scored 250 billion
yuan in business volume in 1996. The per-capita annual income for
farmers reached 1,703 yuan, above the national average.
</P>
<P>
As the country's no. one sugar producer, last year, Guangxi's
108 sugar refining mills turned out 2.36 million tons of sugar and
120,000 tons of alcohol, with a total economic return of 8.8
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is also a major fruit producer in China. Orchards in
the region have reached 937,000 ha., with an annual output of 2.4
million tons of subtropical fruits such as longan, litchi,
shaddock, mango, pineapple and banana.
</P>
<P>
The fruit processing industry is growing along with the
expanding fruit cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Due to fine weather conditions, Guangxi has good returns from
winter farming when most parts of the country suffer from cold
weather.

from 20.4 percent of the country's total exports in 1992 to 40.6
percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Bombards South Lebanon in Retaliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli artillery this morning
bombarded Iglim Al-Toffah, 60 kilometers southeast of capital
Beirut, in retaliation for pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrillas'
attacks on Israeli positions in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment of Iglim Al-Toffah, a ridge often used by
Muslim militants as a springboard to attack the border strip
declared by the Israelis as "security zone," killed a woman and
destroyed several houses, security sources in the area said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Hezbollah, or Party of God,
announced that its guerrillas fired salvos of Katyusha rockets and
mortar shells at the Israeli positions at Birkat Risha and Blat in
the western sector of the "security zone" Wednesday night. Some of
the rockets reportedly landed in northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio claimed this morning that more than 10 Katyusha
rockets and mortar shells landed in the Galilee panhandle in
northern Israel without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of tension came only hours before a five-nation
panel overseeing the implementation of a cease-fire agreement
between Israel and Lebanon meet at the south Lebanese border town
of Naqoura today at the request of both Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee will look into three
complaints filed by Lebanon and one by Israel.
</P>
<P>
In their complaints, Lebanon and Israel accused each other of
violating the cease-fire understanding the two countries reached
in April, 1996 which bars the fighting sides in south Lebanon from
targeting civilians.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring committee comprising representatives of France,
Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States have held 15 meetings
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and retaliatory
bombardments by the Israeli forces constitute a daily scene in
south Lebanon, making the area the last active battlefront of
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a 15-kilometer-wide strip in south Lebanon
along the Israeli-Lebanese border, with a total area of up to
1,100 square kilometers, as a "security zone" in 1985 to buffer
northern Israel from cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Import 550,000 Metric Tons of Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines would have to
import some 550,000 metric tons of sugar if it continues exporting
to the United States, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sugar Regulatory Administrator Wilson Gamboa told a press
conference that he prefers to stop all exports of sugar to the
United States despite rejection by the Presidential Palace and the
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his recent visit to the United States, he
again explained his proposal to "voluntarily give up the U.S.
quota" even if it would mean losing the U.S. market to other
supplying countries.
</P>
<P>
"We'll sacrifice a lot in terms of national integrity if we
continue supplying the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that until the sugar supply situation is stabilized,
his country could not look beyond the domestic problems and
supplant U.S. sugar requirement.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the U.S. sugar quota allocation would mean a higher
price of sugar in the domestic market, thus rendering the
Philippine sugar uncompetitive in the world market, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the quota, the country should export 250,000 metric tons
of sugar, or 15 percent of the national sugar production, to the
United States this year, Gamboa said.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Hits S. Africa Worst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The cases of the most
common cancers in South Africa, cancer of the oesophagus,
prostate, stomach, cervix and breast, are among the highest in
the world, according to an academic report.
</P>
<P>
About 23,000 deaths a year for the next 40 years will be due
to lung cancer from cigarette smoking, and the number of
Aids-related cancers is also expected to rise significantly, a
local daily The Star today quoted the annual National Cancer
Registry (NCR) report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the South African Institute for
Medical Research Wednesday, showed that, based on 1992 figures,
one in 39 black men have a lifetime risk of developing
oesophageal cancer.
</P>
<P>
Cancer of prostate is most common in white (one in 20) and
colored (one in 30) men, and cancer of the stomach is the most
common in Asian men (one in 64).
</P>
<P>
Among women, cancer of the cervix is most common in black (one
in 26) and colored (one in 30) women, and breast cancer is most
common among white (one in 15) and Asian (one in 20) women.
</P>
<P>
These figures are drawn from the 51,517 cases reported via a
countrywide network of private and public pathology laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The NCR warned that the South African government must tackle
cancer if it hopes to sustain health advances so far achieved,
for example, by increasing control of communicable diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The 70-million-population
province of Jiangsu in east China reported a per-capita GNP of
8,447 yuan by the end of last year, and this means they have
started to enjoy a comfortable life three years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the Central Government decided, in line
with Deng Xiaoping's ideas, that the people of the country as a
whole should be able to basically lead a comfortable life by the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the State Statistics Bureau set 16 standards for
this "comfortable life", focusing on economic uplift, material
supply, population growth, services, and the environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Jiangsu was able to basically reach most of the
standards. An overall assessment confirmed the success of the
province in improving the life of its residents, said the
provincial Statistics Bureau director Zhang Quanyuan.
</P>
<P>
The annual per-capita income for farmers was 3,029 yuan last
year, far more than the national average. The per-person living
space was 10.61 sq m for urban dwellers, and 28.52 sq m for rural
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Opposition Split over Planned Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Nationwide strike set for Friday
has split Kenya's opposition ranks, as two key opposition leaders
say no to the strike which is planned by opposition's umbrella
body National Convention Executive Committee (NCEC).
</P>
<P>
Opposition FORD-Asili Chairman Kenneth Matiba said Wednesday
that he is opposed to the mass action's timing, a day after
FORD-Kenya leader Kijana Wamalwa announced the same stance, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 30 opposition members of parliament and several
other opposition leaders said they fully supported the strike
call aimed to speed up the constitutional reform process, adding
all arrangements are in place to make sure it is a success.
</P>
<P>
A strike Friday would inconvenience Muslims greatly and would
also be impractical since the NCEC and the church had just
presented their seven resolutions on political reforms to the
president for approvement.
</P>
<P>
The strike should be suspended because President Daniel arap
Moi has instituted dialogue with interested parties, Wamalwa
stressed in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the door to peaceful and non-violent resolution of
constitutional issues remains open, all mass action such as the
threatened strike must be suspended," said FORD-Kenya
Secretary-General Gitobu Imanyara Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition lawmakers, led by Democratic Party
chief Mwai Kibaki, have urged "all workers, matatu (mini-bus)
operators, and business people to cooperate to make the Nane Nane
(August 8) strike a resounding success."
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers demanded that the government shelves the
Constitutional Review Commission Bill and the Statute Law Bill
until they are discussed between NCEC and the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan Labor Minister Philip Masinde declared illegal
the strike Sunday, warning that the government would not protect
workers who may lose their jobs as a result of participating in
the strike.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here Sunday, 10 Kenyan trade unions
accused the NCEC of hijacking the labor movement in the country
by calling for a strike.
</P>
<P>
The trade unions called on workers, leaders and the labor
movement to shun the strike and warned the NCEC to stop inciting
workers against their employers and the government.

deposits in commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
PCCI President Federico Pascual said that if the bill is
enacted into law, many of the country's depositors will have no
choice but to pull out their dollar deposits and transfer them to
other tax-free places.
</P>
<P>
At present, the total foreign currency deposits in various
banks in the country are estimated at 17 billion U.S. dollars.
They helped a lot to sustain the country's economic growth,
Pascual said.
</P>
<P>
If passed, the bill will defeat the country's economic
objective of attracting more dollar depositors and stunt the
growth of the banking industry because depositors will be
discouraged to put their foreign currencies in the local banks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this move is counter-productive to the
government, saying the change of the ground rule will directly
affect the economic objectives of the government at this time when
the country is slowly recovering from the July 11 currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to Pascual, the proposed law would directly affect
the import and export sectors, the manufacturing industry and
those who source raw materials from abroad or who are paid in
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Heat Produced from Waste in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
developed a new method to burn urban waste and produce heat for
electricity generation or heating.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Yan Jianhua, one of the leaders of the project, said that
some 40 researchers from the Thermal Engineering Institute of
Zhejiang University, got involved in the development.
</P>
<P>
According to Yan, the waste was put into a container to be
burned at a temperature of 800-900 degrees centigrade. "The size
of the waste can be reduced 90 percent after burning and the
closed container can prevent smoke pollution," said Yan.
</P>
<P>
People usually think that waste treatment was only an
environment-friendly activity with no economic returns. "The
concept is wrong," Yan said. "Waste treatment can be profitable."
</P>
<P>
The facility has been put in use in a thermal power plant in
east China's Shandong province. Last year alone, it treated more
than 60,000 tons of industrial waste and produced four million kwh
of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Also in June last year, a burning stove with a daily treatment
capacity of 65 tons of industrial waste was exported to the
Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Export Earnings Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's export earnings
reached 494 billion shillings (823 million US dollars at current
exchange rate) last year, a 13 percent increase over the 431
billion shillings in the year 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Minister for Industries and Trade William
Shija while presenting his ministry's 1997/98 budget estimates to
Parliament held in Dodoma Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report from Dodoma quoted Shija as saying, "Improved export
earnings was mainly due to high volume of industrial products and
raw products whose prices were also high."
</P>
<P>
Shija said 40 percent of the exports went to the European
Union (EU) countries where Tanzania imported goods worth 763.9
billion shillings (1.27 billion US Dollars) last year as against
834.2 billion shillings in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted, trade with member states of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the
Development Community for Southern Africa was not satisfactory
though there are signs for an increase following signing of trade
protocols.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Industries and Trade has started preparations
for a trade policy which will give direction of trade operations
in the country. The policy will stress on harmonization of the
country's requirement under free market and the globalization
network, Shija said.

<HEADLINE> Booming Private High-Tech Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Private enterprises in the
science and technology sector have emerged as major contributors
to China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
State Science and Technology Commission statistics for 1996
show that the nation's 100,000 private high-tech enterprises
employed over two million workers and had total sales of 270
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Private science and technology enterprises engaged in intensive
production account for some 70 percent of the total number of
enterprises located in 112 national or provincial new and high
technology development zones. In addition, skilled technicians
working in the private high-tech sector account for over 20
percent of the total number of employees, and high-tech products
account for well over 20 percent of total sales.
</P>
<P>
Some 450 private high-tech enterprises have annual sales of
over 100 million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Some two percent of the sector's total annual revenue is
dedicated to technical research and new product development, with
related allocations far exceeding those of most township and
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Booming township enterprises characterized China's economic
development in the 1980s, with private science and technology
enterprises emerging as the key to economic prosperity in the
1990s. Economists say the private high-tech sector will play an
even greater role in the future.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Objects Foreign Military Presence in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's new President Mohammad
Khatami has made a veiled call for the withdrawal of U.S. troops
from the Persian Gulf, according to a report here today.
</P>
<P>
"All the regional countries have to cooperate with each other
and build a secure and thriving region without the presence of
foreigners," he said at a meeting with Oman's special envoy
Mohamed al-Rawas on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In analysis, the new president said if the interests of foreign
powers coincided with those of the regional countries, then there
was no reason for their physical presence in the area because the
regional countries could defend their own rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
"If the foreign powers' interests were against (those of) ours,
then they should not be allowed to continue their presence in the
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States now has about 30,000 troops with heavy
military facilities in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Tehran sees the massive U.S. military presence as a major
threat to its national security, especially after Washington
threatened to take retaliatory measures if Iran is found
implicated in terrorist activities against American interests.
</P>
<P>
However, Khatami did state during his oath-taking ceremony
Monday that Tehran wants to have relations with all countries. In
so saying, he did not exclude the U.S. and Israel, as his
predecessor Hashemi Rafsanjani used to.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the Omani envoy delivered a message from
Sultan Qaboos in which he extended congratulations to Khatami and
stressed the need to further strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said "the fact that Iran and Oman are located at the
two ends of the strategic Hormuz Strait is of great significance,"
adding security and tranquility were the two basic criteria for
construction and development.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iran is extending a hand of friendship and
brotherhood to all countries especially those in the region
seeking friendly relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that cooperation as well as exchange of
ideas with regional states would prepare proper grounds for
better and more effective ties.

<P>
JERUSALEM, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli men enjoy one of the
highest life expectancy in the world, according to a report of The
Jerusalem Post today, quoting an announcement of the country's
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy in 1995 reached 79.5 among women and 75.5 in
men. Among Jews, those figures rise to 79.8 and 75.9
respectively. Since 1993, the life expectancies for both women and
men have increased by 0.4 years.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all females born between 1991 and 1995 will
live to be older than 81, with 50 percent of the males passing
78, predicted the CBS Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest world figures available for comparison showed that
in 1993, Israeli men were ranked third highest in the longevity
table at 75.5, slightly behind the Swedes. Japanese men live the
longest, an average 76.5. U.S. men had a life expectancy of 72.2.
</P>
<P>
Israeli women were in 17th position, averaging 79.1 years. In
comparison, Swedish women live to 82.3, Japanese to 83.1, and
Americans to 78.8.
</P>
<P>
Of Israelis born between 1991 and 1995, some 20 percent of
girls and 10 percent of boys will live to become
nonagenarians. Men who reached pension age between 1991 and 1995
can expect to live for an average of 15.6 years in retirement,
with 65-year-old women likely to live another 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli population by the end of 1996 totals 5,763,200 and
80.8 percent are Jews.

</P>
<P>
Ananiashvili's exuberant portrayal of Kitri in "Don Quixote"
was the climax of an international ballet star program of Russian

</P>
<P>
The classical ballet pieces included "Pas de Quatre",
"Giselle", "Nutcracker", "The Sleeping Beauty", "Raymonda",
"Carnival in Venice" and "Don Quixote Grand Divertissement".
</P>
<P>
Beijing's ballet enthusiasts crowded outside the theater
looking for a chance to gain admission ticket, some still hanging
around after the performance had started.
</P>
<P>
Ten ballet dancers were the most popular, and there were
prolonged cheers and long bursts of applause by Chinese ballet
lovers.
</P>
<P>
China Performing Arts Agency (CPAA), the organizer, said that
the city has never been treated to an exceptionally grand
performance like this one.
</P>
<P>
"I never imagined that a Chinese audience would understand
ballet so much. It's my greatest pleasure to make people happy,"
siad the 34-year-old ballerina, who is regarded the most
outstanding and successful combination of acting and dancing.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Ruheng, director of the National Ballet Troupe of China,
said the performance represents the highest standard of ballet
today. "We saw the unadulterated and exacting Russian classical
heritage. It's passionate, dramatic and exciting," the Chinese
ballerina who has co-operated with famous foreign ballet dancers
and companies, said.
</P>
<P>
She said she hopes China's ballet, which has a history of only
38 years, will study the elite materials from world-known ballet
companies.

<P>
COLOMBO, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
decided to implement compulsory education before long after
reports that 10 percent of the country's children are not
attending school, according to the Education Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that although the literacy rate in Sri Lanka

</P>
<P>
As a first step to enforce compulsory education in the country,
the ministry will conduct a countrywide research on children who

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Emerges as Most Cohesive Regional Grouping: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) has overcome its initial gloomy picture to
emerge as one of the most cohesive regional groupings in the
world, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Malaysian national news agency Bernama
published today in conjunction with the 30th anniversary of
ASEAN's founding tomorrow, Mahathir said ASEAN leaders had been
able to pull through despite early difficulties and make a success
of the organization.
</P>
<P>
"I must admit that when ASEAN was first formed, I was not too
hopeful that it would succeed. There were too many differences
between the parties to the agreement. It would not be possible for
them to cooperate but I must say I was wrong," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN was set up on August 8, 1967 when five founding members
-- Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand --
signed the Bangkok Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping now comprises nine members with Brunei
Darussalam joining in 1984, Vietnam in 1995 and Myanmar and Laos
in July this year.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that when ASEAN was formed, it was basically to
help resolve problems between neighbors.
</P>
<P>
There was some kind of tension, but ASEAN provided a forum to
resolve the problems, if not fully, at least to reduce the
tension, he said.
</P>
<P>
The member countries opened up their economy to foreign
investors and this resulted in economic growth and subsequent
prosperity, he said, adding that with the transfer of technology,
ASEAN countries themselves became able to participate in
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
"So I would say that over the 30 years, the initial gloomy
picture has been overcome and ASEAN has emerged as one of the most
cohesive groupings in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
On his fears for the region, Mahathir said ASEAN need to be
wary of efforts by outside parties to dominate their economy.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving into the so-called information age and
borderless world. We have to open up our economy (but) our own
companies and corporations are not yet strong enough to compete
with those coming from outside. There is a real danger of our
economy being totally dominated by foreign companies with huge
sums of money and greater technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the only way for ASEAN to react was to act together.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir does not rule out the possibility of a multi-media
convergence being forged among ASEAN countries in the future with
Malaysia pushing its Multi-media Super Corridor (MSC) project,
Singapore its Information Technology program and the Philippines
its own cyber scheme.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Suffers Setback in Insurance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Front government
suffered a major embarrassment in the Lok Sabha (lower house of
parliament) on Wednesday when it was forced to withdraw a
controversial bill on insurance reform at the time of voting, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to withdraw the bill, designed to open India's
insurance market to foreign firms, was taken when the government
encountered stiff resistance from the opposition Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) and other parties to the entry of multinational
companies into the insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram tried unsuccessfully to ward off this embarrassment as
they sought to defer the voting on the bill by appealing for more
time for further consultations.
</P>
<P>
The government gave in to the persistent demand for the
withdrawal of the bill when it became clear that a BJP-sponsored
amendment barring the entry of foreign companies would be passed
with the support of not only its allies but also the left parties,
which are constituents of the ruling 13-party United Front.
</P>
<P>
The Congress party, which supports the Gujral government from
outside, decided to abstain from the voting on the insurance
reform bill.
</P>
<P>
Though it declared opposition to the BJP amendment, it was
unable to muster sufficient numbers as most of its members had
left for the party's forthcoming plenary session scheduled for
August 8-9 in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament supporting the BJP-amendment clearly
outnumbered those opposing it.

NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- India's imports of petroleum,
which had been fixed at 24.98 million tons in the current fiscal
year, are expected to rise to 27.67 million tons due to increased
demand for petroleum products in the country, The Times of India
reported today.

<P>
The Oil Coordination Committee of India said on Wednesday that
the overall demand for petroleum products in the 1997-98 fiscal
year (from April to March) is estimated to increase from 88.18
million tons, which was originally projected, to 90.87 million.

<HEADLINE> Indian Minister Calls for Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram has appealed for more efforts towards environmental
protection because it goes hand in hand with economic growth, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar on environmental preservation, the
minister quoted a study as saying that environmental degradation
is costing 10 percent of India's national income.
</P>
<P>
Environmental costs of natural resources should be included in
the pricing of products like water and power, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking about environmental protection, Chidambaram said India
has the technology to arrest, prevent and reverse environmental
degradation, but lacks the ability to mobilize social and
political forces to set relevant initiatives in motion.
</P>
<P>
He said there is a tendency to put too much reliance on the
government in checking environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
The government should involve itself at three levels -- as
policy framers, regulators and punishing authority for violators
of law, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the involvement of community-level organizations
alone can safeguard the country's environment, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> NZ Minister Sacked by Party Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Sacked Associate Health
Minister Neil Kirton said this afternoon he had also quit his job
as Customer Minister, deepening a crisis within the New Zealand
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Kirton, a list MP from the New Zealand First party, was sacked
this morning as associate health minister by his party leader
Winston Peters, who is deputy prime minister in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Kirton had been at odds with Health Minister Bill English, who
is from the National Party.
</P>
<P>
Peters told the press that Kirton had ignored his instruction
to make no comment about the dispute with English, but Kirton went
on radio this morning in disregard to the clear instruction.
</P>
<P>
However, Kirton said at a press conference this afternoon that
no such instruction was given and he was sacked because of his
opposition to greater privatization of the health system.
</P>
<P>
He said he would remain an MP and would consider his future
with his NZ First,
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting after Peters dumped Kirton, the NZ
First caucus unanimously supported the decision made by Peters.
</P>
<P>
Under the coalition agreement, NZ First will name another MP to
fill the post left by Kirton, and any minister could only be
dismissed by the leader of his own party.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that if Kirton departs with NZ First, the
coalition will be in real trouble as the two partners, National
and NZ First, enjoy only a one-seat majority in the 120-member
parliament.

<HEADLINE> Five U.N. Peacekeepers Died in Helicopter Crash in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Five members of the U.N. Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) were killed when their helicopter
crashed last nignt in an Israeli-occupied border strip in south
Lebanon, the Daily Star reported this morning.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the crash, which took place late last night
near Bint Jbeil, 120 kilometers south of the Lebanese capital,
was not immediately known but appeared to be accidental, the Beirut
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter, an Italian air force Bell Augusta and one
of the five used by the south Lebanon-based U.N. peacekeeping
forces, was on its routine flight checking on UNIFIL positions
when it crashed in a valley between the villages of At-Tiri
and Rshaf.
</P>
<P>
It crashed just 800 meters west of At-Tiri on its way returning
to the UNIFIL headquarters at Naqoura, a UNIFIL source said,
adding that before the incident, the helicopter had landed briefly
at the Irish battalion's post in the village.
</P>
<P>
All five people on board were killed, the source said. The
pilot and co-pilot were Italians and one passenger was identified
as an Irish UNIFIL serviceman but the remaining victims'
nationalities have not been checked out.
</P>
<P>
The crash site was in an area heavily patrolled by
Israeli troops and their client the South Lebanon Army militia
and located between three SLA positions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army immediately declared a state of emergency in
the so-called "security zone", which the Jewish state established
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The five casualties brought to 214 the number of UNIFIL
personnel who have died in south Lebanon since the nine-nation
peacekeeping forces were first sent to the area in May,
1978.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Small Industries Urged to Form Linkages with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today called on small and medium scale industries
(SMIs) in ASEAN countries to form inter-firm linkages with their
larger counterparts to ensure the strengthening of the
industrialization base of the economy.
</P>
<P>
These linkages are important in ensuring the strengthening of
the industrialization base of the economy and providing market
access and the opportunities for cross-border transfer of
technology, he said when opening the ASEAN-East Asian Business
Forum here.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike some East Asian countries like Japan and Korea, the
SMIs in most ASEAN countries are still weak in terms of
inter-linkages with larger counterparts," he noted, saying it was
therefore their task to learn from these countries and try to
adopt and adapt the strategies to suit the requirement of each
country.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said in the new millennium, SMIs must assume a greater
and more important role in enhancing and strengthening the economy
of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the East
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that the SMIs must not only concentrate on
building up entrepreneurial expertise but must be competitive and
must be prepared to undertake changes to survive the competition
and respond flexibly to market needs.
</P>
<P>
The competitiveness of SMIs could no longer rely on cost
efficiency alone. Equally important was the ability to offer
products, services with higher quality and greater value added, at
internationally competitive prices, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SMIs must adopt a global perspective of manufacturing and
marketing, invest in the right type of technology and processes
for efficient production and undertake research and development to
develop and improve products to gain significant market share, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is for the entrepreneurs themselves to use their
creativity and innovative strategies to build up their market
niches, both domestically and globally, rather than just depending
on government assistance and facilities to spearhead their
development."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said it was envisaged that in a decade, ASEAN would
emerge as a unified Southeast Asia sharing common goals and
economic vision in making the region a boon to investors and
businesses alike.
</P>
<P>
Adjustments need to be made in the way investors and firms
operate in the region and under the new trade and industrial
environment, they must look ASEAN as one larger market and not
just relocating themselves just to serve one particular ASEAN
country, he said.
</P>
<P>
A major challenge to ASEAN would be to keep international trade
open, he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN presently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

KIEV, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Any attempt to cut the presidential
power through amending the Constitution will aggravate the social
and political situations in Ukraine, a senior Ukrainian official
warned Wednesday.

Speaking at a press conference, Presidential Administration
Office Superintendent Yevgein Kushnaryov said this sort of
attempts by some legislators may cause serious problems for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
As local press reported, the proposed amendments would
virtually eliminate the presidential veto, strip the president of
his power to dismiss the prime minister without legislative
backing.
</P>
<P>
Kushnaryov said though no one meant to question the
legislators' right to make amendments to the Constitution, it
would be wrong to ignore the clear-cut provisions on power
division.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Makes Fresh Bid to Persuade Return of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government today
sent a seven-member delegation to the neighboring Indian state of
Tripura in a fresh bid to persuade some 40,000 tribal refugees
there to return.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, led by lawmaker Ranjan Chakma, is expected to
visit different camps in southern Tripura and meet leaders of the
Chakma refugees, who fled their hometown in a brush war going on
between the armed forces and the pro-independent armed tribal
rebels since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,000 refugees were repatriated in two groups in 1994
while 7,000 others returned between March 28 and April 7 this
year after the peace talks made progress between the new
government and the tribal rebels.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation process, however, was halted as the refugees
claimed that Dhaka had not fully complied with its commitments,
under which the refugees should be provided with cash, food
rations, cattle, building materials and jobs.
</P>
<P>
After that, the refugee leaders in India declared that the
remaining refugees will not return home unless their repatriation
and resettlement are supervised by international bodies.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka, however, rejected the demand, arguing that the Indian
authorities did not allow international agencies to look after the
refugees in Tripura.
</P>
<P>
As the stalemate in the repatriation process cast a long shadow
on an expected peace accord on the decades-old tribal rebel
problem, the government decided to send the delegation to Tripura
to sort out the issues once again with the refugees and their
hosts.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, scheduled for a three-day visit, is to return
home on August 9.

but processed with western medicines as ingredients and deemed
dangerous after undergoing tests, the announcement said.

It added that the authorities also discovered that 26 brands of
purified bottled water on sale in the country do not meet
prescribed micro-organic and chemical standards after

billion dollars in short-term loans, accounting for about 28.5
percent of the total foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign debt in the country has increased continually in recent
years, amounting to 116.5 billion dollars in 1995 and 118 billion
dollars in 1996, Sjahrir, managing director of the Institute for
Economic and Financial Research, was quoted as saying by the local
press today.
</P>
<P>
He told the seminar that the increasing foreign debt was
related to the ballooning private sector debt. "There is an
indication that the private sector has a serious problem in paying
back its foreign debt. This must motivate all of us to avoid the
worst financial crisis, such as what occurred in Mexico."
</P>
<P>
Sjahrir said the country's current account deficit is
escalating. He estimated that the current account deficit in the
1998/99 period would reach 10.6 billion dollars, an increase of
800 million dollars from the estimated 9.8
billion dollars for this year.
</P>
<P>
"The current account deficit escalated because the export
growth slowed down while the import growth remained high," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Export is expected to grow about 12.5 percent and import 13.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The total export value is estimated to reach 53.9 billion
dollars in 1997, compared with 61.9 billion dollars for imports.
</P>
<P>
Sjahrir said that if the country can register an economic
growth of 7.7 percent this year, it will see a better performance
of 7.8 percent in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Volcano Normal Despite Minor Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Volcano Pinatubo was still in
normal condition despite four secondary explosions on Wednesday,
the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHIVOLCS)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the PHIVOLCS said some of the 1991 pyroclastic flow
deposits were still hot and steam-driven explosions could still
occur at the slopes of the volcano. It therefore warned the public
against venturing into the 10-kilometer-radius danger zone.
</P>
<P>
A total of four secondary explosions occurred at the slopes of
Mt. Pinatubo on Wednesday, shaking off pyroclastic deposits and
triggering lahar flow in several major river channels in Central
Luzon, the PHIVOLCS said.
</P>
<P>
The ash columns reached heights of up to 1,000 meters and
drifted to the northeast of the mountain, it said, adding that
light ashfall was observed at the Pinatubo Volcano Observatory in
Clark, a former U.S. Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
The PHIVOLCS said in an update report that no volcanic quake
was detected by the seismic monitoring network around the volcano
during the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Volcano Pinatubo erupted in 1991, killing at least 364 people
and wounding more than 184 others. Its last recorded eruption was
in 1992.

<HEADLINE> East China City Bolsters Products' Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Wenzhou in
east China's Zhejiang Province, held a fair yesterday in Beijing
to showcase the city's quality products, in a bid to wash away
people's impression that products from Wenzhou symbolize shoddy or
fake goods, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Wenzhou was widely known because of its
low-quality commodities. And such a perception has been rooted in
many Chinese people's minds.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990s, Wenzhou has been endeavouring to drive
its economy on a fast track by emphasizing quality, which has
resulted in satisfying achievements in the city.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the city hit 100 billion yuan in GDP. The number of
enterprises with sales exceeding 100 million yuan each totals more
than 40 in the city.
</P>
<P>
Years of ups and downs has taught Wenzhou that steady economic
development should rely heavily on the flourishing of brand
products and powerful enterprises, said Huang Weifeng, vice-mayor
of Wenzhou.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 categories of local best products, including
heavy-duty machines, chemicals, light machines, electronics,
motorcycles, garments and leather products are on display in the
Beijing Exhibition Hall.
</P>
<P>
The fair is scheduled to last through August 10 and is the
first of its kind the city held in Beijing to introduce its
products.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Traffic accidents claimed a total
of 615 lives in the Czech Republic during the first half of this
year, a 10 percent increase in victims compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Czech traffic police bureau said that
drivers and pedestrians separately accounted for one third and a
quarter of those killed in the 93,000 traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of cars per capita in the Czech Republic is
obviously lower than western European countries, the fatality rate
is much higher.
</P>
<P>
Czech fatalities in traffic accident per million population are
150, double the rate of Scandinavian countries.
</P>
<P>
A major cause for the high death rate was non-compliance with
traffic rules, such as driving after drinking alcohol, driving
against red lights and excessive speeding, a report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepal could have a better
harvest this year than last year, Nepali Ministry of Agriculture
said.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the rice field in eastern Nepal has been
cultivated, while the harvest of the pre-monsoon corn and rice was
fairly good across the country.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, this year's total harvest could be better than
last year, local press reported today quoting the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate rainfall in some eastern districts in recent days
may have left some places dry but none of the crops have been
adversely affected, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In central Nepal, rice plantation has been done as scheduled
thanks to the normal monsoon, the ministry said, adding most
farmers in the country planted rice in late June or early July as
the monsoon reached its peak level.
</P>
<P>
In all the three regions of western Nepal, crops are also in
good shape due to the normal monsoon, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of Nepalese depend on agriculture for
livelihood.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Cuts Overnight Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 7 (Xinhua) -- With the peso slowly gaining
ground against the U.S. dollar on the foreign exchange market, the
Philippine Central Bank has approved a reduction of its overnight
borrowing rate from 20 percent to 18 percent effective today.
</P>
<P>
The overnight lending rate, hiked from 22 percent to 26 percent
Monday, was also slashed to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank took the action as the peso rapidly
appreciated from 28.704 pesos to 28.51 pesos against the dollar
Wednesday with a total volume turnover of 74.1 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said Wednesday that the
move was also prompted by concern from business groups over the
high bank lending rates.
</P>
<P>
"The concern has been shifted from the foreign exchange rate to
interest rates. We expect a drop in the Treasury Bill rates with
the cut in the overnight rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the peso appreciation and the concurrent rise in the
volume of trade in the Philippine Dealing System, or the currency
trading system, were achieved without intervention from the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
During the past two weeks, the peso was sold at around 29 pesos
for a dollar on the foreign exchange market.

<HEADLINE> Developing China's Productive Forces-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- People's Daily has said that
China's success with socialist construction has come from
concentrating on developing productive forces.
</P>
<P>
It quotes Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), saying that the
socialist system's main contradiction is between increasing
demands for material and cultural improvement and backward
productive forces, which will last through the initial period of
socialism and affect all of society.
</P>
<P>
The CPC's fundamental task, therefore, is to concentrate on
developing productive forces. Only in this way can solutions to
all other social problems be found.
</P>
<P>
For a long time the Chinese people have dreamed of becoming
equal, independent and prosperous members of the global community,
the paper says, but there is still a gap between China and
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
China's efforts have paid off, however, as it now feeds the
world's largest population. Its GDP in 1995 was twice 1980's, and
by the year 2000 is expected to quadruple that of 1980.
</P>
<P>
So, experience has shown that the only way out is to
concentrate on developing productive forces. This was stated
repeatedly by Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's reforms and
opening drive, who said that the nature of socialism is the
liberation and development of productive forces, elimination of
poverty and polarization, and achieving prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Only by sticking to this can we adhere to the true socialist
system, Deng explained. In view of this, China's successes in the
reforms and opening-up drive can be attributed to the "one center
and two basic points".
</P>
<P>
The center is taking economic construction as the main
task. One of the basic points is adherence to the four cardinal
principles: adherence to Maxism, Leninism and Mao Zedong thought;
adherence to the Socialist Road; adherence to the leadership of
the CPC; and adherence to the people's democratic
dictatorship. The other is adherence to the reform and opening up
policy.
</P>
<P>
The article says that backed by "three beneficials" the Chinese
people can continue to push forward the reforms and opening-up
policy. This means that any method of development that is
beneficial to the development of socialism's productive forces,
beneficial to the socialist country's strength, and beneficial to
the improvement of the people's living conditions, can be applied.
</P>
<P>
If China sticks to these principles and the fundamental task it
can reach its final goal, the article says.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Appropriate Money for Expanding NATO Air Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will provide
near 1 trillion lira (about 550 million U.S. dollars) for a
project to expand a U.S. and NATO air base in Aviano, a city in
northern Italy.
</P>
<P>
The whole project includes the construction of more houses for
accommodation of U.S. servicemen and their dependents, shopping
facilities and other service facilities in the air base, local
press reports quoted a senior government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Defense Ministry also will allocate money for the
expansion project, he added.
</P>
<P>
The number of troops stationed in the air base will rise to
3,000 by the end of this century from 1,700 at present, the
official said, adding that the Aviano air base will then become
the largest U.S. and NATO air base in Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, some local officials have been worried about the
planned project, while local residents also have launched peaceful
protests outside the air base.

<P>
YANGON, August 7 (Xinhua) -- Drug control officials of Myanmar
and Thailand are meeting here to seek ways of reducing the use of
narcotic drugs and controlling HIV/AIDS in the Myanmar-Thai border
areas.
</P>
<P>
A two-day meeting, which began Wednesday, is being held between
a Myanmar delegation and a visiting Thai delegation under the
Myanmar-Thai joint narcotic drug control program, according to
today's official daily The New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The two delegations exchanged views on plans, strategies and
joint operations in implementing anti-drug projects in the
Kengtung and Tachilek areas in Myanmar and the Chiang Mai and
Maesai areas in Thailand, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the Bangkok-based Economic and Social Commission
for Asia and the Pacific and the U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP)
also gave suggestions at the meeting, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Thailand signed a drug control cooperation
agreement with the UNDCP in June 1992 and had implemented, between
1994 and the end of 1996, integrated and rural development, law
enforcement and demand reduction in Myanmar's Tachilek, Ahdee and
Hsanlu areas.

<HEADLINE> Italians Restrict Nighttime Airport Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Ministry of Environment
issued a decree today partially banning aircraft takeoffs and
landings at domestic airports at night, in an effort to curb noise
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, at all the airports except the
inter-continental airports in Rome, Milan and Bergamo, planes will
not be allowed to take off and land between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m.
The exceptions will include planes operating medical care,
emergency rescue and postal services.
</P>
<P>
As a component of anti-noise pollution package measures, it
aims at decreasing the noise nuisance for residents around the
airports.
</P>
<P>
The decree forces 16 airports to change time tables, and will
be put into operation next June 30.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increasing development of air transport, planes
generating noise levels lower than 60 decibels will not be
effected by the new decree.

<HEADLINE> River Eases Shandong Drought Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- The Yellow River in Shandong
Province, which has been dry for 132 days, received water from its
upper reaches yesterday morning, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The water, which flowed into the Bohai Gulf last night, is
expected to help ease the drought in western Shandong.
</P>
<P>
Kong Guofeng, an official with the Shandong Yellow River
Administration, said water flowed through the Lijin Hydrometric
Station at 510 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River, the main water source of western and northern
Shandong Province, dried up in Shandong and other provinces in
February after drought struck its upper and middle reaches.
Shangdong Province also experienced the worst drought in decades
this year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the local water conservancy department said the
precipitation will relieve the serious drought in southern
Shandong Province, but the drought in northwestern Shandong and
Jiaodong Peninsula is still severe.
</P>
<P>
More than 3.7 million hectares of farmland are suffering from
drought, and the direct economic loss is expected to reach more
than six billion yuan (722 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the last 25 years, the river has dried up 19 times. Experts
warned that the dry spells are longer each year.
</P>
<P>
The dry spells have cost industries and agriculture along the
Yellow River 26.8 billion yuan (3.2 billion US dollars) in the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The dry spells have also damaged the environment.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Palestinians to Resume Cooperation With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged here today the Palestinians to resume their security
cooperation with the Israeli authorities as tension builds up in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians should act on the information they have and
"if there are people there who are real serious threats to the
peace and to innocent civilians, they should be kept behind bars
if it is legal to do so," Clinton told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The people that murdered all those people, those innocent
civilians, are not trying to get a peace that they think is more
favorable to the Palestinians," the president added.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a duel bomb attack last week which killed
15 people and wounded more than 150 others in Jerusalem. The
suicide bombing has led to the Israeli closure of the self-ruled
Palestinian areas and the arrest of dozens of Hamas activists by
either the Palestinian Authority (PA) or Israel.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged Israel to take "a responsibility to try to
carry its end of the load," stressing "This has get to be a
two-way street."
</P>
<P>
He said he would send his special mediator Dennis Ross back to
the troubled region this weekend to talk to PA President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu mainly on
security.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
here today that she is planning to travel to the Middle East by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon speech, Albright urged both the Palestinians and
Israelis to do more to advance the peace process, which, she said,
had been set back for six months by a "crisis of confidence."
</P>
<P>
She asked the Palestinians to do more to contain terrorists,
while calling on the Israelis to refrain from undertaking
"unilateral acts" that erode Palestinian confidence.
</P>
<P>
Washington is not content with the Israeli construction of
Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem but reluctant to force it to
stop.
</P>
<P>
Press reports speculate that Ross and Albright may bring about
some new ideas to put the peace process back on track, but little
has been spelled out so far.

<HEADLINE> Emission Standards for Cement Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- All cement plants in China will
be required to government emission standards within the next three
years or will face forced closure.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Bureau, State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC), and State Bureau of Building Materials Industry has
introduced the measures to accelerate the standardization of dust
emission.
</P>
<P>
China's cement industry accounts for well over 60 percent of
the nation's annual six million tons of highly polluting dust
emissions.
</P>
<P>
Small township enterprises account for near 80 percent of
China's cement plants.
</P>
<P>
The SETC plans to eliminate the use of obsolete technology, and
is preparing to list acceptable new technology.

<P>
BEIJING, August 7 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
has achieved initial success in treating waste pollution in Taihu
Lake, one of China's largest lakes, "China Environmental News"
reports.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou established a joint

Joint efforts have led to the closure of 170 polluting
enterprises in the region, and have reduced emissions by an
estimated 15,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Huzhou allocated 25 million yuan (about 3.2 million million US
dollars) to renovate 12 key enterprises responsible for pollution.
</P>
<P>
Jiaxing built a new wastewater treatment plant at a cost of 30
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The province has introduced an environmental protection plan
based on reducing the volume of nitrogen and phosphorus flowing into
the lake.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 34 modern agricultural parks, ecological
villages and townships, and four-valley improvement project are
being constructed in a 52.5 sq. km. area.

BUENOS AIRES, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Professional footballers
ended the two-week long strike from July 22 on Wednesday, when the
Argentine Football Federation (AFF) and a television station paid
up to secure the release of six players.
</P>

The last three games of the season had to be squeezed into a
10-day period. Officials said that "it was vital to resume playing

WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said today that she will travel to the Middle
East at the end of the month provided progress is made in security
there.
</P>
<P>
"Provided there is some progress on security issues, I am
prepared to travel to the Middle East at the end of this month,"
Albright said in a speech at the National Press Club in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has come under pressure to continue
its active mediations between the Israelis and Palestinians as the
stalemate has been lingering for several months for the two sides
to come to the negotiating table on the Middle East peace process
and after last week's suicide bombings at a Jerusalem produce
market, which killed 15 people and injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator Dennis Ross will take a trip to the Middle East
this weekend in a hope to revitalize the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We now face a crisis of confidence that has put at risk past
gains and rekindled old animosities," Albright said. "The sine qua
non is a mutual commitment to security against violence. This is
basic. This is common sense."

<HEADLINE> Dow Bounces Back to Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip stocks bounced back
record highs today as bonds ended a brief slump, boosting
financial shares, and an alliance between Apple and Microsoft
added more fuel to the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 71.77 points to 8,259.31,
just topping last Wednesday's record close of 8,254.89.
</P>
<P>
Other major stock indicators also set new records, with the
technology-heavy Nasdaq market setting its sixth straight closing
high.
</P>
<P>
There was no big economic news to justify the day's strength,
but the bond market halted a three-session decline.
</P>
<P>
Most bellwether technology issues became active after Apple
Computer, which surged more than 6.5 U.S. dollars to 26.34 U.S.
dollars, announced a surprising alliance in which Microsoft will
invest 150 million U.S. dollars in the struggling computer maker.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 2-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was heavy
again at 565.22 million shares, more than 525.67 million in the
previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 7.95 to 960.32, and
the NYSE composite index rose 4.04 to 497.00, surpassing Thursday's
record highs by both measures.

<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.41 to 654.06,

the third straight record high for both measures.

<HEADLINE> 29 Apparently Survive in S.Korean Air Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Rescuers pulled charred bodies
today from the wreckage of a Korean Air jet that crashed in the
dense jungled hills near Guam's international airport and 29 of
the 254 people on board were found survived.
</P>
<P>
Flight 801, a Boeing 747, from Seoul, capital of South Korea,
went down five kilometers from its airport destination on the
U.S.-governed Pacific island at about 2:00 a.m. Wednesday local
time. It was carrying 231 passengers and 23 crew members when it
crashed in a driving rain.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said they had found all the survivors 17 hours after
the crash. The exact number of survivors was unclear. Korean Air
said there were 29 survivors, including four flight attendants;
other unconfirmed reports said between 27 and 30 people survived.
</P>
<P>
The survivors had been seated in the front of the plane, which
was largely intact. But the plane's pilot and co-pilot were
missing and presumed dead, the airline said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-nine bodies had been recovered from the smoldering
wreckage by the time the rescue effort was called off for the
night, said Ginger Cruz, a spokeswoman for Guam Gov. Carl
Gutierrez.
</P>
<P>
"We scoured the whole area all day today," Air Force Col. Al
Riggle said. "We know there are some bodies still down there, but
it's smoldering too hot."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton spoke by telephone with Guam's
governor to offer his own condolences, and the support of the
federal government as needed.
</P>
<P>
Rescue work was hampered because of rain-soaked sawgrass
covering the rocks that made it difficult to carry survivors.
Hundreds of rescuers had to make their way through mud and the
towering, razor-sharp sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
Two Navy CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters rescued survivors, many
of them burned. With the jet still smoldering, Navy Seabees moved
in backhoes to crack open the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
Korean Air planned to fly at least 300 relatives of victims and
survivors to Guam tonight. Airline vice-president Lee Tae-won said
a U.S. military transport plane will take some of the survivors
back to Seoul Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Boeing 747-300 delivered to Korean Air in 1984,
was trying to land at an airport that lacked both a main landing
system and a government-staffed control tower.
</P>
<P>
Some witnesses said they saw the plane was on fire or heard an
explosion before it went down to the ground. But one South Korean
survivor, Hong Hyon-sung, said there was no fire or explosion
before the crash.
</P>
<P>
Early reports quoted a White House official as saying that the
pilot reported fire before the accident. However, U.S. officials
later denied any report by the pilot.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to
investigate the accident and the voice and flight-data recorders
have been found and sent to Washington for analysis.

<HEADLINE> China Positive About Peace Mechanism on Peninsula: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 6 (Xinhua) -- China is positive about the
establishment of a peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula and
will adhere to this position in the four-party peace talks among
China, the United States, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) and South Korea, a spokesman for the Chinese delegation
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The four parties Tuesday kicked off an open-ended preparatory
session for the peace talks in Columbia Univercity's School of
International and Public Affairs in New York City.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has reportedly been focusing its discussions on
procedures of the four-party peace talks, including the date,
venue and agenda. The talks were proposed by U.S. President Bill
Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young Sam last April.
</P>
<P>
"China will act according to the principles of facilitating
peace and stability on the peninsula, work closely with the other
parties and make its efforts for progress in the talks and early
establishment of a peace mechanism," the spokesman said in a
briefing to the press.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that harsh reality has shown both in
the past and at present that continued tension on the peninsula
does not serve the interests of the people of the north or the
south of Korea, nor does it contribute to stability and peace in
Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that efforts must be made to change the situation
and find an effective way to long-term peace and stability," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed support for the reconciliation of the
south and north and improvement of relations between the DPRK and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that through sincere and candid consultations, a peace
mechanism will be put in place on the peninsula at an early date
and peaceful unification achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally, we should not fail to see that given the
confrontation and hostility between the DPRK and the ROK and
between the DPRK and the US for decades, the parties concerned may
come up with some different views with regard to the operational
procedure of the peace talks and ways to establish a peace
mechanism," the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the process leading to the establishment of a
peace mechanism on the peninsula is expected to be a long and
complicated one.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the talks calls for patience and unremitting
efforts from all parties," he stressed.

environment is a prerequisite for increased private sector
investment and sound economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, my government has long recognized that
sustained growth could only be possible once inflation has been
brought down under control," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year the economy grew by 6.4 percent and the gross
domestic product is projected to grow at 5.5 percent this year,
Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The on-going privatization is aimed at scaling down
government's direct involvement in commercial activities and
reducing budgetary costs arising from subsidies to red-ink
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is also aimed at promoting competition and improving
efficiency of enterprises and stimulating both local and foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
On poverty reduction, the president said that the government
has been pursuing reforms that are focused on the devolution of
social safety measures to local authorities and the restructuring
of the water and sanitation sector.
</P>
<P>
He promised to continue to give priority to this sector in the
future budgets.
</P>
<P>
Local and foreign bankers, businessmen and representatives of
international organizations are attending the three-day seminar
to seek ways of promoting growth and reducing poverty in Zambia
and Africa as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Croatian, Bosnian Leaders Reaffirm Commitment to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 6 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman and Chairman of the Bosnian Presidency Alija Izetbegovic
today reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the peace
agreements concerning Bosnia and the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders along with their top aides met in Split,
Croatia, for the summit meeting which was delayed several times
due to strained relations that the Bosnian Muslims have had with
Croats and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after the meeting said that meeting
dealt with the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement
concerning the whole Bosnia as well as the Washington agreement
concerning the Muslim-Croat federation and focused, "in
particular, on the strengthening of relations within the
federation... and its cooperation with the Republic of Croatia."
</P>
<P>
"The two sides confirmed readiness to conduct a consistent,
integral and accelerated implementation of the peace agreements
for the sake of strengthing peace and establishing and making
operational democratic institutions in Bosnia and Herzeovina, as
well as for the sake of the overall normalization of relations in
this part of Europe," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to expectations before the meeting, the leaders did
not sign any agreements but merely agreed that draft agreements on
a number of issues would be exchanged by September 1 and a joint
experts group would try to iron out differences in the following
three months.
</P>
<P>
The issues which require special attention are the use of
Ploce, which is a Croatian port but built with Bosnian investment
before the war, and transit through Neum, a Bosnian city which
cuts into the Croatian coastline, as well as property claims,
investment protection and dual citizenship, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, the two leaders met with a U.S. delegation
led by Assistant Secretary of State for Europe Robert Gelbard and
Richard Holbrooke, who brokered the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival in Split, Holbrooke said that the peace
process in Bosnia was moving "at much too slow a pace" and he and
hid fellow delegates were trying to "accelerate the process and
keep it moving forward."

<HEADLINE> US Fed Survey Shows Moderate Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is expanding
moderately in much of the nation, with prices remaining stable
despite tighter labor markets, a survey by the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) said today.
</P>
<P>
"Economic activity generally expanded at a moderate rate in
many districts in June and July, although several reported that
growth was more brisk," the Fed survey of regional business
conditions said.
</P>
<P>
It said that labor markets tightened further, but only
scattered wage pressures were noted. "Prices for most goods were
stable, although reports indicated that lumber and some
agricultural prices rose."
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the Fed's 12 district banks and known
as the beige book because of the color of its cover, will be used
by policy makers of the U.S. central bank when they meet on August
19 to consider monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Although the Fed's Open Market Committee met in May and July,
it has not raised short-term interest rates since it raised the
federal fund rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.5
percent on March 25.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government reported last week that the economic growth
slowed to an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the April-June quarter
following a strong 4.9 percent rate in the first quarter. But
analysts expect it to regain in the second half of the year some
of its first-quarter strength.
</P>
<P>
Few signs of substantial price hikes have emerged so far and
many analysts believe the U.S. Fed will leave rates unchanged for
now as it awaits more economic data.

system to the university which prompted the establishment of this
computer center.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the Cameroun-China cooperation in
higher education has made encouraging progress.
</P>
<P>
With the help of Chinese professors and technicians, he noted,
a micro-biological lab was set up at the University of Yaounde in
1991 and a Chinese language center established in the
International Institute of the University of Yaounde in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people are the sincere friends of Camerounians, Tabi
said, adding that they help Camerounians master technical
know-how.

technology commission of china, is currently visiting the country

Camerounian friends in promoting the scientific and technological
development and encouraging the two nations' economic growth.

<HEADLINE> US Teen-Agers Use More Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 6 (Xinhua) -- The use of heroin by U.S.
teen-agers is on the rise despite a slight decline in abuse of
marijuana, and the drug abuse rate is still much higher than it
was in 1992, a government report said today.
</P>
<P>
The annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse released
today said 9 percent of U.S. teens used drugs in 1996, compared
with 10.9 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the survey also showed that drug use among 18 to 25 year
old young people increased from 13.3 percent in 1994 to 15.6
percent in 1996. And more teens tried heroin for the first time
last year than ever before.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, use of marijuana by teen-agers
declined very slightly from 8.2 percent to 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 22 percent of children aged 12-17 reported they had
used an illegal drug sometime during their lifetime and 48 percent
of young adults 18 to 25 had used some illegal drug. Over half of
Americans aged 26 to 34 have tried illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
The report said the rates of first use of heroin rose for both
those aged 12-17 and those aged 18-25 from 1990 to 1995. For
teen-agers, 2.5 percent reported first use of heroin in 1995, up
from 1.8 percent in 1994. For young adults, first use was reported
by 2.4 percent, up from 1.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Although marijuana use has dropped a bit, we remain concerned
that cocaine may be inching back up and heroin use is definitely
increasing," warned White House national drug policy director
Barry McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, 6.1 percent of the entire population used illegal
drugs in 1996, unchanged from 1995, but down from 14.1 percent in
1979.
</P>
<P>
The report also said there were 62 million American smokers of
all ages, representing 29 percent of the population. Teen tobacco
use remained flat at 18 percent, although use of smokeless tobacco
declined from 2.8 percent to 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
On alcohol, the report said about 9 million Americans under age
21 drank alcohol in 1996, including 4.4 million "binge drinkers,"
who had at least five drinks on one occasion in the last month.
There were 1.9 million heavy users, who binged at least five times
over the past month.
