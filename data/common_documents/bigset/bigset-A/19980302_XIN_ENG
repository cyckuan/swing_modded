<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Information Minister
Mushahid Hussain Sayed Sunday blamed the Awami (People's) National
Party (ANP) for breaking the ruling alliance on a "non-issue".
</P>
<P>
The ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N) felt that the
renaming of the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) as
"Pukhtoonkhwa" "was not an issue which concerned the people of
province," Mushahid told reporters in Lahore, eastern Pakistan,
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate that an attempt was being made to convert a
non-issue into an issue," he was quoted as saying by the official
Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the PML-N under the leadership of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has a consistent commitment to extend support for
provincial autonomy.
</P>
<P>
He expressed PML-N's sorrow that this nine-year relationship
between the ANP and PML-N has been terminated unilaterally and
abruptly.
</P>
<P>
The ANP, mainly based in the NWFP, Thursday formally broke its
nine-year old political alliance with the PML-N following a
categorical "No" by the latter's leadership regarding the renaming
of the NWFP.

<P>
CAIRO, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from countries in the Middle East:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Italy will grant Egypt a soft loan of 20 million U.S.
dollars according to an agreement signed on Sunday between the two
countries, the Egyptian Al-Ahram daily reported.
</P>
<P>
An Italian diplomat in Cairo said that Italy's assistance is
intended to help develop Egypt's small and medium-sized projects
in a bid to reduce unemployment and boosting economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat added that Italy's General Investment Agency has
also agreed to offer 2 million dollars to Egypt in technical
assistance to promote ties between businessmen and investors of
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The World Bank has expected that Egypt's economy will
grow at an annual average rate of 7 percent to the year of 2000,
the Al-Ahram said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Director for the Middle East and North African Region of the
World Bank Kamal Darwish said that Egypt's average per capita
income will also rise to 1,100 dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
He added that Egypt's efforts to attract foreign investments,
its good investment management and fighting unemployment and
poverty will ensure the high prospects.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- According to a report of the Cairo Chamber of
Commerce, Egypt imported 3.7 billion pounds (1.09 billion dollars)
worth of wheat in 1996, 553 percent more than that in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Supplying more than 70 percent of Egypt's total imports of
wheat, the United States has been at the top of the exporting
countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Hassan Massoud, director of the Arab Center for Dry
Region and Arid Land Studies of the Arab League, has said that the
crisis over water resources in the Arab world will intensify in
the coming years with the rapid increase of the population.
</P>
<P>
The area of the Arab world accounts for 10.4 percent of that of
the earth, but it has only 0.01 percent of the water resources of
the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Water resources of the Arab region stand at 264.6 billion cubic
meters, including 225.3 billion cubic meters of surface water and
39.3 billion cubic meters of underground water.
</P>
<P>
MUSCAT -- Oman exported 278.938 billion barrels of oil in the
first 11 months of 1997, according to statistics issued by the
Omani Ministry of Economy.
</P>
<P>
This shows 3.2 percent more than the export in the same period
of 1996.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Meet with Sinn Fein, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam said Sunday she was "in no doubt" Prime
Minister Tony Blair would meet Sinn Fein to discuss the crisis in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"I am in no doubt he will see them but the time decision is
his. When I spoke to him on Friday, he had yet to make a
decision," Mowlam told BBC television.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, was
barred from the peace talks until March 9 for the IRA's
involvement in two killings last month. Sinn Fein, which denied
the connection with the killing, asked for a meeting with Blair to
discuss the problem.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam added that despite the setback due to recent violence in
the divided province, she was still confident the talks would
produce an agreement. The final deal must then be put to an
all-Ireland referendum set for May 7.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident we can reach some kind of accommodation in the
next six to eight weeks and hopefully a referendum at the
beginning of May," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tight timetable and we are working very hard to get the
legislation together, to get the electoral machine up... and we're
aiming for May 7," she said.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which started last September, are designed to
decide the future of Northern Ireland, where the IRA began a
guerrilla campaign 29 years ago to unite the province with the
Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
However, the largest Protestant party Ulster Unionist Party
urged Britain Friday to extend Sinn Fein's suspension while
another smaller pro-British party threatened to walk out of the
talks if Blair met Sinn Fein before March 9.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Begins Privatization Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Qatari government has begun
implementing a privatization program by transferring the operation
and maintenance of a power and water desalination plant to a
public company.
</P>
<P>
According to a deal between the government and the public
company, Qatar Electricity and Water Company (QEWC) will operate
Ras Abu Fontas-B power and water desalination plant from July
after the handover is completed.
</P>
<P>
QEWC has a market capitalization of some 275 million
U.S. dollars, with 43 percent of shares owned by the Qatari
government and 57 percent by Qatari investors.
</P>
<P>
The power and water desalination plant currently produces 650
megawatt hours of power and 33 million gallons of water a day. The
government signed another agreement with QEWC Friday to buy 80
percent of the production, said the Qatari news agency.
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of a privatization program in the
country," the agency monitored here quoted Yousef Hussein Kamal,
Qatari Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade, as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program, suggested by the World Bank, covers
many sectors, including large-scale privatization of other
government-owned industries, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, Qatar's two other power and desalination plants - Ras
Abu Fontas-A and Ras Abu Aboud - will continue to be run by the
government.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Reform Proposals Under Study: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is still
studying the Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) land plan, which was
unveiled in January as an alternative to the government's
intention to acquire over five million hectares of land to
resettle landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai Sunday told the
Zimbabwe News Agency that the government had also received a
number of proposals from various organizations suggesting other
ways in which the government could acquire and distribute land.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to give you my assurance that the government is
seriously studying all the proposals and will respond in due
course," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, some of the proposals had a number
of positive aspects which the government could take without
compromising its intentions to resolve land imbalances brought
about by the colonial regime.
</P>
<P>
The CFU, in its alternative land plan, offered to give the
government 1.5 million hectares of land for resettlement purposes
and over 15 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 900 million U.S.
Dollars) to facilitate the implementation of the program.
</P>
<P>
"Let me also emphasize that the government of Zimbabwe intends
to move ahead with a land reform program that empowers the
indigenous people of this land and contribute substantively to
the eradication of poverty," Kangai said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has a total land area of 39 million hectares and
about 5,000 white commercial farmers own a total of 15.5 million
hectares of agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the government announced intentions to acquire more
than five million hectares of land to resettle landless blacks.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Union Reaffirms Mass Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Sunday reaffirmed its position over the proposed
mass boycott Tuesday and Wednesday and is appealing to all
workers to ignore calls to report for work by people who are not
part of the labor body.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum addressed to all workers and signed by
Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirai, the ZCTU said all workers
should remain at home for the two days.
</P>
<P>
It said workers should also not commute into towns during the
two mass boycott days as this could result in outbreaks of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU has called for a mass work boycott on the two days to
press the government to remove a 2.5 percent sales tax on goods
and services, drop the five percent development levy, 15 percent
tax on pensions and restore prices of basic goods to their
pre-July 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
The labor movement had sent the government an ultimatum to
resolve these issues by February 27 or face a mass boycott by the
workers.
</P>
<P>
However, the move has been roundly criticized by the
government with cabinet ministers, leading counter-calls for
workers to report to work as usual on the said days.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Calls for Urgent Talks With Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government, in a
last effort to avert the Tuesday and Wednesday mass job stayaway,
invited the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) Sunday for
urgent talks.
</P>
<P>
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Minister Florence
Chitauro said in a statement that the government was committed to
finding solutions to the current economic problems.
</P>
<P>
"I am inviting the ZCTU for another meeting Monday March 2,
1998 following its general council meeting held on February
26-27, 1998," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU Friday called for a mass stay-away from work to press
for the scrapping of the five percent development levy and 15
percent tax on pensions as well as the removal of the two and
half percent sales tax increase on goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The workers also want prices of basic goods restored to their
pre-July 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro warned all workers that the job stay-away was illegal
and urged them to report for duty and employers to open their
businesses.
</P>
<P>
"During the two days, the government expects all businesses to
operate as usual and has put in place adequate security measures
to make that possible," Chitauro said.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro is one of several cabinet ministers who have made
desperate calls for workers to ignore the job stay-away declared
by the ZCTU.
</P>
<P>
But the ZCTU Secretary-General Morgan Tsvangirayi Sunday sent
out memos to workers reaffirming the work stoppage despite the
pleas by the government.

<HEADLINE> PNA Denied Involvement in Weapon Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has denied any involvement in weapon smuggling as
charged by Israel.
</P>
<P>
A PNA senior official, Ahmed Abdul Rahman, told the Israel
Radio on Sunday that the PNA has never involved itself in weapon
smuggling, nor did it have any prior knowledge of the attempted
weapon smuggling by a Palestinian on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A 27-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank was captured by
the Israel Defense Force (IDF) along the northwestern shore of the
Dead Sea Friday night with two motorized rubber dinghies loaded
with 60 Kalashinkov assault rifles, seven shotguns, 38 pistols
and thousands of rounds of ammunitions smuggled from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak
told the Israeli cabinet on Sunday that the weapon smuggling was
"intended for the elements of the Palestinian Authority."
</P>
<P>
Rahman, however, strongly denied the allegation, saying the
incident seemed to be a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
"Such an effort was not to be the work of an individual, but of
an organized International gang comprising Arabs and Israelis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Friday night, the IDF and Jordanian army officers
were in constant contact over the incident, and Israel's General
Security Service (GSS) has contacted on Sunday with its Jordanian
counterpart on strengthening security cooperation along the border.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were being checked for fingerprints and test-fired
to see if they had been used in previous attacks in Israel or if
Israeli police had a record of them.

BONN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Gerhard Schroeder was re-elected
premier of the western German Lower Saxony state Sunday by winning
over 47 percent of the vote, showed exit polls published by German
television immediately after the end of the local vote.
</P>
<P>
The result greatly boosted Schroeder's chances to be selected
by Germany's main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) as its
candidate to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl at the general
elections in September.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary projections of the television
network ZDF, Schroeder won 47.5 percent of the vote, up from 44.3
percent he won in the 1994 local elections.
</P>
<P>
He has vowed to drop his bid for the chancellor candidacy of
the SPD if he falls two percentage points below the 1994 showing.

The SPD is due to nominate its chancellor candidate Monday

<HEADLINE> Zambian Trade Unions Warned Against Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian employees and trade unions
here Sunday were warned against taking industrial action or they
risk being fired and de-registered respectively, according to
Zambia News Agency ZANA.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Lusaka, Newstead Zimba, Labor
and Social Security Minister, said that the employees and trade
unions will risk punishment if they take any action contrary to
the "laid-down" procedures.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made after the dialogue on a wage freeze
between the government and trade unions came to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zambian trade unions warned the government they
will go on a nationwide one-day strike scheduled for March 9 as a
protest to its wage increment freeze during this year in the
public sectors.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said that by powers of the country's industrial and
labour relations act, he can cancel the certificate of a trade
union if it wilfully violates the act.
</P>
<P>
He gave warnings in particular to Zambia Congress of Trade
Union (ZCTU), the largest labor organization in the country.
</P>
<P>
If ZCTU violates any provision of the relevant act, including
organizing strike action outside the law and without the
authority by a strike ballot, said the minister, it can be
de-registered.
</P>
<P>
Zimba also warned the employees who may be led into taking
part in an illegal action that the government will show no
sympathy to such "willful disregard of authority".
</P>
<P>
"Such persons will be summarily dismissed with no recourse to
appeal and will forfeit their terminal benefits," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government declared at the end of last year that
it will in 1998 freeze the wage increment for employees in the
public sectors, which has met strong objections from the
country's public service workers and their trade unions.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Left by Gulf War Threaten Lives of Iraqis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has defused more than 14,314
unexploded bombs, explosives, missiles and mines left over from
the Gulf War in 1991 over the past year, the Iraqi news agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Mohamed Nouri, Director of Civil Defense in
Iraq, as saying that the aircraft of the U.S.-led allied troops
dropped millions of bombs and explosives throughout the country
during the war.
</P>
<P>
He said that civil defense squads were still dealing with these
mines and bombs, particularly in the governorates of Al Muthanna
and Nagaf, southwest of Iraq and adjacent to the Saudi Arabian
borders.
</P>
<P>
According to Nouri, a number of army officers and civil defense
personnel died during handling of the bombs and mines in
1997. Besides, a large number farmers and herdsmen were killed or
maimed by bombs or mines, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Gulf War was touched off by Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait. Iraqi troops were driven out of Kuwait by the
U.S.-led allied forces after a seven-month long occupation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reaffirms Condition on Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel reaffirmed its readiness
on Sunday to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon if Lebanon
would curb cross-border guerilla attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai told a weekly
cabinet meeting that Israel is willing to carry out the United
Nations Resolution 425 and pull out from south Lebanon in exchange
for guarantees that it would not be attacked by Muslim fighters
from Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution calls for respect for the independence and
sovereignty of Lebanon and demand an unconditional withdrawal of
Israeli troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
According to a cabinet statement, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said at the meeting that Israel would not pull
back from south Lebanon unilaterally because Israel believes such
a move would intensify Hezbollah's attacks on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 to allegedly protect its northern areas from attacks by
Lebanese resistance forces.
</P>
<P>
For more than a decade, Israeli troops have suffered heavy
losses in south Lebanon. In 1997, more than 100 Israeli soldiers
were killed. Peace groups and activists in Israel have called on
the government to withdraw from south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> UAE Foodstuffs, Assistance Arrive in Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Five trucks carrying 180 tonnes of
foodstuffs and 40 tonnes of clothes and blankets provided by the
Red Crescent of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) arrived here
Sunday, the Iraqi news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted Saeed Mohamed Mansouri, head of the UAE
delegation, as saying that these foodstuffs and assistance are an
expression of UAE's solidarity with the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the UAE sent 80 tonnes of medicine and medical
supplies to the Iraqi people as a gift to help them overcome the
difficulties caused by the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq since 1990
against its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The UAE is considered the country that has extended most
humanitarian assistance to Iraq in the region. UAE President
Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan has repeatedly called for an
early lifting of the U.N. sanctions in order to relieve the Iraqi
people of their sufferings.

<HEADLINE> mee030116hke - Iran, Italy Voice Readiness to Promote Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 1 (Xinhua) - Iran and Italy on Sunday announced
their readiness to promote relations and cooperation, following
the European Union (EU) decision to resume contacts with Iran at
ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Majlis (Parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri met
with visiting Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini to call for
further promotion of parliamentary cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Nouri lauded Italy's opposition to the d'Amato Act of the
United States threatening to punish any company which has an
investment of more than 20 million U.S. dollars in Iran's oil and
gas sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the EU has approached the issue in a
positive manner, Italy was a forerunner in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current situation as a preamble to expansion of
relations, Nouri hoped that the two countries' parliamentary
groups would be able to play a role in further enhancing bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Dini said that following the improvement of relations between
Europe and Iran, the U.S. would become familiar with the
important position and role of Iran, and would finally be forced
to change its behavior towards Iran, according to the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
The Italian minister arrived here Saturday evening on a
three-day official visit, the first by a European minister since
the EU banned ministerial-level contacts with Iran following a
German court ruling that Iranian leaders were behind a terrorist
assassination of Kurdish dissidents in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided to lift the ban on Monday but still expressed
concern on Iran's stance over terrorism, production of weapons of
mass destruction, the Middle East peace process and the death
sentence on the British writer Salman Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Iranian counterpart Kamal
Kharrazi here Sunday, Dini voiced content with continuing
Rome-Tehran dialogue and hoped it would pave the way for dialogue
between Iran and other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Terming Tehran-Rome relations as "very satisfactory," he said
that Italy was Iran's major trade partner and Rome was determined
to further promote its cultural relations with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the EU "critical dialogue" with Iran over
the past years was unsuccessful, and said the European body has
decided to seek "open talks and direct contacts with Iran."

<HEADLINE> Serious Budget Deficit Forecasted for Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The budget deficit of Gulf Arab
countries will amount to 12 billion U.S. dollars in 1998 if the
oil prices stay at 12 to 15 dollars a barrel, a report issued by a
bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) are
estimated to earn a revenue of 74.32 billion dollars this year
based on the aforesaid oil prices against their projected
expenditures of 86.73 billion dollars, the report of the Emirates
Industrial Bank said.
</P>
<P>
This year's forecast deficit of GCC states indicates an
increase of 4.61 billion dollars compared to that of last year,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
The projected budget deficit this year of the six countries are
as follows: the UAE stands at 480 million dollars, Saudi Arabia
4.8 billion, Bahrain 200 million, Oman 780 million, Qatar 950
million and Kuwait 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report, however, predicted a soaring deficit if oil prices
continue to slump as the six states are seriously reliant on oil
exports, which comprise nearly two thirds of their incomes.
</P>
<P>
The oil price has dropped to 14 dollars a barrel recently from
an average of more than 19 dollars a barrel last year.
</P>
<P>
The price began to fall last December when the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries decided to raise its output ceiling
by 10 percent, or 27.5 million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The slump has been exacerbated by a mild winter in northern
hemisphere, Asia's economic turmoil and Iraq's return to the world
oil market with an increased amount of oil to sell.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has allowed Iraq to raise from 2.1 billion
dollars to 5.2 billion dollars the amount of oil it can sell every
six months under the U.N. oil-for-food program.

<HEADLINE> Qatari, Egyptian Leaders Discuss Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani Sunday held talks with his Egyptian counterpart
Hosni Mubarak over telephone on ways of improving bilateral
relations, the Qatari news agency monitored here reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed "friendly" relations between the two
countries and ways of boosting and developing such relations in
various fields, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It gave no further details, but informed sources in Doha said
the Qatari Emir's phone call was mainly aimed at bringing a
three-month war of words with Cairo to an end.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Qatar and Egypt strained when Cairo refused
to attend the Middle East and North Africa economic conference
held in Doha last November in protest of Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
Such a move caused Doha's retaliation by sacking Egyptian
employees working in Qatari government departments.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Khalifa al-Thani held talks late last year in
Riyadh under Saudi mediation, but the talks failed to lead to a
total thaw of ice between the two countries.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Most members of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, have arrived in
Beijing for the committee's first annual session on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By this afternoon, when registration for the session was

<P>
The Ninth CPPCC National Committee has a record 2,196 members,
103 more than the Eighth. The new members are nearly two years
younger on average than their predecessors, and more than half of
them are attending the session for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"Only by constantly recruiting new blood can the CPPCC maintain
its vigor and vitality," said Li Ruihuan, incumbent chairman of
the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee represent 34
different social circles. The science and technology circle has
contributed 186 members, more than any other circles.
</P>
<P>
The oldest member of the new CPPCC national committee is Xie
Bingxin, a well-known writer who was born in 1900. Li Xiaoshuang,
a 25-year-old world champion of gymnastics, is the youngest.
</P>
<P>
Since this year's CPPCC session is the first one following Hong
Kong's return to China on July 1 last year, the number of members
from Hong Kong, now a special administrative region of China, has
greatly increased, with their official title changed from "Hong
Kong compatriots" to "Specially-invited figures from Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
"Attending the session is an opportunity to discuss and
participate in the running of state affairs. We will cherish this
opportunity to contribute to maintaining Hong Kong's long-term
prosperity and stability," one of the Hong Kong members said.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources said that the session's Proposals Examination
Committee, which was just formed this afternoon, has already
received 173 proposals from the members.
</P>
<P>
The first proposal was submitted by the Central Committee of
the China Democratic National Construction Association, one of
China's eight non-Communist parties, calling for a faster
development of China's risk investment sector.
</P>
<P>
"Such kind of proposal is rare in the previous CPPCC sessions,"
an official with the Proposals Examination Committee commented.
</P>
<P>
Xu Liangjie, a private businessman from east China's Fujian
Province who was elected to the CPPCC National Committee for the
first time, described the current period as the "second Spring"
for China's non-state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"I will center my advice on the role non-state businesses can
play in reforming state-owned enterprises, the way to develop a
national industry and the creation of China's own famous brands,"
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Chosen for First Telemedicine Application </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has been chosen as
one of the three locations worldwide for the first ever Patient
Information Folder (PIF), a telemedicine application system,
Malaysia's national news agency Bernama reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The PIF system was demonstrated to Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad at the Technology Park Malaysia here Monday by
Prof. R. I. Kitney of Imperial College of Science, Technology and
Medicine, London, who developed the system.
</P>
<P>
The telemedicine application gives healthcare professionals
direct access to leading specialists in other countries through
computers and also enables doctors at designated hospitals to gain
access to medical records of patients using smartcard.
</P>
<P>
PIF is an advanced electronic patient record system which is
capable of handling a very wide range of multi-media data.
</P>
<P>
Pusat Pakar Utara (Northern Center of Experts) in Kedah,
northern Malaysia, has been selected to carry out clinical trials
simultaneously with St. Mary's Hospital and Hammersmith Hospital
in London and University of Southern California in Los Angeles of
the United States in four weeks' time.
</P>
<P>
Kitney was quoted as saying Monday the trial run was expected
to take three months while the general usage worldwide would be
one year after evaluations.
</P>
<P>
Kitney said Malaysia was picked as one of the clinical trial
centers as the country was developing the Multimedia Super
Corridor (MSC).
</P>
<P>
PIF provides the integration of the national healthcare
community into international medicine, allowing patients who had
sought specialist care abroad to be treated within their local
environment.

<HEADLINE> US Congressmen Urged to Tackle Iraq Issue Wisely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of Iraq's National
Assembly (parliament) Saadoun Hammadi on Monday called on
U.S. congressmen to resort to wisdom in tackling the Iraq issue.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the official Iraq News Agency,
Hammadi said the Iraq issue is concerned with the fate of 22
million people, with world peace and security, and with the
interests and reputation of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The speaker was reacting to a call by Republic members in the
U.S. House of Representatives urging the Administration to veto any
U.N. Security Council resolution that would not involve using
force spontaneously against Iraq if Baghdad violates its recent
deal with the U.N. over weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Republican Party and it representatives in both the
Senate and the House of Representatives have shown much ardor for
an aggressive plan against Iraq, Hammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He accused them of seeking to "get the ruling Democratic Party
involved in a military adventure that would achieve for the U.S.
nothing but further isolation and failure, and would do harm to
the U.S. reputation and interests, especially in Arab and Islamic
countries."
</P>
<P>
Hammadi said that such an adventure, if materialized, would
have no political or practical effects on Iraq, and that it would
produce results contrary to the interest shown by the U.S
Administration in the work of the U.N. Special Commission charged
with dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The only victor in the Iraq-U.N. deal on the work of weapons
inspections is the logic of peace and goodness whether it is in
Iraq, in the U.S. or in the international community at large,
while the only one harmed by this deal is the logic of evil and
aggression," said Hammadi.
</P>
<P>
Reports said speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Newt
Gingrich, had warned that the passing of a weakened resolution by
the U.N. Security Council would be a victory for Iraq and would do
great harm to U.S. credibility.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Is Important Form of Promoting Democracy, Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The People's Political

affairs. In other words, principal policies, major political
affairs and key economic and social issues will be submitted for
consultation before final decisions are made, he said.

members will exercise their effective supervision over the
implementation of the Constitution, laws and regulations, major
state principles and policies and official duties performed by

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Further Develop Export-Oriented Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Beijing Mayor Jia Qingli said here
today that the Chinese capital will open further to foreign
investors and continue to develop its export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
He said Beijing will expand efforts to increase exports and
maintain substantial growth in the influx of overseas capital. Jia
made the comments in an address to a conference on the city's
foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investments and external trade are rapidly emerging as
the leading forces forming the backbone of the city's economic
growth, and Beijing must rely on both the domestic and foreign
markets to develop an export-oriented economy," said Jia.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Beijing has approved about 13,000
foreign-funded enterprises in recent years, with total contracted
investments standing at 21.3 billion US dollars. The actual influx
of some 11.7 billion dollars in foreign capital accounts for 30.7
percent of the city's total investments in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, the total added industrial output value
of Beijing's foreign-funded enterprises accounted for
approximately 60 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
Attracting additional foreign investment will be an important
factor in Beijing's ability to readjust its industrial structure.
</P>
<P>
Jia noted that advanced technology and equipment introduced by
foreign investors has helped narrow the gap between Chinese
enterprises and their overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing's export volume has increased
14-fold over the past two decades and stood at 9.6 billion dollars
at the end of 1997. The city has also established 240 enterprises
in 60 countries and regions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jia said Beijing will continue to pay close attention to the

<HEADLINE> Official: Indian Parties Facing Crisis of Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chief Election Commissioner Dr.
M. S. Gill said Monday that there is a crisis of confidence among
the political parties in India.
</P>
<P>
In a special election program on Doordarshan television here,
Gill said things were going out of control and that conducting
free and fair elections in a vast country like India is becoming
more and more difficult.
</P>
<P>
He said all the political parties should evolve a model code of
conduct to ensure free and fair elections without any violence.
</P>
<P>
Since the federal government and states are ruled by different
parties, there is always a feeling of mutual mistrust, putting a
question mark on the neutrality of the administration, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very high demand for deploying central forces from
most of the states. This shows the mistrust in the state
administration. Considering the limited number of central forces,
it may be a good idea to have a neutral administration take over
during the election process," he said.
</P>
<P>
India started its general elections to the 12th Lower House of
Parliament on February 16 and the whole election process is still
in progress. Election-related violence claimed more than 100
lives.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Spokesman: Shortage of Grains Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) said on Monday its stock of 167,000 metric tons of
grains registered by January 1 this year is running out fast.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the DPRK's flood relief task force said even if
the over 20 million population's per capita ration is down to 100
grams of grain per day, the stock could be wiped out this month.
</P>
<P>
Last summer's drought, heat wave and tsunami cut the DPRK's
corn output by 1.2 million and rice by 600,000 tons, to result in
its total annual grain production of less than 2.69 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In a normal year, the DPRK needs 7.84 million tons of grains,
including 4.82 million tons as staple food.
</P>
<P>
In face of the serious grain shortage nationwide, the per
capita ration was reduced to 300 grams per day in January
and further down to 200 grams in February.

</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli housing sales continue slumping in the
first two months of 1998, the local daily Haaretz reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Housing Ministry attributed the slump to the rise
in mortgage interest rates in recent months and the expectation
that the size of government-subsidized mortgages will be increased
in the next few months, making it worthwhile for people to wait.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli foreign currency reserves dropped 88
million U.S. dollars in February from the highest level of 21.623
billion dollars in January to 21.535 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The reserves had climbed 1.552 billion dollars in January over
that of the previous month -- the second-highest increase for a
single month in a decade.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel will ask Argentine Economy, Works, and
Public Services Minister Roque Femandez, who arrived here Monday,
to launch negotiations on a free trade agreement between Israel
and the Mercosur trading bloc, local daily The Jerusalem Post said.

<P>
Argentina now holds the rotating presidency of Mercosur, which
groups Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay and has
association agreements with Chile and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The Iranian government Sunday allocated 3.5 billion
dollars to import basic goods in the coming Iranian fiscal year
(to start from March 21), local daily Iran reported Monday.

barley, sugar, rare material for vegetable oil, printing papers,
medicines, tea, chemical fertilizers as well as buses.

RIYADH -- The United Saudi Bank has announced it secured 406
million riyals (108.3 million dollars) in net profit last year,

<P>
However, in the years after 1989, the arms industry experienced
a sharp decline in export, with the country's ranking dipping from
7th largest arms trader in 1989 to the 14th largest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The recent rebound of the industry was the result of the Czech
government's efforts to revitalize the industry.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Delegation Arrives for NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- "As a deputy elected by Hong Kong
people, I will try my best to live up to people's expectations by
fully exercising my lawful rights," said Tang Hin-chi upon
arriving at the Beijing Capital Airport this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Tang is a member of the 35-member delegation from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region coming to the Chinese capital to
attend the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC) scheduled to open on coming Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NPC deputies from Hong Kong were all smiles and answered
questions.
</P>
<P>
Said Deputy Yeung Yiu-chung, the principal of a Hong Kong
middle school: "That we can form an independent delegation to the
NPC session testifies to the central government commitment to
implementing its policy of one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Hong Kong used to join the delegation of its
adjacent Guangdong Province to attend annual NPC sessions. And
their number was limited to 27. This year Hong Kong is sending its
own delegation, the number of its members increased to 36.
</P>
<P>
With the death of one deputy not long ago, the Hong Kong
delegation actually has 35 members.
</P>
<P>
"I believe in the popular saying that Hong Kong will prosper as
long as the motherland is prosperous," Yeung said, adding that
Hong Kong deputies to the NPC feel the need to increase
exchanges and cooperation between the mainland and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies said that they are proud to be members of the
first independent NPC delegation representing the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region. Deputy
Philip Wong Yu-hong described his participation in the NPC session
as "the greatest honor" he has ever had in his life.
</P>
<P>
Ng Hong-mun, who has been an NPC deputy since 1975, said: "As a
member of an independent NPC delegation, I feel great pressure and
have a sense of great responsibility. I do hope our delegation
will have a good performance at the session."
</P>
<P>
As an economist and an expert on the Chinese economy, professor
Lau Pui-king from Hong Kong University said that, while it has made
impressive economic achievements, the mainland faces some
problems in the economic field and that she would like to put
forward suggestions on solving such problems at the coming NPC
session.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls on Iraq to Implement Agreement With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Monday called on Iraq to
implement the agreement it reached with the United Nations a week
ago in a bid to completely defuse the crisis arising from weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a weekly news briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry deputy spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey hopes
that this accord could put an end to the Iraqi-U.S. standoff.
</P>
<P>
"We welcomed the agreement reached between the U.N. secretary
general and the Iraqi government and we are hoping that Iraq will
carry out all the provisions," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Iraqi crisis is really over, Atacanli
said that this has to depend on whether the Iraqi leadership will
keep their promise.
</P>
<P>
"As we have announced on many occasions, we don't want to see
any further dangerous developments of the situation in this
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had been actively involved in the international efforts
of seeking a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi crisis since the
United States threatened to force Baghdad to back down with
military strikes.
</P>
<P>
As a neighboring country of Iraq, Turkey does not want to see
the situation in the sanctions-stricken country further
deteriorating due to a military confrontation with Washington,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has suffered huge economic losses since the United
Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, a major trading
parter of Turkey, following the 1991 Gulf War, according to
Turkey's official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials have expressed the hope that the
U.N. sanctions against Iraq should be lifted as early as possible
if Iraq has fully implemented relevant U.N. resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Seminar Discusses Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in Asia and
its possible impact on Nepal and other South Asian countries were
discussed at a seminar jointly organized by the Nepali government
and the Nepal Resident Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that more than 60
representatives from the Nepali government, the private sector,
foreign embassies in Nepal and international organizations
attended the one-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
At the seminar, Dr. Min Tang from the ADB gave an overall view
of what caused the crisis that started in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said what were blamed for the crisis were macroeconomic
vulnerability including regulation of exchange rate policy,
decline in exports in the affected countries since 1996, fragility
of the financial sector marked by a relatively high percentage of
non-performing loans, and mismanagement of global financial
integration reflected by the lack of adequate monitoring and
supervision mechanisms in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sophia Ho, an economist with the ADB, said the immediate
impact of the financial crisis on the Nepali economy had not been
particularly significant.
</P>
<P>
However, the short-term economic prospects are less positive,
she said, adding that urgent measures are needed to address the
structural weaknesses of the economy, particularly in the areas of
external trade, resources mobilization and fiscal imbalance.
</P>
<P>
She said Nepal should make continued efforts in tax reforms,
financial reforms, privatization and revitalization of the capital
market so that it could reduce overdependence on foreign
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Finance Minister Rabindra Nath Sharma told the seminar
that his government remained committed to its economic reform
process which started in 1991.

<HEADLINE> First Sino-Foreign Condom JV Established </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The London Intl. Group (LIG) Plc
and the Qingdao Latex Company in east China's Shandong Province
today established China's first condom manufacturing and marketing
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture -- Qingdao-London Intl. Latex Company Ltd. --
was established with a total of seven million US dollars shared
equally by the two parties. The venture, with a contract life of
eight years, will manufacture condoms under the British brand name
"Durex."
</P>
<P>
China encourages the use of condoms as an safe family planning
method which is effective for preventing the transmission of
diseases associated with sexual contact. The use of condoms is
seen as effective way to prevent the spread of sexually
transmitted diseases amongst the Chinese population which is
expected to approach 1.3 billion by the year 2000. Statistics
show that over 50 percent of China's population of slightly over
1.2 billion population are currently in the prime reproductive
period.
</P>
<P>
LIG CEO Nick Hodges expressed confidence about the future of
the joint venture, and noted that an ever increasing number of
Chinese citizens will opt to purchase condoms as a result of
the deepening of the reform of China's medical welfare system.
</P>
<P>
China currently produces 1.2 billion condoms annually and
formally distributed free condoms as part of the one child policy.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Family Planning Commission, Ministry
of Public Health and the British Embassy to China
attended the ceremony.

<HEADLINE> NPC Woman Deputy Pledges to Spread Agrotechnique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Wan Liyun, a 29-year-old female
technician in east China's Anhui Province, has served not only as
an "eye" for her blind husband but a guide for agronomical
practices in her village.
</P>
<P>
"My greatest wish is to help my fellow villagers to get
affluent as soon as possible with my own effort," said Li, a
college graduate in Chongqing, one of China's four municipalities.
</P>
<P>
After her marriage to a blind technician at the beginning of
1994, Wan gave up her easy and comfortable urban life and
accompanied her husband to his hometown, an outlying village in
Anhui six months later.
</P>
<P>
There, they leased a tiny plot of land and erected a hut in the
field to start their new career. Wan worked night and day to grow
edible fungi with a new technique, and her hard work soon paid
off.
</P>
<P>
Shen then bought 2,500 kg of straw to go on with her
fungi-growing experiment. And she set a record of reaping an
average of 1.2 kg of mushroom on each kg of straw.
</P>
<P>
To impart her technique to her fellow villagers, Wan spent
approximately 60,000 yuan (7,200 US dollars) she earned buying
relevant books for other villagers and providing them with fungi
and vegetable seed strains and plastic sheets.
</P>
<P>
So far, Wan has developed seven species of high-quality fungi
and introduced them to agronomists and farmers in 26 provinces and
autonomous regions across the country and opened training courses
for 2,000 participants, including agrotechnians, farmers and
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Her eminent deeds have been incorporated into a local opera and
Wan was awarded the title of "outstanding female technician".
Early this year, she was elected a deputy to the First Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"I am working to prepare for a motion to be submitted to the
coming NPC session so as to enable agrotechnique popularization
centers to benefit and better serve Chinese farmers," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A major Africa-wide
conference on governance in Africa was officially opened here
Monday with an aim to promote good and effective governance in the
poor continent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, K.Y. Amoako, Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa
(ECA) and chairman of the conference, said that good governance
is an essential ingredient for democracy and for sustainable
economic development in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the overall objective of the conference is
"to provide a forum to reflect on how to strengthen governing
institutions and how to maintain a functional balance between
them in order to create appropriate foundations for good
governance" in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The conference will provide an opportunity for leading
personalities in Africa to undertake an Africa-based diagnosis of
the vexing problems in Africa and identify strategies appropriate
to the African reality in fostering good governance, he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that an Africa-wide conference on
governance has been organized in Africa. The conference will
build on a number of similar initiatives organized through the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and other UN agencies
in the past,
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Minister of Justice Woredewolde Wolde noted that though
situation has changed in Africa over the past few years, but
undoubtedly Africans have to go a long way in putting in place in
Africa the kind of governance in all areas that would ensure
economic progress, social harmony and security.
</P>
<P>
A message read at the ceremony from United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan urged African nations to build the governance
structures, systems and frameworks to foster good and effective
governance in the continent.
</P>
<P>
The 5-day conference is jointly sponsored by the UN, the
Commonwealth Secretariat and the Mwalimu Nyerere Foundation.

<HEADLINE> People's Congresses Supervise Government and Judicial Bodies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's local legislatures -- the
people's congresses of provinces, autonomous regions and
centrally-administered municipalities and their standing
committees -- have carried out effective supervision over the work
of local government departments and local judicial bodies such as
courts and procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
Reports show that local people's congresses have played a vital
role in helping their respective local governments solve major problems
relating to reform, development and stability, and in guaranteeing
strict law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The Financial and Economic Committee under the Standing
Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress has insisted
on hearing and examining the implementation of the city's budget
once every three months to learn about possible problems in the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and August of 1997, local people's congresses in
Guangdong province helped judicial bodies correct mistakes in
1,332 cases, and prompted local governments to expel and punish a
number of corrupt and law-breaking officials.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's
Congress has repeatedly sent inspection teams to the city's
various districts, suburban counties and enterprises, to gather
information about laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers required the municipal government to work out a
plan to control local layoffs, and to take effective steps to help
laid-off workers find a new job as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, legislators in east China's Shandong
Province have carried out a dozen inspections to examine the
implementation of 12 laws and 11 local regulations. They have also
heard 86 reports by local judicial bodies on law enforcement, and
made 20 relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers in east China's Zhejiang Province laid special
emphasis on local agricultural development and environmental
protection. In 1995, they prompted the provincial government to
take action against the misuse of farmland and, in the next year,
helped solve the problem of water pollution in the Jiaxing area
near Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM: Iran Can Play Important Role in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini stated here Monday that Iran can play an important
role in preserving stability and ending regional crises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Iranian official news agency IRNA before
leaving Tehran for the historical city of Isfahan in central
Iran, Dini said that Iran can play an important and key role in
establishing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran, as the chairman of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC), can also play a determining role in
eliminating tension and consolidating international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the attempts by some western countries to isolate
Tehran, Dini expressed hope that with respect to Iran's new role
stemming from the viewpoints and attitudes of Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami's government, grounds would be prepared for
Iran's presence on the international scene better than ever before.
</P>
<P>
He termed the results of his visit to Iran as "positive,"
saying that the visit could be viewed as being in line with
attempts to promote Tehran-Rome ties which would be welcomed by
other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Dini arrived here Saturday evening for a three-day official
visit, the first one of a European minister to Iran after the
European Union lifted a ten-month-long ban on ministerial level
contacts with Iran late last month.
</P>
<P>
The ban had been imposed after a Germany court said Iranian
leaders sponsored state terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister said that the recent EU decision

<HEADLINE> More Hospitals, Health Centres Set up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
constructed and upgraded 16 district hospitals and another 70
rural health centres in the past four years at a cost of about
27 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare was currently
equipping the institutions with machinery and furniture, said
Osten Rutsate, who is in charge of the ministry's family health
project.
</P>
<P>
Staffing of the institutions would be done by the respective
provinces, local newspaper The Herald quoted Ostem Rutsate as
saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was working tooth and nail to ensure that
everybody lived within a 10 km radius gets access to nearest
health centres, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The government is channeling a lot of money towards the
upgrading or improvement of the country's health sector, whose
facilities are currently over-stretched because of the increasing
number of people seeking medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the project were provided by the World Bank through
soft loans, while additional funds to see the project through
came fron various donors.
</P>
<P>
During the colonial era, not many people had access to health
facilities.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of independence in 1980, everybody has access
to health, as the aged and those who are earning 400 Zimbabwean
Dollars (about 24 U.S.Dollars) a month and below are being
treated freely at government health institutions.

TOKYO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Japan's National Land Agency has
proposed building traffic systems by 2015 which will enable
travelers from any region in Japan to get to East Asian countries

<HEADLINE> Ailing Economy Spurs Export of Secondhand Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Some South Korean businessmen are
engaged in the business of secondhand goods when the nation, one
of the "Four Dragons in Asia," is tightening its belt due to a
serious financial catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
"Exporting secondhand electronic goods is a great idea to
revive the nation's sagging economy and earn badly needed
U.S. dollars," said Moon Dae-wang, head of the Kangdong branch of
the Korean Association for Recycling Electronic Goods and
Furniture.
</P>
<P>
Moon's association, which will export 300 Korean-made
secondhand refrigerators this month, is seeking to export
secondhand TV, audio sets, computers, washing machines and other
used products to Russia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Thailand,
Mongolia and African countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the association exported 60 units of used electronic
goods to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"However, it is hard to find discarded goods these days," said
Moon, whose association, established in June 1995 for recycling
resources and environmental protection, now has 135 offices across
the country, including 19 in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Before the financial crisis which erupted late last year because
of corporate failures and bad loans of financial institutions,
South Koreans were always replacing home electronic appliance and
furniture with new models and Moon's association received a flurry
of calls donating used goods.
</P>
<P>
Since the austerity measures taken by the South Korean
government in accordance with an agreement signed with the
International Monetary Fund last December for a rescue loan of 57
billion U.S. dollars, the nation's people have stopped throwing
away used goods, ranging from clothing and books to electronic
goods and furniture.
</P>
<P>
The association collect and repair used electronic products,
furniture, books, toys, garments and other miscellaneous goods at
the request of citizens before sales.
</P>
<P>
It collected and fixed 26,261 refrigerators, 18,823 washing
machines and 29,119 TV sets last year.
</P>
<P>
But domestic manufacturers are more active in collecting and
crushing discarded electronic goods after they have found that
sales of used goods can lower the demand for their products.
</P>
<P>
Moon said that used refrigerators, washing machines and TV sets
crushed by -- LG, Samsung and Daewoo -- respectively stood at
260,000 units, 310,000 units and 210,000 units, respectively, last
year.
</P>
<P>
"If 10 percent of those used goods was available for exporting,
the nation could earn up to 4.4 billion won (some three million
U.S. dollars) annually,'' said the association head.

<HEADLINE> Project Preventing Water Pollution at China's Three Gorges Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government departments are
working on a project at the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River
that will prevent water pollution at the reservoir in the future.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the cleaning of waste from garbage dumps, toilets,
sewage systems, hospitals, tombs, livestock sheds,
slaughterhouses, and industry, according to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
The 185-meter-high dam will turn the Three Gorges valley into a
large lake after the project is completed in 2009. The clean-up
project has been going on since last year, says Sun Xuejun, of the
Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
She says the clean-up work in some low-lying areas is quite
urgent because they may be inundated by flooding in the
spring. Although the river was dammed last November, water levels
are not much higher.
</P>
<P>
The major effort before floods come is cleaning up garbage
along the river and industrial waste, according to Pan Shunchang,
an environmental expert who is involved in the effort and who has
maintained that local governments near the dam area need to curb
serious pollution in the river.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Sector in UK May Fall to Brink of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 2 (Xinhua) - The Asian financial turmoil will
knock 1 percent off UK exports and about 0.5 percent off gross
domestic product, according to Oxford Economic Forecasting (OEF),
the economic consultancy.
</P>
<P>
"Already struggling with a substantially over-valued currency,
export-oriented manufacturers are now feeling the shock-waves of
the Asia crisis," OEF said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest forecast, OEF warned: "The UK manufacturing
sector will fall to the brink of recession this year."
</P>
<P>
The gulf between manufacturing and services could widen this
year, aggravating the dilemma for economic policy, it also said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the UK economy will continue to be
supported by strong consumer demand during the first half
of the year, but this may decelerate in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The full-year forecast for GDP growth is 2.1 percent this year,
after 3.3 percent in 1997 with manufacturing sector showing hardly
any growth during 1998, according to OEF.
</P>
<P>
OEF expected that the services sector, especially
telecommunications and the financial sector, will grow strongly,
but could also be caught up in the slow-down later this year.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Education Ministry
has drafted an eduction development program of about 640 milion
U.S. Dollars for the next six year, " The New Vision" reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some 466 billion Uganda Shillings (420 million U.S. Dollars)
of the fund are proposed to support primary education,
particularly the universal primary education program (UPE), the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Every family has a right to send four children for a free
primary education under UPE.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the program, Uganda plans to build 37,000
classrooms on 176 billion Uganda Shillings (some 160 million U.S.
Dollars). Lack of qualified classrooms is one of the acute
problems facing the the primary education of the country.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda, one in every four primary classes has no classroom
while one in six primary classes is in temporary structure, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The other key point of the program is to improve textbook
supply and teachers training, and to reduce the exclusion of
girls and other disadvantaged groups from UPE.

Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to the Ninth
National People's Congress (NPC) flew to Beijing Monday to attend
the first session of the Ninth NPC scheduled to open on March 5.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the deputies to represent the HKSAR
in China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
They were seen off at the airport by Wu Lan Mu Lun, deputy
director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, the deputies told reporters that they are
determined to fully perform their duties and obligations.

In addition, he will also raise some suggestions concerning the
reform of civil servants system, he added.

JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will close some
diplomatic missions in Eastern Europe this year while moving to focus
its initiatives to South America and Asia, local daily the Star
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Officials of South Africa's Department of Foreign Affairs
attributed the adjustment to the factor that the department is facing
a 20 percent budget cut, which, they said, could seriously hamper
diplomatic initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The department is expected to announce the closure of seven foreign
missions in a cost-cutting exercise and to move the focus of its
initiatives to South America and Asia, the officials said, adding the
missions to be closed were mostly in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Tom Moir, Foreign Affairs Chief Director of Finance said last week
that while the nominal budget cut could be about eight percent, if the
exchange rate impact was considered it owuld be closer to 15 percent,
and when inflation was factored in the real percentage, cut was in the
order of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
High ranking foreign affairs officials and some politicians described
the budget cut as "frightening" and "very gloomy".
</P>
<P>
Goy Geldenhuys, National Party member of the Foreign Affairs
Portfolio Committee, said the budget cuts could seriously affect the
leading role South Africa had taken in international forums and in
Africa.

BAGHDAD, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Mothers who lost their children
because of the seven-year-old U.N. economic sanctions held a mass
funeral in downtown Baghdad on Monday for their beloved in protest
against the U.N. trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
Cars carrying 33 small coffins wrapped in white cloth
proceeded from the Martyrs' Square to the office of the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP), with thousands of mourners
flanking both sides of streets.
</P>
<P>
"We want to show the world that the U.S. policy designed to
prolong the embargo means mass killing of Iraqi people,
especially the children, because of the resulting lack of food
and medicine," said Saltan al-Shawy, chairman of the Iraqi Child
Support Society, organizer of the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Calling the embargo "a genocide," he said everyday 50 children
die in Baghdad alone or more than 250 throughout the country due
to the shortages in food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Mourners chanted "Down with U.S.A," "Clinton is the enemy of
Allah," as they marched four kilometers to the UNDP office.
</P>
<P>
Najya Faleh, a mourner in black robe, said she lost a
six-year-old boy half a year ago because the hospital was in
shortage of medicines.
</P>
<P>
Fadala Kamase, another mourner, said her six-month-old son has
been hospitalized for three months, but still has not recovered
from pneumonia for lack of medicines.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to let the world know our children are dying in
hospitals because of the sanctions," Kamase said. "We want the
sanctions to be removed."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq since 1990 for its invasion
of Kuwait has thrown the country's economy into a depression and
created severe shortages in food and medical supplies. The Iraqi
government said more than one million Iraqis died in the past
seven years as the result of the embargo.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Preparations for the beginning
of Hong Kong's West Rail project were further geared up as five
detailed design contracts had been awarded for the project, it was
announced here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) spokesman said that
the contracts were awarded after open and competitive tendering
and the total value of the contracts is about one billion HK
dollars (128.2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The detailed design works stimulated by the contracts will
bring the design of the project from the current level of about 25
percent of full design to a level sufficient to prepare for the
commencement of construction.
</P>
<P>
The construction, scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of
this year, is subject to the authorization of the railway scheme
by the Executive Council, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Rail network is crucial to Hong Kong's transport
infrastructure, with a total daily patronage of the 121-kilometer
rail system reaching about 5.55 million. It represents 34 percent
of the total public traffic volume in the Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The West Rail project is aimed at improving traffic and
boosting economic development in the western part of Kowloon and
the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has planned to complete Phase I of the
project in 2002-03. The West Rail network shall connect with the
railway system in Shenzhen of South China's Guangdong Province,
when the project is completed.

<HEADLINE> Family Members Play An Active Role in Chinese Prisoners' Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- One Chinese prisoner who is serving
time for a serious criminal offense decided to repent recently
after having dinner with his family members.
</P>
<P>
A man named Pan, who received the death sentence, which has
been suspended, was severely reprimanded by his aging parents for
his crime during the recent lunar new year dinner in Luzhong
Prison in east China's Shandong Province,
</P>
<P>
When he looked at his tearful wife and young child, Pan, who
had been hostile toward prisoners and jailers in the past, said
that he would do better and work for release as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Jail employees say that this is a fairly typical example of
what has happened since Shandong authorities began the family-love
program among prisoners last year. It allows for private telephone
conversations and dinners with members. And some prisoners who
follow prison regulations carefully can even live with their wives
for one or two days, according to officials at Shandong's Prison
No 1 in the city of Jinan.
</P>
<P>
This change with prisoners in mind has helped jail employees
run the prison better. Some inmates serving long sentences may
feel a sense of hope after meeting with family members, the
officials say, and their relatives praise the project for
strengthening family ties.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 2 (Xinhua) -- South African policemen are
suffering from high stress levels, thus attributing to a high
suicide rate in the country, according to a study by Technikon
South Africa available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, 269 policemen have committed suicide
and on any given day about 10,000 police officers out of
160,000-strong force are absent from work nationally mainly
because they suffer from dangerously high stress levels, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
High levels of stress and depression among police had an
adverse affect on policing in general and were reflected in the
incidence of suicides, absenteeism and resignations.
</P>
<P>
An average of 450 police members leave the force each month,
the study showed.
</P>
<P>
Police officials, academics, psychologists and social workers
over the weekend attended a two-day conference hosted by the
Technikon to deal with this growing crisis in the police service.
</P>
<P>
South African policemen have been battling high crime levels
for years. An average of 50 people a day are murdered in the
country, which also has rates of serious crimes several times
higher than those in Western Europe and the United States.

<P>
CAIRO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Monday stressed the importance of Arab solidarity and joint action
to achieve stability in the Mideast region.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the 25th Arab Labor Conference opened in the
southern Egyptian city of Luxor Monday, Mubarak expressed keenness
on promoting human resources and providing appropriate atmosphere
and guarantees for maintaining Arab potentialities.
</P>
<P>
He said it is stability in the region that would provide the
proper atmosphere for pan-Arab action.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is determined to achieve peace and stability in the Arab
area, he said in the address read out on his behalf by Ahmed
el-Amawi, minister of manpower and Egypt's chief delegate to the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long conference, representatives of employers,
employees and governments of the Arab countries will discuss the
social effects of globalization on labor issue.
</P>
<P>
They will also deal with the Arab labor accords, the pending
issues during the coming session of the International Labor
Conference in Geneva and a draft Arab accord for employment
inspection.
</P>
<P>
The selection of Luxor as a venue for the conference confirms
the Arab countries' support for Egypt's stand against terrorism,
according to Director General of the Arab Labor Organization Bakr
Mahmoud Rasoul.
</P>
<P>
A massacre of 58 foreign tourists in Luxor last November has
dealt a devastating blow to Egypt's tourism, a major foreign

<HEADLINE> Women's Rights Observed in Iran: Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Vice President and head of
the country's Environmental Protection Organization (EPO)
Masoumeh Ebtekar has said that women's rights are fully observed
in Iran.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting U.N. High Commissioner for Human
Rights Mary Robinson Sunday, Ebtekar said that the Iranian women
play an important role in the country's affairs, calling on the
U.N. to recognize "the fact that women's rights are fully observed
in the Islamic Republic of Iran," according to the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, so far a distorted image of Iranian women has
been presented in the west which even portrays their Hijab
(Islamic dress code) as a detriment to their social activity,"
the first Iranian female vice president said.
</P>
<P>
She said that preservation of environment fell within the
scope of human rights, adding that "there is a definite relation
between the environment and human beings individual and social
rights and polluting the environment actually constitutes the
violation of people's rights."
</P>
<P>
Ebtekar told Robinson that there were numerous organizations
in Iran related to environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Robinson expressed hope for expansion of cooperation between
the U.N. and Iran over environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
The former Irish president arrived here Saturday to attend the
workshop on regional human rights arrangements in the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference Sunday evening, Robinson pledged that
she would make efforts during her term in office to prevent
politicization and selective approach to the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that she would strive to prevail a balanced
approach to the subject, adding that the body might have acted
selectively in the past giving way to criticism but it would
support human rights in a fair manner.
</P>
<P>
Violation of human rights does not merely cover violation of
political and civil rights, rather it encompasses environmental,
social and cultural rights, the IRNA quoted her as saying.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with her visit to Iran, Robinson said
that she held meetings with representatives of the Iranian
government and non-governmental organizations and has gained
fruitful results during the two-day stay in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Launch Censure Motion Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The opposition parties of Thailand
submitted to the parliament a no-confidence motion against Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai and his coalition government Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first no-confidence motion submitted by the
opposition since Prime Minister Chuan came to office on November
15, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The motion was raised by opposition leader and New Aspiration
party leader Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, Chart Pattana party leader
Chatichai Choonhavan and leaders of Prachakorn Thai party and Muan
Chon party Samak Sundaravej and Chalerm Yubamrung.
</P>
<P>
When submitting the motion to President of the National
Assembly wan Mohammed Nor Matha, Chavalit, Chuan's predecessor,
said that Chuan and his government could not guarantee the
security of people's life and property.
</P>
<P>
He also charged the 100-day administration with corruption and
mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the opposition's planned motion, the government
said last week that it was too early for a three-month
administration to confront with such a motion.
</P>
<P>
The government said that it should be given more time to show
its ability to bring the country out of the mire of economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The government also said among its priorities is to win back
foreign investors' confidence in Thailand, which depends largely
on the country's political stability.
 The parliament will begin debate over the motion on March 18 and
19, after Prime Minister Chuan ends his trip to the United States
from March 10 to 17, National Assembly President Nor Martha said.

JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign exchange
reserves decreased to 16.333 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
February from 20.39 billion dollars on January 15, Bank Indonesia
(BI), the central bank, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here by the bank's director, Miranda S.
Goeltom, said the current level of reserves was enough to finance
non-oil and non-gas import for four months.
</P>
<P>
The release did not explain why the reserves were being
depleted.
</P>
<P>
It said Indonesia still had 1.871 billion dollars in stand-by
loans, which could be cashed anytime when the government needs.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers have said that the central bank had been
active lately in defending the rupiah, the national currency, from
continuous attacks by intervening in both the spot and swap
markets.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been under speculative attacks since the
devaluation of the Thai baht on July 2. Since then the rupiah has
lost more than 80 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Stability Restored in Thai Binh Province, Says President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's President Tran Duc Luong
said stability in Thai Binh province, about 80 kilometers
southeast of Hanoi, has been "initially restored" following social
unrest that occurred in late 1997 due to official corruption.
</P>
<P>
President Luong, who is also a member of the Standing Board of
the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Vietnam, made the
remarks during a tour of the province in the northern Red River
delta last week.
</P>
<P>
Luong's statement made at a meeting with local key officials
was reported by major Vietnamese newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
Luong said Vietnam's Communist Party, government and people
"have drawn valuable lessons" from social developments in the
province.
</P>
<P>
Repeated complaints were lodged with central party and
government agencies by local people in the province in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Hostile forces took this opportunity to deliberately criticize
the party, the government," Luong said.
</P>
<P>
Assessing causes of the social unrest in the province, Luong
said it "resulted from the local people's indignation at mistakes
made by officials and party members at the grassroots level, and
shortcomings of the provincial party committee and authorities in
correcting those mistakes."
</P>
<P>
"Corruption and violations of people's right to democracy were
commonly seen among cadres at all levels," he said. "Violations of
state laws and regulations, illegal spending of state budget
allocations, corruption, and other negative phenomena were
detected at all levels."
</P>
<P>
The president attributed the return of stability in the
province to "drastic efforts made by party committees and people's
committees at different levels, with assistance and instructions
from the Party Central Committee's ad-hoc working group."

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Firm on Gold Price Lift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar climbed
back over 68 U.S. cents Monday in a rally triggered by a sharp
lift in the price of gold bullion in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 68.08 U.S. cents after
finishing here previously at 67.45.
</P>
<P>
"We ran into good demand from offshore markets," said Craig
Busch, head of foreign exchange at St. George.
</P>
<P>
Busch said demand for the local currency continued after the
release of trade figures for the month of January from the
Australian Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The local currency had dipped to 67.85 U.S. cents just after
the release of trade data which showed the Australian balance on
goods and services was a deficit of 598 million Australian dollars
(406.65 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The deficit was much wider than that of the most pessimistic
economist had predicted.
</P>
<P>
But a rally in the currency to 68.25 U.S. cents during weekend
dealings in New York trade had already set the tone for a firmer
unit.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion, a major influence on the value of the Australian
dollar, rallied 4.70 to 300.10 U.S. dollars in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar closed here at 85.35
Japanese yen from 85.68 and at 1.2280 German marks from 1.2255.

<HEADLINE> New Gene Linked with Breast, Lung Cancers Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of scientists said
Sunday that they had found a new gene linked with both breast and
lung cancers, said reports reaching here from Philadelpyia.
</P>
<P>
Frank Rauscher and his colleagues at Philadelphia's Wistar
Institute said that the gene, called BAP1, works with another gene
linked with breast cancer known as BRCA1.
</P>
<P>
Both genes control production of enzymes that suppress tumor
development, they explained, adding that tumors can form when the
genes take on a form that interferes with its production.
</P>
<P>
They also said that the mutations of BAP1 had been found in
both breast cancer and in non-small-cell lung cancers.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket closed
up marginally Monday, although down from the strong gains in the
morning session because of disappointing international trade
figures, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
"It was up fairly strong in the morning, but it came back
fairly savagely in the afternoon after the release of the

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Two Black-necked Cranes Saved in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Two black-necked cranes suffering
from food poisoning were saved today in a rare animal hospital in
southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
About 20 days ago, two farmers in Yongshan County found the
cranes lying on the ground, foaming at mouth. They rushed the
cranes to the hospital, where doctors determined that they were
suffering from food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
After 20 days of careful nursing, the two cranes have been
declared out of danger.
</P>
<P>
Black-necked cranes, the only crane living on the plateau, have
a population of no more than 3,000 in the world. China's
black-necked cranes spend their summers in northwest China's
Qinghai Province and migrate to Yunnan in winter.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the 1990s, Yunnan Province set up a nature
reserve to protect black-necked cranes. This winter about 1,000
black-necked cranes came to the the protection zone.
</P>
<P>
The two rescued cranes are still very weak. Doctors were
worried about their ability to fly north, and decided to raise
them in the hospital for the time being.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined on the
Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
(STII) lost 4.74 points to close at 1610.64 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Market players said that the stock prices dropped as investors
reacted negatively to last Friday's budget of Singapore for fiscal
1998-99. Dealers said that the market was disappointed that the
budget failed to provide tax concession.
</P>
<P>
Banks led the fall on expectations that the general provisions
they may set aside could hurt pre-tax profits. However, the
dealers noted that selective buying of some component stocks
helped pare early losses.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 352.55 million units, valued
at 523.77 million Singapore dollars (about 323.31 million U.S.
dollars). Declines led advances by 263 to 110, while 239 other
counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
L&AMP;M was the most actively traded counter as it registered a
turnover of 40.97 million units. It was followed by Easyknit which
had 37.28 million shares traded. Renong Bhd was next with 13.75
million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
SPH (Singapore Press Holdings) Foreign led the gainers of the
day as it surged by 1.6 dollars to finish at 24.8 Singapore
dollars. Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 rose by 50
cents to close at 39.1 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Venture was the biggest loser as it declined
by 35 cents to end at 5.85 Singapore dollars. KepFELS fell by 34
cents to close at 4.64 Singapore dollars, while Sea View was 30
cents lower at 5.3 Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Accelerate Study on El Nino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. scientists are
accelerating their study on the current El Nino phenomenon, which
they predicted last summer would bring torrential winter rains to
California and southern states.
</P>
<P>
Successful predictions "give more confidence in the money that
is going to research," said Lisa Goddard, a climate researcher
with San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
About 70 buoys have been placed in the Pacific Ocean to measure
sea temperature while satellites bounce radar off the ocean
surface to measure its height and the depth of its warmer upper
layer.
</P>
<P>
Other satellites take sea surface temperature readings and
commercial ships are used to drop temperature sensors.
</P>
<P>
In San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography,
meteorologists use computers to compile and translate data about
the current El Nino and its predecessors. Other climate scientists
feed wind and wave data into supercomputer models.
</P>
<P>
This year, scientists are conducting a special experiment in
which they fly a plane into the low-level stream that turns
tropical moisture into damaging storms that typically hit
California in winter.
</P>
<P>
The instrument-laden plane crisscrosses the jet stream -- not
to be confused with the upper-level jet stream that guides storm
tracks -- at altitude from 200 to 20,000 feet, gathering readings
on winds, temperatures, pressures and moisture that meteorologists
can't get anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
Scientists turned some information into real-time warnings. A
Feb.2 flight, for instance, led within hours to a flash-flood
warning for Santa Cruz county.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Thailand agreed
Monday that ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
countries need to strengthen their trade by using regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during talks between visiting Thai
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and Indonesian President Soeharto at
the latter's residence in central Jakarta, Thai Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panichakdi said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Promoting intra-ASEAN trade will use currencies of the ASEAN
countries," Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said during the meeting, Soeharto made it clear that
Indonesia will continue to implement the agreement it signed with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for carrying out economic
and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
However, the president emphasized that a policy of reconciling
IMF reforms, which he referred to as "IMF-Plus", is needed to
stabilize the rupiah (the national currency).
</P>
<P>
Chuan, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day visit to get to
know about the measures taken by the Indonesian government to cope
with its monetary crisis, briefed Soeharto on his recent talks
with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Muhammad in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Chuan also reaffirmed his commitment to providing 5,000 tons of
rice and medicines to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Thailand are facing similar monetary crisis. The
Indonesian rupiah has lost more than 80 percent of its value
against the U.S. dollar since July last year.

<P>
LAGOS, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Major Johnny Paul Koromah, leader
of the ousted Sierra Leonean military junta, was sighted last
week in eastern Sierra Leone and might be on his way to Guinea,
reports said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Yusuf Bah, a Guinean journalist,
claimed that he saw Koromah last week in Kono District, which is
near the border with Guinea, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Koromah was wearing a false beard and disguising himself as a
priest, the journalist said, adding that Koromah was planning to
escape into Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Koromah, his family and a large retinue of officials,
including 60 bodyguards arrived in Kono last week, Bah said.
</P>
<P>
The whereabout of Koromah, who overthrew elected civilian
president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in a coup last May, has remained a
mystery since the West Africa peace-keeping force ECOMOG seized
capital Freetown on February 12.
</P>
<P>
On February 14, a man who claimed to be Koromah himself called
the British Broadcasting Corporation on the telephone, saying
that he was in the hills near Freetown and would fight back.
Koromah was declared wanted last Saturday in Lagos by ECOMOG
Field Commander Timothy Shelpidi.

ZHENGZHOU, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
has gone all out to develop traditional Chinese medicine, topping
other provinces with the most hospitals of its kind, local health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some 160 medical organizations employ 33,000 workers. The

<P>
Local doctors have conducted academic exchanges with
specialists from 20 foreign countries such as Japan, Russia and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an international medical symposium and a bone
injuries treatment study class, which was jointly organized by

<HEADLINE> New Features of Ninth CPPCC National Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
which is begin its first session here tomorrow, has a number of
new features.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,196 members will attend the session, more than any
previous national committee of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee
demonstrates features of China's patriotic united front work in a
new historical period.
</P>
<P>
Like those of previous CPPCC national committees, members of
the Ninth CPPCC National Committee come from 34 social quarters.
But for Hong Kong members, the name of their social quarter has
now changed from "Hong Kong Compatriots" to "Specially Invited
Personages from Hong Kong" and, for Macao members, the name of
their social quarter has changed from "Macao Compatriots" to
"Specially Invited Personages from Macao." This reflects Hong
Kong's changed political status and Macao's soon-to-change
political status.
</P>
<P>
The previous CPPCC national committee had an "Agricultural and
Forest" quarter, or group. In the Ninth CPPCC National Committee,
it has changed to "Agricultural" quarter. This demonstrates that
CPPCC members will discuss state affairs on a wider range of
subjects.
</P>
<P>
The largest group in the previous CPPCC national committee was
that of "specially invited personages," who totaled 217 in number.
In the current Ninth CPPCC National Committee, the biggest group
are composed of people from science and technology circles, who
total 186 in number.
</P>
<P>
Among the Ninth CPPCC National Committee members, 40 come from
businesses that are not publicly owned, double the number in the
previous CPPCC national committee. This is a reflection of the
acceptance of non-public ownership as an important aspect of
China's socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Among members of the new CPPCC National Committee are scores of
young professionals below the age of 40. Members with senior
technical titles constitute 63 percent of the total membership,
five percentage points higher than the previous CPPCC national
committee.
</P>
<P>
The oldest member of the new CPPCC National Committee is Xie
Bingxin, who was born in 1900, while the youngest member is
25-year-old Li Xiaoshuang, an outstanding sportsman.

<HEADLINE> British Aircraft Carrier in Gulf to Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The British aircraft carrier
Invincible will soon go for home after handing over its mission of
enforcing the U.N. sanctions against Iraq to another British
carrier Illustrious, a local newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Invincible is anchored at Bahrain's Mina Saman port and is
about to sail for the northern Gulf before heading for Portsmouth
in Britain, Gulf News said.
</P>
<P>
The carrier's position will be taken by the Illustrious, which
entered the Gulf Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Invincible arrived the Gulf region in January amid rising
tensions between Iraq and the United Nations on arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
It joined the western flotilla already there to supervise the
U.N.-mandated Operation Southern Watch, also called no-fly zone
operation over southern Iraq to support U.N. economic sanctions
against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The deployment of the Invincible was also part of a
U.S.-Britain military buildup in preparations for an ever-possible
use of force against Baghdad's defiance against UN arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain threatened to launch military attack to
force Baghdad's compliance with U.N. resolutions on eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The crisis was defused after
an accord was signed by the U.N. and Iraq on February 23.
</P>
<P>
James Burnell-Nugent, captain of the Invincible was quoted as
telling reporters that there was "a sense of relief" among sailors
and pilots aboard the carrier after the possibility of using
force against Iraq was eroded by the Iraq-U.N. agreement.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Advanced Deep-Sea Rescue System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed
an advanced system that could rapidly guide a rescue submarine to
a sunken ship in turbid seawater without help from an underwater
television.
</P>
<P>
The system, developed by Harbin Engineering University in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and five other research
institutions, has passed expert appraisal here.
</P>
<P>
Bian Xinqin, a professor at the university and leader of the
research team, said that a deep-sea rescue submarine equipped with
the system could automatically reach a sunken ship and go down to
within 0.5 meters above the sunken ship before linking up with it.
</P>
<P>
With the advanced equipment, he said, a rescue submarine could
work in conditions with an ocean current of 1.5 miles per hour and
a water transparency of 1 meter.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the allowed rescue condition was 0.5 miles per
hour of ocean current and 10 meters of sea-water transparency.
</P>
<P>
He said the newly developed system could be used in China's
East China, Yellow, Bohai and South China seas which have strong
ocean currents and turbid water.
</P>
<P>
The ocean beds are rich in mineral and marine resources which
require the building of sea-bed working stations. Bian believed
that the system could provide technical guarantees for sending
technicians and materials to the stations.

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Hails Opening of CPPCC Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Tuesday edition of the
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial
hailing the opening of the First Session of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
"This session will hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, further strengthen the solidarity and unity of people of
all ethnic groups and social walks across the country, and
contribute to the attainment of the magnificent trans-century goal
set by the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC)," says the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The article notes that the past five years have witnessed great
advancement for the work of the CPPCC, as well as tremendous
contributions of the CPPCC to China's reform, opening-up and
modernization drive and the great cause of China's peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
It says that as China's most popular patriotic and United Front
organization and as a key institution for multi-party cooperation
and political consultation under the leadership of the CPC, the
CPPCC in the past five years has adhered to a correct political
line and done a good service for the country's central task of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The nearly-half-a-century history of the CPPCC has proved that
this political organization has distinct characteristics and
advantages suited to Chinese realities, and plays an irreplaceable
role in the country's political life, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
"We must attach greater importance to United Front work, and
make full use of it in our efforts to build China into a
prosperous, democratic, civilized and modernized socialist
country," it says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the most important aspect of Deng
Xiaoping's theory for United Front work in the new period is to
unite as many people as possible and combine their efforts for the
attainment of the Party's magnificent goals.

Chinese people can the CPPCC successfully serve the country's
reform program, opening-up and economic development, serve
socialist ethical and cultural progresses and the building of
socialist democracy and a legal system, help safeguard social
stability and contribute to a peaceful reunification of the
motherland," it says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that the new CPPCC National Committee, whose
members include newly-elected leaders of all non-Communist
parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce,
noted experts and scholars and experienced Party and government
officials, has the widest representation of the Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
The new CPPCC National Committee also has a record number of
representatives of people in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, Macao and Taiwan, a fact that displays the constant
development of the patriotic United Front under new
circumstances, the article adds.
</P>
<P>
"This has laid a fine organizational foundation for a
continuous promotion of CPPCC's work in the next five years," it
says.
</P>
<P>
It expresses the hope that all members of the CPPCC National
Committee will carry forward the fine tradition and style of work
of the CPPCC, adhere to the basic principles of multi-party
cooperation, political consultation and democratic supervision,
and make the upcoming session a great success.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident that the session will be democratic,
pragmatic, united and encouraging, and will accomplish all its
scheduled tasks smoothly," it concludes.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Drives Economic Growth of Shandong Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment has become a
major driving force for the economic growth of east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The contractual value of overseas investment in Shandong in
recent years has reached 36.5 billion U.S. dollars while the
amount actually utilized totaled more than 20 billion
U.S. dollars, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Direct foreign investment is the major form of overseas
investment in Shandong. During recent years the Chinese province
has approved the establishment of 20,000 overseas-funded
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the inflow of investment, overseas-funded
enterprises now produce nearly half of Shandong's annual exports.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of overseas investment has also effectively helped
ease capital shortage in construction. During the 1979-1996
period, overseas investment accounted for 20 percent of Shandong's
total investment in fixed assets, with the ratio reaching 30
percent in the coastal cities of Qingdao and Yantai.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment, which made up 40 percent of Shandong's
investment for technical renovation, has also been used to
transform state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in Shandong comes from more than 90
countries and regions, with Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, the
United Sates, Taiwan and Japan being the major sources of overseas
investors.

<HEADLINE> China Steps Up Environmental Protection in Yangtze River Valley (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Forestry will
strengthen environmental protection in the Yangtze River Valley,
launching tree-planting projects, announced Li Yucai, vice
minister of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Li made the announcement at a recent seminar held in Chongqing,
China's newly designated municipality under the direct
administration of the central government.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River runs more than 6,000 kilometers (km), with a
river valley area of 1.8 million square km, accounting for 18.8
percent of China's total land. With the rapid development of the
river valley, the region's environment has been degraded sharply
with the more frequent incidents of natural calamities.
</P>
<P>
Projects fostering shelter forests along the middle and upper
reaches of the Yangtze River were launched as early as in 1989.
The partly completed first-phase project covers an area of 4.73
million hectares, which helped eliminate land erosion in 100
counties and covered the counties' mountains with forests.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase project will be completed by 2000, Li said,
adding that the Ministry of Forestry will take 30 years to carry
out the tree-planting projects in a 24.7-million-hectares area
along the river valley.

<P>
The ecologically vulnerable Three Gorges area, the Jialingjiang
River Valley, western Sichuan Province and the Jinshajiang River
Valley, all have been given priority for planting shelter forests,
which will cover an area of 16 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"China will gradually cut or even stop the logging along the
middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River," said Li, stressing
that projects will be launched to protect the natural forest
resources in those regions to put an end to the declining
resources.
</P>
<P>
China will increase its forest-covered region by 20 million
hectares after the completion of these projects, which will reduce
the river's siltation by 700 million tons.
</P>
<P>
With the formation of a green belt along the Three Gorges area,
a healthy ecological system will be established along the whole
river valley for the sustainable development of China's national
economy, Li said.

BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The China Society for Human Rights
Studies today issued a commentary on the China section of the 1997
Human Rights Report of the the Department of State of the United
States. The full text of the commentary, titled Human Rights in
Name, Swaying Power in Reality, is as follows:
</P>
<P>
On January 30, the Department of State of the United States
trotted out the 1997 Human Rights Report. Once again it regarded
itself as a "human rights judge" and wantonly made judgments and
accusations regarding the human rights situations in 194 countries
and regions in the world. The report ran into strong opposition
from many countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe upon
its release. The report devoted many pages to flagrant accusations
about China's human rights situation. It is equipped with all the
means of fabrication, distortion and piecing together irrelevant
events and is full of falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
One. So-Called "Facts" in the Report
</P>
<P>
The report fabricated so-called "facts" in order to draw up
charges against China for human rights abuses. For example, in
order to prove that China suppresses so called "dissidents," it
proclaimed in pretended earnest that "at least eight protesters
were picked up by police in Tiananmen Square during the 15th Party
Congress." But in fact not even a single demonstration occured in
Beijing during the congress. The so-called arrest of eight
protesters is sheer fabrication. As another example, the report
proclaimed that police suppressed large-scale demonstrations of
workers in some provinces including Sichuan" and that after "a
large protest in Mianyang, Sichuan province, Estimates of the
number of people reportedly arrested ranged from several hundred
to several thousand." The fact is that what happened in Mianyang
City was that a petition was presented by only several hundred
people instead of a "large-scale protest demonstration" as the
report stated. Moreover, thanks to proper handling of the issue by
the local government, the issue was resolved promptly. The local
government never dispatched police, let alone arrested any
person.

As still another example, the report accused China of imposing
restrictions on access for foreigners to Tibet, stating that the
restriction "began mid-1997 and, in some cases, continued until
the end of the year." The fact is that China's Tibet has always
been open to the outside world. The number of foreigners who went
to Tibet for tourism, sightseeing and business in 1997 increased
substantially over previous years. According to statistics, nearly
90,000 people from dozens of countries and regions went to Tibet
for visits, inspections or news coverage in 1997 alone. Among them
were ambassadors, counsellors, religious people and journalists,
who belonged to 395 groups of 1,499 people. The number and scale
of the groups far exceeded those of the previous years.
</P>
<P>
The report accused China of "keeping proceedings closed to the
public" and, "in some cases, even family members in sensitive
cases." It also gave an example that "Pastor Xu Yongze's family
received no notification of his mid-1997 trial." The fact is that
Xu Yongze was detained on May 21, 1997. The public security
department notified his daughter, who works in the Nanyang
Department Store, of this by express mail on May 22. After Xu was
arrested on June 25, the public security department notified his
wife by express mail, too. The court announced his formal trial
three days in advance. Therefore, there did not exist the issue of
blocking access to information for Xu's family and lawyer as the
report alleged. The report also played up the case of Xu Yongze,
stating that Xu was "sentenced to ten years of reform through
labor" because he conducted normal missionary activities, and used
this as evidence for China's religious persecution. The fact is
that in 1984 Xu Yongze set up a cult named the "All-Round Church."
He asserted wantonly among people: "The end of the world is
imminent, so are disasters" and that while gathering "people must
weep loudly. This is the only way to reincarnate and save
themselves". Instigated by him, many people abandoned their work,
production and study, and threw themselves into an orgy of weeping
in groups daily. As a result, they lost means to support
themselves, became mentally ill and could not take care of
themselves. Some people went blind from weeping and some even
committed suicide. This cult seriously disturbed production and
lives of local people, and disrupted a normal social order,
causing grave damages to society and the people.

<P>
Xu was sentenced to three years of reform through labor in
Beijing in 1988. After he served his sentence and was released in
April 1991, Xu did not repent, but, on the contrary, intensified
his efforts to engage in socially disruptive activities. In June
1997, the public security department of Zhengzhou City in Henan
Province arrested Xu in accordance with the law. In December the
local court sentenced Xu to three years' imprisonment for the
crime of disrupting social order. The fact is that Xu Yongze was
sentenced for breaking the law. But the report alleged that he was
sentenced because he conducted normal religious activities. It is
a total distortion of the facts.
</P>
<P>
The report claimed that "the migration of ethnic Han into
Xinjiang in recent decades has caused the Han-Uyghur ratio in the
capital of Urumqi to shift from 20:80 to 80:20." However,
according to statistics, the total population of Urumqi was
635,000 in 1960. The ratio of the populations of the Han and
minority nationalities was 75.2:24.8. In 1996 the population in
the city increased to 1.479 million. Of this number, 1.076 million
were Han and 406,000 belonged to minority nationalities -- a ratio
of 72.8:27.2. It is obvious that the fact that the population of
the Han nationality is relatively larger in the city is due to
historical reasons. In fact, the growth rate of the Han population
has been far below the that of the population of minority
nationalities in the city in the past few decades. In fact, the
ratio of Han people to the population has actually decreased.
There is great discrepancy between the figures in the report and
facts.

<HEADLINE> Three Farmers Build China's First Private Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's first private railway was
built by three farmers in Liangshan County in east China's
Shandong Province. The railway has turned the county into the
largest oil distribution center in the southwest part of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The private railway connects an oil depot, which has a reserve
capacity of 10,000 tons, and the Liangshan Station on the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway, one of the country's north-south trunk
rail lines.
</P>
<P>
The 630-meter railway, no longer than the distance between two
stations on Beijing's subway, is the first one totally built with
private funds since the first railway line appeared in China in
1881.
</P>
<P>
Wen Maowen, one of the investors, said they transported
kerosene and gasoline from seven large oil fields, including the
Dagang oil field in east China's Tianjin Municipality and the
Jinzhou oil field in northeast China's Liaoning Province, and
provided them to more than 20 counties.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who has dealt in oil for years, estimated their annual
income could reach 15 million yuan (1.8 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wen said Liangshan and neighboring counties have a large demand
for oil. Oil transportation was formerly done by trucks because
the county had no rail link until the Beijing-Kowloon Railway
connected the county with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"If we use railway transportation, the cost will be lowered by
about 80 yuan per ton," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Wen and the other two investors, Wang Bosheng and Gao
Chenghuan, applied to the Jinan Railway Bureau in the provincial
capital to build a railway with an annual transportation capacity
of 180,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations issued by the Chinese Ministry of
Railway, building a rail line with an annual transportation
capacity surpassing 500,000 tons should get ministry approval. If
less than 500,000 tons, approval at the bureau level is required.
</P>
<P>
Wen's application was approved by the bureau at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the railway and the oil depot, from April
to November in 1997, cost 12 million yuan. Wu Guanzheng, top
leader of the province, inspected the railway during its
construction.
</P>
<P>
Sima Ge, an official of the Railway Ministry, said China does
not oppose individuals building railways as long as legal approval
is obtained.

The report also attacked China for discriminating against
Tibetans in Tibet. It said, "Overall, government development
policies have helped raise the economic living standards of many
ethnic Tibetans, but most benefits of development accrue to Han
Chinese."
</P>
<P>
The fact that the living standards of many Tibetans have been
raised means that many Tibetans have benefited from such
development. How can the report say that most benefits accrue to
the Han people? As a matter of fact, the 62 projects undertaken by
the Chinese government in the 1990s for Tibet aimed at bringing a
happy life to the Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, by 1996, 56 projects of the 62 had
been completed, which greatly improved Tibet's infrastructure,
including transportation, energy and telecommunications. They
directly benefited more than one million people.
</P>
<P>
In the Tibet Autonomous Region the population of Tibetans
accounts for more than 90 percent of the total population.
Obviously, those who have benefited are mainly Tibetans.
Meanwhile, the Han people in Tibet have also naturally benefited
from the projects. It is totally groundless for the report to
claim that "most benefits accrue to the Han people."
</P>
<P>
The contents of the report confused right and wrong. For
example, the report blamed the Chinese government for its
poverty-alleviation policy, saying that this program through
resettlement "forces the evacuation of persons from the poorest
mountain areas" and "disrupts the traditional living patterns
of minority groups".
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of insufficient food and clothing
of people in some regions, the Chinese government has formulated
and implemented a key poverty-alleviation program which aims to
help 80 million people to get rid of poverty within seven years
(1994-2000). The program includes a plan for helping the people
living in extremely harsh natural conditions to cast off
poverty through resettlement. The plan represents a pioneering
undertaking of the Chinese people in their fight against the
harsh natural environment. Facts have proved that the plan is
welcomed by the local people, for it is an effective measure
adopted by the government to help the people in the
poverty-stricken regions to improve their human rights conditions.
</P>
<P>
Take Shangxing Village of Tianyang County in a mountainous
region in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as an example. The
village is characterized by low-lying land, with little water
available within a circumference of dozens of kilometers and rocks
all around. For a long time villagers lived on the maize that they
planted in crevices between the rocks. The arable land per capita
of the villagers was only about 0.01 ha, and the annual income per
capita, 160 yuan. Every year the villagers used to be short of
food for five or six months. After they were re-settled in 1995,
the annual income of the villagers per capita reached 1,360 yuan,
an increase by 9.5 times. Their living conditions have been
greatly improved and the villagers have supported the
resettlement. The poverty relief measure through resettlement
similar to this is really one beneficial to the people and to the
improvement of human rights. But the report cited it as proof for
infringment of human rights.

Two. The Report reveals political bias of the Writer on China
</P>
<P>
Different from previous years' versions, this year's report
mentioned a number of times the "positive progress" China has made
in human rights, and even recognized in some place that "Average
citizens go about their daily lives with more personal freedom
than ever before." However, in its overall assessment of human
rights in China, the report asserted that there is still
"widespread and well-documented human rights abuses" in
China. This evidently revealed the fact that the judgement of the
writer of the report on China's human rights is not based on facts
but on intrinsic political bias.
</P>
<P>
It is widely recognized that 1997 is the year that witnessed
remarkable progress in China's human rights cause. During the
year, China achieved favorable national economic development with
a high growth rate and a low inflation rate, people's living
standard rose steadily and the country's human rights situation
further improved.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the GDP calculated in constant price increased
by 8.8 percent in 1997 from the previous year. The per capita
disposable income of urban residents reached 5,140 yuan, a rise
of 2.9 percent with the price factor deducted. The per capita net
income of rural residents was 2,080 yuan, up 4 percent in real
terms.
</P>
<P>
The number of people under the poverty line decreased to 50
million from 1978's 250 million. In 1997, another 400 counties
(cities and districts), which account for 15 percent of the total
population, basically realized nine-year compulsory education and
eliminated illiteracy among the middle aged and the young. Thus, a
total areas with 65 percent of the national population have met
the above requirement. Four million young and and middle-aged
people became literate last year, enabling the areas with 73
percent of the national population to basically eliminate
illiteracy in the above mentioned age group.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of democracy and the establishment of a legal
system were stepped up evidently. The citizen and political rights
were effectively safeguarded. Statistics show between the
beginning of the reform and opening up program and November of
1997, the National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing
Committee enacted 324 laws, 114 or a third of which were adopted
by the Eighth National People's Congress and its Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Council formulated 780 sets of rules and
regulations. Local people's congresses formulated a total of 5,300
sets of local rules and regulations. As a result, a comprehensive
legal system that safeguards human rights has been introduced.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress, in particular, clearly set
forth the principle that "the governing of country by the
Communist Party of China means respecting and safeguarding human
rights," and included in China's cross-century development
strategy the enhancement of human rights and the administration of
the country in accordance with law as an important objective in
the reform of the political structure and the promotion of
democracy and the introduction of a legal system.
</P>
<P>
This has brought about bright prospects for the development of
China's human rights cause. China is now enjoying political
stability, economic growth and ethnic unity. Its people are living
and working in peace and contentment. The human rights conditions
are showing a strong tendency toward all-round improvement.
</P>
<P>
However, the report ignored the aforementioned objective facts
and called on absurd logic to accuse China of "widespread human
rights abuses." The logic is whatever permits the
opposition to China's legitimate government and to the status of
the CPC as the ruling party conforms to human rights. Otherwise,
it means abusing human rights.

<TEXT>
<P>
The report attacked China for serious human rights abuses. In
the final analysis, that is because China does not tolerate
the right to overthrow its legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the report said that China infringes upon its
citizens' freedom of information, producing as evidence the fact
that China bans using the Internet to "incite the overthrow of the
Government or the Socialist System or "incite division of
the country and harming national unification."
</P>
<P>
The report made an accusation that there is no freedom of
speech or freedom of the press in China, claiming that China
"stipulates that people cannot publish any material that is
contrary to the Constitution, reveals state secrets, endangers
national security, or harms the country."
</P>
<P>
The report said that China restricts freedom of peaceful
assembly and association on the grounds that China's Constitution
``provides that such activities may not challenge Party leadership
or infringe upon the interests of the state."
</P>
<P>
The report accused China of restricting freedom of religious
belief in Tibet, claiming that because "the Chinese government
does not tolerate religious manifestations that advocate Tibetan
independence or any expression of splittism."
</P>
<P>
All these accusations boil down to demanding that China should
give a tiny number of law-breakers and criminals the freedom to
incite the overthrow of the government, the CPC leadership and the
socialist system.
</P>
<P>
This is tantamount to saying that whatever activities that help
to achieve this purpose, even if they are law-breaking activities
regarded as crimes around the world, such as "violating the
Constitution, revealing state secrets and endangering state
security", "inciting splittism or harming national unity," should
not be prohibited because they all "conform to human rights."
</P>
<P>
When China punishes such activities according to law, some
people in the United States cry out that China "suppresses
dissidents" and "infringes upon human rights on a large
scale". That is their logic. Prejudice is farther away from truth
than ignorance.
</P>
<P>
It entirely conforms to international norms for
China to restrain citizens' freedom of information, speech,
publication, assembly, association and religious belief.
</P>
<P>
The International Convention on Civil and Political Rights of
the United Nations clearly states in its articles 18 to 22 that
such freedoms should not endanger state security, public security,
public order, public sanitation or ethics, or the rights and
freedoms of others.
</P>
<P>
No country will allow its citizens to abuse their freedoms and
rights to engage in criminal activities such as violating the
Constitution, inciting people to overthrow the government and
the social system, endangering state security and unification,
revealing state secrets and harming state interests.
</P>
<P>
In articles 2381 to 2391 of Chapter 18, the Legal Code of the
United States of America stipulates severe punishment measures for
such activities.
</P>
<P>
The report cited China's stipulations and measures, which
conform to international norms, as evidence of China's "human
rights abuses."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the real purpose of the writers of the report is to,
under the pretext of human rights, support a handful of
anti-government elements in China in disrupting China's stability,
and eventually overthrowing China's legitimate government and
changing China's road of development.

Three. the report revealed the United States' efforts in using
human rights diplomacy to enforce power politics.
</P>
<P>
The report portrayed the United States itself as a universal
embodiment of human rights, attacking China repeatedly for going
against "internationally accepted norms", censuring China for
making itself an "exception to the principle of universality" of
the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights".
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is the United States which takes itself as an
"exception to the principle of universality" of the "Universal
Declaration of Human Rights". One of the most important
contributions the "Declaration" has made to the world is that it
not only for the first time on a global basis affirmed the
citizen's and political rights of the people, but also their
economic, social, and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
The intact connotation of the universal principle of the
"Declaration" rests on the fact that not only do citizen's and
political rights have universalities, but so do economic, social
and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, which has consistently regarded
itself as a spokesman for this universality, has openly taken
itself as an exception to the principle of universality by not
acknowledging until the present date the economic, social and
cultural rights as parts of the human rights in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
As to the human rights diplomacy adopted by the United States,
it is a further demonstration of the country's exception to
the universality of human rights
</P>
<P>
The "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" issued by the
State Department of the United States each year focus on 190-plus
nations and regions around the world, but the report takes
exception to the United States by mentioning not even a word on
the human rights record of its own.
</P>
<P>
As an American scholar pointed out, such human rights standard
is an example of the country's practice to style itself as an
exception to the universality of human rights...regarding itself
as an example for other countries to follow, thus making the
so-called international standard of human rights meaningless.

<HEADLINE> Sugar Output in South China Region Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China, the country's largest sugar producer, will
turn out 2.4 million tons of sugar in the 1997-1998 production
period, setting a new record.
</P>
<P>
Located in the country's subtropical area with a mild climate
and sufficient sunshine, Guangxi is an ideal place for growing
sugarcane. Its sugar output makes up one third of the national
total.
</P>
<P>
The region has been placed the first in the country for cane
sugar output in a succession of five years. It produced 2.35
million tons of sugar in the 1996-1997 production period.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the growing area of sugar canes
amounted to 460,000 hectares in the region last year, a rise of
about 6,600 hectares over the previous year. Some 22 million tons
of sugar canes will be harvested for sugar production.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, trucks could be seen, at any time, carrying
full load of canes to a refinery in Congzuo County, where per
capita sugar output leads all other counties throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the rising sugarcane output, Guangxi has built 36
refineries and expanded 60 existing ones in the past few years,
bringing the total number of refineries in operation to 105.
These plants have a combined daily production capacity of 200,000
tons.

China has always respected the "Declaration of Human Rights"
and the principle of the universality of human rights. China has
actively participated in and strictly complied with international
conventions on human rights adopted by the United Nations and all
other related international documents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fact that China has adopted effective measures
to safeguard and promote human rights in accordance with the law
and reality within the country clearly shows the integration of
the universalities and specialities of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Like many other countries in the world, China can not act in
line with the human rights standard set by the United
States. Conditions and realities in China are, in fact, quite
different than those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has invaded many countries over the past
200-odd years, but has itself remained free of foreign
incursions. China, on the other hand, has suffered from the
humiliation of being carved up by foreign aggressors and has
experienced the tribulations of long-time wars, as well as massive
losses of life over the past 100 years and more.
</P>
<P>
China treasures its hard-won national independence,
sovereignty, and national dignity, while at the same time
cherishing a stable and peaceful environment.
</P>
<P>
The differing realities between China and the United States are
quite obvious. For example, China's population is 4.6 times that
of the United States, with per capita arable land in the former
representing only one-tenth that of the latter. In addition
China's per capita share of grain output accounts for a mere 22
percent of the share for the United States, and its per capita
portions of other resources are far less than those of the latter.
</P>
<P>
China is a large developing country with a backward economy,
while the United States is a superpower. China's economic
development level is far below that of the United States, with its
per capita share of wealth accounting for only 1.6 percent of that
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the United States, development is the top
priority in China and represents the key to solving a wide
assortment of problems, but stable social and political
environments constitute the preconditions for China's
development.

China has adopted a social system quite different from that of
the United States. The fact that China had inherited its
independent cultural traditions that could trace back to one
origin and date back over 5,000 years has quite naturally resulted
in differing views of values when compared to the United States.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the United States in terms of views of values which
respect and emphasize individual rights, China places greater
stress on the coordination of rights and obligations, individuals
and all other people, collectives and the society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
China places greater emphasis on values which require placing
the interests of others and collectives before oneself. It is
ludicrous to expect China to adopt U.S. standards and management
models given the vast differences in the histories, realities and
cultures of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, both the specialities and universalities
of human rights involve objective existence, and there are indeed
specialities in human rights in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States is home to less than five percent of the
world's total population, nonetheless accounts for 30 percent of
the world's petroleum, natural gas, and coal consumption. China,
with a population of over 1.2 billion, would have surpassed the
world's total consumption figure by 140 percent if all Chinese
citizens consumed as much as the average American. That is to say,
the global consumption would be not enough for the consumption of
China alone. Is it possible to imagine what would have happened to
the world would that be the case? The world would have fallen
into chaos had Americans been allowed to promoted such excess
privileges to the world as the universality of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The United States is simply a member of the world community and
is in no position to censure human rights of other countries. In
the world today, the United States is the only country which
attempts to act as an "international judge on human rights" by
overriding the sovereignty of other nations and releasing annual
reports on human rights situation in other countries in the name
of U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
United States' such actions have severely violated the
international norms on equality and sovereignty of all nations and
on noninterference in the internal affairs of another
country. Said actions totally defy the goals and principles of the
"United Nations Charter".
</P>
<P>
The human rights report issued by the U.S State Department is
nothing more than a product of U.S. internal laws in accordance
with the "Foreign Assistance Act" enacted by the United States
Congress in 1974 and the "Hartin Amendment" in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The United States not only lacks authority from the United
Nations or other accepted international organizations, but also
lacks the backing of international laws to make judgements on
human rights situations in other countries based on its domestic
laws. Said illegal practices to make judgements at random on the
human rights situation in other countries represent nothing but
hegemonism and power politics.

<P>
The United States is by no means qualified to preach to China.
Over the past 100 years, the United States has many times imposed
aggressive wars and unequal treaties on China, supporting the
Kuomintang reactionaries in China's civil war, launching the
Korean War in an attempt to strangle New China, bringing about
heavy losses to the life and property of the Chinese people, and
infringing upon human rights on a large scale in China. In the
United States itself there exist severe human rights problems.
</P>
<P>
Many of the accusations against China in the report could be
used to satirize the United States. When the United States attacks
China for discriminating against minority ethnic groups, it should
remember its history of genocide of native Indians and enslavement
of kidnapped black people. Racial discrimination is still rampant
in the US even today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released in 1977, the average life
expectancies of black men and women in the United States were 5.4
years and 7.5 years lower than those of white men and women.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, China does much better than the United States in
practicing ethnic equality, giving favorable treatment to minority
ethnic groups and protecting the human rights of the people of
such groups.
</P>
<P>
Although the United States is the richest country in the world,
20 percent of its population live below poverty line. China is not
prosperous, but by its own efforts it has succeeded in basically
providing adequate food and clothing for 1.2 billion people. The
number of people living below the poverty line has decreased by
200 million in less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur reported in 1997 that
the average working hours of American workers increased from 40.6
per week in 1973 to 50.6 hours in 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a US national commission in charge of equal pay
for equal work, an ordinary American woman earns 500,000 dollars
less than an ordinary male employee in her lifetime.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the weekly working time of Chinese workers has
been cut from 48 hours to 40 hours, according to law, and men and
women get equal pay for equal work.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses China's judicial system of not
safeguarding human rights. But both the rate of violent crimes and
the proportion of prisoners in the United States are the highest
in the world, and the recidivism rate in the US is more than 40
percent. These figures are far higher than those in China.
</P>
<P>
The United States accuses China of not respecting international
human rights norms, but the United States has joined fewer
international human rights conventions than any other major
country. So far, the United States has joined only 15
international conventions on human rights. China has joined
17. The United States should first look at its domestic human
rights problems.

<P>
It is well known that the Human Rights Report periodically
released by the US State Department resulted from the political
needs of the Cold War launched by the United States.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning it has served as a political weapon of
the US government to contain socialist countries, put pressure on
developing countries and practise hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War and the development of
multi-polarization, people all over the world are demanding an end
to Cold War thinking and confrontation. They seek equal dialogue
and co-operation so as to promote the healthy development of human
rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
At present when proposing dialogue and opposing confrontation
have become the irresistible historical trend, the United States
has already received strong opposition and resistance
from nations across the globe for clinging to a relic of the Cold
War -- the Human Rights Report.
</P>
<P>
For too many years, the report has been a giant barrier for
developing the Sino-US relationship.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to the US last
year ushered in a new phase of development for the relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries issued a "Joint Statement", which dedicated
them to building a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Although the two sides admitted that significant differences
exist in dealing with the human rights issue, they have agreed to
solve the problem through governmental and non-governmental means
in the spirit of equality and mutual respect, which reflects the
requirements of the times and the aspirations of the people. It
is the hope that the US State Department would change over to new
ways and return to the correct road of dialogue and co-operation
in dealing with the human rights issue.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists to Explore World's Largest Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expedition team this
year will hike through the Yarlung Zangbo River Canyon, the
world's longest and deepest canyon.
</P>
<P>
The team, organized by the China Association of Scientific
Expedition, will send a small group of 12 people to walk across
the canyon in April and prepare for a larger-scale expedition in
October.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau, the highest in the world,
the Yarlung Zangbo River Canyon is 496.3 kilometers in length with
an average depth of more than 5,000 meters, a world record in
terms of both length and depth.
</P>
<P>
Before some Chinese scientists made careful studies of the
canyon in 1994 and identified it as the world's largest, the Grand
Canyon in the southwestern United States and the Canyon of Cerro
Colca in Peru had been considered the longest and deepest canyons
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The expedition team, including television and newspaper
reporters, will use modern communication methods to broadcast the
whole process of the expedition and explore the canyon's natural
wonders, Gao Dengyi, executive vice-chairman of the China
Association of Scientific Expedition, said today.
</P>
<P>
The team will also collect scientific data about animals,
plants, rivers, glaciers and other geographic data to provide
first-hand material for the development of the canyon, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
A film on the expedition will be produced and released
worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another important task for the team is measuring the canyon
with the Global Positioning System and other modern scientific
methods, and updating relevant data which was gathered in the
1970s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the association planned the expedition last year, but
failed because of financial problems.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, we have found two companies and some other
organizations, who would jointly sponsor 3.75 million yuan
(452,000 U.S. dollars) for the expedition," he said.

<HEADLINE> US President's Special Envoy Visits Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
personal representative Walter Mondale arrived here Monday for a
one-day visit to Indonesia, a press release issued by the U.S.
Embassy here said.
</P>
<P>
Mondale, former vice president under Jimmy Carter is expected
to discuss Indonesia's economic woes with President Soeharto on
Tuesday, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia J. Stapleton Roy said
that Mondale will not meddle in Indonesia's political affairs.
"This visit is just to have a talk with President Soeharto," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Mondale is likely to discuss U.S. concern over the
monetary and economic crisis here. He is also tipped to advise the
president to stand by agreements reached in a deal with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on January 15.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Mondale is scheduled to deliver a message from
U.S. President Clinton to Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that he also will dissuade the Indonesian leader
from accepting a currency board on the grounds that it is
premature, and would aggravate Indonesia's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Indonesian parliament member Lukman Harun said
here that foreign governments should not interfere with
Indonesia's domestic affairs but financial aid is most welcome.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia wants friendly relations with other nations but
negative comments on the country's leadership are an intolerable
offense, said Harun, who is a member of the ruling Golkar group.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the beneficiary of a 40 billion U.S. dollars
bailout put together by the IMF and is receiving aid from other
international organizations as well as direct assistance from
foreign donors.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Macao's Tourism Faces Challenges in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Macao's tourism sector faces
challenges in 1998 following a sharp drop of more than one million
tourists last year.
</P>
<P>
Unfavorable factors leading to the tourism slump like the
currency storms in southeast Asia still remain, and Macao
Government should make great efforts to meet the challenge,
experts pointed out at a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Chan Yuen, President of the Macao Tourism Businesses
Association, said at a seminar last week that the Government
should maintain a good social order, readjust its target market,
make joint promotion efforts with Hong Kong and China's inland,
simplify entry procedure and lower certain taxes to attract more
visitors.
</P>
<P>
Macao received seven million visitors last year, down 1.15
million, or 14 percent, from the previous year. It was also the
largest drop in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Except for Taiwan, tourist arrivals from major market all
declined. Tourist arrivals from the largest market, Hong Kong,
dropped for the third year running, to have reached 4.40 million
last year, down 15.5 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of tourists from China's inland
reached 527,000, down 12.6 percent, and the number of Japanese
tourists plummeted 43.6 percent to hit only 290,000.
</P>
<P>
Security problems and the currency crisis are believed to be
the two leading factors causing the decline, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Although there were 2.7 percent growth rate in tourist arrivals
in the first quarter of 1997, rising crimes widely publicized in
international media cut the arrivals by 11.9 percent in the second
quarter. The decline continued till the end of the year, and was
aggravated by the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The unfavorable factors will continue to affect Macao this
year, experts believed.
</P>
<P>
"Macao's tourism will be hit by the devaluation of currencies
in some southeast Asian nations in two aspects," said Chan.
"Tourism arrivals from those nations will continue drop as some
have been plunged into economic chaos."
</P>
<P>
"In addition, devaluation in those countries will divert many
potential tourists from Macao to those destinations because the
cost will be much cheaper," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Government to maintain good social order, and
help create a friendly, clean, comfortable and efficient tourism
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Government should also adjust its target market and make
effective promotion in those regions that are less hit by the
currency crisis like Hong Kong, Taiwan, China's inland and Japan.
The United States and Europe should be targeted as well, Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that Macao should make use of its own
advantages and conduct joint tourism promotion campaigns with Hong
Kong, which faces similar problems as Macao, and China's inland so
that more people will know Macao and visit Macao.

<HEADLINE> Relief Operation Boosted in North-eastern Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military Joint Task
Force (JTF) joined the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) in air-drop
of relief food for flood victims in northeastern Kenya, the Daily
Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted JTF's public affairs officer Amoux Abraham as
saying that the task force is airlifting relief food to flood
victims with two marine KC-130s based at the Moi International
Airport in the port city of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Since last Wednesday, Amoux Abraham said, the JTF has already
airlifted 256 tons of grain in such sites as El-Wak, Wajir,
Garissa, Hola, Mandera, Garsen and Malindi.
</P>
<P>
He said that after assessing the flood situation, they
observed that the entire length of the Tana River and its delta
were still flooded, extending to as far away as a mile on either
side of the river.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the JTF officer said, major access roads have
been washed away, thus isolating towns in areas such as Tana
River District and Dadaab.
</P>
<P>
Over the last four months, torrential rains caused by the El
Nino phenomenon have destroyed roads and bridges in northeastern
Kenya, making it impossible to reach many areas in the region by
road.
</P>
<P>
Since December last year, WFP has delivered 6,500 tons of
relief food to the region with two Belgian Air Force C-130s and
one Transafrik C-130, and a Kenya Air Force Buffalo freighter and
a helicopter.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Women's Efforts for Political Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 2 (Xinhua) -- A new effort by the Kuwaiti
women to gain political rights in the Islamic emirate was thwarted
as a parliamentary committee rejected a draft law granting them
the rights of elections, local media reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti National Assembly's Legal and Legislative Committee at
a meeting Sunday unanimously rejected a draft law which calls for
granting women the rights
</P>
<P>
Committee Chairman MP Ahmed Baquer said after the meeting that
the decision to reject the bill was based on a Fatwa (religious
ruling) by the Fatwa Department at the Islamic Affairs Ministry,
adding that the ruling considers the bill religiously unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti constitution grants equal right and obligations for
women and men. But the election law of the country denies the
women their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
The committee, mainly dominated by Islamic and conservative
parliamentary members, is ardently opposed to women's political
rights, local English daily Arab Times said.
</P>
<P>
Presently women constitute 50.4 percent of Kuwait's 710,000
population. Kuwaiti women first raised their demand for political
right 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the committee decision, women's rights activists
said the decision would only make women more determined to
fight for their rights, while saying they were not surprised
to see the refusal of the bill.
</P>
<P>
A delegation of women activists submitted a memo to the
speaker of the parliament in December 1971, first raising the
demand for political rights after the first women's conference in
Kuwait, but it was rejected.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, a new proposal in this regard was raised but was
turned down again.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue of women's political rights in Kuwait was
raised by previous parliaments and the 1992 parliament discussed
suggestions to give women the right to vote ahead of giving them
the right to be nominated to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti previous National Assembly's Legal and Legislative
Committee passed a similar draft law which never reached the
floor for discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- An Israel Air Force (IAF) F-15D
fighter crashed Sunday during a routine training in the West Bank,
killing the pilot and navigator, an official IAF announcement
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plane hit an 80-meter-high antenna on Mount Eval before
crashing into a nearby mountain outside Nablus, the West Bank, and
the pilot and navigator died instantly, it said.
</P>
<P>
They were identified as pilot Maj. Uriel Kolton, 27, from Bat
Yam, and navigator Capt. Uri Manor, 21, from Haifa.
</P>
<P>
IAF Commander Maj.-Gen Eitan Ben-Eliahu has appointed an
internal inquiry to be headed by a colonel.
</P>
<P>
The advanced F-15D had been flying at a height of about 2,000
meters at sea when it headed east in a simulated attack with a
speed of some 800 kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
The F-15D was the most advanced model of the US-made jet
fighters in Israel until the arrival this year of the F-15I. F-15I
has a terrain-following radar system which experts believe could
have prevented this type of accident.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports on Sunday that an IAF helicopter crashed
at the same place were uncorrect.

<HEADLINE> Giant Chemical Company to Make First Investment in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The giant chemical company Dow
is to make its first-ever Israeli investment in high-tech
technology in the coastal city of Ashkelon in central Israel,
local daily Haaretz reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Ashkelon Mayor Benny Vaknin as saying that
the deal was sealed at an international business conference being
held in the city.
</P>
<P>
Vaknin noted that the conference, which opened Saturday night
and attracted some 120 entrepreneurs and investors from 27
countries, has so far led to deals to establish some new
high-tech ventures in the city.
</P>
<P>
Dow is one of the 10 largest chemical companies in the world,
with a 20-billion-U.S. dollar turnover. It plans to become a
partner in a high-tech factory in Ashkelon, investing 750,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Its scientists will work with scientist from the factory on a
number of high-tech projects, Vaknin said. Meanwhile, the company
also plans to set up another factory in Ashkelon to manufacture
microchips.
</P>
<P>
Another new venture resulting from the conference will be a
factory set up by BND, a subsidiary of the Switzerland-based metal
 developer and manufacturer Grove. The company plans to invest 120
million U.S. dollars in the plant, which will employ 750 workers
in its first year of operation, Vaknin said.
</P>
<P>
The Reichman family from New York also plans to invest in
Ashkelon, by setting up a company to apply one of the
technologies developed in the city, an electronic scanner for
mapping the brain. The investors are now looking for a suitable
site to build the plant, at an investment of 4 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A fourth deal which is near closure, Vaknin said, is with the
Swiss company Data Systems, which is also interested in setting
up a factory to manufacture microchips.
</P>
<P>
High-tech industry in Israel has enjoyed high rates of return
on investment, and stock exchanges around the world have shown
keen interest in Israeli high-tech shares.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Ashkelon has been declared a national priority zone
for high-tech and tourism, which means that investors in these
sectors are eligible for government grants and tax benefits.

<HEADLINE> Australia Seeks to Convene World Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer Monday announced Australia would pursue a series
of diplomatic initiatives to strengthen the Biological Weapons
Convention, including a plan for a world chemical weapons meeting.
</P>
<P>
Australia will call for a high level meeting of foreign
ministers or officials and have negotiations on a strengthened
chemical weapons treaty in place by the end of this year, Downer
told the Australian parliament in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
But a spokesman told Xinhua that no specific date has yet been
set for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Despite a legal norm (of the Biological Weapons Convention)
preventing the development, production and stockpiling of chemical
weapons being in place for some 25 years, there is still no
effective means of checking countries' compliance with the
convention, Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community needs a reliable mechanism to
detect and act upon any breach of the convention," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He indicated military action should be taken to enforce the
convention if diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
He accused Iraq of violating the norm by developing a large
scale biological weapons program, which "demonstrates the
necessity of intensifying the current negotiations and putting in
place a stringent verification regime that will ensure that the
world is free from the threat of biological warfare."
</P>
<P>
"For our part, the government would like to see these
negotiations concluded by the end of this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Australia would also establish an expert advisory group,
including scientists, academics and industry representatives, to
ensure the verification regime was as effective as possible,
Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"And we intend to work closely with other delegations in our
current capacity as vice-chairman of the negotiations and as
coordinator of the Western group, to develop a draft protocol text
which will allow an early conclusion of the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came during debate on a motion by Australian
Prime Minister John Howard who sought parliamentary approval for
his decision to deploy nearly 200 Australian troops to Kuwait last
month in support of a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China Comments on US Human Rights Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China Society for Human Rights
Studies today issued a commentary on the China section of the 1997
Human Rights Report of the Department of State of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The commentary, entitled "Human Rights in Name, Swaying Power
in Reality," points out that the China section of the report that
was released on January 30 is full of falsehoods.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the US of regarding itself as a "human rights judge,"
the commentary says the report wantonly made judgments and censure
regarding the human rights situations in 194 countries and regions
worldwide, and ran into strong opposition from many countries in
Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe upon its release.
</P>
<P>
The report devotes many pages to flagrant accusations about
China's human rights situation, the commentary says, and it also
took all the means of fabrication, distortion and piecing together
irrelevant events.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that the report fabricates so-called
"facts" in order to draw up charges against China for human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
For example, in order to prove that China suppresses so-called
"dissidents," it proclaims in pretended earnest that "At least
eight protesters were picked up by police in Tiananmen Square
during the 15th Party Congress."
</P>
<P>
However, it is learned that actually not even a single
demonstration occured in Beijing during the meeting, and the
so-called arrest of eight demonstrators is a sheer fabrication,
the commentary says.

<HEADLINE> China Comments on US Human Rights Report (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to the blame made by the report on China's
poverty-alleviation policy, the commentary defends that the
program does not include "forced evacuation of persons from the
poorest mountain areas," nor has it "disrupted the traditional
living patterns of ethnic minority groups."
</P>
<P>
In fact, to solve the problem of insufficient food and clothing
for people in some regions, the Chinese government has formulated
and implemented a key poverty-alleviation program which aims to
help 80 million people to get rid of poverty within seven years
(1994-2000).
</P>
<P>
The program includes a plan for helping the people living in
extremely harsh natural conditions to cast off poverty through
resettlement, the commentary explains, and it represents a
pioneering undertaking of the Chinese people against harsh natural
environments.
</P>
<P>
Facts have proved that the program is welcomed by the local
people, for it is an effective measure to help the people in
poverty-stricken regions to improve their human rights conditions,
the commentary notes.
</P>
<P>
Different from previous years' versions, the United States
mentions a number of positive aspects China has made in human
rights progress this year. The report even recognizes on some
occasions that average Chinese citizens go about their daily life
with more personal freedom than ever before, it says.
</P>
<P>
However, the report asserts there is still "widespread and
well-documented human rights abuses" in China, the commentary
points out, and this reveals that the US judgement on China's
human rights is not based on reality but in-built political bias.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that it is widely recognized that 1997 has
witnessed continued and remarkable progress in China's human
rights.
</P>
<P>
China achieved favorable national economic growth with a high
increase rate and a low inflation rate during the year, while
people's living standard grew steadily, and the human rights
situation further improved.
</P>
<P>
China is now enjoying political stability, economic growth,
ethnical unity and its people are living and working happily, the
commentary says, adding that the human rights situation is
undergoing improvement on an all-round basis.
</P>
<P>
However, the report ignores the aforementioned facts and uses
on absurd logic to criticize China for extensively infringing
upon human rights.
</P>
<P>
The commentary points out that maintaining human rights
according to the US logic would require defying the legitimate
government of China and the status of the Communist Party of China
as the ruling party.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Workers Urged not to Take Part in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Drastic and punitive action will
be taken against employers and employees who will take part in
the stay-away on Tuesday planned by Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions, a senior Zimbabwean official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan Shamuyarira Sunday
told the daily "The Herald" that the police and the army will be
deployed in the capital city Harare, to ensure that peace
prevails as workers report for work.
</P>
<P>
"All workers should report for work tomorrow without fear as
they will be protected by the police and the army," he said.
</P>
<P>
Security will also be provided at shops and factories to
enable them to conduct normal business.
</P>
<P>
"Drastic and punitive action will be taken against workers who
stay away from work, and business people who encourage their
workers to stay away by shutting their businesses," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government was aware of some whites who were
instigating civil unrest,adding that stern action will also be
taken against them.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Harare Sunday night, Minister of
Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare Florence Chitauro also
urged all workers to report for work, saying the job stay-away
was illegal.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU on Friday called for a mass stay-away from work to
press the government for the scrapping of the five percent
development levy and 15 percent tax on pensions as well as the
removal of the two and half percent sales tax increase on goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
It also wants prices of basic goods restored to their pre-July
1997 levels.

<HEADLINE> China Comments on US Human Rights Report (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report portrays the United States itself as a universal
embodiment of human rights, attacking China repeatedly for going
against "internationally accepted norms", censuring China for
making itself an "exception to the principle of universality" of
the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights".
</P>
<P>
In fact, it is the United States that takes itself as an
"exception to the principle of universality" of the "Universal
Declaration of Human Rights," the commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important contributions the "Declaration" has
made to the world is that it not only for the first time on a
global basis affirmed people's political rights, but also their
economic, social and cultural rights.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, has consistently regarded itself as
a spokesman for this universality, and has openly taken itself as
an exception to the principle of universality by not acknowledging
until the present date the economic, social and cultural rights as
part of the human rights in its constitution, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
As to the human rights diplomacy adopted by the United States,
it is a further demonstration of the country's exception to the
universality of human rights, it notes.
</P>
<P>
The "Country Reports on Human Rights Practices" issued by the
State Department of the United States each year focus on 190-plus
nations and regions around the world, but takes exception to the
United States by putting no word on the human rights record of its
own.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that like many other countries in the
world, China cannot act in line with the human rights standard set
by the United States, because the two countries are quite
different in their state realities.
</P>
<P>
China is a large developing country with a backward economy,
while the United States is a superpower, it notes, adding that
development is the top priority in China, and represents the key
for solving a wide assortment of problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, stable social and political environments are
preconditions for China's development, the commentary emphasizes,
and China's top priority in fostering human rights centers on
ensuring the rights to subsistence and development as well as
promoting comprehensive human rights by achieving development
under stable conditions.

<HEADLINE> China Comments on US Human Rights Report (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States not only lacks authority from the United
Nations or other accepted international organizations, but also
lacks the backing of international laws to make judgements on
human rights situations in other countries based on its domestic
laws.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the US illegal practices represent
nothing more than hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
It is well known that the Human Rights Report periodically
released by the US Department of State resulted from the political
needs of the Cold War launched by itself.
</P>
<P>
From the very beginning it has served as a political weapon of
the US government to hem in socialist countries, oppress
developing countries and achieve hegemony.
</P>
<P>
With the end of the Cold War and the emergence of
multi-polarization, people all over the world are demanding an end
to Cold War thinking and confrontation, and seeking equal dialogue
and cooperation so as to promote a healthy development of human
rights around the world.
</P>
<P>
At a time when proposing dialogue and opposing confrontation
have become an irresistible historical trend, the United States
government has already received strong opposition and resistance
from nations worldwide for clinging to a relic of the Cold War --
the Human Rights Report.
</P>
<P>
For too many years, the report has been a giant barrier for
developing the Sino-US relationship, the commentary notes, adding
that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's successful visit to the
United States in 1997 has ushered in a new phase of development of
the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two governments issued the Sino-US Joint Declaration, which
dedicated them to building a strategic partnership, it says.
</P>
<P>
Although significant differences exist in dealing with human
rights issues, the two sides have agreed to solve the problems by
means of governmental and non-governmental dialogue in the spirit
of equality and mutual respect, which reflects the needs of the
times and the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
The commentary earnestly urges the US Department of State to
return to the correct route of dialogue and cooperation in coping
with human rights issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of businessmen in the
southern Philippine island of Mindanao closed shops Monday to
protest against high interest rates being imposed by local banks.
</P>
<P>
Augusto Velarde, head of a provincial business association,
said 90 percent of business in Marbel town, South Cotabato were
paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the businessmen were against what they said
excessive lending rates of 30 to 38 percent set by local banks,
adding that the action only meant to serve as indignation over the
banks' unreasonable rates increase.
</P>
<P>
However, Deogracias Vistan, head of the Bankers Association of
the Philippines, said bankers were already directed on February 2
to lower the interest rates by one percent every week until it
falls at around 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
Vistan said that any unreasonable increases should be
immediately reported to the Bankers Association of the Philippines
for proper action.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, some 1,000 people from different sectors held
a peaceful rally at a park in South Cotabato, asking for the
lowering of the interest rates.

<HEADLINE> Over 671,800 Zimbabweans Registered for Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 671,800 Zimbabweans have
so far registered for food aid with the Ministry of Public Service,
Labor and Social Welfare and more are expected to apply as their
food stocks continue to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 671,800, 350,300 had applied for free food, while
another 321,455 had requested aid under the government's grain
loan scheme, according to statistics issued by the Social Welfare
Ministry at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The number of people who urgently needed food aid was expected
to swell because the rain season started late during the present
agricultural season owing to the predicted El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
But the government has since made an assurance that it had
enough supplies to feed the nation.
</P>
<P>
Although most crops were doing well countrywide, there was an
urgent need for rainfall in some parts to save the moisture-stressed
dryland maize crop which is currently at grain filling stage.
</P>
<P>
Should these adverse conditions prevail, more people were
expected to register for food aid from the government.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Lands and Agriculture Kumbirai Kangai reiterated
at the weekend that the government would not import any maize, as
the strategic grain reserve had sufficient maize in stock to take
the nation through to the next harvest.

coffee have suffered huge losses due to abnormal weather
conditions and drought caused by the El Nino phenomenon, local
press reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's National Hydrometeorological Center said that the
rainy season ended one or two months earlier than usual in
1997. The precipitation dropped 30 percent nationwide, and 70
percent in some places.
</P>
<P>
Lack of rainfall has greatly lowered water levels in Vietnam's
rivers and reservoirs. It has triggered seawater to flow back into
rice fields in the southern and coastal areas of the
country. Salinization of soil thus has worsened.
</P>
<P>
Continuous drought would affect the production of hydro
electricity, which is Vietnam's major source of energy. Water and
energy shortages will adversely affect the country's industrial
and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The unusual weather has drawn great attention from the
Vietnamese government. It calls on its people to make efforts to
fight drought and minimize the impact of natural disasters, in
order to ensure the sustained development of the country's
agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Money Supply in January Grows at Slower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's money supply
recorded a slower growth of 16 percent in January this year
compared with a marked expansion of 18.5 percent in December 1997,
the State Bank reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Money supply at the end of January, 1998, grew by 2.8 billion
ringgit (775.623 million U.S. dollars) against a growth of 11
billion ringgit (3.047 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of
December, 1997, the central bank said in its "Monetary and
Financial Developments for January 1998" released here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In terms of components, currency in circulation recorded a
significant increase of 5.2 billion ringgit (1.44 billion U.S.
dollars), due to the festive season at the end of January, it
said, adding however, this was partly offset by the decline in
demand deposits of 3.8 billion ringgit (1.0526 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Broad quasi-money meanwhile expanded by 1.4 billion ringgit
(387.811 million U.S. dollars) due mainly to the increase in fixed
deposits and repurchase agreements, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the State Bank's international reserves increased by
103 million ringgit (28.531 million U.S. dollars) from the level
at the end of January to 56.7 billion ringgit (15.706 billion U.S.
dollars at the present rate) at February 14, 1998, it said, adding
that the U.S. dollar equivalent of international reserves on
February 14, 1998, was 20.4624 billion U.S. dollars, sufficient to
finance 3.2 months of retained imports.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said that it has not entered into any forward
transactions in its investment operations and that in terms of
determinants, claims on the private sector rose by 8.1 billion
ringgit (2.2437 billion U.S. dollars) with loans and advances
expanding by 3.4 billion ringgit (941.828 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In addition to the claims on the private sector, government
budgetary operations and to a lesser extent the external sector
was also expansionary on money supply, it said.
</P>
<P>
In January, the ringgit experienced pressure amid turbulent
regional developments, but strengthened towards the month's end.
</P>
<P>
After recording a low of 4.8800 ringgit against the U.S. dollar
on January 7, the ringgit recovered to close at 4.4250 against
the greenback on January 27, an appreciation of 10.3 percent from
the level recorded on January 7.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the local unit strengthened further supported by
international, regional and domestic developments and was close to
3.6550 against the greenback on February 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the ringgit, which recorded an appreciation of 21.1
percent against the U.S. dollar last month, is hovering at the
3.6100 level.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian NSPD to Find Ways to Overcome Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Monday opened its
first National Smart Partnership Dialogue (NSPD) '98 to find ways
to overcome the current economic and financial crisis facing the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad opened the two-day dialogue,
themed Economic Recovery Through Smart Partnership with a keynote
address on "National Smart Partnership Approach to Development
Since Independence."
</P>
<P>
He called on Malaysian investors not to be swayed by others and
resort to profit-taking the moment share prices appreciate.
</P>
<P>
He said the people should not put their money in other
currencies or in foreign banks as they would effectively be
depriving their fellow businessmen of credit needed for their
operations and expansion purposes.
</P>
<P>
"We must not take out our money from our Malaysian banks
because someone has suggested that our banks are weak and may go
under despite the government's guarantee," he said in his keynote
address.
</P>
<P>
"We should instead support local businesses in every way...we
should support the Buy Malaysia Campaign and reduce foreign
travel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is vigorously engaged now in trying to bring about
economic recovery following upon the devaluation of the ringgit
and shares of companies, he said, adding that to succeed in this
"we must cling to our high values, morality, honor, honesty and
caring for each other... we must not get selfish and act in our
own interests."
</P>
<P>
He said the partnership that Malaysia has developed between the
races when implementing the New Economic Policy (1970-1990) and
the National Development Policy (since 1991), the partnership
between the government, private sector and the workers and their
(trade) unions, should not only be continued but be intensified.
</P>
<P>
He said smart partnership demands that "we have to make some
sacrifices now in order that recovery would be hastened."
</P>
<P>
Smart partnership is the way towards economic recovery.
"Anything that stands in the way of smart partnership must be
eschewed, rejected," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said "that way, we will recover sooner and we will all
benefit."
</P>
<P>
The government has formulated many approaches and policies
which might seem to impose restrictions in its quest for personal
or even company interests, he said, adding "...but in the long
run, we will benefit through the minor sacrifices that we are
called upon to make and in everything that we do, we must consider
ourselves as partners to everyone, by caring for the interests of
our partners."
</P>
<P>
The two-day dialogue would see captains of industry forwarding
their views in efforts to find ways to overcome the current
economic and financial crisis facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is scheduled to be the moderator for the first session
on "Strengthening National Resilience Through Smart Partnership -
Roles of Private Sector, Labor and Government."
</P>
<P>
His Deputy and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim is scheduled to
be the moderator for the concluding session on "Strategies for
Recovery - Human Capital, Values and Technology " Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 participants including cabinet ministers, political
leaders, top government officials, corporate captains, trade union
leaders and non-governmental representatives are attending the
dialogue jointly organized by the Malaysian Industry-Government
Group For High Technology (MIGHT) in collaboration with the
Academy of Sciences Malaysia, the Commonwealth Partnership for
Technology and Management (CPTM), the Institute for Strategic and
International Studies (ISIS), the Malaysian Institute of Economic
Research (MIER), the National Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Malaysia and Technology Park Malaysia (TPM).

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Loan Growth Rate Slows Down in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The annual growth rate of
loan in Malaysia moderated to 23.4 percent at the end of January
1998 from 26.5 percent at the end of December 1997, the State Bank
said Monday in its January monthly statistical bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Loans extended in the month under review rose by 3.9 billion
ringgit (1.08 billion U.S. dollars) against a rise of 3.4 billion
ringgit (944.44 million U.S. dollars) in December 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the growth in loans was extended to the
manufacturing sector, accounting for 2.073 billion ringgit (575.83
million U.S. dollars), or 54 percent of the total increase during
the month, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Loans extended to the broad property sector moderated to 1
billion ringgit (277.77 million U.S. dollars) in January 1998
against 2.279 billion ringgit (633.05 million U.S. dollars) in
December 1997 due to lower amount of loans extended to the
construction sector and for the purchase of non-residential
property, it said.
</P>
<P>
Loans extended to the finance, insurance and business services
increased by 1.2 billion ringgit (333.33 million U.S. dollars) and
hire purchase loans for passenger cars rose by 0.8 billion ringgit
(222.22 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government targeted the annual growth rate of
loan at 20 percent by the end of the first quarter 1998 and at 15
percent by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said total deposits declined by 4.9 billion
ringgit (1.36 billion U.S. dollars) to 428.522 billion ringgit
(119.03 billion U.S. dollars) compared with an increase of 17.2
billion ringgit (4.77 billion U.S. dollars) in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the withdrawals was made by business enterprises
and financial institutions, the bank said, adding the lower
deposits in January were due to the festive season at the end of
January and temporary placements of deposits in December 1997 due
to year-end activities, placement of loan proceeds and bonus
payments.
</P>
<P>
It said on an annual basis, deposit growth moderated to 16.4
percent in the month under review against 21.3 percent at the end
of December 1997.
</P>
<P>
With the growth in loans exceeding that of deposits, the local
banking system recorded a resource gap of 8.4 billion ringgit
(2.33 billion U.S. dollars) in January, thus, the outstanding
resource surplus of the banking system declining to 23.1 billion
ringgit (6.416 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of January from
31.5 billion ringgit (8.75 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the loan deposit ratio increased to 94.6 percent
in January against 92.7 percent at the end of December 1997, it
added.

<HEADLINE> Fires Destroy Economic Forests in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Forest fires as a result of a
prolonged drought in Vietnam have destroyed numerous economic
plants, the local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 730 hectares of tender eucalyptus of the
international joint venture Kien Tai were burned by 17 fires,
which occurred in Kien Giang, Vietnam's southern province.
</P>
<P>
Five more fires occurred in the U Minh Thuong forest buffer
zone and natural park, with over 30 hectares of tender cajeput
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Little rainfall in this season was the main cause of the forest
fires.
</P>
<P>
After the tropical storm linda hit the Mekong Delta in early
November last year, a prolonged drought in the region has
threatened crops and forests.
</P>
<P>
The provincial ranger department and local authorities have
mobilized groups of firemen to protect forests most vulnerable to
forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Five high-capacity pumping machines have been used to supply
water to the U Minh Thuong natural park which boasts up to 7,000
hectares of forest.
</P>
<P>
According to the forestry department, Vietnam had 290 forest
fires all over the country last year, and 1,361 hectares of
natural and planted forests were destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Kosovo Armed Conflict Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Tension in Yugoslavia's southern
province of Kosovo heightened on Sunday after an escalation of a
larger armed conflict between Serbian police and local ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released on Sunday, the Serbian Interior
Ministry said four Serbian policemen and 16 ethnic Albanians were
killed while another two Serbian policemen injured, when a police
patrol was attacked Saturday in the village of Likoshane near
Glogovac by ethnic Albanian terrorists using bazookas, bombs and
automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, there are conflicting media reports about the number
of those killed and injured. The state-owned Serbian newspaper
"Politika" quoted the Kosovo Albanian political leadership -- the
DSK -- as saying that "at least 15 ethnic Albanians had been
killed and 27 injured" Sunday morning in the clash.
</P>
<P>
"Politika" also reported that three Serbian policemen have been
killed so far in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade Radio B92 on Sunday quoted the Kosovo Albanian human
rights organization as saying that violence was going on and that
30 heavily-armed police vehicles and several helicopters had also
been sighted moving towards Likoshane on mid-Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, police authorities said that the Serbian police had
been withdrawn from the conflict region Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Croatian news agency, around 2,500 ethnic
Albanians staged demonstrations in Pristina, the capital city of
Kosovo, for stopping the violence and called on the United States
to make measures for preventing the escalation of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic insisted Sunday in a
letter to Serbian President Milan Milutinovic that the problem of
Kosovo must been solved exclusively in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
He called on the ethnic Albanians not to shed innocent blood
for some political hacks and profiteers.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Increase Hotel Fees in Tourism Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Hotels Association
announced on Sunday that hotel fees in the tourism resort of
Pattaya would be increased by 30 percent beginning from October.
</P>
<P>
"The increase was made necessary because the room rates in
Pattaya and adjoining areas were unrealistically low when compared
to those charged in Europe and other foreign countries," said
Chatchawal Supachayanont, president of the Thai Hotels
Association.
</P>
<P>
Pattaya, a tourist attraction about 150 kilometers south of
Bangkok, receives millions of tourists worldwide every year.
</P>
<P>
Chatchawal said the increase would reflect the weakened baht,
which had devaluated about 50 percent against the dollar since
Thailand floated the currency's exchange rate against the dollar
in July last year.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment would bring the hotel room rates on a par with
international standards and reflect higher operation cost,
Chatchawal said.
</P>
<P>
Room rates in Pattaya have not increased for the past 15 years
because of the business competition which enabled foreign tour
operators to dictate the prices for their customers visiting the
beach resort.
</P>
<P>
The 30-percent increase would be adjusted after the expiry in
October of the agreement on room rates which Pattaya hotels have
signed with foreign tour operators.
</P>
<P>
Asia Pattaya Hotel Managing Director Anusak Rodboonmee said
the rate increase was needed to save the Pattaya hotel industry
since the present room rates quoted for foreign tour operators had
been signed about one to two years ago when the baht was strong.
</P>
<P>
Anusak said in remarks published by Bangkok Post Monday that
the rate increase would not affect Thai tourism industry since it
would apply only to foreign tour operators bringing tourists from
abroad to the beach resort.

<HEADLINE> Argentina to Continue Fight Against Unemployment, Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem said on Sunday that his government will adhere to its reform
policy and continue the fight against unemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
In his annual government working report addressed to the
parliament, the president said economic, social and employment
reforms will top the agenda of the government in the following two
years.
</P>
<P>
Argentina's economy in 1997 increased by 8.1 percent, 2.1
percentage points higher than planned, Menem said in his 50-minute
speech.
</P>
<P>
He added that the taxation reform, which aimed to create jobs
and lighten the burden of those on a low income, is one of the
priorities of the current economic reform.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for support from parliament for his
reform. Menem's ruling Justicialist Party suffered a defeat in
last year's elections and the president has to face an
opposition-dominated parliament.
</P>
<P>
As for the country's foreign policy, Menem said his government
will continue efforts to seek a peaceful end to the dispute over
Malvinas Islands (Falkland Islands) with Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said he will discuss the issue with British leaders during
his official visit there later this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Aluminium Market Stay Oversupplied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 2 (Xinhua) -- China's aluminium market will stay
oversupplied this year as exports are expected to drop
drastically, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Aluminium consumption is estimated to be 2.18 million tons this
year when the domestic total output reaches 2.2 million tons, the
newspaper quoted a source from China National Non-ferrous Metals
Corp (CNNC) as saying.
</P>
<P>
The glut on the domestic market will expand from 489,000 tons
in 1997 to 630,000 tons this year, and the decrease in exports
will exacerbate the oversupply situation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since southeast Asian countries share nearly 99 percent of
China's export market and the recent financial meltdown has
greatly depreciated their currencies, they will not be able to
import as much aluminium this year.
</P>
<P>
China exported 248,000 tons of aluminium last year, a big jump
of 125.7 percent from 1996.

as saying.
</P>
<P>
Suchai Jaovisidha, director-general of the Internal Trade
Department, said he will inform the cabinet of the situation
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Prices of some 428 products were increased to meet the rising
production costs suffered by manufacturers. Among the 428 product
groups, 72 are on the list to be closely monitored by the Commerce
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Suchai said manufacturers asked to raise the prices of their
products due to higher production costs, including imported raw
materials.
</P>
<P>
They complained that the costs skyrocketed as the exchange rate
sank below 35 baht against one dollar from the 25 baht against one
dollar before the July 2 floatation.
</P>
<P>
In view of the recent appreciation of the baht, Suchai said his
department will ask manufacturers to reduce prices.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers of fertilizer, wheat flour, concentrate sweet
milk, pharmaceutical, soap, sanitary goods and shampoo have been
asked to keep their price down.
</P>
<P>
The baht sank below 50 against a dollar in January, but
stabilized at 42-43 against a dollar in recent weeks.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: Kosovo Issue Yugoslavia's Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic said on Sunday that he opposed any attempt to
"internationalize" the Kosovo issue, stressing that the issue
"could not be successfully resolved in the same manner as Serbia."
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolence to relatives of the policemen who
died in a clash with separatist militants Saturday, Milosevic
reiterated "the Kosovo problem is Yugoslavia's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
Milosevic called on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo Province not to
"shed blood for the personal interests of some politicians and
foreign forces involved."
</P>
<P>
Only Kosovo's Albanians coexist in a peaceful and equal
condition would they have a bright future, the president stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, some Interior Ministry patrol policemen were
attacked in an ambush in Glogovac, Kosovo. Four policemen and 16
terrorists were killed in gun shooting. Police also arrested nine
terrorists and confiscated a lot of weapons.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the separatist paramilitary group, "Kosovo
Liberation Force" raided local police units and carried out
terrorist actions against serbs, Montenegrins and even ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo is an area ruled directly from Belgrade since 1989 but
its peopled were largely Albanian-speakers.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian community forms about 90 percent of the
population of the province, which accounts for about 20 percent of
the entire population in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Help Banks Win Back Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda said in an interview published Monday that
Thailand would help commercial banks and finance companies win
back confidence.
</P>
<P>
He said winning back confidence in the economy and financial
system would be among the priorities of the government.
</P>
<P>
The restoration of confidence was vital to renewed capital
inflow into the country, a trend which would help ease the tight
liquidity in the economy and would stabilize the baht exchange
rate, Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
The government, he said, would oversee the reform of the Bank
of Thailand as one of the major steps to ensure the renewed inflow
of capital.
</P>
<P>
He said he was fully aware of the international community's
and public's concern about the disastrous role of the Bank of
Thailand in defending the baht and in extending liquidity support
to finance companies, whose half of the 800-billion-baht loans
might not be recoverable.
</P>
<P>
That was why the government would like to enforce 'surgery on
the Bank of Thailand', Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
He said without explanation that the government's efforts to
create macroeconomic stability had begun to bear fruit in the past
three months.
</P>
<P>
Another confidence-boosting strategy is to ensure that there is
not an excessive contraction in the economy, which is forecast to
post growth of -3 percent in 1998, Tarrin added.

<HEADLINE> Makinen, McRae Retired from Safari Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Champion Tommi Makinen and Colin
McRae were forced out of the Safari Rally on Sunday, opening the
way for Briton Richard Burns to win his first world rally
championship victory.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the second leg, Burns led Finn Ari Vatanen in his
Ford by six minutes.
</P>
<P>
Burns, runner-up to compatriot McRae in this event last year,
had been 36 seconds behind Makinen overnight. The Mitsubishi
driver ended the day in a time of six hours seven minutes and 25
seconds.
</P>
<P>
McRae, in a Subaru, was the first to retire when his engine
began to overheat on the 10th stage. McRae finished it in seventh
place, which dropped him from second to fourth overall, but his
engineers were unable to identify the cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
McRae's retirement, which leaves him with only four points
after three events, allowed Mitsubishi driver Makinen to take
things easier.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, who had led the event from the second stage on
Saturday, had earlier been hit with an 80 second penalty for
leaving the eighth stage's service area eight minutes late after
repairs to his oil sump. However, worse was to come.
</P>
<P>
Makinen, a winner of this event in 1996, managed only six kms
on the 66.5 kms 11th stage before engine failure forced his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
McRae's teammate Pierro Liatti, of Italy, was also forced to
retire when engine failure prevented him from completing the 10th
stage.
</P>
<P>
Vatanen suffered a puncture on the 11th stage but elected not
to change it, unlike his team-mate Juha Kankkunen, of Finland.
That choice left him fourth behind Frenchman Didier Auriol, in a
Toyota.
</P>
<P>
World championship leader Carlos Sainz, in a Toyota, won his
first stage of the event on the 11th, but the Spaniard remains 12
minutes behind Burns.
</P>
<P>
The drivers face another five stages before the finish in
Nairobi on Monday.

VIENNA, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Martina Ertl won her
first World Cup slalom of the season on Sunday in Hinterglemm,
Austria.
</P>
<P>
Ertl, 24, made amend of her poor performance in Nagano with a
combined time of one minute 36.00 seconds though she finished a
disappointing sixth in the first run. She was fourth in both
slalom and giant slalom at the Nagano Games.
</P>

The German, who has four victories in giant slalom and super-G
races, came back in the second with a fastest run to steal the win
from Norway's first run leader Trine Bakke.

<HEADLINE> Credit Growth Slows Down in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' growth of credit
slowed down to 29.1 percent at the end of 1997 from 39.1 percent
the year before, due to the banking sector's "conservatism" since
the outbreak of the currency crisis last July.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Business World Monday quoted a report from the
Department of Finance as saying that the growth rate represents a
significant drop from the pre-crisis level of up to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the total loans extended for the whole
year of 1997 amounted to 1.947 trillion pesos as opposed to 1.508
trillion pesos in 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the period, reserve money, the measurement of currency
in circulation and banks' reserves with the central bank, declined
by 9.5 percent to 266.5 billion pesos after rising 14.4 percent in
end-1996 to 243.3 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
This means that banks lending rates surged during the period,
not because of tighter liquidity, but the uncertainty that it has
become "very risk to lend", the report said.
</P>
<P>
Department of Finance officials said the banks' decision to
slash their lending activities was "understandable" given the
volatile market conditions.
</P>
<P>
However, this "conservatism" has led to "extremely high"
interest rates, and may in the end, boomerang on the banks
themselves since it would translate into an overall slowdown in
the economy, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the banks' conservatism is likely to stay as long
as the regional financial markets continue to stand on shaky
ground.

final and to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in Sydney in January.

Davenport in the semifinals Saturday, said she guarded against any
letdown after taking the match many felt amounted to the real
final.

The 17-year-old Williams, who had three service breaks in each
set Sunday, is the biggest hitter on the women's tour but had just
two aces in the final.
</P>

MANILA, March 2 (Xinhua) -- Three helicopters carrying
Philippine President Fidel Ramos and top government officials made
emergency landings due to bad weather, Manila Bulletin reported on
Monday.
</P>

The newspaper said the pilots failed in several tries to cross
a northern mountain range on Sunday due to thick clouds and rain
as Ramos, accompanied by cabinet officials and journalists,
traveled to Lagawe, Ifugao province, to open a sports meet.

<P>
With a map in hand, Ramos conferred with the pilots and decided
to land at a school in another town in Ifugao, a government
statement said.
</P>
<P>
From there, Ramos and his party continued the trip in a pickup
truck and two jeeps to Lagawe.
</P>

Ramos was traveling to several northern towns on Sunday partly
to campaign for candidates of his ruling party in the May 11

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian pole vaulter Anzhela
Balakhonova stole the show on the final day of the European indoor
championships on Sunday with a world record.
</P>
<P>
Balakhonova, 25, cleared 4.45 meters in her first attempt,
adding one centimeter to the former mark set by Iceland's Vala
Flosadottir last month.
</P>
<P>
The former gymnast failed at her three attempts to improve when
the bar was set at 4.50
</P>
<P>
Flosadottir, the reigning champion, had to settle for the
bronze medal in a hotly contested event.
</P>
<P>
Former world record holder Daniela Bartova, from Czech
Republic, also cleared 4.40 meters, she was awarded the silver
medal having had fewer failures throughout the competition.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine also struck gold with a surprise victory in the men's
200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Sergey Osovich won in a national record of 20.40 seconds, the
fastest indoor time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
Anninos Marcoullides, of Cyprus, was an equally unexpected
silver medalist with 20.65 while Britain's Allyn Condon took third
in 20.68.
</P>
<P>
Britain's John Mayock won the men's 3,000 meters.
</P>

distance, won a physical race ahead of three Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
Having had to push his way out of trouble on the final lap and
heavily barged Spain's Manuel Pancorbo, the British runner was
loudly booed by the local crowd for costing the host nation its
last chance of a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The barracking continued throughout the British national anthem
at the medal ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Mayock in return made various provocative gestures to the
spectators.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, UNSCOM Make Different Interpretation on Inspections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ambassador to the United
Nations Nizar Hamdoon suggested Sunday the U.N. secretary-general
will be in charge of running a special group formed by diplomats
for the inspections of eight presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
"The special team that was formed will be focusing on the eight
presidential sites. As for all other sites in Iraq, UNSCOM (U.N.
Special Commission) will continue to be in charge of," Hamdoon
told CNN in an interview. "But as for those eight sites, there
will be a special team which UNSCOM will be represented within...
But the secretary-general will be in charge of running that team."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler remains the
person in charge, Hamdoon said that "it depends (on) how you see
it."
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be more input by the secretary-general in
this special team case than in the work of the UNSCOM at large,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
But Butler said that contrary to the comment by Hamdoon, the
agreement reached by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, was "perfectly clear -- it doesn't
depend on how you see it."
</P>
<P>
"That (Hamdoon's comment) troubles me slightly because actually
it doesn't depend (on) how you see it," Butler told CNN in the
same interview a little later.
</P>
<P>
"The extraordinary agreement that Kofi Annan brought back from
Baghdad... has within it a provision that says we will draw up the
special arrangements under which presidential sites will be
visited," he said.

must change its stated objective, which is containing Saddam, not
removing him.
</P>
<P>
"I would speak to 22 million Iraqis: `we're going to liberate
you,'" he told the same program.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Leahy, another Democratic senator, agreed on the same
program that Clinton should press for Saddam's removal.
</P>
<P>
But Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said the difficulty of
overthrowing Saddam meant the United States might have to stick to
a policy of containment.

<HEADLINE> White House Aide Calls Starr Probe Partisan Pursuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A White House aide said Sunday
it is time for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to end his
investigation of President Bill Clinton, while a former
administration lawyer said Attorney General Janet Reno should fire
the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
"This is not about seeking the truth. This is a partisan
political pursuit of the president, and it's time for Ken Starr to
start wrapping up pieces of his investigation and get to the
bottom of it," said White House adviser Rahm Emanuel on CBS' "Face
the Nation."
</P>
<P>
Senator Patrick Leahy said that the prosecutor was out to oust
the president.
</P>
<P>
"The fact of the matter is that... Starr has gotten totally out
of control. He has this fixation of trying to topple the president
of the United States. He's doing everything possible to do it,"
Leahy, a Democrat, said on NBC's "Meet the Press."
</P>
<P>
But on "Meet the Press," Republican Senator Orrin Hatch
contended Starr has done a "very good job."
</P>
<P>
Lanny Davis, a former White House lawyer hired to respond to
queries about sensitive issues, said Starr's subpoena of
presidential adviser Sidney Blumenthal "constitutes blatant
prosecutorial misconduct." Blumenthal was called for testimony
about Starr's suspicions that the White House was trying to
sidetrack his investigation by releasing derogatory information
about his agents.
</P>
<P>
"I think Janet Reno should consider a for-cause dismissal of
this man (Starr)," Davis said on "Fox News Sunday." He said the
president hasn't told his side of the story because "no defense
lawyer... would put a client out in the cross hairs of this
particular out-of-control prosecutor, Mr. Starr."

<HEADLINE> Implanted Pacemaker Helps to Wake Up Coma Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 1 (Xinhua) -- British scientists are planning
trials of a pioneering electronic pacemaker which seems capable of
waking up coma victims.
</P>
<P>
Cambridge University researchers aim to recruit up to a dozen
patients, suffering from persistent vegetative state (PVS), to
take part in the trial this autumn, The Sunday Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The trial, to be run by doctors at the Wolfson Brain Imaging
Center in Cambridge, is part of a four-nation project, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier experiments in France and Japan showed that the
technology can help some PVS patients make almost miraculous
recovery.
</P>
<P>
In PVS, a condition which is normally irreversible, basic
life-support systems continue to function but the patient is
apparently unable to think or communicate and suffers almost total
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
The pacemaker, which is permanently implanted in the brain and
works by delivering tiny electric pulses, seems to be able to
stimulate the revival of higher brain functions, giving back to
some patients the ability to see and hear.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Local Election Victory Seals Schroeder's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 1 (Xinhua) -- A brilliant local election victory
Sunday has confirmed Gerhard Schroeder, the Social Democratic
(SPD) premier of the German Lower Saxony state, as his party's
candidate to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl in the national
elections in September this year.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary computer projections, Schroeder, who
has been contesting with his party chairman Oskar Lafontaine for
the SPD chancellor candidacy, was re-elected Lower Saxony's state
premier by winning over 48 percent of the vote, up from 44.3
percent achieved in the 1994 local elections.
</P>
<P>
It was also the best results achieved by the SPD at the western
German state since 1947.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has vowed to drop his bid for the chancellor
candidacy if he falls two percentage points below the 1994
reading.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the election victory, SPD party manager Franz
Muentefering said in Bonn that Schroeder would be proposed by
Lafontaine as the SPD candidate at a meeting of the party's
executive committee in Bonn Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed later by Lafontaine himself. "Gerhard
Schroeder is now chancellor candidate," he said in an interview
with the German ZDF television network.
</P>
<P>
"I has not expected such a victory in my wildest dreams," said
Schroeder after the first computer projections came out.
</P>
<P>
He interpreted the election results as a clear expression of
German voters' hope for a fundamental political change in Bonn.
"Kohl's era is over," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to computer projections, Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) party won less than 36 percent at the Sunday vote,
down further from its worst showing of 36.4 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
While conceding defeat, Christian Wulff, the Lower Saxony CDU
leader, complained that the vote had been dominated by the issue
of SPD chancellor candidate instead of actual local problems.
</P>
<P>
CDU General Secretary Peter Hintze also tried to play down
Schroeder's performance, saying "a great victory in his own state
means nothing for the general elections."
</P>
<P>
Germany's general election is due to be held on September 27
this year.
