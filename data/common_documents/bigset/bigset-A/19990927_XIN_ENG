<HEADLINE> UAE Calls for Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Sunday called for lifting of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq,
which were imposed after Iraqi troops stormed into Kuwait in
August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions must come to an end because they are only
worsening the plight of the Iraqi people while the Iraqi
government is not affected, UAE Minister of Information and
Culture Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan said in an interview
here with the Jordian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the continuing of sanctions will have an adverse
effect on the U.S. credibility as a peace sponsor," Sheikh
Abdullah added.
</P>
<P>
On the peace negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel,
the minister said that the main issues are still pending.
</P>
<P>
"The task will not be that easy. I do not think that the
Palestinians have anything left to concede," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the Israelis will never negotiate on main issues
like the status of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian
refugees without guaranteeing further Palestinian concessions.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Abdullah also expressed his confidence in the the UAE
federation, which was composed of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras
Al Khaimah, Fujairah, Umm Al Qaiwain and Ajman.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he was worried about the future of the federation,
which was founded in 1971, he said that the federation is
coherent and sound.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot imagine that even a single citizen has doubt about
the future of the federation. This question could have been asked
ten years ago, not now," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Multilateral Talks Before Syrian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Sunday that the multilateral peace talks will not
be resumed before Israel restarts negotiations with Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of the multilateral talks should follow that of
the peace negotiations on all tracks, including the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks, Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The multilateral talks, which kicked off in 1992, came to a
halt in 1996 when former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
took power. The negotiations covered issues including disarmament,
water, Palestinian refugees, the environment and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has agreed to implement the
peace deals with the Palestinians and has started the negotiations
with the Palestinians for a final peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Barak has also promised to resume the stalled talks with Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were suspended in early 1996 due
to disputes over the Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syria
in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, but bilateral relations were cool during the
hard-line Netanyahu's period in office.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Condemns Jewish Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat decried on Sunday the decree of the
Israeli government to build 4,000 housing units in East Jerusalem
and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival here from Tunisia Sunday evening, Arafat
condemned the decree as a violation of the signed agreements
between the two sides and an undermining of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli Ministry of Construction and
Housing issued a decree to build 1,000 housing units in Adumim
settlement in East Jerusalem in addition to 2,600 apartments in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
On the United States' role in the final status talks between
Israel and the Palestinians, Arafat said he agreed with
U.S. President Bill Clinton during their meeting in Washington on
Saturday that the U.S. will play a greater role in the last stage
of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had made a week-long tour of Egypt, the U.S., France and
Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in New York, he made a speech before the United
Nations General Assembly in which he also called on Israel to
implement all signed agreements and halt expansion of Jewish
settlement in the occupied Arab territories.

ABU DHABI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Middle East region
will face a difficult task of environment protection in the new
millennium, according to a newly-published United Nations report.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not to Change Policy Towards S. Africa: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Should the Republicans
come into power in the United States next year, there will be no
change in policy towards South Africa, South African President
Thabo Mbeki predicted.
</P>
<P>
"(South Africa's) relations with the U.S. government are very
good. In fact, they're excellent," Mbeki said in a pre-recorded
interview broadcast Sunday by South African Broadcasting
Corporation (SABC) television.
</P>
<P>
The South African president said he believed that if there was
a change in the U.S. administration from Democratic to Republican,
he didn't think there would be much of a change in policy.
</P>
<P>
"There had always been a bipartisan approach towards South
Africa in the United States," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"Even in the apartheid years there was a great insistence --
correctly -- on a bipartisan approach with regard to South
Africa," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he was prepared to meet the Republican's front
runner for presidential candidate, Texas governor, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
He had wanted to pay a courtesy call on junior Bush during his
recent trip to the United States, but the governor's hectic
schedule had not allowed for this.
</P>
<P>
However, Mbeki said he would still meet the governor.
</P>
<P>
"I will see him. He is, so it seems, a leading candidate for
the presidency of the Republican side."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki dismissed reports that he had cancelled his visit to
Texas because he did not wish to embarrass U.S. Vice-President Al
Gore, the likely Democratic Party nominee.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and Gore share a special relationship having chaired the
U.S.- South Africa bi-national commission under the Nelson Mandela
and Bill Clinton administrations.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, when President Clinton became Democratic candidate...
we actually saw him, before he became president," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would like Deputy President Jacob Zuma as his
successor as co- chair of the commission with Gore, even though
the U.S. vice-president wanted the status quo to remain.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also dismissed reports that he had snubbed President
Clinton by refusing to share a limousine with him after bilateral
talks earlier this week in New York.
</P>
<P>
"I saw the story and it made me feel a little bit sad. I don't
know why anybody would want to invent a story," he said.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Crisis Resolved in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A weeks-long coalition
crisis in Israel was resolved Sunday after an agreement was
reached over the governmental funding of religious schools
belonging to the powerful ultra-Orthodox party Shas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between the Education Ministry and the Shas
party will pave way for thousands of teachers in Shas' schools to
get their salaries, unpaid for more than three months, as soon as
Monday, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Shas issued its threat to quit the coalition of
Prime Minister Ehud Barak if the government would not transfer 12
million shekels (about 2.85 million U.S. dollars) to its
educational network.
</P>
<P>
Finance and Education officials, however, insisted that Shas
had to formulate a reform plan before the transfer of money could
be made, citing reports that millions of shekels had been wasted
due to mismanagement and alleged corruption.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest party in the parliament, controls 17 of
68 seats in Barak's coalition, which had 73 seats before another
ultra-religious party, the United Torah Judaism, withdrew its five
members early this month in protest against Barak's consent to
transport heavy power equipment on the Jewish weekend Shabbath.
</P>
<P>
Religious institutes enjoyed preferential treatment in the
three years of rule of former right-wing prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, raising resentment among the secular public.
</P>
<P>
In the campaign leading to his election victory in May, Barak
pledged to change the national priorities and stop the overflow of
money to the religious schools and institutes.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Countries Urged To Unite On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Vice-President
Simon Muzenda Sunday urged the southern African countries to make
collective decisions on security to avoid manipulation by
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
"Outside powers cannot manipulate us as a collective unit but
can easily do that to individual countries," Muzenda said at a
Southern African Regional Institute for Policy Studies 1999 annual
colloquium in Harare.
</P>
<P>
"Decisions on security matters have to be made through mutual
consultation,!1he said.
</P>
<P>
Muzenda pointed out that it was the policy of some big powers
to project their power through operating in designated regional
centers of influence.
</P>
<P>
It was time Africa started resolving its conflicts by
themselves, he noted, saying that the United Nations had failed to
intervene in conflict areas where Africa had wanted it to act.
</P>
<P>
He said the Organization of African Unity (OAU) should take a
lesson from U.N.'s stance on conflicts from situations in Rwanda,
Somalia and the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
"The conflicts have convinced Africa to take a more active role
in the resolution to African conflicts. The OAU must champion
this cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean vice-president said that anti-government rebels
in southern Africa like the National Union for Total Independence
in Angola (UNITA) should seek civilized ways of participating in
the political and economic development of their countries.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, he said, the end of the cold war led to the
increase of conflicts in various parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Africa had also taken a share of the conflicts, contributing to
the slowing down of the development process in the continent, said
Muzenda.
</P>
<P>
"The end of the cold war created optimism as high expectations
about peace throughout the world. Unfortunately, this has not
been the case," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Civil wars and inter-state conflicts have actually increased
in various parts of the world," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Targets Bombed by U.S.-British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Civilian facilities in the
southern Iraqi province of Basra were bombed on Saturday evening
by the United States and British warplanes, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 20:50 local time (1650 GMT), 22
formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from Saudi and
Kuwaiti bases violated southern Iraqi airspace over the provinces
of Basra, Thi-Qar, Muthana, Najaf and Qadisiyah.
</P>
<P>
These warplanes bombed some civilian and service facilities in
Basra, said the spokesman. He did not mention whether casualties
were inflicted or not.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back at the U.S. and British
planes and forced them to flee to their bases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nine formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from
Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva,
Erbil and Dohuk provinces at 12:05 local time (0805 GMT) on
Sunday, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's massive airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 12,857 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
and military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

ABU DHABI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- President of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan returned
home Sunday from Geneva following a private visit to Switzerland
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed usually spends the summer season in Europe where
the climate is much more pleasant than in the hot and humid UAE.
</P>
<P>
But this year, the president delayed his journey until the end
of August. The summer in the UAE starts in June.
</P>
<P>
After a few days' stay in Geneva, Sheikh Zayed left for
Cleveland, the U.S., and had medical tests there.
</P>
<P>
UAE officials dismissed U.S. newspaper reports that the
president was to have a surgery, saying the checkup was routine
and did not include surgery.
</P>
<P>
A UAE official statement later announced that the medical tests
were successful, and the president were found to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
After the checkup, Sheikh Zayed returned to his residence in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Zayed, who is in his 80s, underwent tests in 1998 in the
U.S. where he had a successful surgery on a vertebra in 1996.

<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
"The Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) on Major Issues Concerning the Reform and Development
of State-owned Enterprises, adopted at the 4th Plenum of the 15th
CPC Central Committee on September 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
THE DECISION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE
</P>
<P>
COMMUNIST PARTY OF CHINA ON MAJOR ISSUES CONCERNING THE REFORM
AND DEVELOPMENT OF STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES
</P>
<P>
(Adopted at the 4th Plenum of the 15th CPC Central
</P>
<P>
Committee on September 22, 1999)
</P>
<P>
To achieve the magnificent goal of the trans-century
development of the country's reform, opening up and modernization
drive, the 4th Plenum of the 15th CPC Central Committee discussed
the major issues related to the reforms and development of State-
owned enterprises (SOEs) and made the following decision.
</P>
<P>
One. Pushing SOE Reforms And Development
</P>
<P>
 Is An Important And Urgent Task
</P>
<P>
Since New China was founded 50 years ago, the Chinese people
of all nationalities have, under the leadership of the CPC and
through unremitting efforts, scored great achievements in the
socialist construction. China has developed from a poor and
backward agrarian country into a socialist country that will soon
become well-off and is striding toward the goal of
industrialization and modernization. This is a great historical
leap forward in the developing process of the Chinese nation, and
in which the SOEs and the working class have made great and
indelible contributions.
</P>
<P>
Since the 3rd Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the
Party has opened up a new way of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory. To overcome the
malpractice of the traditional planned economy, we have
consistently emancipated our minds, sought truth from facts,
actively explored in a gradual manner, and constantly deepened the
reforms of SOEs and the whole economic system to push forward the
modernization drive. Profound changes have taken place in the SOEs
management system and their operational mechanism, and a large
number of enterprises have grown strong amid market competition,
with their technology and equipment remarkably upgraded. The
output of some important products mainly manufactured by SOEs has
taken the lead in the world. Under the new situation in which
public ownership as the main form of ownership and other forms of
ownership economy are developing simultaneously, the State-owned
economy, with its overall strength further enhanced, continues to
play a leading role in the national economy and has always been
the main source of financial revenue, providing strong support for
the country's reform and construction. After years of effort, SOEs
have taken an unprecedented major step toward the reform's goal of
building a socialist market economic system.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOEs reforms are extensive and profound. The transformation of
the SOEs' system and their structural readjustments have reached a
crucial stage, with some deep-rooted contradictions and all the
problems having emerged. A considerable number of SOEs have not
yet adapted to the demands of market economy due to the long-term
influence of the traditional system, the many problems left over
from history, the redundancy of construction over the past years
and the drastic changes of market environment. They are not
flexible in terms of operations, weak in technical innovation,
heavily in debt and social burdens, and have too many surplus
workers and difficulties in production and business operation.
Their economic returns are dropping and some of their employees
have difficulties in their life. It is imperative to take
practical and effective measures to solve these problems, which
has a vital bearing not only on the success or failure of SOE
reforms, but also on the success or failure of the overall
economic restructuring. The whole Party must fully see the
importance and urgency of pushing forward SOE reforms and
development, and must have a sober understanding of the long and
protracted nature of this work, and work tirelessly to make new
breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, peace and development are still the
themes of the times, but hegemony and power politics have also
appeared in a new form. Comprehensive national strength has become
an increasingly leading factor to determine the future and fate of
a country. If we want to enhance China's economic strength,
defense capability and national cohesive force, we must constantly
promote the development and growth of the State-owned economy. The
public-ownership economy, which includes the State-owned economy,
is the economic basis of China's socialist system. It is a basic
force the State uses to lead, push and regulate economic and
social development, and an important guarantee for realizing the
fundamental interests and common prosperity of the people. We must
firmly implement the guidelines of the 15th CPC National Congress,
push forward SOE reforms and development, and enhance the vitality
of the SOEs and the control of the State-owned economy in an
overall way, and this is of great significance to the
establishment of a socialist market economic system, to the
promotion of the sustainable, fast and healthy development of the
economy, to the improvement of the people's life quality, to
maintaining a good political situation of peace and stability, and
to consolidating socialist system.

<P>
The SOEs are a pillar of China's national economy. China must
always rely on and bring into full play the important role of the
SOEs to develop the productive forces of the socialist society and
realize the country's industrialization and modernization. Under
the situation in which the globalization of economy and the
scientific and technological progress are accelerated, SOEs are
facing increasingly fierce market competition. Development is of
overwhelming importance. Therefore it is vital to keenly grasp the
development trend of the domestic and world economy, take concrete
measures to change the mode of economic growth, and expand the
space for development to create new advantages for SOEs as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
SOE reforms constitute the central link of the entire economic
restructuring. The most important thing in establishing and
improving the system of a socialist market economy and in
effecting a good combination of public ownership and market
economy, is to enable the SOEs to form a management system and an
operational mechanism that suit to the demands of the market
economy. It is imperative to continue to emancipate minds and seek
truth from facts for the sake of developing the productive forces
of the socialist society, enhancing the comprehensive national
strength of the socialist country, and improving people's life
quality. We should boldly make use of every operational method and
organizational form that reflect the law of modern socialized
production, and strive to explore various forms of public
ownership that will greatly promote the development of productive
forces and make new headway in deepen the SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
To succeed with SOE reforms and development is the important
basis for the country to realize lasting peace and order and
maintain social stability. It is imperative to correctly handle
the relationship between reform, development and stability, and
the intensity and pace of reform should conform with national
strength and social tolerance, and strive to create a new
situation in which reform, development and stability will promote
each other.
</P>
<P>
Our Party and the working class of the country have always been
brave and good at overcoming any difficulties and obstacles. We
have the guidance of Marxism, Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the basic line of the Party, the
comprehensive national strength stronger than before, and
experience gained from the years of practice as well as the active
participation of the broad masses of workers, we can surely score
new successes in SOE reforms and development as long as all the
Party members have confidence and fight together to achieve their
goals.

<P>
Two. Major Objectives and Guiding Principles of
</P>
<P>
SOE Reform and Development
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC National Congress and the First Plenum of the
15th CPC Central Committee proposed that in about three years, the
majority of money-losing large and medium-sized State-owned
enterprises (SOE) get out of their difficulties, and that a modern
corporate system be set up in the majority of backbone large and
medium-sized SOEs by the end of the century. In pushing forward
the restructuring and development of SOEs, major efforts should
first be directed to the realization of this target.
</P>
<P>
Key sectors, enterprises, and old industrial centers need to be
better managed in accordance with the realities of different
sectors and areas and the process of unbalanced development, and
solutions to current major problems should be combined with long-
term development so as to create favorable conditions for the
cross-century development of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The objective for SOE reforms and development by the year 2010
is basically completing strategic readjustment and restructuring,
creating a more rational layout and structure for the State-owned
economy, establishing a modern corporate system, markedly
improving economic performance, markedly strengthening the
capability of scientific and technological development, market
competition and risk-taking, and giving the State sector more
dominance in the national economy in accordance with the
fundamental transformation of the economic structure and economic
growth mode, and with the needs of opening up further to the
outside.
</P>
<P>
These guiding principles must be followed in the promotion of
SOE reforms and development:
</P>
<P>
(1) With public ownership dominant, diverse forms of ownership
be developed side-by-side. The ownership structure must be
readjusted and perfected. Multiple forms of public ownership must
be actively explored. The ability of the State sector to control
the national economy should be enhanced. And fair competition and
common development of economies of all forms of ownership must be
promoted.

Three. Strategic Readjustment of the Lay-out of State
</P>
<P>
Economy
</P>
<P>
Under a socialist market economy, the leading role of the State-
owned economy in the national economy mainly relies on its
capability to control.
</P>
<P>
(1) The role of State-owned economy should be materialized by
solely State-owned enterprises as well as through making greater
efforts to develop a stock-holding system in order to claim the
stake-controlling and stock-sharing by the State.
</P>
<P>
(2) State economy enjoys a dominant status in key industries
and crucial fields related to the lifeline of the national economy,
to support, orient and bring along the social and economy
development as a whole and to play a key role in materializing the
goals of the macro-economic State control.
</P>
<P>
(3) State economy should be maintained at an appropriate level,
with its layout further optimized and its quality further improved.
In different stages of economic development, the proportion of
state economy in different industries and areas could vary, while
the layout should be adjusted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The strategic readjustment of the layout of the State economy
should be combined with the optimization and upgrading of
industrial structure and the readjustment and improvement of the
structure of ownership, while adhering to the principles of
developing what should be developed, withdrawing what should be
withdrawn, doing what should be done while leaving others done.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the State economy is over-distributed, with its
overall quality not so high, and the distribution of resources is
not reasonable enough, a situation which must be tackled with
great effort.
</P>
<P>
Industries and sectors that need to be controlled by the State
economy include: industries that are related to State security;
industries that are naturally monopolized; industries that supply
major products and services for the public; and pillar industries
and backbone enterprises in high and new technology sectors. In
other industries and fields, the entire quality of the State
economy could be improved through regrouping the assets and
readjusting the structure to centralize their capacity and
strengthen the key SOEs.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining State and collective economies as the main
body, the development of non-public ownership, such as self-
employed individuals and private businesses, will be encouraged
and guided.
</P>
<P>
Along with the continued development of the national economy,
the development of the State economy has vast potential, with its
size increasing, overall quality improving, and layout being
rationalized, though the proportion it holds in the entire
national economy might be somewhat decreased. The decrease will
not affect the socialist nature of the country, so long as it
continues to make public ownership the main body and controls the
lifeline of national economy, while the controlling capability and
competitiveness of the State economy are strengthened.

<TEXT>
<P>
Various means of realizing public ownership should be actively
explored. State-owned capital could attract more social capital
through the stock-holding system in order to increase the
functions of State-owned capital and strengthen State economy's
capability of controlling and influencing. Large and medium-sized
SOEs, especially those that are dominant and suited to the stock-
holding system, should be turned into stock-holding enterprises,
in the forms of standardized listing, Sino-foreign joint ventures,
and enterprises exchanging shares. A mixed ownership economy
should be developed, while the State controls the main stake in
key enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive plans should be made and policies should be
adopted to speed up the layout readjustment of old industrial
bases and the State economy in central and western China. For old
industrial bases that are in greater difficulty, the State will
increase its support in the fields of technological renovation,
property regrouping, structural readjustment, as well as re-
employment of laid-off employees from SOEs, and arrangement of
social security funds.
</P>
<P>
The State will assist in the development of the central and
western areas and regions densely-populated by ethnic minorities
by giving priority to infrastructure construction and increasing
transfer payments from the exchequer.
</P>
<P>
The central and western areas should take into consideration
their own conditions as they work to develop comparatively
superior industries and technologically advanced enterprises, in
order to optimize and upgrade the local industrial structure.
While accelerating the reform and development, the eastern areas
should assist the economic development in the central and western
areas, under the principles of mutual benefit and achieving common
goals, by way of relocating industries, transferring technology,
one-to-one assistance, and joint exploration.

Four. Pushing Forward Strategic Restructure of SOEs
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening-up drive started, the
organizational structure of SOEs has seen positive changes, but is
still irrational so far, mainly because of serious overlapping in
construction, and all enterprises, no matter how large or small,
have an all-inclusive organizational structure, but have failed to
establish systems for specialized production and socialized
coordination and a scaled economy, and lack market competition
capability.
</P>
<P>
The strategic restructure of SOEs should be continued in
accordance with their varying conditions. The State will give
necessary support to a handful of enterprises that must be
monopolized by the State, as they make efforts to meet the demands
of a market economy, in order to let them play their due role
better. Enterprises that have a certain strength in competitive
fields should accelerate their development by attracting
investment from different sectors. Enterprises that have a market
for their products but are suffering from an over-heavy burden and
management difficulties should regroup their assets and readjust
their structure, through mergers and coalitions, to regroup the
idle assets.
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy and closing are the only options for enterprises
that cannot find any market for their products, have a history of
losses, are not expected to make up their losses while their
resources are drying up, and small coal mines, refineries, cement
and glass factories and small thermal power plants that have been
wasting resources, or are technologically backward, are
manufacturing poor-quality products, and have caused severe
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The principle of "managing well large enterprises while
adopting a flexible policy toward small ones" should be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Powerful and competitive large enterprises and enterprise
groups should be fostered, as some of them could be turned into
trans-regional, trans-industrial, trans-ownership and
transnational large enterprise groups. Their superiority in
capital management, technological renovation and market-
exploration should be brought to the forefront, so as to turn them
into pillars of the national economy and the main powers in
international competition.
</P>
<P>
The development of enterprise groups should abide by economic
laws, as the enterprises should be regarded as the main body and
the capital as the link. The enterprise groups have to be realized
by the market and can not be produced by administrative means.
There should not be a blind chase to make them as large and all-
inclusive as possible. Efforts should be made to emphasize their
main business and increase their superiority in competition.

<P>
Small SOEs should be enlivened through reorganization,
coalition, merger, leasing, contract-based management, and
cooperative shares systems, and through putting up for sale.
Cooperative shares enterprises that have emerged in great numbers
in recent years should be supported and guided, while the
experience should be reviewed so as to improve them gradually. Any
sales have to be carried out strictly in accordance with relevant
State regulations. No matter which form is adopted, opinions of
the workers and staff members must be sought, while changes should
be carried out according to conventional practice and priority
should be given to substantial effects.
</P>
<P>
Priority should be attached to the important role of small and
medium-sized enterprises of various ownership in enlivening urban
and rural economies, meeting various demands of the society,
absorbing surplus laborers, developing new products and promoting
the development of the national economy. A system to serve small
and medium-sized enterprises should be fostered to provide them
with service in information and consultation, market exploration,
funding, loan guarantees, technical support, and personnel
training.
</P>
<P>
In the process of the strategic restructure of SOEs, the role
of the market mechanism should be brought into full play, while
economic, legal and necessary administrative means should be
adopted. The appraisal of assets must be standardized in mergers
or purchase of enterprises that involves changes in property
rights, in order to prevent the loss of State-owned assets and
evasion or abolishing of bank debts and State taxes. Proper
arrangements should be made for workers and staff members and
their legitimate rights and interests must be protected.

<P>
The development of specialized mass production and the market
economy naturally calls for the establishment of a modern
enterprise system, which is an effective way to combine public
ownership with the market economy, and is the orientation of the
reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to proceed from China's actual situation, sum
up experience, and fully understand and grasp the essence of the
requirements calling for clear property rights, clear-cut division
between rights and obligations, separation of administrative
functions from corporate functions, and scientific management, in
accordance with the expositions of the Third Plenum of the 14th
CPC Central Committee and the 15th CPC National Congress on the
establishment of the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Special efforts should be made to:
</P>
<P>
(1) Continue to push forward the task of separating
administrative and corporate functions.
</P>
<P>
The government performs the functions of shareholders in the
state-financed enterprises or state shareholding companies via its
designated representatives, enjoys the rights to share profits
from assets, make major decisions and select managers in
accordance with the scale of investment, bears limited
responsibilities for enterprises' debts, and will not interfere in
the daily operations of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises will operate business independently according to
law, pay taxes in accordance with relevant regulations, be
responsible for preserving and increasing the value of the net
assets of the owners, and not be allowed to tamper with the
legitimate rights of the owners.
</P>
<P>
In terms of personnel and financial management, Party and
government departments at different levels should fully separate
themselves from the economic entities they run or enterprises they
directly administer.

Eight. Do a Good Job of Workforce Reduction,
</P>
<P>
Re-employment and Social Insurance.
</P>
<P>
Laying off redundant workers to increase enterprise efficiency
and helping the displaced workers to get re-employed is an
important part of the State enterprise reform. Reducing the
workforce should be combined with increasing efficiency so as to
attain the goal of reducing cost, and increasing efficiency and
profitability in the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Qualified SOEs should create economic entities that are
financially independent and responsible for economic losses and
profits of their own, by separating their main business from
accessory businesses and diverting part of the workers to some
auxiliary posts. In this way, some redundant workers can get re-
employed and the social employment pressure can thus be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Procedures of laying off workers should be standardized, re-
employment centers should be set up inside the enterprises, and
basic living expenses need to be guaranteed for the layoffs to
maintain social stability.
</P>
<P>
The work of laying off workers should be adapted to the State
financial power and the capability of society to absorb the
unemployed. The fiscal spending structure should be readjusted,
and enterprises, society and government should cover the funds
necessary for the task. The government should supply part of the
funds which fall beyond the financial capabilities of the
enterprise in the red and society.
</P>
<P>
If some local financial departments are not able to supply the
rest of the funds needed, the central finance departments will
grant them some financial support through transfer payment.
</P>
<P>
The system of ensuring basic living for laid-off workers,
providing unemployment insurance and minimum living for urban
residents should be improved and the three aspects should be well
combined. The policy of ensuring basic living for laid-off workers
and the unemployed should be earnestly implemented.

<P>
(4) With government approval, unlisted SOEs can acquire cash by
transferring their land use right or fixed assets for increasing
capital, reducing debts and the enterprise restructuring. All this
must be done in accordance with the country's laws and regulations,
and the principle of openness, equality and fairness should be
adhered to so as to safeguard the rights and interests of the
proprietors, banks and other creditors.
</P>
<P>
(5) The government policies on the interest rate should be
strictly followed to alleviate SOEs' interest burdens. Banks
should set up a rational loan term to meet their reasonable demand
for capital. Irrational loan terms should be redressed in a timely
way; and no one should raise interest rate in disregard of
regulations or in any other names; For a number of highly credible
or less loan risky enterprises which conform to the State industry
policies, the interest rate may be lowered by appropriately.
</P>
<P>
(6) Large SOEs capable of paying off debts may issue their
bonds within government approved volume and after appraisal by
qualified intermediate agencies, and some enterprises may issue
their bonds outside China with approval. Various illegal means of
fund raising will be strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
(7) SOEs will gradually break away from the social welfare
responsibility so as to reduce the social burdens of the SOEs.
Enterprises located in cities will shift their running of schools,
hospitals and other social service agencies to local governments
for overall management. The money needed for this will be jointly
covered by enterprises and the local governments for some time,
and then gradually by the government, and some may be turned into
enterprises. Independent industrial and mining areas should also
work hard to create conditions for separating their social service
agencies from enterprises. Local governments at all levels should
take effective measures to actively push forward the work.
</P>
<P>
Improving the balance of assets and debts of SOEs and reducing
their social burdens should be combined with preventing and
minimizing financial risks, promoting internal reforms, setting up
new mechanism and strengthening scientific management in SOEs so
that old problems will not emerge again.

Seven. Improving Balance of SOE Debts and
</P>
<P>
 Assets and Reducing SOE Social Burdens
</P>
<P>
It is of utmost importance in effecting the SOE reform and
development to gradually solve problems of the SOEs such as too
high asset-to-liability rate, capital shortage and heavy social
burdens. These problems should be solved step-by-step through
various means according to the current macro-economic environment
and the State financial power.
</P>
<P>
(1) Chinese banks should increase reserves for writing off the
bad loans caused by acquisition and bankruptcy of big and medium-
sized SOEs and closure of the mines whose resources have dried up,
and for supporting key industries. State-owned and collectively-
owned enterprises may enjoy relevant encouraging policies while
acquiring SOEs. All the employees displaced by acquired, bankrupt
and closed enterprises should be settled well in line with
relevant State regulations.
</P>
<P>
(2) Major SOEs, those currently debt-ridden but have market for
some of their products and have prospects for development, should
solve the problem of high asset-to-liability rate by debt-to-
equity transformation, together with the State banks' current
reform on handling non-performing loans. Enterprises which adopt
the reform of debt-to-equity should change their current operating
mechanism and execute standard company system, and their
performance will later be independently appraised by financial and
asset management firms. All this must be done in accordance with
the rule of the market economy and related rules and regulations
to avoid possible losses of State assets.
</P>
<P>
(3) Direct fund raising should be increased. SOEs which already
meet the qualifications for listing may raise funds in domestic
and overseas capital markets, and the proportion of public shares
under current circulation should appropriately be increased. Other
SOEs may prepare for the listing by debt reshuffling. State-owned
and share-holding enterprises are allowed to participate in the
allocation of new shares according to relevant regulations. A
number of promising enterprises with good credibility will be
picked out to reduce the State shares provided this will not
affect the State control of shares. The State will use the surplus
capital for SOE reform and development. The system of stock
issuance and listing should be further improved to promote the
healthy development of the securities market.

<P>
Preferential policies should be improved to facilitate the re-
employment of displaced workers, encouraging them to get re-
employed as soon as possible by accepting jobs in non-public
entities, starting their own business or becoming self-employed.
</P>
<P>
As for those who start their own businesses, the government
should grant them more support in getting official permits,
finding office sites, enjoying reduced or exempted taxes, and
receiving bank loans. The labor market should be actively
developed and regulated so as a market-oriented employment
mechanism could be formed.
</P>
<P>
Speeding up the building of the social security system is an
important prerequisite for a smooth implementation of the State-
owned enterprise reform. The social security services such as
endowment, unemployment and medical insurance should cover people
of a wider range, and State-owned township enterprises,
collectively-owned enterprises, overseas-funded ventures and
private businesses and their employees should all take part in the
social security program, and hand in insurance premium.
</P>
<P>
The collection of social insurance premium should be stepped up,
and measures should be taken to collect the defaulted premiums to
ensure a timely and full payment of the retirement pensions. A
unified management plan of retirement pension funds at the
province-level should be further improved, and multiple measures
such as selling off some State assets and readjusting the fiscal
spending structure should be taken to expand new fund-raising
channels for social security program and replenish the social
security funds.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Group Opposes Settlement Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The new housing
construction tenders for settlement expansion in the
Israeli-occupied Arab territories would seriously jeopardize the
peace process with the Palestinians and Syrians, said an Israeli
peace group here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After learning that Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry
has issued tenders for building 2,600 new houses for Jewish
settlers in West Bank settlements, the Peace Now group said this
action will cause more trouble for the Israeli-Palestinian
final-status talks
</P>
<P>
The number of new tenders issued by the ministry exceeds the
total number issued in the three years' tenure of the previous
government led by Benjamin Netanyahu, the satement added.
</P>
<P>
The group is scheduled to ask Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
explain the government's policy toward the settlement expansion,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Education Minister Yossi Sarid expressed his
objection to settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the
new tenders.
</P>
<P>
Housing and Construction Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the
National Religious Party, said Sunday the tenders were issued
under the government's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported earlier that all those 2,600 tenders
were issued after the new government came to power in July and
1,000 of them were slated for Ma'aleh Adumim, the largest
settlement east of Jerusalem with about 6,000 settlers.
</P>
<P>
Israel calls Ma'aleh Adumim a city, instead of settlement.
</P>
<P>
The other tenders were for several Jewish settlements in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is one of
the thorny issues to be solved by Israel and the Palestines during
their final-status talks which has been launched on September 13.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has repeatedly asked Israel to halt the
settlement expansions pending a final solution to this issue.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a speech in the United
Nations on Wednesday asked Israel again to immediately end the
settlement expansions in the territories.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has declared to continue new house constructions in
Ma'aleh Adumim, not matter what happens in the future.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, during his visit to this settlement
on September 15, pledged to the settlers there that he will
continue to expand it.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that Ma'aleh Adumim "is part of Greater Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side strongly criticized Barak for making such
remarks. Faisal Husseini, Palestinian Cabinet Minister in charge
of Jerusalem Affairs, said "the only future in store for Ma'aleh
Adumim is evacuation."
</P>
<P>
"Creating a mixture of Israeli settlements with Palestinian
cities is nothing but a ticking time bomb that will only lead to
situations like those in Kosovo," he added.

Relationships should be well handled between improving quality
and increasing output, between developing technology-intensive
industries and labor-intensive industries, between developing
China's new technologies and introducing foreign technologies, and
between developing the economy and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
With technological renovation and industrial upgrading, a few
large enterprises and enterprise groups should reach or be near
the advanced world level in terms of product quality,
manufacturing technology, manufacturing equipment, and labor
productivity, and occupy their certain shares in the world market;
a large number of enterprises should be able to produce products
with high added value by using their advanced technologies, and
have strong competition at both domestic and overseas markets;
most enterprises should actively improve technologies and upgrade
products and participate in market competition at home and abroad
by making full use of the advantage of sufficient labor resources
in China.
</P>
<P>
Active and effective policy measures should be taken to support
the technological renovation and industrial upgrading of the
enterprises. When adopting a pro-active fiscal policy to expand
domestic demand, the State should focus on increasing input into
the technological renovation of key industries, key enterprises,
key products and manufacturing of important and advanced equipment.
State policies should also support transformation of old
industrial bases so as to achieve notable results in this regard.
Subsidized bank loans should be extended to technological
renovation projects which have good market prospects, high
profitability, and support from State industrial policy; and tax
incentives should be provided for investors of such projects.
</P>
<P>
Industrial investment funds and venture capital funds should be
nurtured and developed. Funds should be pooled from domestic and
overseas capital markets to support the technological renovation
of enterprises, industrial restructuring, and development of new-
and high-tech industries.

 Nine. Speeding up Technological Renovation
</P>
<P>
 and Industrial Upgrading of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
To achieve sustainable, fast and healthy economic development,
attention should be paid to keep up with the global trend in
readjustment of industrial structure and changing demand of
domestic and overseas markets, and speeding up the technological
renovation and industrial upgrading.
</P>
<P>
Given the important position of the State-owned economy in the
national economy, State-owned enterprises should lead others in
technological renovation and industrial upgrading to achieve
further growth and bring their critical role into full play.
</P>
<P>
The direction and emphasis of the State-owned enterprises in
technological renovation and industrial upgrading should be: with
the market as a guide, using advanced technology to transform the
traditional industries and strengthen technological renovation of
existent enterprises as a means of increasing product diversity,
improving quality, increasing efficiency and spurring exports;
</P>
<P>
Also, the goal of the reformed enterprises should be to hold an
important position in new and hi-tech industries in electronic
information, bio-engineering, new energy, new materials, aviation,
space technology and environmental protection and mastering core
technologies so as to serve as an industrial leader.

<P>
Policy incentives should be offered to facilitate the
application of technology and a technological market should be
actively developed. Policy measures aimed at supporting
enterprises' technological renovation should continue to be
pursued, such as speeding up depreciation of fixed assets,
increasing the amount of funds enterprises could withdraw from
funds used for development of new products, offering tax and
tariff incentives and reducing customs fees on import of advanced
technology and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should be taken as principal participants in
technological renovation and industrial upgrading and it is
imperative to establish a system of technological renovation with
enterprises as its center. Enterprises should reinforce their
technological development personnel and increase input in that
regard, and large enterprises should set up technological
development centers, develop core products with their own
intellectual patents, increase technology reserves, and improve
training of technicians.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production, research and development of technology
should be combined, technological personnel in scientific research
institutions and institutions of higher learning should be
encouraged to join enterprises or enterprise groups, development
and spreading of practical technologies should be intensified, and
input into experimental application of new technologies should be
increased, so as to facilitate the translation of technological
developments into real productive forces.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation is needed to tackle major technological problems,
and great importance should be attached to the role of
technological experts. An incentives program should be established
to attract talents and kindle the enthusiasm of the technological
personnel, and intellectual property rights should be protected.

Ten. Create Sound External Environment
</P>
<P>
For SOE Reform and Development
</P>
<P>
The SOE reform and development is a complex social system
engineering project, which requires appropriate overall control
and management as well as reforms in all related areas.
</P>
<P>
(1) A balance in its economic aggregate power should be
maintained. Efforts should be made to boost domestic consumption,
broaden its rural and urban markets, increase employment, promote
the sustainable, rapid and healthy development of the national
economy and prevent drastic fluctuations in the economic growth
rates in order to create a favorable macro-economic environment
for the development of SOEs.
</P>
<P>
(2) Continued efforts should be made to open up to the outside
world. Efforts should be made to push forward and improve the all-
round opening up in various fields and at all levels and encourage
the SOEs to use both the domestic and overseas markets and the
resources therein and raise their international competitiveness.
Active efforts should be made to import advanced technology and
make it a point of digesting and absorbing the technology and even
make their own inventions. Measures should be taken to optimize
the composition of the import and export commodities and expand
overseas markets and foreign trade. The Efforts should be made to
improve investment environment and increase and improve the use of
overseas funds. Qualified SOEs may bring into full play their
strong points to set up businesses abroad and open up
international markets with necessary government policy support.
</P>
<P>
(3) Measures must be taken to curb irrational and redundant
constructions. The project fund system and the responsibility
system of project legal person should be strictly carried out so
as he who makes the decision undertakes liabilities and risks. The
government should guide this through formulating industrial
policies and providing information among others, encouraging fund
investment in projects designed to improve technology, and their
products have ready markets and economic returns. There must be
strict controls over new projects whose domestic production
capacity has clearly exceeded market demand.

<TEXT>
<P>
(4) Various markets should be developed and normal economic
order should be maintained. Efforts should continue to improve
commodity market, foster and develop the market of production
factors and establish a national unified market system beneficial
to the rational flow of commodities, capital, technology and labor.
Efforts should also be made to improve market regulations,
standardize market conduct, increase market supervision and
control, eliminate the market administrative barriers and create a
market environment for fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Forceful measures should be taken to tackle the issue of
arrears among enterprises, enhance the awareness of credibility
and be strict with settlement disciplines. Smuggling, selling of
smuggled goods, the making of fake and inferior quality products
and other economic crimes must be severely dealt with according to
law. Efforts should be made to advance the tax reform, sort out
and curb indiscriminate levies, fines and apportions to
effectively reduce the burdens of the enterprises.
</P>
<P>
(5) The system of intermediary services should be improved. All
social intermediary agencies must sever their links with the
government departments. Work should be done to standardize the
conduct of accountants, lawyers, notary offices, asset appraising
agencies and consulting services to ensure objectivity, truth and
fairness. Those that practice frauds must be investigated and
affixed the responsibility and punished according to law.
Associations of various industries should be rectified and
standardized and strengthen their self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
(6) A legal system of the socialist market economy should be
established and improved. Efforts should be intensified to
formulate and improve the laws and regulations concerning to
maintain market order, execute macro regulation and control,
standardize the main body of the market, and improve social
security. The judicial and administrative organs must also
strengthen and improve their law enforcement and supervision. The
law-breaking activities that encroach upon the legitimate rights
and interests of the enterprises must be severely punished
according to law. Efforts should be made to improve public order
and create a sound social environment for the production and
marketing activities of the enterprises.

<P>
(2) Effective ways for management of state assets should be
actively explored.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to gradually construct a network and mechanism
for management, supervision and operation of state assets in
accordance with the principles of state ownership, classified
management, franchised operation and division of supervision, and
to establish and improve a strict responsibility system.
</P>
<P>
The State Council, on behalf of the state, handles the
ownership of the state assets in a unified manner. The central and
local governments practice classified management of state assets,
and large enterprises, enterprise groups and share-controlling
companies will be authorized to operate state assets.
</P>
<P>
Capital contributors must provide sufficient investment.
Localities will be encouraged to explore the detailed measures for
management of state assets.
</P>
<P>
The experimental practice of sending special supervisors to
work in grassroots enterprises will continue. It is also
imperative to implement the guidelines of the 15th CPC Congress in
an active manner, improve and standardize the system of the board
of supervisors so that supervision over state-owned enterprises
will be intensified, and state assets and its legitimate rights
should not be infringed upon.
</P>
<P>
(3) Introduce standardized corporate system reform into large
and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The corporate system is an effective organizational form of the
modern enterprise system. The practice of using corporate legal
persons is the core of the corporate system. It is necessary to
clarify the duty of councils of share-holders, the board of
directors, the board of supervisors and managerial ranks. Also, a
system for harnessing corporate legal persons should be formed,
and should specify that each legal person is responsible for his
own work, and for harmonious operations combined with effective
restrictions.

<P>
To meet the needs of a modern enterprise system and to survive
and grow amidst fierce competition, SOEs must build up their
highly-qualified management operations and nurture a large number
of skilled entrepreneurs. The managers of the SOEs are generally
good and have made important contributions to SOEs' reform and
development. However, the trend of building up a socialist market
economy has imposed new demands on SOE managers. They should not
only be ideologically and politically qualified, law-abiding, have
a deep sense of responsibility and career-minded, they should also
have good management abilities, be familiar with the business they
engage in, be armed with modern management know-how and basic
knowledge of finance, science and technology and laws, so as to
make correct decisions in accordance with market changes.
</P>
<P>
China must deepen the reform of the personnel system of SOEs.
The Communist Party of China must manage and supervise its SOE
cadres. The Central committee and local committees of the Party
must strengthen management over the operation of the SOEs that
hold the lifelines of the state security and national economy.
They must establish a system to standardize the selection,
nurturing, management, appraisal and supervision of the cadres. In
the selection of cadres, there should be a two-way system: While
relying on its own judgment to promote cadres, they should also
invite competition from society to compete with Party-selected
candidates.
</P>
<P>
SOE cadres should no longer be certified only on the basis of
the official level. China must establish a talent market for
business managers and a related talent database. Good personnel
should be used regardless of their localities and origins.
Education and training should also be strengthened to improve the
quality of the managers.
</P>
<P>
China should establish a system to encourage SOE managers'
outstanding performance and to curb irresponsible conduct. The
managers' incomes should be linked with their performance.
Managers should not only get due material rewards, they should
also receive due honors for their dedication. A small number of
companies have experimented with an annual manager salary system
that includes share options. This can be carried out further on a
trial basis, but should not be encouraged for nationwide use for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
There should be a system to standardize the allocating of
salaries to managers and that system should be open and above-
board. In addition, more work should be done to increase
supervision over managers in areas such as use of funds,
production and management, income distribution, use of personnel
and self-discipline. Managers who cause heavy losses to their
enterprises should be duly punished and removed from their posts;
they should not be transferred to work in the same position
elsewhere.

Owners have the ultimate power of control over enterprises. The
board of directors should safeguard the rights and interests of
capital contributors, and should be responsible for the council of
share-holders.
</P>
<P>
The board of directors makes decisions regarding development
goals and major operation activities of the company, employs
business operators, and evaluates the work of the operators.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to bring into full play the supervisory role
of the council of supervisors over financial affairs, directors
and operators of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Party committee leaders of solely state-financed companies and
state share-holding companies can be included in the boards of
directors and supervisors in accordance with legal procedures, and
workers' representatives should be included in the boards of
directors and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Leading Party members inside the boards of directors,
supervisors, managerial ranks and trade unions can join the Party
committee according to the Party Constitution and relevant rules.
The Party secretary and chairman of the board of directors can be
the same person, but in principle, the chairman of the board and
general manager should be two separate posts.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to give full play to the role of the board of
directors in making unified decisions on major issues and the
effective supervisory role of the board of supervisors. Party
organizations should perform duties according to the Party
Constitution, and trade unions and workers' congresses should
carry out their respective duties in accordance with relevant laws
and regulations.
</P>
<P>
Diversity of equities is conducive to the formation of a
standardized corporate legal person management structure. It is
necessary to develop companies featuring multiple investing
entities, except for a small number of enterprises that should be
monopolized by the state.

successful enterprises can survive and loss-making enterprises are
eliminated, operators can be promoted or demoted, personnel can be
employed or fired, income can be raised or lowered, technology
continues to be upgraded, and the value of state assets are
preserved and increased.
</P>
<P>
An income distribution system compatible with the modern
enterprise system should be established, and the practice of
members of the board of the directors and the managerial ranks
receiving rewards based on their work and other contributions
should be done under the guidance of state policies.
</P>
<P>
Salary scales of workers should be determined by enterprises in
accordance with the average salaries in different localities and
the benefits of the enterprises. Within the enterprises, the
principle of distribution according to work should be followed,
but proper income gaps will be allowed. Means of production, such
as capital and technology, will be permitted to be taken into
account in distribution of profits.

Effective measures should be practiced to solve the current
problem that personal income of some monopolized industries is too
high.

Development of State-Owned Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Strengthening and improving the Party leadership is the
fundamental guarantee for speeding up the reform and development
of SOEs.

<P>
To manage well SOEs in general, efforts must be made to
establish a leadership system and organizational and managerial
systems in them that conform to the law of the market economy and
China's actual situation, to strengthen the building of their
leadership, to give play to the Party organizations as the
political core of enterprises, and to adhere to the principle of

the Party and State policies in related enterprises; participating
in making decisions on major issues, supporting the board of share-
holders, board of directors, board of supervisors and managers or
directors to exercise their functions and powers according to law;

<HEADLINE> Egypt Works to Eliminate Child Labor: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian official said
on Sunday that his country spares no effort to eliminate child
labor.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is keen on removing the causes, primarily poverty and
illiteracy, of child labor, said Abdel Kader el Aasar, advisor for
international cooperation to the minister of insurance and social
affairs.

El Aasar made the remarks before leaving for Geneva to attend
meetings of an experts committee of the International Labor
Organization (ILO) on eliminating child labour.
</P>
<P>
Children in Egypt work in basic crafts and occupations, unlike
in some other countries where they are forced to involve in
unethical practices including drug-trafficking and sometimes war,

<TEXT>
<P>
According to The Decision of the CPC Central Committee on Major
Issues Concerning the Reform and Development of State-owned
Enterprises, which was adopted at the 4th Plenum of the 15th CPC
Central Committee, the SOEs are undergoing extensive and profound
changes and the reform of the SOEs is at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
The Decision, issued here today, says it is imperative to adopt
practical and effective measures to solve the deep-seated problems
plaguing the SOEs, which are pillars of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The SOE reform is at the core of the whole economic reform. To
promote the development of a socialist market economy and realize
the combination of public-ownership and market economy, it is
important for the SOEs to form a management system and an
operational mechanism that meet the demands of the market economy,
the Decision points out.
</P>
<P>
It says that efforts must be made to create a new situation in
which reform, development and stability will promote one another,
the Decision stresses.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh PM Utilizes Her Peace Prize Money to Set International Prize Named After Her Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina on Sunday announced that she would introduce an
international prize named after "Father of the Nation Bangabandhu
Sheikh Mujibur Rahman" for peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass reception accorded to her at the Paltan
Maidan in the capital city on her receiving the UNESCO Peace Prize
in Paris on Friday, Hasina said she would utilize the prize money
by setting up the foundation for an international prize named
after her father, the first prime minister of independent
Bangladesh who was assassinated in August 1975.
</P>
<P>
The reception was organized by the ruling Awami League.
</P>
<P>
Hasina and former U.S. senator George J. Mitchell jointly
received the 1998 UNESCO Peace Prize worth 800,000 franc (about
512,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Referring to the background that led to the conclusion of the
Chittagong peace accord in December 1997, Hasina said: "We always
considered it as a political problem and wanted to solve it
politically through discussions and negotiations."
</P>
<P>
She described the task of restoring peace in the Chittagong
Hill Tracts as a difficult one, saying that "any problem can be
solved if it is handled with sincerity and honesty."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said she had a vision to develop the country
by the year 2020 so that it could keep its head high in the
community of nations. "The county... will be able to achieve
progress and prosperity at any cost," she said.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating the prime minister on receiving the peace award,
General Secretary of the ruling Awami League (AL) and Minister for
Local Government, Rural Development and Cooperatives Zillur Rahman
said that at least 35,000 people were killed in the country's
southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts over two decades of time.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister restored peace there through signing the
peace agreement with the tribal people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people attended the reception, carrying banners,
placards, miniature flags and colorful ribbons.

<HEADLINE> French Government to Tax Enterprises Laying Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The French government will tax
those enterprises who are laying off workers while making profits,
after the Michelin tire group said it would lay off 10 percent of
its work force in Europe.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin is expected to announce
next week a series of measures against the enterprises who are
kicking off workers and those who employ a large percent of
workers on short-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Solidarity and Employment Martine Aubry said
that those enterprises who are laying off workers should pay for
their acts.
</P>
<P>
The government could increase the tax subsidized for creating
jobs on those enterprises, while decreasing charges on those who
are keeping their workers, she said.
</P>
<P>
The government will also tax enterprises which employ more than
10 percent of their work force as short-term contract workers, she
added.
</P>
<P>
France has been greatly inspired by the recent agreement
reached by the U.S. auto workers' union UAW and the
DaimlerChrysler auto group on guaranteeing life employment for the
eldest workers.
</P>
<P>
The French Communist Party, which is part of the leftwing
coalition, has been increasing pressure on the Socialist-led
government to take measures against layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The Communists will organize a nationwide demonstration on
October 16 against layoffs.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian founding
father Julius Nyerere is seriously ill, President Benjamin Mkapa
confirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who called for a press conference at the State House in
Dar es Salaam, said that Nyerere, 77, is suffering from chronic
lymphocytic leukemia, or blood cancer, at St. Thomas Hospital in
London.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made a stopover in London on Saturday morning after
concluding a 12-day working visit to the United States. He visited
Nyerere at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
An aide of Mkapa later told Xinhua, "Nyerere was a bit
conscious, but he could not speak."
</P>
<P>
"It (the disease attack) is coming and going," the aide said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa called for the press conference hours after he returned
to the capital Dar es Salaam en route Zurich, Switzerland. The
press conference is apparently aimed at dismissing rumors that
have been abounding these days in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa assured people in the country that Nyerere is getting
good treatment and he asked the nation to pray for the first
president of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who led his country to independence in 1961, was sent
to Britain weeks ago for a medical check-up, but was formally
admitted to the hospital later.

<HEADLINE> Dialog Urged In Zimbabwe to Avoid Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Both employers and employees
in Zimbabwe have been urged to hold dialog to avoid unnecessary
strikes which damage the economy of the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Industrial Relations Association made the call
Sunday, expressing concern over the spate of strikes in the
country which seem to suggest that the labor dispute settlement
process is not working.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the association, Lovemore Madhuku, said that
strikes, no matter how justifiable, should not last for days or
weeks as this hurt the economy.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the existing legal framework which
identified strikes as illegal was harmful to labor relations,
called for complete overhaul of the Labor Relations Tribunal as it
had a large backlog of cases resulting in matters going for weeks
without being resolved.
</P>
<P>
This discouraged the dialog between employers and employees
with employers banking on fire striking employees, Madhuku said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the employers should change their attitudes so as
to improve dialog rather than be quick to fire striking employees.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government should entrench the right to
strike but there should be a clear mechanism to break the strike.
</P>
<P>
This could be achieved through compulsory arbitration, where
matters could be resolved urgently.
</P>
<P>
Only this month Zimbabwe recorded more than four strikes, with
the hotel and catering industry strike dragging for more than a
week.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the health service was paralyzed after junior doctors
went on strike demanding pay and allowance increments.

international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at 53rd meeting of the Interim Committee of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Dai said the fluctuation in
exchange rates increases uncertainty in trade and investment and
exposure to speculative transactions, and generates different
types of derivatives resulting in the popularity of highly
leveraged operations.
</P>
<P>
Huge risks abound on the international financial market, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Dai pointed out that the current international financial system
cannot solve the balance of payments imbalance, which has
repeatedly been the cause of international financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong called on the international community to consider
the additional allocation of SDRs and create conditions to
increase their use and strengthen the Fund's function of providing
liquidity to its member countries to solve the problem of an
international reserve currency.
</P>
<P>
Dai also urged the major industrial countries to shoulder the
responsibility in coordinating their policies effectively to
establish a new exchange rate mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong stressed that in reforming the international
financial system, the developing countries should be more involved
in the process and should not be forced to restructure their
economies according to the developed countries' standards.
</P>
<P>
"The operations of the international monetary system and its
reforms should not be controlled by a few member countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dai said if the developed countries' could not pay enough
attention to the level of economic development in the developing
countries and solely call on these countries for opening markets,
the developing countries may encounter new crisis.
</P>
<P>
On the role of IMF and its reforms, Dai Xianglong said the IMF
has always been at the core of the international monetary systems
and its functions are irreplaceable.
</P>
<P>
However, the Fund needs to reflect on its experiences and
lessons, improve its efficiency, pursue substantive reform, and
continue to enforce cooperation with other international
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Dai expressed his support for the proposal to change the name
of the Interim Committee into "International Monetary and
Financial Committee".
</P>
<P>
Full account should be taken of the representativeness and
effectiveness in the process of reforming the Interim Committee,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient attention should be paid to ensure that the
representation of the developing countries is enhanced and that
their voice is heard, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Chinese economic growth and reform, Dai Xianglong said in
1999, the Chinese government has continued its vigorous and active
fiscal policy, appropriate monetary policy, and maintained steady
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said in 1999, GDP is expected to increase by at least 7
percent, and the RMB exchange rate will remain stable.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Chinese economy will continue to grow in the
context of the deepening reform of the financial sector and
corporate restructuring," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (DAR) withstood the
challenge stemming from the financial crisis in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's GDP turned to positive growth in the second quarter
of 1999 and the region has passed its hard time, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
Dai said Hong Kong's appropriate policy measures have enabled
it to successfully weather the external shocks.

<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- France's extreme-right National
Front (FN) leader Jean-Marie Le Pen expressed on Sunday his racism
against Muslim immigrants in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made to some 4,000 supporters in the forest of
Vincennes at the annual FN festival, Le Pen claimed that a
majority of the Muslims in France are ``stranger or rebel to
integration.''
</P>
<P>
They could also be put under strong influence from a foreign
government or organization engaged in terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
``Each one in his own country, each religion in its
geographical sphere,'' said Le Pen, adding that France is faced
with the threat of Islam which is interwound with ``massive
demographical and social phenomena.''
</P>

``When the church towers are in the north and mosques in the
south, the landmarks are better fixed, orientations better made,
and the tensions will not appear and there will not be

SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin today expressed his hope that Time Warner Inc. of the United
States will play an active role in promoting the healthy and
stable development of Sino-U.S. ties in the next century.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Gerald Levin, chairman and CEO of the
company, Jiang said that with the rapid advancement of information
technology, the news media will have more important bearing on
social life and relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's major media groups, Time Warner Inc. can
do much to push forward understanding between the peoples of
different countries.
</P>
<P>
Time Warner Inc. is the parent company of Fortune magazine,
which is sponsoring the '99 Fortune Global Forum here in China's
largest industrial city.
</P>
<P>
Levin gave a briefing on a China tour, Visions of China, hosted
by Fortune magazine for the launching of the forum, saying that
the tour has allowed the company to understand China more deeply.
He spoke highly of the social progress and economic development
China has achieved in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He told Jiang that this was the first time his group held this
year's board meeting outside the United States, and it is of great
symbolic value that the meeting was held in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"Seeing is believing," Jiang said, adding that through the
China tour, of which a series of programs are now being presented
on Time Warner's CNN TV network, the company can have a more
realistic view of China's reality.
</P>
<P>
Levin said that after the forum and the tour, the media of Time
Warner will likely issue more positive reports on China.

<HEADLINE> Britain on Way towards Long-Term Economic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 27 (Xinhua) -- British
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, addressing the Labour
Party's annual conference on Monday, said the Government has been
successful in its efforts to rebuild long-term economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The essential stage of the Labour Government's journey since
the 1997 election has been to end "damaging economic instability,"
and to tackle the "boom and bust" which served the interests of
the privileged few but left millions insecure and worse off, Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
The Government has been pursuing "the values of economic
responsibility, planning for the long term, building stability
from solid foundations," in place of short-termism,
"take-what-you-can" attitudes and selfish irresponsibility,
according to Brown.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, Britain at the moment has mortgage rates
around their lowest levels for 20 years, inflation at its lowest
level in over 30 years, long-term interest rates at their lowest
levels in nearly 40 years and over 648,000 more jobs created.
</P>
<P>
"We will never return to the days of Tory (Conservative) boom
and bust," he asserted. "Labour Government will never take risks
with inflation. I will never let deficit get out of control. We
will not spend money we have not earned. Our years of
responsibility in Government have only just begun."
</P>
<P>
On the Labour Government's policy on the euro, Brown said "we
will be the party of Britain in Europe."
</P>
<P>
"Europe is where we are, where we trade, from where thousands
of businesses and millions of jobs come," he said, noting that a
successful Single Currency that meets Britain's "five economic
tests" is in the country's national economic interest.
</P>
<P>
Urging the business circles to embrace technological
revolution, Brown said economy of the next decade will need more
competition, more entrepreneurship, more flexibility and more
long-term investment.
</P>
<P>
"We must never again become a Party that is seen as
anti-success, anti-competition, anti-profit, anti-markets" he
said.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Extradition Hearing Opens in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The much-delayed hearing on
whether former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet should be
extradited to face trial in Spain started Monday in a crowded
British courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The elderly Pinochet did not attend the hearing, which is
expected to last five days.
</P>
<P>
He will have to be present when the verdict is made, which is
not expected until about two weeks after the extradition hearing
ends.
</P>
<P>
Police kept supporters and opponents of the former leader apart
as proceedings got underway at Bow Street Magistrates' Court in
London.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is wanted by Spain for a string of alleged human
rights crimes during his 1973-90 rule.
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old general was arrested in Britain on October 16,
1998, while convalescing from back surgery at a London clinic. He
has been fighting extradition ever since.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet will face around 36 charges, mainly allegations of
torture, which will be detailed in the opening session. They are
the result of an investigation by a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Chinese
community, which has banded together to raise money for the
victims of Taiwan's devastating earthquake, will on Tuesday send 2,
000 tents to the island.
</P>
<P>
Victims of the quake were not in dire need of food or water
but tents, an Australian relief organizer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people died in the earthquake which rocked the
island last Tuesday, and more than a thousand were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Australian-based Taiwan Earthquake Relief
Fund said the community has already sent 140 tents to the region.
</P>
<P>
"Tents and medical supplies are in great shortage," the
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese community had already raised about 300,000
Australian dollars (198,000 U.S. dollars) for relief efforts in
just three days, she said.

<P>
16 tons of tents will be transported free of charge by courtesy

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Autonomous County Celebrates Founding Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people of the Tu
ethnic group today attended celebrations to mark the 45th
anniversary of the founding of their autonomous county in
northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
With a population of more than 190,000, the Tu people live
mainly in Qinghai and the southern part of Gansu Province also in
northwest China, and the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in eastern
Qinghai, with a population of 70,000, is China's only autonomous
county for the Tu ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The history of the Tu ethnic group dates back to the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
The Tu people are famous for their vibrant dress, colorful
dresses, and folk dancing and singing. They live in remote rural
regions with a somewhat lagging economy. For a long time before
the founding of New China in 1949, the they were considered poor
and backward.
</P>
<P>
After 1949, especially since the country's reform and opening-
up drive started two decades ago, the group has become much more
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the county's production value reached 458
million yuan, and total industrial and agricultural output value
reached 686 million yuan by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the county's brewing, building materials,
smelting, and power and garment-making industries have been
developing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the celebrations, which will last for a couple of
days, include sports activities, singing and dancing contests, and
folk-custom exhibitions.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Vows to Continue Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif Monday said that his government will continue to make
serious efforts for social and economic reforms which "would
ultimately bring prosperity and progress to the country".
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the new terminal building at Sukkur Airport in
Sindh province, Sharif deplored that he had launched a number of
major projects during his previous tenure from 1990-1993 but they
were abandoned by the following Benazir Bhutto government.
</P>
<P>
The new terminal building project at Sukkur Airport was
initiated in 1992 and should have been completed in 1994, he said,
adding that for its own reasons the Benazir government withheld
this vital project of the area.
</P>
<P>
However, it was his government which again started the work on
this project and it has now been completed, said Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions from media, Sharif said that his government
was "intact and strong" and that efforts to destabilize his
government would not succeed.
</P>
<P>
The Sharif government is facing serious challenges from the
opposition parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) led
by Benazir and others, which launched waves after waves of
anti-government rallies and demonstrations in Sindh during the
recent two months.
</P>
<P>
The opponents accused the government of corruption and failure
to bring the economy back to the right track after the nuclear
tests last year.
</P>
<P>
Recounting his government's major steps in economic fields,
Sharif said the yellow cab scheme and the self-employment scheme
were very significant in fighting the unemployment especially
among the educated youth of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said when the PPP went out in 1997, the country's reserves
had exhausted. He said he was determined to achieve national
progress and prosperity with the active support of people.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said he had announced 16 billion rupees of
annual development program for 1999-2000 which was in addition to
the public sector development program. Under this program, he
said, 7000 kilometer long roads from farm to market would be
completed, besides providing electricity and drinking water to the
people in rural as well as urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Helps Relieve Resource Shortages in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Family planning has helped
China relieve resource shortages and improve environmental
protection, according to the results of a recent survey conducted
by the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred million fewer people were born in China during
the past three decades than would have been without the family
planning policy, helping to relieve contradictions between rapid
population growth and environmental protection, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the family planning policy in the
early 1980s, the per-capita grain output in China has increased
from 293 kilograms to 402 kilograms. Without the family planning
policy, the per-capita grain output could not have been expected
to increase at all, and China would face serious food shortages.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the per-capita arable land in China has
dropped from about 0.1 hectare in 1978 to 0.08 hectare in 1997.
Without any control on population growth, that figure would have
been 0.06 hectare in 1997, worsening the shortage of arable land.
</P>
<P>
Per-capita water resources in China was 2,275 cubic meters in
1997, which indicates that China is already a country with a water
shortage. Without family planning, the per-capita water resource
would have been 1,836 cubic meters in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Family planning has also helped slow down the reduction in per-
capita forest area and the per-capita consumption of coal, iron,
phosphorus, potassium, salt and other resources, according to the
survey.

<HEADLINE> African Nations Urged to Develop Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Africa should stop being a
provider of raw and unprocessed materials if it has to get a share
of the global market in the next millennium, Zambian Minister of
Commerce, Trade and Industry, David Mpamba, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba made the remarks when he opened the Third Meeting of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) Committee
in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Dependence on the export of raw materials will create untold
poverty on this continent, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to develop industries that have the
capacity to turn Africa into the bread basket of the world.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba urged manufacturers in the region not to worry about the
 implications that are going to be brought about by a free trade
area.
</P>
<P>
He said the free trade area would create larger markets that
would enable the region to attract more investors.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba noted that currently national markets are too small to
allow firms to expand sufficiently and achieve the optimum scale
production.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Acting Secretary General Sindiso Ngwenya said COMESA
Free Trade Area (FTA), which was scheduled for October 31, 2000,
would enable firms not only to supply the regional market but also
the international market.
</P>
<P>
Ngwenya said the COMESA Economic Integration arrangement
spanning a period of 16 years has witnessed the gradual reduction
of customs duties to an extent that the average tariffs now stands
at two percent.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, conventional non-tariff barriers have
been eliminated through a combination of the COMESA programs and
the unilateral trade liberalization programs being pursued by
member states.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting that about 50 billion U.S. dollars will be
required in the next five years to finance programs aimed at
enhancing trade and investment within the 21-member grouping.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the market size, he said, the average size of a
COMESA economy is about six billion dollars. In this regard, the
FTA will create a single economic space with a combined population
of approximately 380 million people and a combined Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) of 170 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans have been urged to
preserve traditional heritage in order to develop and to
revitalize the country's young tourism industry after a heavy
blow in March.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister
of Tourism, Trade and Industry Moses Ali in a message addressed
to the general public here on the World Tourism Day, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has rich tourist resources like wetlands, forest parks
and well- preserved bird species, the senior official said in the
message.
</P>
<P>
Preservation of cultural heritage is the first step to help
the country' s tourism to gain momentum in the coming century.
Uganda has to improve its image in the world's tourism stage, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Bwindi National Forest Park, which accounts for some 70
percent of the country's tourism revenue, was dealt a heavy blow
in early March when eight foreign tourists were hatched to death
by Rwandan Hutu extremists coming from the Democratic Republic of
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
The incident sparked a spate of mass tourist cancellations and
greatly dented the country's image in the international stage.
Although the government has done a lot to rekindle the stagnating
industry, still very few foreign tourists listed Uganda as their
tourist destination.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Budget Surplus Rises to 115 Billion Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27(Xinhua) -- The U.S. government Monday
estimated the budget surplus in fiscal 1999 should hit at least
115 billion dollars, the largest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The news was announced by President Clinton at the White House
early Monday. "It is a landmark achievement for our economy,"
President Clinton said before leaving on a trip to New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
The larger-than-expected surplus likely will prompt new
Republican calls for major tax cuts for Americans. Clinton vetoed
a 792 billion dollars tax cut bill last week as "too big, too
bloated" and urged passage of a cut in the range of 250 billion to
300 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The president called anew on Republicans to work with his
administration on fixing Social Security, Medicare and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
"We can do all that and still have an affordable tax cut for
the middle class and pay down our debt so that by 2015 we are
debt-free for the first time since 1835, when Andrew Jackson was
president," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders are struggling to adjourn Congress by Oct.
29. They suggested Clinton's veto had killed chances for sweeping
tax reductions this year.
</P>
<P>
The higher surplus figure "is further proof that we're on the
right road to prosperity," Clinton said. "Our nation has come a
long way in a short time. In 1992, the budget deficit was 290
billion dollars, projected to rise above 400 billion dollars this
year," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the administration had estimated the surplus
for fiscal 1999 _ which ends Thursday _ at 99 billion dollars, but
the strong economy and larger than expected tax revenues pushed
the figure higher. The 115 billion dollars figure would break the
record 69 billion dollars surplus last year.
</P>
<P>
Even after adjusting for inflation, it is still the largest
surplus in U.S. history, Clinton administration said. The 1999
surplus would be about 1.3 percent of the gross domestic product,
the largest on this basis since 1951.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges International Community to Reaffirm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday urged the international Community to reaffirm
its commitment to the world's island developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the special session of the United Nations General
Assembly on small islands, Annan said "By working with small
islands on their problems, we can find solutions for ours.
Brighter horizons for small islands can mean brighter horizons for
the world in general."
</P>
<P>
On the problems facing the small islands, Annan said there are
three:
</P>
<P>
-- The built-in constraints. Most small islands have not only
limited resources, whether land, human and financial. Many lie in
the path of hurricanes and cyclones.
</P>
<P>
-- The Environmental problems. The include climate changes,
freshwater shortages, inadequate waste management, over-fishing,
marine population and the threat of accidents involving transports
of hazardous wastes.
</P>
<P>
-- A set of challenges linked with globalization. Tourism is
both a blessing and a bane, bringing jobs but putting strains on
water supplies and ecosystems. Trade brings much-needed goods, but
liberalization and an end to special trade preferences will make
it harder for some of the products of small islands to compete.
</P>
<P>
Annan said small islands had done as much as they could to
manage their problems, and the international community, as fellow
inhabitants of the world island, should provide funding,
technology and other assistance in a spirit not only of solidarity
but of enlightened self-interest.

<P>
NICOSIA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The annual military exercise
of Cyprus' National Guard will take place during October 2-7 with
the participation of Greek warplanes and navy vessels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the "Nikiforos" maneuver,
Chief of Staff of Cyprus' National Guard Alexandros Pallas said
the purpose of the exercise is to assess the competence of the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He said Greek military aircraft and warships are scheduled to
participate in the maneuver.
</P>
<P>
Pallas noted that a search-and-rescue exercise will take place
off the coast of Cyprus' southwestern town of Paphos.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, the final day of the land, air and sea exercise,
military parades will take place in both Paphos and Cyprus'
southeastern town of Larnaca.
</P>
<P>
In November 1993, Cyprus and Greece agreed on a joint defense
pact, according to which Athens will offer Nicosia air, land and
sea support in case of Turkish offensive against the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.

<HEADLINE> Speakers at Fortune Forum Optimistic on China's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- All four speakers at today's
first commerce session of the Fortune Global Forum agreed that
China's future in the next 50 years will be prosperous.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that China's economy is now developing soundly,
and that over the next five to ten years the country can expect
continued rapid growth. They noted that China is now facing both
opportunities and challenges, but the opportunities outweigh the
challenges.
</P>
<P>
Kenneth S. Courtis, strategist and chief economist from the
Deutsche Bank Group Asia Pacific, said that it is vital for China
to efficiently use bank deposits, which will produce "
revolutionary" effects on its economic development. He predicted
that the country will become both a major exporter and a large
consumer in the future.
</P>
<P>
Fan Gang, director of National Economic Research Institute,
expressed optimism about the current reform of state-owned
enterprises, saying that the reform is going in the right
direction, and will likely be completed in the next three to five
years.
</P>
<P>
As China has been confronted with the problem of deflation for
the past two years, Mickey Kantor, former U.S. secretary of
commerce and trade representative, said that China has adopted a
series of measures, such as cutting interest rates, increasing
salaries and investing more in infrastructure, and all these
measures are correct and will bear good results.
</P>
<P>
"China will harvest a lot as it is planting the seeds now,"
said Kantor.
</P>
<P>
Maurice R. Greenberg, chairman and CEO of the American
International Group Inc., said at today's session that China needs
the WTO, but the WTO needs China more. He noted that the United
States should abandon a narrow view of politics and develop a
partnership with China, because that kind of relationship will be
good for both countries.

<HEADLINE> FDI Down 11 Percent in 1998 From 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The total volume of foreign
direct investment (FDI) in 1998 was 85 billion U.S. dollars, 11
percent down against the 1997 record, but the total in 1998 was
still the second highest ever and was about 3 billion dollars more
than that in 1996, according to a United Nations report published
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In past years, the overall total was highly affected by FDI to
China which received FDI flows of about 45.5 billion in 1998,
exceeding the previous year's level by 1 billion dollars according
to revised estimates," said the United Nations Conference for
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in its World Investment Report 1999:
Foreign Direct Investment and the Challenge of Development.
</P>
<P>
China not only accounted for well over half of total FDI flows
into the region, but was the third largest recipient in the world
behind only the United States and the United Kingdom, said the
UNCTAD.
</P>
<P>
Against the background of the Asian crisis, the UNCTAD said,
South Korea received its largest ever volume of FDI inflows at 5.1
billion dollars, a four-fold gain over its annual average in the
first half of the 1990s, and 2.3 billion above the 1997 volume,
making South Korea a net recipient after having been a net FDI
outflow country since the start of the decade.
</P>
<P>
As for South-East Asia, inflows to Malaysia and Singapore were
down 27 percent and 26 percent respectively. Hardest hit of all
was Indonesia, where FDI inflows turned negative with divestment
of 356 million dollars, compared to inflows of 4.7 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, rising levels of mergers and acquisitions pushed
inflows to Thailand to nearly 7 billion dollars, over 3 billion
more than those in 1997. The Philippines also enjoyed record
inflows.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, Bangladesh experienced fast growth of FDI
inflows in 1998, particularly in energy. However, flows into India
fell by around 1 billion dollars to 2.3 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD said that low oil prices last year impacted FDI into
West Asia, with 1998 volume remaining almost the same as in 1997,
at 4.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the UN agency said, "Plans to expand oil and gas
production capacity in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, United Arab Emirates
and Yemen, and the opening up of the petroleum sector to foreign
investors in Kuwait and the Islamic Republic of Iran should lead
to increase in FDI."

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) will host TELECOM 99 + INTERACTIVE
99 in Geneva from October 10 to 17, the United Nations agency
announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda this year will be the huge growth and
influence of mobile communications and the Internet. During the
last such event in the 20th century, world leaders from the
telecom and information technology (IT) industries as well as key
figures from governments around the globe will discuss the issues
that will shape the future path of an industry already worth over
a trillion U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"As the third generation mobile systems made possible by the
ITU's work on the IMT-2000 standard come into use, in the early
years of the next decade, we will finally see the dream of
anywhere anytime communications come true, for both voice and data,
" said ITU Secretary-General Yoshio Utsumi.
</P>
<P>
"But in our excitement over the apparently all-pervasive growth
of cellular telephony and the Internet," he continued, "we should
not forget that the vast majority of the world's people do not yet
have access to even basic telecommunications services. It is
essential not to create a new form of information gap between the
world's richer and poorer countries."
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 exhibitors are expected to be at the week-long
event, followed by a specially designed two-day event open to the
general public, the ITU said.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Asks for Security Council Delegation for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia has
proposed that the U.N. Security Council to send a delegation to
Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, to "ascertain the real situation"
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was contained in a letter to the president of the
Security Council from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations. The letter was
published here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The September 16 report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK) "is not fully reflective of the situation in Kosovo and
Metohija, the autonomous province of the Yugoslav constituent
Republic of Serbia, and this prevents the Security Council from
obtaining a full insight into that situation and from forming
appropriate positions."
</P>
<P>
The disarmament of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) "has
not been effected as provided for by Security Council resolution
1244, nor is the International Security Force (KFOR) determined to
enforce it," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was adopted on June 10, demands the
completion of the KLA disarmament on September 19 and the full
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The terrorists have been given three months to continue their
program against the Serbs and to carry out ethnic cleansing and to
conceal arms in bunkers built specially for these purposes in
Kosovo... or to transport them to Macedonia where, according to
reliable data, 30,000 rifles have been stacked," he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior Yugoslav diplomat told a press conference here
earlier this month that the KLA has only turned in out-dated
weapons, and concealed what is good in Kosovo and neighboring
Albania.
</P>
<P>
"This is made possible due to uncontrolled borders since the
Yugoslav Army and border police have not been deployed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the measures taken by the Special Representative of
the United Nations Secretary-General, Bernard Kouchner, are not
only contrary to Security Council resolution 1244, but are in
effect instrumental in promoting the session of Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kouchner has legalized regulations on the use of foreign
currencies in Kosovo and the opening of a new customs office
despite opposition from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"These regulations have no legal or political basis in Council
resolution 1244, aid and abet terrorism and separatism and amount
in all practical terms to the continuation of the aggression
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by other means," he
said.

<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Horse racers from
southwestern China's Tibet Autonomous Region came out big winners
with a dominating performance at horse racing competitions at
China's on-going National Games for Traditional Sports of Minority
Nationalities in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Horse racers from the Region won the top three places of the
horseback archery event on Monday, with Tashitaje winning his
delegation's third gold medal in the competitions. Eight out of
the 18-strong field were from the Region.
</P>
<P>
Participants from Tibet Autonomous Region won the horseback
archery title at the Lhasa venue of the Games in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan minority participants took the top eight spots of
the horseback rifle shooting event here on Sunday, with
Lobsangdoje declared the champion. Racers from the Region took
half of the 20-member entries for the event.
</P>
<P>
Their closest rivals are those from the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in the northwestern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Both events demand high skills in horse racing and shooting.
Horseback shooting, for example, allows each racer only nine
seconds to complete a 100-meter run while shooing down two
balloons placed 35 meters apart by the track. The racer who
scores more good shots in the two runs wins the event.
</P>
<P>
Experts put the long history of animal husbandry behind their
victories in the horse racing competitions. Harsh life on
horseback long ago made the ancestors of the region's herdsmen

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A plan to cancel up to 27 billion dollars in debt owed by
the world's most desperately poor countries won key financial
backing from major industrial governments Sunday, clearing the way
for funds that now flow to foreign creditors to stay home instead
to pay for schools and clinics.
</P>
<P>
-- Congressional Republicans are pressing a new round of
confrontation with the White House over environmental protections,
adding one more large complication to the already difficult task
of finishing work on the annual spending bills.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The head of the Bank of Japan strongly hinted that he was
prepared to reverse course and act to halt a three-month rise in
the value of the yen, before it chokes off Japan's fragile
economic recovery and sets off further clashes with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State K. Albright met in New York with the
man expected to lead an independent East Timor and warned
Indonesia that it risks losing American aid and investment unless
it protects refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Chechnya's capital was attacked by Russian warplanes for the
fourth day as Yeltsin's defense minister refused to rule out an
invasion of the breakaway republic that humiliated Moscow in the
1994-96 separatist war. An estimated 13,000 Russian troops are now
on the border.
</P>
<P>
-- Colombia will let the peso float against the dollar,
abandoning the central bank's efforts to maintain trading bands
amid heavy selling pressure.

<HEADLINE> UK Calls for Reform of EU Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The British
Government on Monday reiterated its call for the reform of the
European Union's common agricultural program (CAP).
</P>
<P>
British Secretary for Agriculture Nick Brown, addressing the
Labor Party's annual conference here, urged reducing production
subsidies for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we should have a common approach to agriculture
throughout the European Single Market, but I want to transform the
CAP so that there is less emphasis on production subsidies that
force prices up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said there should be more emphasis on rural
development measures which recognize the role played by
agriculture in rural life, in rural economies, in protecting the
environment and in shaping the landscape, he said.
</P>
<P>
Europeans cannot go on producing food surplus in heavily
subsidized regimes, "food which is either dumped on world markets,
with damaging effects on producers outside Europe or put into
store, building stockpiles of food that will never be eaten," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Also, he stated the "major priorities" facing the Labor
Government at the moment as "making further progress with
agricultural reform during the next WTO round, making maximum
possible use of new opportunities to pursue Labor's countryside
policies through the Rural Development Regulation and helping
British farming through the present deep and enduring fall in farm
incomes."

<HEADLINE> US Company Chooses HK as Asia-Pacific Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- ON Semiconductor, one of
the world's leading suppliers of analog, logic and discrete
electronic component, has named Hong Kong as its Asia Pacific
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
ON Semiconductor, formerly the Semiconductor Components Group
of Motorola, is now a new and independent company.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held this afternoon at the Grand
Hyatt to announce the decision, Steve Hanson, president of ON
Semiconductor, said that one of the reasons to choose Hong Kong as
the regional headquarters is that with its central location, Hong
Kong offers easy access to all of the company's major markets.
</P>
<P>
"Its cosmopolitan character helps us to develop new ideas and
new technology," Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
The excellent telecommunications infrastructure and its role as
the Internet traffic and content hub in Asia also lays a very good
foundation for the company to develop its e-commerce capabilities,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's unique position as a special administrative region
of China gives ON Semiconductor unparalleled advantages to open
the gateway to China's mainland," Hanson stressed.
</P>
<P>
Henry Leung, vice president and general manager for Asia
Pacific region of ON Semiconductor, said that the availability of
talents, the cost-effectiveness and the support from the local
government all help the company to choose Hong Kong as its
regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The company, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, the United
States, employs 10,000 people in Asia and runs manufacturing
plants in China, Japan, Malaysia and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Closes Lower in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in
Tokyo Monday, hit by erratic movements in the foreign exchange
market despite monetary officials from the Group of Seven (G-7)
nations expressing concern about the yen's recent rise against the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped 50.67 points, or 0.30
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 16,821.06.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, edged down 1.04 points or 0.07 percent to 1,
429.38.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index topped 17,000 in early trading in line with
the dollar's rebound against the yen, following the G-7 meeting
held in Washington Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index, however, lost ground after the dollar dropped
again in the afternoon, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 346.72 million
shares from 640.36 million shares last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 665 to 525, with 141 issues remaining unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar jumped to the
106 yen level in early trading but later fell to the 103 yen level,
with the Group of Seven (G-7) statement of concern about the yen's
rise having only short-lived effect.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 104.12-15 yen, down from
105.57-62 yen at 9 a.m., and 103.90-104.00 yen late last Friday in

<HEADLINE> Reception in Macao Marks PRC's 50th Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that the Chinese people have entered a new era in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and that China
will contribute more to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
made the remarks to more than 2,000 guests attending a grand
reception to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
At the reception hosted by the Xinhua branch, Wang first
expressed his heartfelt gratitude to those in Macao who have been
supporting the development of New China over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in half a century, China's comprehensive national
strength has been raised remarkably and the Chinese people now are
on the road to becoming well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have shown that the Chinese people have found an
appropriate way for national development," Wang said. "Our next
goals are to achieve the nation's modernization in the mid-21st
century and contribute more to the progress of mankind."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the year of 1999 is of great significance for
the Chinese people as the PRC is 50 years old and Macao is
returning to the motherland. The two events will greatly encourage
all the Chinese to march toward the 21st century with a new
outlook."
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, Macao is in the final stage of the
transition period. The region's future chief executive has been
elected and principal officials appointed. Preparatory work for
establishing the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) is well
under way, Wang declared.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that Portugal and China can strengthen cooperation in
relevant consultations so as to ensure Macao's smooth transition
and transfer of power," he added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
upcoming visit to Portugal will enhance the cooperation between
the two countries and facilitate the long-term development of
friendly bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"It is foreseeable that Macao will maintain lasting stability
and development and have a more promising future after its return
to the motherland," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira said at the reception that
the rapid economic growth China has made over the past 50 years
has laid the foundation for the country's continuous development
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The governor expressed the wish that the Chinese people will
make even greater achievements in the future.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the future Macao SAR, was
also present at the reception.

authorities to make further efforts to maintain the political
stability and social security in order to attract more tourists.

Tourism is one of the most promising industries in Cambodia
which boasts the centuries-old temples, such as Angkor Wat, that
are regarded as among the most magnificent monuments in the world.

Jintao today urged both China and Japan to continue following the
principled spirit set forth in the "Sino-Japanese Joint Statement,
" the "Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship," and the "
Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration."
</P>
<P>
Hu said that both sides should develop in-depth exchanges and
cooperation, and implement a series of important consensus and

<HEADLINE> Uganda Trying to Improve Reproductive Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has been enhancing
protection of reproductive health rights through supportive
policies over the past few years, a report released Monday here by
a regional workshop shows.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, the country has adopted the national
population policy whose overall goal is to improve the quality of
life and standard of living.
</P>
<P>
The country's constitution, enacted in 1995, states that laws,
cultures, customs or traditions which are against the dignity,
welfare or interest of women or which undermine their status, are
prohibited by the constitution. These include harmful practices
like early marriages that have negative health related effects.
</P>
<P>
The government adopted a national gender policy in 1997 whose
key aspects are to integrate gender into development efforts at
all levels for planning, resource allocation, and implementation
of development programs.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the government is now in the process of
developing a reproductive health policy which will focus on safe
motherhood, family planning, HIV/AIDS prevention, adolescent
health and genital tract cancer.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda still has one of the highest adolescent
pregnancy in Sub-Sahara Africa, the government is confident that
more and better legislative work would be done to improve
reproductive health of the public in general and women in
particular, the report noted.

When it comes to bilateral relations, Hu said the SDP, as the
Japanese party with the longest history of exchanges with the CPC,
has played a very important role in promoting the healthy
development of bilateral relations and increasing mutual
understanding, mutual trust and friendship.
</P>
<P>
"We highly appreciate that some far-sighted Japanese statesmen
have courageously got rid of various interferences and have
dedicated themselves to friendship between the two countries,"
said Hu, adding the hope that statesmen in both countries will
continue to increase exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Doi said that the SDP started friendly exchanges with the CPC
even before the normalization of bilateral relations, which
contributed greatly to the development of friendship between two
nations and two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Now that the two heads of states have reached an important
consensus on the development of bilateral relations, she said the
SDP hopes to further increase party-to-party ties with the CPC and
in turn promote state-to-state ties.
</P>
<P>
"Our recognition the 'one China' policy has further deepened,
and we shall continue to hold to this principle," she added.
</P>
<P>
Hu also voiced his concern over the recent earthquakes in
Taiwan and expressed sympathy and solicitude for Taiwan
compatriots, and reiterated the Chinese government's consistent
policy on the Taiwan issue.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Increase Set to Take Effect in Philippines This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Another round of oil price
increase is set to take effect in the Philippines this week due to
the rise of crude oil cost in the world market, officials of
Pilipinas Shell and Petron Corporation said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters, Shell Vice President for
Corporate Affairs Rey Gamboa said the increase will take effect
before September 30. He assured it will not go beyond one peso but
not lower than 58 centavos per liter.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that prices of diesel oil and liquefied
petroleum gas will remain the same.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said the increase is based on the current cost of crude
oil in the world market pegged at 17 U.S. dollars to 21 dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
A new round of oil hikes will also take effect next month
which, Gamboa explained, would be due to an increase in the price
of crude oil in the international market.
</P>
<P>
International oil suppliers have sent out advisories to the
local oil firms that there would be a four-dollar increase in the
price of crude oil next month. The purchasing cost of the product
will rise to 25 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Gamboa said oil companies may be forced to hold back any price
adjustments for oil and other petroleum products if the government
agrees to reduce specific taxes and duties imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Petron Corp. and Pilipinas Shell raised the prices
of their oil products by an average of 35 centavos a liter.

<HEADLINE> Korean Athletes Swing High at China's National Minorities Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- With the flower-decorated
ropes waggling, golden bells jingling and their colorful skirts
floating in the wind, two Korean girls swinging in the air seemed
like fairies out of the clouds.
</P>
<P>
Kim Chunhua, a 18-year-old middle school student and her
partner from the Korean minority nationality won the pairs
swinging event by touching the bells 85 times within the
stipulated time of 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
A pair of competitors from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
who are twin sisters, took the silvers with one less touch in the
regular time.
</P>
<P>
Swinging competition was one of the hottest sports at the
current Chinese National Games for Traditional Sports of Minority
Nationalities, which opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The big crowd here is really unexpected," Kim said. "I'm
very happy. The hard training has finally paid off," she said.
</P>
<P>
With the game of swinging more and more prevailing, some people
are considering to promote it, as an international sport, to other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure we would win if there are world championships for the
sport," said Li Xuexiu, leader of the Jilin Provincial swinging
team and a four-time participant of the National Minorities Games.
</P>
<P>
Mainly a traditional folk game, swinging has enjoyed a great
popularity among residents of South Korea and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Many experts in China have made great efforts and finally
succeeded in transforming it into an organized sport, with
generations of talented players emerging in recent years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Research has been commenced in some sports middle schools in
Jilin, a northeastern Chinese province with the largest Korean
minority nationality community, to make the game safer and more
attractive to TV audiences.
</P>
<P>
Besides individual and pairs contest for bell-touching event,
there are also height competitions for both individuals and pairs,
at the Games here. The player who swings the highest is declared
the winner.

<HEADLINE> Opinion Polls Add Confusion Over Indian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- No clear picture has
emerged from the four phases of the ongoing Marathon election
battles in India, which have been carried on mainly between the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its rival, the Congress, ever
since last August.
</P>
<P>
Opinion or exit polls by several agencies of the country seemed
to have added more confusion over the possible winner of the
pollings to the lower house of parliament, which began early this
month.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, an exit poll by the official Doordarshan two
hours after the end of the fourth phase of polling concluded that
the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) was heading for a
simple majority.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, three more agencies put out results of their polls
and each of them had reached a set of confusion that did not tally
with the other.
</P>
<P>
An interesting feature of the results announced separately by
the three agencies was that two of them said the Congress might
cross the 200-seat mark and emerge as the single largest party
while the third said categorically that NDA would get an absolute
majority despite "some minor losses" in the third and fourth
phases of polling.
</P>
<P>
The agencies which predicted a comfortable and absolute
majority for the NDA are normally commissioned by those who have
close relations with the BJP, or even BJP's members of parliament
(MP).
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, most of those which predicted results just the
opposite are pro-Congress agencies such as Lokmat poll which was
carried out by a newspaper owned by a Congress MP.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account all the four exit polls, Jain Television,
owned by a former BJP MP, said NDA was likely to get 236 out of a
total of 543 seats in Lok Sabha while the Congress was set to win
only 127 seats, giving a clear advantage of 109 seats over the
Congress-led alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a complete contrast, the Lokmat exit poll predicted that the
Congress and its allies would emerge as the single largest group
while the NDA would be in the second position with only 200 seats.
</P>
<P>
However, well-informed independent sources here said the
BJP-led coalition would have comfortable win and secure over 300
seats in the elections, the third in four years in the South Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
If the projections turn out right, the BJP could overtake the
Congress as the single largest party after the third of October
when the last phase of the polling is to be launched.

<HEADLINE> Inland Western China Province Heading for Take-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Landlocked Shaanxi Province in
northwest China will use the country's strategic economic shift to
western parts to improve its economy, Li Jianguo, the provincial
Communist Party Committee secretary, has told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi was a revolutionary base of the Communist Party and a
sacred place of the Chinese revolution with its "Yan'an Spirit",
named for the Communist Party base, which is a combination of
diligence and working class know-how, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the twenty years of China's opening-up, however, the
province lagged behind coastal provinces because of its isolation
and late-awakening to market consciousness. But, the economy has
been given new life by the country's new infrastructure
construction and its own awareness of the need to emphasize
tourism and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The province's gross domestic product grew to 141 billion yuan
last year, 16 times the 1978 figure. During a visit to Shaanxi
this June, President Jiang Zemin told the region to take bolder
steps in the reform and opening-up, meaning that it is time to
boost the economy of the relatively backward region.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is an important province in northwest China and has set
a goal of becoming an economic leader of the region by the year
2010, Li said. It now has the most powerful research team in the
region and has attracted specialists from various areas to join
the effort in exploring new methods of economic growth.

JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman congratulated his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak on
his re-election in a nation-wide referendum held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Weizman telephoned Mubarak Monday afternoon and expressed his
congratulations to Mubarak that he has been re-elected to another
six-year term in office during the Sunday national referendum,
Weizman's office said.
</P>
<P>
During the cordial conversations, Mubarak also expressed
congratulation to Weizman on his nomination as a candidate for
1999 Nobel Peace Prize, it added.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed ways to further enhance the
relations between the two countries as well as the Middle East
peace process, the office said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mubarak has won 94 percent of the "yes"
vote in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has been nominated for the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize by
several former prize laureates.
</P>
<P>
In his letter of recommendation, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat wrote that Weizman "was one of the pioneer brave Israelis
who persisted in acting for direct negotiations between the
government of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization,"
and that during his term in office Weizman "continued to act
tirelessly to break down the walls of enmity between Israel and
its neighbors and to widen the circles of peace and coexistence in
the Middle East."
</P>

Weizman earlier said that he was surprised to learn the news,
because no body, including those who recommended on his behalf,
has told him that he has been nominated for the Peace Prize.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Tackles Gas Plant Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo Sunday flew to the country's largest joint venture
Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Plant to seek a way out of the closure
of the factory following the local jobless youth's protest and
siege.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, accompanied by ministers and governors of states,
rushed by a helicopter to Bonny in the country's southeast Rivers
State where the plant is located, shortly after he had returned
from New York, reported the Guardian newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the restive youths, the president said that
the face- off between the community and the companies was hurting
the country's foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo admitted that failure to plan for the future of the
youth who worked at the LNG construction site was to blame for the
shut-down of the multi-billion plant.
</P>
<P>
The huge 3.8 billion U.S. dollar plant was shut down last
Thursday following the continued siege of the plant by local
protesters demanding for jobs.
</P>
<P>
The plant is jointly invested by Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, Anglo-Dutch Shell, Italian group Agip, French Elf and
other major western oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's new civilian government hoped the
multi-billion-dollar plant to diversify its too much reliance on
oil export and prevent gas flaring from causing severe
environmental pollution.

<HEADLINE> Sensex Down in Bombay Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The sensitive Index
(SENSEX) fell 42.15 points Monday on the Bombay Stock Exchange
(BSE) due to heavy selling pressure and lack of worthwhile
purchases by Foreign Funds.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-30 share sensitive index flared up reflecting hefty
gains initially. However, these gains were trimmed substantially
in the latter part of the session coupled with losses in economy
stocks that pushed the sensex down to close at 4715.67 as against
last Friday's close of 4757.82, netting a fall of 42.15 points.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-100 Index eased by 1.53 points to 2219.41 from previous
close of 2220.94.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 Index and the Dollex were quoted down at 510.87 and
195.21 compared with previous close of 512.01 and 195.65
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-500 Index declined to 1512.85 from last Friday's close
of 1515.28.

<HEADLINE> Farmers in Eastern China Create Environmental Miracle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Some foreign scholars have been
amazed at the success in Anhui Province's Yinshang County, which
has two villages listed among the world's 500 top successful
environmental protection units.
</P>
<P>
This miracle of transformation began with two brothers, Zhang
Jiashun and Zhang Jiawang, the heads of the villages of Xiaozhang
and Balihe, respectively, who are known here as the "ecology
brothers".
</P>
<P>
Before the mid-1970s, the average annual income of Xiaozhang's
farmers was 45 yuan (5.4 U.S. dollars) and per hectare grain
output was 825 kilograms. But by the mid-1970s, Zhang Jiashun led
the villagers in planting trees, developing water conservation
projects, building hydro-electric power stations, transforming
farmland, and digging wells. Energy-saving stoves were introduced
to reduce the use of firewood and methane-generating pits were dug
to provide clean energy. The mud from the fish ponds was used as
manure on fields.
</P>
<P>
The village has built 45 forest shelter belts 50 km long in all.
The improved environment has helped increase agricultural output.
Grain output has climbed to 16,500 kilograms per hectare and the
farmer's annual income has increased to 2,800 yuan per capita.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the village was recognized for its environmental
protection by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and
Zhang Jiashun was given a UNEP award in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Balihe Village is 30 km away. There, Zhang Jiawang led farmers
in providing irrigation and drainage systems for 2,500 hectares of
land. They also developed 370 hectares of lotus ponds, 600
hectares of paddies, and 187 hectares of ponds for special types
of fish and aquatic vegetables.
</P>
<P>
With the improvements in the local ecological environment,
every family in the village has its own fish pond and farmers'
average annual income has increased to 3,200 yuan, from less than
200 yuan before the 1980s. And Zhang Jiawang was listed among the
world's top 500 individuals for their outstanding work in
environmental protection in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Congress Urged to Amend Anti-Rape Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Philippine woman Senator Loren
Legarda has urged Congress to consider amending the Rape Victim
Assistance and Protection Act, so that only female physicians may
conduct examination on female rape victims, Philippine News Agency
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is degrading for female victims of rape, particularly
minors, to be examined by a male doctor. Some people even say it
is just like the victim is being raped twice," Legarda said.
</P>
<P>
The traumatized victim adamantly refused to be examined by a
male medico-legal officer, she added.
</P>
<P>
Legarda, meanwhile, appealed to her colleagues for support on
ensuring that the Rape Victim Assistance and Protection Act is
adequately funded in the proposed 2000 national budget.
</P>
<P>
Passed in February 1998, Legarda lamented that up to now, the
law has remained unfunded to the tune of 120 million pesos (3
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The law seeks to establish at least one rape crisis center in
every province and city.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Oil firms Get Ultimatum on Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Major oil and gas companies
operating in Nigeria's Niger River Delta have been given six weeks
to submit proposals on remedial measures over environmental
pollution to the Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Monday quoted Nigerian Environment
Minister of State, Imeh Okopido, as saying: "it was disheartening
to note that in several of the industrial establishments, waste
treatment procedures were not followed through, exposing the
environment, including humans, to unimaginable hazards and
nuisance from these wastes."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the end of a visit to the country's
southeast oil yielding states.
</P>
<P>
He added that the government was anxious to see improvement in
waste management practices in the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is not just lead. The benzene is our greatest concern.
Benzene is the one that destroys the genes of humans and that is
part of the petroleum products that are emptied into our rivers
affecting our children and even adults," Okopido emphasized.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained
half a U.S. cent Monday after one of the sharpest gold rallies
ever seen in the price of the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
The bounce in gold since its close on Friday in New York was
enough to see some analysts again predicting that the local
currency could reach 68 U.S. cents by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 65.46 U.S.
cents, up from Friday's local close of 64.96. During the day it
traded between 65.06 and 65.6 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
In the money market Monday, the 90-day bank bill rate was at
4.98 percent from 5.01 percent and the 180-day bill was at 5.19
percent from Friday's close of 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Also at the local close, the Australian dollar was buying
0.6263 euro from 0.6178 at Friday's close and 68.23 Japanese yen
from 67.48.

<HEADLINE> FOREX Market to Be Liberalized in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign exchange
market will be liberalized by the end of October with the daily
Inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) reintroduced, Nigeria's
Central Bank Governor Joseph Sanusi has said.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of IFEM will bring to an end the Autonomous
Foreign Exchange Market (AFEM) through which the Central Bank of
Nigeria has intervened weekly for the past 13 years in sales of
foreign exchange to banks, local newspaper This Day Monday quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor made the remarks in Washington during
the on- going annual meeting of the World Bank Group and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
According to him, "AFEM will run parallel to IFEM for one or
two weeks, after which it shall be scrapped for a liberalized
environment."
</P>
<P>
Sanusi admitted that the central bank made an attempt to
liberalize the foreign exchange market in March this year with
the introduction of IFEM, but it failed to take off because
certain things were not properly done.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with the introduction of IFEM, the oil companies
would have the right to sell their forex directly to the market,
thereby allowing banks to buy as much forex as they require.
</P>
<P>
"The foreign exchange market will now become fluid and that the
central bank will cease to intervene on a weekly basis, except it
becomes necessary to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the past, oil companies are required to sell their forex
proceeds to the central bank, which will subsequently be sold to
the banks through AFEM.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to the decision to liberalize the forex market,
bank executives who spoke to This Day all lauded the decision,
saying "it had been long over due."
</P>
<P>
Jim Ovia, managing director of Zenith International Bank, was
quoted as saying that with the liberalization of the market, the
local currency naira would be allowed to float and find its
actual value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of the forex market in Nigeria is one of the
monetary reform measures the IMF has been pushing for under a
medium term economic program.
</P>
<P>
The IMF has held the view that the central bank should stop its
weekly intervention in AFEM and artificially peg the value of the
naira against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang Zemin's Speech at Fortune Forum (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua)-- Following is the full text of
the speech delivered by Chinese President Jiang Zemin at the
banquet to celebrate the opening of the '99 Fortune Global Forum
in Shanghai today:
</P>
<P>
On this splendid moonlit night in mid-autumn, as we gather in
the beautiful city of Shanghai, located on the coast of the East
China Sea, let me, on behalf of the Chinese Government and people,
extend a warm welcome to the friends who have come to take part in
the '99 Fortune Global Forum, which is sponsored by Time Warner
Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
This forum's theme is "China: the next 50 years." China is a
large developing socialist country, and its future development
will not only directly affect the future of the Chinese people,
but will also have an important impact on the development and
progress of Asia and the world. Over the past hundred-odd years,
the Chinese people have gone through storm and stress, and in the
course of vigorous struggle they have accomplished a great
historic transformation. New China's 50 years of development have
resulted in accomplishments that have astonished the world.
</P>
<P>
Only six years ago, in this Lujiazui District of Shanghai's
Pudong area, where we are gathered this evening, there were only
run-down houses and farms. Now it is a vibrant modern financial
and business zone, full of high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
Over fifty years ago, I was in Shanghai attending university.
At that time, I had a deep sense of the poverty, backwardness and
feebleness of old China. It was then that I decided to devote
myself to the noble task of building an independent, free,
democratic, unified, rich and powerful New China, and I have been
struggling for that to this very day.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen years ago, I became mayor of Shanghai, and experienced
the process of reform, opening-up and modernization in this, China
's biggest city. I'm sure that all of you have seen with your own
eyes the constant and unceasing transformation of Shanghai. The
growth of Shanghai is one reflection of the enormous changes
taking place in China.

<P>
In the first 50 years of the 20th century, the Chinese people
made unflagging efforts to change the tragic fate that had been
theirs ever since the Opium War. After arduous and valiant
struggle, they finally ended their semi-colonial and semi-feudal
history, won independence for the nation and freedom for the
people, and founded the People's Republic of China under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In the latter half of the 20th century, relying on their own
efforts, the Chinese people went all out to make their country
strong and embarked on socialist construction. On the poor and
deprived foundation of old China, they built a relatively complete
industrial structure and national economic framework, raising the
levels of their cultural and material lives significantly. China
started marching forward steadily toward prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Chinese people are confidently taking the road to the
future, the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics
pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. These historic initiatives of
the Chinese people have fundamentally transformed the tragic fate
of modern China, and they are also great contributions made by the
Chinese people to the cause of human progress.
</P>
<P>
At this moment in time, when we are about to step into the 21st
century and look ahead at the prospects for the next 50 years, we
are filled with confidence. The Chinese people will firmly and
unswervingly follow the path of reform and opening-up. Our goal is
to realize modernization by the middle of the coming century, to
make our country a wealthy, strong, democratic and civilized
modern socialist country, and to achieve the great revival of the
Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> Loroupe to Race in 2000 London Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Tegla Loroupe, who won the
Berlin Marathon in the world's fastest time ever run by a woman,
has confirmed she will run in the London marathon on April 16 next
year.
</P>
<P>
Loroupe, in Berlin, was timed two hours 20 minutes 43 seconds
to better her own world mark set in Rotterdam last year by four
seconds.
</P>
<P>
She will race against fellow-Kenyan and defending champion
Joyce Chepchumba .
</P>
<P>
Chepchumba clocked 2:23:22 in London this year, the fastest
time ever in a woman only race. Loroupe was paced by men both in
Rotterdam and Berlin.
</P>
<P>
London organizers believe, that in line with track races and
major championship marathons, marks set in mixed races should not
be recognized as world bests.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Monday they said the International Amateur
Athletic Federation cross country commission had voted 7-2 in
favor of a recommendation that women should start at least 30
minutes ahead of men in marathons to qualify for a world best.
</P>
<P>
"Much debate has surrounded both the London marathon's decision
to recognize Joyce's winning time in last year's London race as a
women's only world best and also Tegla's use of male pacemakers
throughout the race when she set her previous world best time in
Rotterdam in 1998," said international race director Dave Bedford.
</P>
<P>
"Many questioned which was the better performance. We will now
have an opportunity to see a true race between them when the
competitive element comes first and fast times are an added bonus,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Around 30,000 people are expected to take part in the 2000
London Marathon.

<P>
Here, I would like to speak to you about some basic values of
the Chinese people. Without an understanding of these, it is
difficult to make sense of present and future events in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have always respected the dignity and worth
of human beings. The Communist Party of China led the people in
revolution, construction and reform for the very purpose of
realizing freedom, democracy and human rights for all the people
of China. The great vitality displayed nowadays in China vividly
demonstrates the tremendous space that the Chinese people have to
freely and democratically exercise their creativity. China has a
population of over 1.2 billion, but its social production is still
not well developed, and we must first and foremost safeguard the
people's rights to survival and development; otherwise we cannot
even begin to talk about other rights. The fact that China has
assured the rights to survival and development of over 1.2 billion
people is a major contribution to the cause of the progress of
human rights all over the world. The Chinese people advocate the
close interlinking of collective human rights with individual
human rights, of economic, social and cultural rights with
citizens' political rights. This is the road we must take for the
cause of promoting human rights in light of China's national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have always insisted on independence. They
cherish the rights of independence that they have won over a long
period of struggle, and they resolutely uphold that all the
nationalities enjoy these rights. We also believe that every
country has the right to choose the social system and path of
development that suit its national conditions. Countries with
different social systems should respect each other's sovereignty
and territorial integrity; they should treat each other as equals
and coexist peacefully. We oppose any efforts by any country to
impose its own social system and ideology on another country.  (

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese people have always loved freedom and peace. The
Chinese people have suffered greatly from wars and invasions in
modern times, and they feel deeply how precious peace is. As it
engages in modernization, China needs a peaceful international
environment. We hope that all people will be able to live in a
world without war and without violence. China adopts a foreign
policy with peace as its goal, and resolutely opposes any acts
that endanger world peace. China's development does not pose a
threat to anyone, instead, it will only help to advance world
peace, stability and development. It is the Chinese people's
solemn promise to the world never to seek hegemony.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people have always prized national unity. To
safeguard the unity of the motherland is the firm aspiration of
the entire Chinese people. Hong Kong has already returned to the
motherland; Macao will return on December 20 this year. It is
certain that the Taiwan question will eventually be resolved. No
country will allow its own territory to be split off, nor will it
allow any foreign force to create or support such a split. Our
guideline for solving the Taiwan question is "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems". In resolving the
Taiwan question, we will not undertake to renounce the use of
force precisely for the purpose of bringing about a peaceful
resolution of the Taiwan question. The Chinese people have both
the determination and ability to achieve the complete
reunification of their motherland. The series of recent severe
earthquakes that occurred in the region of Taiwan weigh heavily on
the heart of everyone in China. I would like to take this
opportunity to again express profound condolences to our
compatriots in Taiwan who have suffered from the earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
The world is a colorful and varied one. The people of each
country follow the path of development they have chosen for
themselves and pursue their own ideals. This is an inevitable
demand and basic criterion for the progress of human civilization
and world democracy. It is therefore an unstoppable tide of
history. We believe that the different social systems that exist
in the world and the dissimilarities in political beliefs should
not be used as obstacles to the various kinds of normal economic
and technological cooperation and exchange.
</P>
<P>
All you business leaders tonight are outstanding achievers in
your respective fields. You have a wealth of successful
experiences and strategic vision. Set your eyes on China. China
welcomes you. China's modernization needs your participation, and
China's economic development will also offer you tremendous
opportunities. I hope that Chinese enterprises will learn from the
advanced experiences of foreign enterprises. They must go out and
temper themselves in the winds and storms of economic
globalization, and build up their own competitiveness. The Chinese
government will offer good terms to and create a better
environment for foreign enterprises investing here.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua ) -- Nigerian government, together
with international agencies, will pool some 200 million U.S.
dollars for the advancement of science, engineering and technology
in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The program is to be anchored by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and
strongly committed by Nigerian government, according to the
Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo has launched a Special
Framework Plan of Action to ensure the scheme's success, said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
The special plan, according to Fola Osotimehin, a UNESCO
science policy adviser in Paris, France, is intended to reinforce
international co- operation with Nigeria in the efforts at
national reconstruction and development and strengthening of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Besides, science and technology, education, culture,
communication, informatics and information are other sectors that
would benefit from the plan.
</P>
<P>
Osotimehin, who coordinated a Consultative Forum on Budgeting
for Scientific, Engineering and Technological Activities in Abuja
last week, said that Nigeria had invested in the establishment of
a fairly adequate Science and Technology (S&AMP;T) infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the infrastructure needed to be
reinforced and modernized.
</P>
<P>
"A major urgent requirement is the reform of the national
science and technology system and this is the main goal of the
science component of the Special Nigeria-UNESCO Plan of Action,"
Osotimehin said.
</P>
<P>
The reform being pursued is aimed at increasing the
effectiveness of the national science and technology system,
particularly by ensuring that S&AMP;T outputs are used in attaining
important macro-economic objectives for the benefit of the
masses. Such benefits include job creation, diversification of
the economy, promotion of exports and protection of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The reform, which will involve the evaluation of S&AMP;T policies,
programs and institutions, is expected to be undertaken during the
next rolling plan.
</P>
<P>
Osotimehin said the preparation of next year's budget is an
opportunity to launch the reform process. He added that there is
a need for science and technology to address the economic needs
of the country rather than scientists being concerned about their
professional competence. "That is important, but we should not
downplay the economic outcome of science and technology," he
said.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO Representative to Nigeria and ECOWAS, Emmanuel Apea,
reiterated at the close of the four-day forum, which began last
Monday, that science and technology should play proper role in
the national efforts for economic growth and national
development.

<HEADLINE> President Jiang Zemin Addresses Fortune Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here this evening that China's future development will
affect both the country and the world and called on foreign
business leaders to participate in China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was speaking at a banquet marking the opening of the '99
Fortune Global Forum in the Shanghai International Convention
Center in Shanghai's flourishing Pudong New Area. The theme of the
three-day forum is "China: the Next 50 Years."
</P>
<P>
Extending warm welcome on behalf the Chinese government and
people to "the friends who come to forum", Jiang said that China
is a large developing socialist country and its future development
will not only directly affect the future of the Chinese people,
but will also have a major impact on the development and progress
of Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
"All you business leaders present tonight are outstanding
achievers in your respective fields. You have a wealth of
successful experiences and strategic vision," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"Since you've set your eyes on China, China welcomes you. China
's modernization drive needs your participation, and China's
economic development will also offer you tremendous opportunities,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 chairmen, presidents and chief executive officers of
multinational companies including General Motors, Ford, Mitsui,
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, are present at the forum, the largest
ever sponsored by the Time-Warner Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed his hope that Chinese enterprises will
learn from the advanced experiences of foreign enterprises. "They
must go out and temper themselves in the winds and storms of
economic globalization, and build up their own competitiveness."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will offer good terms to and create a
better environment for foreign enterprises investing in China," he
promised.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that over the past more than hundred
years, the Chinese people have experienced various vicissitudes of
life. In the course of vigorous struggle they have accomplished a
great historic transformation. Over the past 50 years, New China
has made tremendous development achievements that have drawn
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
"More than 50 years ago, I was attending university in Shanghai,
and was well aware of the poverty, backwardness and weakness of
Old China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was at that time that I decided to devote myself to the
noble cause of building an independent, free, democratic, united,
prosperous and powerful New China. And I have been struggling for
that to this very day."
</P>
<P>
Jiang became mayor of Shanghai 14 years ago, and has
experienced the process of reform, opening-up and modernization in
this China's biggest city.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that all of you have seen with your own eyes the
changes that have been taking place day by day in Shanghai. The
growth of Shanghai presents one aspect of the tremendous changes
taking place throughout China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Chinese people are fully confident
of the country's prospects in the next 50 years at a time when
mankind is about to step into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people will continue to follow firmly and
unswervingly the path of reform and opening-up," Jiang said. "Our
goal is to basically realize modernization by the middle of the
next century, to make China a powerful, democratic and civilized
modern socialist country, and to achieve the great rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese people have always respected
the dignity and value of human beings, insisted on independence,
loved freedom and peace, and treasured national unity.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the world is a colorful one where the people
of all countries follow the path of development they have chosen
and pursue their own ideals. This is an inevitable demand for and
fundamental sign of the progress of human civilization and world
democracy. It is therefore an irresistible historical trend.
</P>
<P>
He said that China believes that the different social systems
and different political beliefs that exist in the world at present
should not be used as obstacles against normal economic and
technological cooperation and exchanges of all kinds.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century and millennium, the initiative for
development lies in the hands of the people of all countries,
Jiang said, and called for the people of all countries to make
joint efforts for the noble cause of promoting peace and
development of mankind.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that China will have an even brighter future
as will the future of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also took the opportunity to express once again
condolences to Taiwan compatriots who have suffered from a series
of severe earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the banquet are Chinese Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Huang Ju and Secretary of the
Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee Zeng Qinghong.
</P>
<P>
This year's forum is the largest in the history of the Fortune
Global Forum. More than 800 delegates from both China and abroad
will attend the meeting. Among the attendants are 300 chairmen,
presidents and chief executive officers of multinational companies
and heads of 200 large Chinese companies, as well as celebrities
from the political and economic circles.
</P>
<P>

the meeting, far exceeding the number in the previous two meetings.
</P>
<P>
The attendants also include more than 40 high-ranking officials
from China's central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
The forum has also attracted nearly 600 journalists from
Chinese and international media.

<HEADLINE> Information Technology Boosts China's Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The fast-growing information
technology has dramatically pushed China's education development
forward, which brought about profound transformation in the
country's education cause, said Chen Zhili, China's minister of
education at the '99 Fortune Global Forum here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Fortune Information Technology Roundtable, Chen
said that with popularization of information technology, China has
established a large group of radio and TV universities, education
TV stations and centers, and established three satellite
educational channels as well as more than 16,000 ground receivers.
</P>
<P>
Educational and multimedia software are widely used in teaching
as well, said the minister, adding that the Chinese education and
research network (CERNET) has so far connected with over 400
universities, and more than 300,000 network users are on line each
day.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that information technology has provided technical
support for the country's distance-learning program. Through radio,
satellite TV and the Internet, China has trained an army of
teachers, and effectively transmitted education courses to islands
and plateaux as well as mountainous regions at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, multimedia and network technology has already caused
major changes in the thinking, philosophy, model, methods and
strategies in the country's education development, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Edward S. Tian, president and chief executive officer of the
China NetCom Corporation, also expressed his views at today's
Fortune Information Technology Roundtable, saying that China will
become a wired country and an on-line nation by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by 2003, there will have had 80 to 100 million
people using computerized information terminals or appliances in
China. Among them there will be 20 million mobile internet
subscribers, 10 million broadband interactive users. China will by
that time have at least five to eight nationwide high speed IP/WDM
backbones in place, and on-line education will become one of the
basic applications, Tian added.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Share prices fell sharply
breaking through the sensitive 2,000-point mark Monday as the
market shrugged off the weekend announcement of a strong hike in
Singapore's August manufacturing output and focused on regional
bourses.
</P>
<P>
Worries over the situation in Indonesia and a possible hike of
U.S. interest rates pushed the benchmark Straits Times Index (STI)
below the 2,000-point level to close at 1,990.38 points with a
loss of 28.63 points.

Total turnover contracted to 186.21 million units valued at
349.25 million Singapore dollars (205.15 million U.S. dollars).
Losers outstripped gainers by 316 to 16, nearly 20 times, with 119

cents to finish at 9.95 Singapore dollars while CityDev sank 35
cents to end at 8.25 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted that the market was under pressure from the start
but fell sharply as the index broke through 2,000 points a little
after the midday break.
</P>
<P>
They said investors were reluctant to initiate fresh moves due
to political uncertainty in Indonesia, the volatile yen and ahead
of a decision on U.S. interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board.

A technical analyst was quoted as saying, "It is going to be

<P>
-- A recent poll showed that a majority of the French people
are individualistic rather than adherents to a strong government.
Seventy-two percent of the French polled by IFOP polling institute

government, and 59 percent support a downsizing of public work
force.
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Ministr is expected to announce on Monday in
Strasbourg, where Socialist deputies are meeting, his measures in

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Re-elected with Over 90 Percent "Yes" Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak has been re-elected with 93.79 percent "Yes" votes in a
referendum on his presidency, the interior minister announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habib el-Adli said on national television that the "Yes" vote
stood at 17,554,856, or 93.79 of the valid votes in the referendum
on Sunday. The "No" vote was 1,162,525, or 6.21 percent, el-Adli
said.
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old sitting president was the only candidate in the
yes-or-no referendum.
</P>
<P>
The turnout was 79.2 percent, or 18.957,893 of the nearly 24
million eligible voters, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the "Yes" vote was less than 95 percent
in a presidential referendum in Egypt. In the past three
referendums, Mubarak got more than 95 percent "Yes" votes.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak became president in 1981 after the former president,
Anwar Sadat, was assassinated by Islamic radicals. He was
re-elected in 1987 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
Under Egypt's constitution, the country does not hold direct,
multi-candidate presidential elections. Instead, the parliament,
People's Assembly, nominates one candidate, and a referendum must
be held to approve the nomination. The parliament dominated by
Mubarak's National Democratic Party nominated him in July.
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 years, Mubarak has pushed forward the peace
process with Israel and carried out a privatization program which
has helped Egypt maintain a more diverse and open economy in the
Middle East.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
governments at all levels, from the central to the local, have
actively led ethnic minority farmers and herdsmen to start capital
construction on farmland and grasslands, and have adopted various
measures to develop the rural economy and improve the agricultural
production level. Through various measures, such as providing free
farm tools and production capital, reducing and exempting
agricultural and animal husbandry taxes, and issuing interest-free
or low-interest loans, the Chinese government has made remarkable
achievements in supporting the rural economic development of the
areas inhabited by minority peoples (see Table 4). In 1998, the
net income per farmer in ethnic minority autonomous areas reached
1,633.11 yuan, or 21.5 times the 1980 figure.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysian Navy
(RMN) Monday took delivery of two Italian-built corvettes.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony was held at the RMN base in Lumut, some 290
kilometers northwest of here, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the ships, RMN Deputy Chief Rear Admiral Mohamed
Hussin Tamby said Malaysia had acquired them with a view to
contributing toward the peace and stability of the Southeast Asian
region.
</P>
<P>
"The purchase should not be construed as part of an arms race
in this region," Bernama quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a maritime nation, Malaysia needed a
well-equipped navy able to discharge its big responsibility of
safeguarding the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
These are the last two of four corvettes ordered by Malaysia
from the Fincantierri-Cantieri Norali Italiana company at a total
cost of 260 million U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Both ships are equipped with sophisticated weapons including
surface to surface missiles, super rapid fire guns as well as
compact naval guns, according to Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The ships measuring 62.3 meters in length and weighing 705 tons
were commissioned by Defense Minister Abang Abu Bakar Mustapha at
the La Spezia Shipyard in Italy on July 31 and will join the
navy's 24th Corvette Squadron.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of White Paper on Minorities Policy (32) Increasing the Momentum of Reform and Opening-Up in Minority Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 Since the adoption of the policy of reform and opening-up by
China at the end of the 1970s, minority areas, like the other
areas throughout the country, have undertaken, along the line of
establishing a socialist market economy system, a series of
reforms concerning rural areas, state-owned enterprises, taxation,
finance, investment, foreign trade, circulation, social security,
and housing. Fundamental changes have taken place in their
economic systems and operational mechanisms; and the level of
marketization and socialization of the local economies have been
remarkably improved. Meanwhile, along with the formation of the
state omni-directional, multi-level and wide-ranging opening
pattern, ethnic minority areas have brought into full play their
respective advantages of lying along the coasts, the rivers and
the country's borders to actively develop border trade and foreign
economic and technological cooperation; and their opening to the
outside world has entered a new stage. Their status and role in
the nation's overall opening pattern is also becoming daily more
pronounced.
</P>
<P>
 Since the end of the 1970s, while adopting various
preferential policies, such as extending financial subsidies to
minority areas and establishing development funds, the state has
encouraged minority areas to actively start the introduction of
foreign investment and technology and domestic cooperation, and
develop border trade according to local circumstances. It has
supported minority areas in their efforts to promote the
readjustment of their social and economic structures, and
strengthen their self-development ability through active and
stable reform measures.

 In the early 1980s, the Central Government decided on two
policies toward Tibet that would not be changed for a long time to
come -- ``The land will be used by households, and will be managed
by them on their own,'' and ``livestock will be owned, raised and
managed by households on their own'' --and offered exemption from
taxes to farmers, thus greatly rousing the enthusiasm for
production of the farmers and herdsmen, who make up over 80
percent of the total population of Tibet, and resulting in bumper
harvests in agricultural production year after year. In 1998, the
total grain output of the Tibet Autonomous Region stood at 850,000
tons, or 5.6 times the 1959 figure. To further improve the
conditions for agricultural and animal husbandry production, in
the 1990s the state has invested more than two billion yuan to
comprehensively develop and improve the agricultural
infrastructure facilities in the valleys of the Yarlungzangbo,
Lhasa and Nyangqu rivers. It is planned that 40 projects will be
constructed. After the completion of these projects, 45.6 percent
of the existing cultivated area in Tibet will benefit from them.
Thanks to the support of the state, since 1989 the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has completed the first and second phases of
comprehensive agricultural development in the Hetao Irrigated Area,
reclaimed 40,000 ha of wasteland, and ameliorated more than 100,
000 ha of medium- and low-yield fields, enabling an additional
production capacity of nearly 400 million kg of grain *(10).
</P>
<P>
 To accelerate the development of ethnic townships, in 1993
the Chinese government formulated the Regulations on the
Administrative Work of Ethnic Townships, specifying that the
governments at higher levels should adopt special policies and
measures concerning finance, banking, taxation, the construction
of infrastructure facilities, and other fields to help ethnic
townships to develop their economies. During the Eighth Five-Year
Plan period (1991-1995), the Chinese government offered discount-
interest loans totaling 100 million yuan every year to assist
minority areas in developing township enterprises.

 In 1987, the state defined that places with right conditions
in border minority areas should be selected to learn the
international experiences of setting up inland development zones
and border free trade zones, to speed up the opening there. To
enliven economy in border areas, bring prosperity to border
residents and promote economic and trade cooperation with adjacent
countries, the state decided, in 1992, further to open a number of
inland border cities with large minority populations, including
Manzhouli and Erlianhot of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,
Hunchun of Jilin Province, Yining, Bole and Tacheng of the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and Pingxiang and Dongxing of
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. In 1993, the state selected
seven ethnic localities--Hulun Buir League, Wuhai City, Yanbian
Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Southeast Guizhou Miao-Dong
Autonomous Prefecture, Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture, Golmud
City, and Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture, as areas for pilot
projects for reform and opening-up.

<P>
In the 1980s, Beihai City in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region was listed as one of the country's 14 coastal open cities
and another one city and five counties were named as national
coastal economic open zones; Urumqi, Nanning, Kunming, Hohhot,
Yinchuan, Xining, Guiyang and other capital cities of ethnic
minority autonomous regions and provinces which have fairly large
minority populations were listed as inland open cities; the state
also gave approval to Guilin, Nanning, Urumqi and Baotou cities,
which are four large and medium-sized cities in minority areas, to
establish new- and high-tech industrial development zones.

Preferential Financial Policies for Minority Areas
</P>
<P>
 The state set up ``ethnic region subsidies'' in 1955, and the
Flexible Ethnic Region Fund in 1964, and adopted the preferential
financial policy of raising the proportion of the financial
reserve fund of the ethnic regions to help minority areas develop
their economies and improve the local people's livelihoods.
According to statistics, in terms of the above-mentioned three
preferential policies, the state had offered 16.8 billion yuan of
subsidies to minority areas by 1998. Since 1980, the central
financial authorities have adopted a quota subsidy system for the
five autonomous regions and the three provinces with large ethnic
minority populations--Guizhou, Yunnan and Qinghai. The above-
mentioned three preferential policies have also been included in
the quota subsidy system. From 1980 to 1998, the autonomous areas
received more than 140 billion yuan of quota subsidies from the
central financial authorities. In 1980, the state set up a fund to
aid the development of economically underdeveloped areas, of which
a large part was used in minority areas. In 1986 the state set up
the help-the-poor discount-interest loan and capital for providing
employment as a form of relief, of which a large proportion was
used in minority areas. In 1994 China began to reform the ``
revenue-sharing-scheme'' financial management system. In the
meantime, all the original subsidies and special financial
allocation policies for minority areas were preserved. With
respect to the transfer payment method for the transition period
which China adopted in 1995, the state specially added the policy-
related transfer-payment contents for the five autonomous regions,
including Tibet, and the autonomous prefectures in Yunnan, Guizhou,
Qinghai and other provinces, offering preferential policies to the
ethnic minority areas. The policy-related transfer-payment sum has
constantly increased along with the growth of the state's
financial capacity. In 1998 the ordinary transfer-payment sum by
the central authorities to the five autonomous regions and Guizhou,
Yunnan and Qinghai provinces where ethnic minorities are fairly
concentrated was nearly 2.9 billion yuan, making up 48 percent of
the nation's total transfer-payment sum.

 So far, Xinjiang has established stable economic and trade
relations with more than 70 countries and regions worldwide. From
1992 to 1997, Xinjiang's total import and export volume reached 6.
99 billion US dollars, with an average annual growth rate of 21.1
percent. The six open cities, the economic and technological
development zones, and the border economic cooperation zones in
Xinjiang have made great achievements in construction and
investment solicitation. Xinjiang has opened 15 trading ports, and
the completion of the multiple tracking of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang
Railway and the opening of the second Euro-Asia Continental Bridge
has resulted in the basic formation of a modernized northwest
international thoroughfare.

 Since Guangxi adopted the policy of opening to the outside

loans from foreign governments), or 6.6 times the figure of the
Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-1990). By the end of 1997,
Guangxi had accumulatively approved 8,505 foreign-invested
projects, involving 13.79 billion US dollars of contracted foreign
capital, and had actually utilized 6.71 billion US dollars of
foreign capital. So far, more than 30 countries and regions have
invested in Guangxi. *(11)

Encouraging the Development of Trade in Minority Areas and
Guaranteeing the Production of Articles Used by Minority Peoples
</P>
<P>
 The state adopts preferential policies toward ethnic trade.
For instance, since 1963 it has adopted a threefold policy in this
regard. This ensures a portion of reserved profits, self-owned
capital and price subsidies for minority peoples. To respect the
folkways, customs and religious beliefs of ethnic minorities and
satisfy their needs for special articles of daily use, the state
guarantees the production of more than 4,000 varieties of ethnic
articles, which fall into 16 categories, such as garments, shoes,
hats, furniture, silks and satins, foodstuff, production tools,
handicrafts, ornaments and musical instruments. It has also
extended some preferential policies, such as setting up special
production bases, giving priority to the guarantee of production
capital and the supply of raw and processed materials, reduction
of and exemption from taxes, low-interest loans, transportation
subsidies, etc.

 Since 1991, in light of the new situation of reform and
opening-up, the state has made appropriate readjustments in the
preferential policies concerning ethnic trade and the production
of ethnic articles for daily use. During the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995), the state offered preferential treatment to
commercial, supply and marketing and pharmaceuticals enterprises
and more than 2,300 designated enterprises for producing ethnic
articles for daily use in the 426 designated ethnic trade counties
in terms of credits, investment, taxation and the supply of
commodities, and offered special discount-interest loans for the
construction of an ethnic trade network and the technological
transformation of designated enterprises for producing ethnic
articles for daily use. As part of a new package of preferential
policies offered for the same purpose by the state in June 1997,
the People's Bank of China will offer 100 million yuan in a
discount-interest loan a year during the Ninth Five-Year Plan
period (1996-2000) for the construction of an ethnic trade network
and the technological transformation of the designated enterprises
for producing ethnic articles for daily use, and the state-owned
ethnic trade enterprises and grass-roots supply and marketing
cooperatives below the county level (excluding the county) shall
be exempt from value-added tax.
Helping Impoverished Minority Areas Get Rid of Poverty
</P>
<P>
 Although the minority people's life has witnessed tremendous
improvement since the founding of the People's Republic of China,
restricted by geographical conditions, a low social development
level, bad production conditions, and lack of scientific,
technological and cultural knowledge, western China, where
minority peoples live in concentrated communities, is relatively
backward as compared with the coastal areas in eastern China. In
some minority areas, production and living conditions are fairly
difficult, and the basic needs of some people are not assured.
Since the mid-1980s, when China started a large-scale help-the-
poor drive in an organized and planned way, the state has always
attached importance to helping the minority peoples and minority
areas.

<HEADLINE> Air Raids to Continue on Chechnya, Says Russian Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Strikes will be made until the last gangster is destroyed,"
the minister said after a meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir
Putin, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The conference was also attended by First Deputy Prime Minister
Nikolai Aksyonenko, Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov, Interior
Minister Vladimir Rushailo and Federal Security Service Director
Nikolai Patrushev.
</P>
<P>
The officials discussed the mounting flow of refugees from
Chechnya since federal airplanes started bombing raids four days
ago, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Russian media reported that thousands of refugees have fled to
the neighboring republics of Daghestan and Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
Rebel bases, arms depots, oil refineries, mobile communications
and television transmission facilities were among the targets of
the air raids. The radar at the Grozny airport and an AN-2
airplane, the only one functioning in Chechnya, were destroyed in
the first day of bombing.
</P>
<P>
In a newspaper interview published Monday, Prime Minister Putin
said Russian authorities are prepared to hold talks with Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov, who is the legitimate leader of
Chechnya, provided that he denounces international terrorism and
sends his condolences in connection with those civilian deaths
which occurred in several Russian cities due to terrorist
explosions.
</P>
<P>
Putin was referring to several apartment building blasts in
Moscow and two other Russian cities that killed more than 300
people. Chechnya-based Islamic militants, with support from abroad,
are believed to be behind the explosions.
</P>
<P>
He said fighting terrorism is Russia's overriding goal. "Before
we deal with this, we cannot succeed in anything in the economy or
politics."

 During the help-the-poor efforts in the past decade or so,
poverty-stricken minority areas have enjoyed the preferential help-
the-poor policy offered by the Chinese government to other poverty-
stricken areas, as well as a series of special policies formulated
by the state: (1) Expanding the sphere of aiding the minority
areas. In 1986, when identifying the most seriously poverty-
stricken counties for the first time, the state raised the
national unified standard for per capita subsidies in poverty-
stricken counties from 150 yuan a year in 1985 to 200 yuan for
ethnic minority autonomous counties, and 300 yuan for pastoral
areas and certain other counties in minority areas. Of the 331
most seriously poverty-stricken counties designated at that time,
141 were inhabited by minority peoples, making up 42.6 percent of
the total. At the start of the State Seven-Year Priority Poverty
Alleviation Program (a program designated to lift 80 million
people out of absolute poverty in a period of seven years from
1994 to 2000) in 1994, China readjusted the plan for the state's
key poverty alleviation counties, and decided that 592 counties be
the state's key poverty alleviation counties, of which 257 were
ethnic minority counties, making up 43.4 percent. (2) Giving
priority to poverty-stricken ethnic minority counties in terms of
the distribution of help-the-poor capital and materials. While
distributing the help-the-poor capital and materials, the Chinese
government put the five autonomous regions on the same footing as
western China, placing them all on the priority list. Some
provinces and autonomous regions allocate special funds to help
the poverty-stricken ethnic minority counties while distributing
the help-the-poor funds. According to incomplete statistics, from
1996 to 1998 the state allocated 16.95 billion yuan from the
Central Government's help-the-poor funds to the 257 poverty-
stricken ethnic minority counties, making up 45 percent of the
total.

 To improve the quality of the ethnic minority population and
accelerate the economic and social development of the ethnic
minority autonomous areas, the people's congresses of these areas
have formulated their own family planning policies toward the
ethnic minorities in light of the spirit of the state's
regulations concerning the need also for minority peoples to
practice family planning. These policies are more lenient than
those with the Han people. Under these policies, an ethnic
minority family generally may have two or three children; in
border areas and areas with adverse geographical conditions,
families of ethnic minorities with very small populations may have
more than three children each; and Tibetan farmers and herdsmen in
the Tibet Autonomous Region may have as many children as they like.
As a result, ethnic minority populations have been able to
increase at a higher rate than the rest of the population. The
population of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang was 4.54 million,
according to the first national census, taken in 1953, and it
increased to 9.46 million in the fourth census, taken in 1990. By
1998, the total population of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang was 10.
4601 million, accounting for 62 percent of the total population of
the autonomous region. In 1952, the Tibetan local government,
headed by the 14th Dalai Lama, reported to the Central Government
that the population of Tibet was one million. By the end of 1998,
the population of Tibet had increased to 2.52 million, of which
the increase of Tibetan population was 1.2 million. At present,
the Tibetan population accounts for 94 percent of the total
population of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of White Paper on Minorities Policy (41) Helping the Minority Areas to Develop Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 Education among national minorities is an important part of
the education of China. The development of education among
national minorities is of paramount importance to the improvement
of the quality of the minority population and the promotion of
economic and cultural development in ethnic minority areas. In
conformity with the needs of the modernization drive and the
policies of educational development, the state persists in
proceeding from the characteristics of minority peoples and the
reality of minority areas and gives active support and assistance
to minority peoples in their efforts for educational development.
</P>
<P>
 The state has adopted many policies and measures to support
the development of education among minority peoples. For instance,
it respects the autonomous areas' right to develop ethnic
education on their own, attaches importance to teaching in
minority languages and bilingual teaching, strengthens the
building of the ranks of minority teachers, offers special care in
terms of funds, runs ethnic institutes, schools and classes that
enroll students for future service in specific areas or units,
actively starts counterpart educational support between inland
provinces and municipalities and minority areas, and mobilizes the
whole nation to support education in Tibet.

 The state has paid great attention to promoting universal
compulsory education in poverty-stricken areas, especially poverty-
stricken ethnic minority areas. In 1993, the relevant government
departments proposed that counterpart support and cooperation
between the economically and educationally advanced provinces and
municipalities and the 143 poverty-stricken ethnic minority
counties under government supervision should be started, and
defined the cooperative relations and the main tasks of helping
the poor through education. The Ministry of Education and the
Ministry of Finance jointly organized the implementation of the
state's compulsory education project for the poverty-stricken
areas. In accordance with the project's plan, between 1995 and
2000, the central authorities will invest 3.9 billion yuan into
this project, which will exceed 10 billion yuan if the supporting
capital to be contributed by local authorities is added to it. The
launching of this project will play an important role in promoting
the popularization of compulsory education in poverty-stricken
ethnic minority areas. The state encourages people to help
minority areas to develop basic education through the ``Hope
Project'' and other forms. For instance, the Western Hunan Tujia-
Miao Autonomous Prefecture has founded 136 Hope primary schools,
thus enabling tens of thousands of poverty-stricken minority
children to attend school.

 The state itself runs a number of ethnic institutes and
schools. By the end of 1998, the state had independently founded
12 ethnic universities and institutes, 59 ethnic teachers'
training schools, 158 ethnic secondary vocational schools, 3,536
ethnic middle schools, and 20,906 ethnic primary schools. Ethnic
institutions of higher learning and ordinary higher educational
institutions, secondary specialized schools and adult institutions
of high learning conduct quite a number of preparatory classes for
minority peoples. In 1998, more than 80 institutions of higher
learning in China held such classes, with a planned enrollment of
7,142 students. Preparatory education has played a great role in
improving minority students' basic cultural knowledge, and
enabling more minority students to continue their studies at
secondary and higher specialized schools. It has become a unique
way of developing education geared to the needs of minority
students.
V. Preservation and Development of the Cultures of Ethnic
Minorities
</P>
<P>
 China's ethnic minorities have formed their unique cultures
in the long process of historical development. China respects and
preserves the traditional cultures of ethnic minorities, and all
of the minority peoples are free to maintain and develop their own
cultures.
</P>
<P>
 Respecting the Folkways and Customs of Minority Peoples
</P>
<P>
 The various ethnic minority groups in China differ widely in
their folkways and customs. They have different modes of
production and life styles, as displayed in dress and adornments,
diet, residences, marriage, etiquette and funerals. The minority
peoples have the right to retain or change their folkways and
customs, which are respected by the state. The government protects
such rights in every aspect of social life.

This was a second launch with a Proton after a July 5 crash
that prompted a suspension of the use of Protons. The first such
launch on September 6 put two Yamal-100 communication satellites
into orbit.
</P>
<P>
Proton-K rockets will be used without restrictions because
experts have agreed that the error which was responsible for the
July 5 crash will never occur again, Interfax said, quoting an
official in the state-run Khrunichev company which makes Protons.

The LMI-1 is owned by the Russian-U.S. joint venture Lockheed
Martin Intersputnik. It was manufactured by the Lockheed Martin
Missiles &AMP; Space company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Contracts on the use of most of the LMI-1's channels have been
signed. In particular, Rostelekom has rented 25 transmitters which
will relay signals to a network of 26-30 ground stations providing
communication services to remote parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Other channels will serve other users in Russia, other member
nations of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Eastern Europe,
South and Southeast Asia and parts of Africa and the Middle East.

 In China, about ten minority peoples have the tradition of
eating Muslim food. Taking this into consideration, the state has
established Muslim canteens or supplies Muslim food in state
organs, schools, enterprises and institutions. In some work units
where people eating Muslim food are few, Muslim canteens are
jointly established by several units or Muslim food is specially
prepared. Muslim food and beverage shops can be found in places
where Muslim ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities.
In cities, communication hubs, restaurants, hotels and hospitals,
and on trains, ships and airplanes, Muslim catering is provided.
The state stipulates that ``Muslim food'' must be marked on beef
and mutton sold to ethnic minorities who eat Muslim food at all
the stages of slaughtering, packaging, transporting, processing
and selling. In large and medium-sized cities where there are
large numbers of ethnic minority people who eat Muslim food, the
relevant state departments have established special beef and
mutton wholesale departments or retail shops and given them
preferential treatment.

A national planning section and office have been established by
the state to organize the editing and publishing of ancient books
of ethnic minorities. Currently, about 25 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities, 130 autonomous prefectures,
prefectures and leagues and other minority areas, and some ethnic
colleges and schools have established institutions for the same

Beginning in the early 1950s, governments at various levels and
culture and arts departments have organized tens of thousands of
experts in anthropology, sociology and ethnology, and writers and
artists to collect and preserve traditional folk cultures and arts
in regions where minority peoples live. At the beginning of the
1980s, the Chinese government put in much capital and efforts into

<HEADLINE> Jordan Studying Hamas Request on Detained Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordan is studying a request
from the militant Palestinian group Hamas' leadership in Gaza to
avoid the trial of Hamas members arrested during a month-long
clampdown in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Majali said the government has not
responded to the Hamas request, but Jordan hoped to see "a calming
down and not a escalation of the situation" following the roundup
of 21 Hamas members and supporters in Jordan, including its
political chief Khalid Mishaal and spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leadership in Gaza hoped to send a delegation to
Amman to discuss issue, requesting a mutual solution to avoid the
trial of its members, who had been charged with engaging in
illegal political activities in Jordan, the semiofficial Jordan
Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or the Islamic Resistance Movement, is known as a
militant Palestinian organization that opposes the peace process
between Israel and the Palestinians, and stands for a holy war to
liberate all occupied Palestinian territories to establish a
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
The radical group was responsible for several deadly attacks on
Israelis in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has long tolerated the activities of Hamas on its soil
because of its many sympathizers in the small kingdom, which
accommodates millions of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, police closed the Hamas office in Amman in a surprise
move on August 30 and arrested 15 of its members and supporters
during a month-long crackdown on the movement.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the Jordanian police also detained Mishaal and
Ghosheh upon their arrival in Amman from Iran.
</P>
<P>
The police action seemed to be a preemptive measure at a time
when Israel and the Palestinians are making progress in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The arrested Hamas members were also charged with illegal
possession of weapons and conducting anti-Israeli military
practices in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they will face a one-year prison term in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The State Security Court, responsible for investigating the
Hamas issue, has not yet responded to a request by the lawyer of
the arrested Hamas leaders to release them on bail, Jordan Times
said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh Armouti, chief defense lawyer of the 21 arrested Hamas
members said he believed parties concerned seemed to be seeking a
political solution to the case.

The state and relevant departments devote great efforts to
fostering literary and artistic talents among the minority peoples,
and promoting the creation of literature and art by setting up
literature and art organizations, art institutes and schools,
cultural centers and mass art centers. In the early 1950s, the
national-level Central Ethnic Song and Dance Ensemble was
established in Beijing. It is composed of performers from various
ethnic groups, and performs ethnic songs and dances of its own
creation both in China and abroad. To date, in autonomous areas,
there are 534 art troupes, 194 sites for art performances, 661
libraries, 82 mass art centers, 679 cultural centers, 7,318
culture-dissemination stations and 155 museums. Furthermore, there
are 24 art colleges and secondary-level art schools in the five
autonomous regions and Yunnan, Guizhou and Jilin provinces
specially for fostering artistically talented people among China's
ethnic minorities.

 The ``Twelve Mukams'' opera, a classical musical treasure of
the Uygur people, which was on the verge of being lost, has been
preserved. At the end of the 1940s, only two or three elderly
musicians could sing it completely. But now it is flourishing,
since the Mukam Art Troupe and Mukam Research Office have been
established in Xinjiang. In addition, Tibetan opera, which has a
history of over 500 years, is well preserved and flourishing.
Every year, it is included in the Shoton Festival, together with
other singing, dancing and drama performances.

 Promoting Ethnic Minorities'Cultural and Arts Undertakings
</P>
<P>
The state regularly conducts the competition for the ``Peacock
Award'' for ethnic minorities' music, dance and drama and the ``
Stallion Award'' for films, television programs and literary works
dealing with minority peoples. Beginning in 1992, the state
started to carry out the ``Long Cultural Corridor Construction in
the Nation's Border Areas'' projects in nine autonomous regions
and provinces where minority peoples are concentrated, including
Guangxi, Yunnan, Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang and
Jilin. In the past few years, governments at various levels have
also put large amounts of funds into the construction of many
cultural infrastructure facilities, which have improved and
enriched the cultural life of more than ten million ethnic
minority people.
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade or more, ethnic minority culture and art
troupes have extended their exchanges with the outside world, and
over 100 of them, national and local, have performed in other
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
 The ranks of ethnic minority writers are continuously growing.
A large number of such writers have come to the fore and created a
great number of literary works. Nearly 600 writers belonging to
ethnic minorities are members of the Chinese Writers' Association,
constituting more than 10 percent of its total membership.

The arts and handicrafts of minority peoples are a splendid
legacy. The mural art of the Tibetans is continuously enriched
with contents depicting the development history of the Tibetan
ethnic group and the new lives of the Tibetan people. The Tibetan
art of scroll painting, or Tangka, is well preserved. The carpets
and wall hangings made by the Uygur and Mongolian peoples are very
popular on the Chinese and overseas markets. The wax-printing art
of the Bouyei, Miao, Yao and Gelo ethnic groups is growing in
popularity, with great improvement in designs, patterns and
varieties. And the brocade technique of the Tujia, Zhuang, Dai, Li
and Dong ethnic groups has developed from small-scale family
workshops to today's brocade mills, whose production scale has
been on the increase.
</P>
<P>
 Preserving and Developing the Traditional Medicine of Ethnic
Minorities
</P>
<P>
The state has made great efforts to foster medical specialists
for minority peoples. It has established medical colleges and
universities of Tibetan, Mongolian and Uygur medicine in the Tibet,
Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang autonomous regions, respectively,
which have trained 2,531 specialists. Of them, more than 500 have
been trained by the Tibet College of Tibetan Medicine, founded
nearly ten years ago. Nowadays, there are 127 hospitals of ethnic
minority medicine all over the country, of which 52 are Tibetan
medicine hospitals, 41 are Mongolian medicine hospitals, 26 are
Uygur medicine hospitals and eight specialize in the traditional
medicine of other minority groups. Also, the state has provided
active support for the development and application of ethnic
minority traditional medicine. In 1992, the state gave permission
for the setting up of centers for making Mongolian, Tibetan and
Uygur pharmaceutical preparations. They manufacture more than ten
kinds of pharmaceutical preparations and over 100 kinds of
traditional medicines with the combination of traditional and
modern expertise.

Fifty years of experience have proved that the policies toward
ethnic minorities of the People's Republic of China are successful
ones. China has blazed a correct way for handling ethnic problems
and realizing the common prosperity of the various ethnic groups
in conformity with China's reality. In the meantime, however, the
Chinese government is well aware of the fact that, due to the
restrictions and influences of historical, physical, geographical
and other factors, central and western China, where most ethnic
minority people live, lags far behind the eastern coastal areas in
development. In some ethnic minority areas, the people are
inadequately fed and clothed, and while in some other areas
sustained development has been adversely affected by poor
production conditions. The Chinese government attaches great
importance to these problems, and is taking measures to solve them.
The Chinese government is convinced that, as the reform, opening-
up and modernization drive develop, the various ethnic groups of
China will develop in a still more rapid and healthy way, and the
relations between ethnic groups marked by equality, unity and
mutual help are certain to be further consolidated and developed
in the coming 21st century.

The traditional sports of ethnic minorities originate from the
daily life of the people and are rich in content and form, and
have distinct characteristics and a long history. They call for
skill of a high order, and most of them are accompanied with music,
or singing and dancing. They include horse racing, archery, sheep-
chasing on horseback, wrestling, swinging, springboard jumping,
dragon-boat racing and mountaineering. Physical culture and sports
institutions have been established in the various autonomous areas
to train people in ethnic sports, develop traditional ethnic and
modern sports activities and improve the health of minority
peoples. To date, more than 290 kinds of traditional ethnic sports
have been revived. In 1953, the first traditional ethnic sports
show and competition was held in Tianjin, known as the First
National Traditional Ethnic Minority Sports Meet. Beginning in
1982, such meets have been held every four years, and the sixth
one is being held in Beijing in September 1999, with some contests
held in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
Throughout the country, there are 25 provinces, autonomous regions
and municipalities that hold traditional ethnic minority sports
meets every four years.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Receives over 90 Percent "Yes" Votes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian sitting President
Hosni Mubarak received more than 90 percent "yes" votes in the
Sunday's referendum on his re-election, the interior minister said
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Habib el-Adli visited Mubarak early in the day and briefed him
on the outcome of the referendum on the parliament nomination of
Mubarak for a new six-year term, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
El-Adli told the president that he got 93.79 percent "yes"
votes, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the meeting that he will announce the
details of the referendum later in the day.
</P>
<P>
The poll started at 8:00 local time (0500 GMT) Sunday and ended
at 17:00 (14:00 GMT). Egypt set up 40,907 polling stations in 26
governorates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In the past referendums, Mubarak received more than 95 percent
"yes" votes.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's constitution does not allow for a direct presidential
election. Instead, the parliament, the People's Assembly,
nominates one candidate for the presidency. A referendum must then
be held to endorse the nomination.
</P>
<P>
The parliament, which is dominated by Mubarak's National
Democratic Party, chose him for a fourth six-year term in
July. The voters are asked to say "yes" or "no" to the nominee.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was first elected president in 1981 after former
President Anwar Sadat was assassinated. He was re-elected in 1987
and 1993.
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 years, he has pushed forward the Arab-Israel
peace process and carried out an economic reform program which has
helped Egypt maintain one of the best economic performances in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 24 million people in the country of a population of 64
million are eligible voters.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China claimed here today
that the household telephone penetration rate is expected to rise
from 12 percent at present to 22 percent and the fixed line users
will increase from 100 million to around 180 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, Minister of Information Industry, said today at the
Information Technology Round Table of '99 Fortune Global Forum
that the main expansion areas of the household telephones will be
the vast rural areas and the western region.
</P>
<P>
He added that the mobile phone users will increase from 36

In 2003, China will witness about 20 million Internet users, up
from 4 million today.
</P>
<P>
To reach these goals, he said, the country will have a
constitutional framework for introducing competition mechanism and
opening the telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that China will build an equal, fair, transparent
and orderly competitive market while building a flexible pricing
system that will benefit the country, the companies and the
individuals as well.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan said, China will also incorporate effective
international management principles into the country's
telecommunications industry, including the public offerings of
telecommunications companies, in order to enter the global
financial market.
</P>
<P>
Chairmen and CEOs of the world IT giants as Dell Computer

<HEADLINE> - Mayon Evacuees Wary of Going Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The erratic character of Mt.
Mayon in the central Philippines scares many residents near and
around it, but evacuees are thinking of going back home,
Philippine News Agency(PNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At least 3,000 people fled their homes last week after the
volcano exploded for the second time in three months, the PNA
said.
</P>
<P>
Local government was quoted as saying its emergency funds will
not last for weeks feeding the evacuees but its officials could
not send them back home because of the risks.
</P>
<P>
"Nor could we turn down those who wanted to stay in evacuation
centers," said Governor Al Bichara of Albay province, where the
Mt. Mayon lies.
</P>
<P>
The risk is doubled specially during the rainy season since
disaster experts fear heavy rains might trigger an avalanche of
volcanic debris deposited up the Mayon's slopes.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(Phivolcs) has maintained a level Alert 2 Status on the Mayon.
</P>
<P>
Phivolcs expert Ed Laguerta said the volcano might just be
cleaning up debris of its past eruptions for a stronger blast.
</P>
<P>
The Mayon's first eruption this year was June 22, followed by
another one on September 22.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Philippine Vice President Gloria Arroyo visited
three evacuation centers in the province and released some 1 mill
ion pesos (25,000 U.S. dollars) for the continued construction of
the Mayon Rehabilitation Center.
</P>
<P>
Arroyo, concurrent secretary of social services and
development, said her department is ready should the Mayon assume
a violent character.

<HEADLINE> China Releases White Paper on Minorities Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 20,000-Chinese-word paper, entitled "National Minorities
Policy and its Practice in China", was released by the Information
Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
It is made up of five parts, with the following headings: a
united multi-ethnic country, adherence to equality and unity among
ethnic groups, regional autonomy for ethnic minorities, promoting
the common development of all ethnic groups, and preservation and
development of the cultures of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
The paper goes over the history and progress of the country's
55 minorities groups, which account for 8.98 percent of the 1.2
billion population, and reviews the central government's policies
in handling issues concerning ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
"China has blazed a correct way for handling ethnic problems
and realizing the common prosperity of the various ethnic groups
in conformity with China's reality," the paper says.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper adds, due to the restrictions and influences
of historical and geographical factors, central and western China,
where most ethnic minority people live, lags far behind the
eastern coastal areas in development.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government attaches great importance to these
problems, and is taking measures to solve them."
</P>

drive develops, various ethnic groups of China will develop in a
still more rapid and healthy way, and relations between ethnic
groups marked by equality, unity and mutual help are certain to be
further consolidated and promoted in the coming 21st century.

percent leap in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Domain names registered in the ".nz" space leapt 81 percent to

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Groups Enjoy Equality, Unity and Mutual Assistance, Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China is a united multi-
ethnic state, where all ethnic groups enjoy equality, unity and
mutual assistance, according to a white paper released here today.
</P>
<P>
The paper, entitled "National Minorities Policy and its
Practice in China", was released by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, there are 56 ethnic groups identified
and confirmed by the Central Government. As the majority of the
population belongs to the Han ethnic group, China's other 55
ethnic groups are customarily referred to as the national
minorities.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey conducted in 1995 showed that 108.46 million
people belonged to minority ethnic groups, accounting for 8.98
percent of China's total population of over 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
The country's ethnic groups live together over vast areas.
Minority peoples are mainly concentrated in provinces and
autonomous regions such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia,
Guangxi, Tibet, Yunnan, Guizhou and Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu,
Liaoning, Jilin, Hunan, Hubei, Hainan and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"China has been a united multi-ethnic country since ancient
times," the paper notes.
</P>
<P>
"During the long process of unification, economic and cultural
exchanges brought the people of all ethnic groups in China close
together, giving shape to a relationship of interdependence,
mutual promotion and mutual development among them and
contributing to the creation and development of the Chinese
civilization," it says.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the central governments of the various periods each had a sequence
of policies and systems of its own concerning ethnic affairs.
</P>
<P>
"But under them all, whether set up by the Han people or by
ethnic minorities, there was no equality to speak of among ethnic
groups," the paper notes.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of the People's Republic of China opened up a new
era in which all ethnic groups in China enjoy equality, unity and
mutual assistance," it says.
</P>
<P>
In the big, united family of ethnic groups in China, the people
of all ethnic groups unite of their own accord for mutual
promotion and common development, and dedicate to the building of
a strong, prosperous, democratic and civilized New China, it notes.

<HEADLINE> China Adheres to Ethnic Equality and Unity, Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper, entitled "National Minorities Policy and Its
Practice in China", was released by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
In China, every ethnic group, regardless of their population
size, their level of economic and social development, customs and
religious beliefs, enjoys the same rights and performing the same
duties in every aspect of political and social life, the paper
says.
</P>
<P>
"Equality and unity among ethnic groups as the basic principle
and policy for resolving ethnic problems have been clearly defined
in the Constitution and relevant laws," it notes.
</P>
<P>
The government has adopted special policies and measures to
effectively realize and guarantee the right to equality among all
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In China, the minority and Han peoples participate as equals in
the management of affairs of the state and local governments, and
rights of the minority ethnic groups are especially guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
For instance, 428 deputies elected to the Ninth National People
's Congress were from ethnic minorities, accounting for 14.37
percent of the total, which was about five percentage points
higher than the proportion of their total population in the nation
's total population at the time.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also formulated policies to ensure
respect for and safeguard freedom of religious belief for ethnic
minorities and guarantee all normal religious activities of ethnic
minority citizens, the paper notes.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 30,000 mosques in China, of
which 23,000 are in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In Tibet
there are over 1,700 places for Tibetan-Buddhism activities, it
says.
</P>
<P>
All ethnic groups in China also have the freedom and right to
use and develop their own spoken and written languages. Of the 55
national minorities, except the Hui and Manchu who use the Chinese
language, 53 have their own languages.

<HEADLINE> Regional Autonomy, Important Part of China's Political System, Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper, entitled "National Minorities Policy and Its
Practice in China", was released by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
"Regional autonomy for ethnic minorities means that under the
unified leadership of the state, regional autonomy is practiced in
areas where people of ethnic minorities live in concentrated
communities.
</P>
<P>
In these areas, organs of self-government are established for
the exercise of autonomy and for people of ethnic minorities to
become masters of their own areas and manage the internal affairs
of their own regions," the paper says.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, five autonomous regions, 30 autonomous
prefectures and 120 autonomous counties (banners) have been
established, as well as 1,256 ethnic townships.
</P>
<P>
Among the 55 ethnic minorities, 44 have their own autonomous
areas, with a population of 75 percent of the total of the ethnic
minorities and an area of 64 percent of the area of the whole
country.
</P>
<P>
"Regional autonomy for ethnic minorities conforms with the
national interests and the fundamental interests of the people of
all ethnic groups in China," the paper says.
</P>
<P>
"The practice of regional autonomy not only ensures the rights
of the ethnic minorities to exercise autonomy as masters of their
own homelands, but also upholds the unification of the state."
</P>
<P>
It enhances the combination of state policies and principles
and the concrete conditions of the ethnic minority areas and the
integrated development of the state and the ethnic minorities, the
better for each to give free rein to its own advantages, it says.
</P>
<P>
While exercising the functions and powers of local organs of
the state, organs of self-government in autonomous areas at the
same time exercise other functions and powers as stipulated by the
Constitution and the Law on Ethnic Regional Autonomy, the paper
notes.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Common Development of All Ethnic Groups, Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper, entitled "National Minorities Policy and Its
Practice in China", was released by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
country's minority areas developed in a very slow pace. Some areas
still remained in the primitive "slash-and-burn" stage of
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, the state has spared no effort to
promote the common development and progress of all ethnic groups
of the country, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The state has worked out and adopted a series of policies and
measures to assist these areas in developing their economies, and
mobilize and organize the developed areas where Han people live to
support them.
</P>
<P>
"Especially along with the constant deepening of China's reform
and opening to the outside world in recent years, the state has
increased its investments in minority areas to speed up their pace
of opening up, thus making the minority areas show new vitality
for economic development," the paper stresses.
</P>
<P>
The document notes that the state has shown great concern for
infrastructure facilities construction and basic industries
development in minority areas, giving priority to the arrangement
of water conservatory, power and communication.
</P>
<P>
A preferential policy on investment has also been adopted by
the state so as to divert more foreign investments to those areas,
it says.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, of the total increased financial investment by the
state, 62 percent was used in central and western China, and the
investment made by the central authorities in fixed assets in
central and western China increased by 31.2 percent, or 14.9
percentage points higher than in eastern China and the highest
figure since the founding of New China.
</P>
<P>
"These policies and measures have greatly promoted the economic
development of ethnic minority areas," the paper notes.
</P>
<P>
Though the minority people's life has witnessed tremendous
improvement over the past 50 years, the paper also notes that
western China, where minority peoples live in concentrated
communities, is still relatively backward compared with the
coastal areas in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-1980s, when China started a large-scale help-the-
poor drive, the state has always attached importance to helping
the minority peoples and minority areas, it says.

<HEADLINE> China Preserves and Develops Ethnic Cultures, Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper, entitled "National Minorities Policy and Its
Practice in China", was released by the Information Office of the
State Council.
</P>
<P>
China's various ethnic minority groups differ widely in their
folkways and customs. They have different modes of production and
life styles, as displayed in dress, diet, residences, marriage,
etiquette and funerals.
</P>
<P>
"The minority peoples have the right to retain or change their
folkways and customs, which are respected by the state. The
government protects such rights in every aspect of social life,"
the paper says.
</P>
<P>
To preserve the traditional cultures of the ethnic minorities,
the state has formulated plans or organized specialists for work
involving collecting, editing, translating and publishing of their
cultural heritage and the protecting of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
A national planning section and office have been established by
the state to organize the editing and publishing of ancient books
of ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 25 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities have established institutions for the same purpose,
the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The state has also invested a great deal of capital in
maintaining cultural relics and historical sites, including the
Drepung, Sera and Gandan monasteries in the Tibetan capital Lhasa,
the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
It also devotes great efforts to fostering literary and
artistic talents among the minority peoples, and promoting the
creation of art and literature by setting up related organizations,
institutes and schools.
</P>
<P>
To date, in autonomous areas, there are 534 art troupes, 194
sites for art performances, 661 libraries, 82 mass art centers,
679 cultural centers, 7,318 cultural-dissemination stations and
155 museums.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there are 24 art colleges and secondary-level art
schools in the five autonomous regions and Yunnan, Guizhou and
Jilin provinces specially for fostering artistically talented
people among the country's ethnic minorities, it says.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed and
over 30 others injured in clashes between the Turkish security
forces and political prisoners in Ankara on Sunday, local press
reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the incident took place when the security
forces tried to enter into wards in Ankara Main Covered Jail early
Sunday morning in a bid to search weapons and transfer the inmates
to prisons in other provinces.
</P>
<P>
The clashes between the security forces and the prisoners
lasted four hours in Ankara Prison with 11 people killed and over
30 others, including six soldiers, injured.

<P>
 The People's Republic of China is a united multi-ethnic state
founded jointly by the people of all its ethnic groups. So far,
there are 56 ethnic groups identified and confirmed by the Central
Government, namely, the Han, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uygur, Miao,
Yi, Zhuang, Bouyei, Korean, Manchu, Dong, Yao, Bai, Tujia, Hani,
Kazak, Dai, Li, Lisu, Va, She, Gaoshan, Lahu, Shui, Dongxiang,

and Jino. As the majority of the population belongs to the Han
ethnic group, China's other 55 ethnic groups are customarily
referred to as the national minorities.
</P>
<P>
 According to the fourth national census conducted in 1990, of
the country's total population 91.96 percent belong to the Han
ethnic group, and 8.04 percent belong to minority ethnic groups *(
1). A sample survey conducted among one percent of the total
population in 1995 showed that 108.46 million people belonged to
minority ethnic groups, accounting for 8.98 percent of the country
's total population of more than 1.2 billion, a 0.94 percentage
point increase over the figure in 1990.

<TEXT>

<P>
 China's ethnic groups live together over vast areas while
some live in individual concentrated communities in small areas.
In some cases minority peoples can be found living in concentrated
communities in areas inhabited mainly by the Han people, while in
other cases the situation is just the other way round. This
distribution pattern has taken shape throughout China's long
history of development as ethnic groups migrated and mingled. The
national minorities, though small in numbers, are scattered over
vast areas. Minority peoples live in every province, autonomous
region and municipality directly under the Central Government, and
in most county-level units two or more ethnic groups live together.
Now minority peoples are mainly concentrated in provinces and
autonomous regions such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia,
Guangxi, Tibet, Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, Liaoning,
Jilin, Hunan, Hubei, Hainan and Taiwan *(2).
</P>
<P>
 China has been a united multi-ethnic country since ancient
times.
</P>
<P>
 In 221 B.C., the first united, multi-ethnic, centralized
state--the Qin Dynasty--was founded in China. Today's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, where minority
peoples are concentrated, were prefectures and counties under the
jurisdiction of the united Qin regime. During the Han Dynasty (206
B.C.-220 A.D.), the centralized feudal state became even more
powerful by inheriting the Qin system. The Han Dynasty set up a
Frontier Command Headquarters in the Western Regions (a general
term for today's territory west of Dunhuang, Gansu Province, since
the Han Dynasty) and added 17 prefectures governing the people of
all ethnic groups there. In this way, a state with a vast
territory embracing the ancestors of the various peoples living in
Xinjiang today emerged. In the course of the frequent
communication between the Han Dynasty and the surrounding minority
peoples, the people of the Chinese nation were called the Han by
other ethnic groups, and the most populous ethnic group in the
world, the Han, emerged. China as a united multi-ethnic country
was created by the Qin Dynasty and consolidated and developed by
the Han Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Government to Restrict Islamic Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government has
decided to take a series of actions against segments of the
Islamic Movement which are engaged in inciting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a special meeting Sunday night
convened at the request of the police and General Security
Service (GSS) in response to the involvement of Israeli Arabs
belong to the Islamic Movement in the attempted car bombings in
Haifa and Tiberias earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Public Security Minister Shlomo
Ben-Ami, Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, Education Minister

publications of the Movement which are found to be inciting
violence against Israel and there will be a general investigation
into the legality of certain Islamic institutions and their
associations, while the Arab and Islamic leaders will be called
upon to dissociate themselves from any segments of their
population that threaten to harm the fabric of relations between
Jews and Arabs in this country.
</P>
<P>

closely.
</P>
<P>
The security establishment suggested during the meeting more
severe measures than were taken, including limitation on travel
and the size of demonstrations, and sealing the homes of the car
bombers as a punishment.
</P>

to be headed by Ben-Ami, to coordinate and oversee these efforts.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Japan to Consider Easing Sanctions on Pyongyang: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said Monday that Tokyo welcomes the recent
announcement by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
that it will freeze test-launches of long-range missiles and said
that Japan will consider easing sanctions imposed on the country.
</P>
<P>
The top Japanese government spokesman welcomed Pyongyang's
comments on the missile issue made in a speech at the United
Nations on Saturday, saying, "Based on the comments, we need to
carefully consider our response."
</P>
<P>
DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun said in the speech that
Pyongyang will not test-fire missiles while talks with the United
States are under way.
</P>
<P>
Japan imposed sanctions against the DPRK after it fired a three-
stage rocket over Japan in August last year. The DPRK said it was
launching a satellite, but Tokyo insists it was for testing a
medium-range ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
Japan's sanctions include a freeze on food aid and charter
flights between the two nations. Japan also suspended negotiations
on normalizing diplomatic ties with DPRK.

<HEADLINE> AIDS to Reduce Kenyan Life Expectancy to 42 years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Average life expectancy in
Kenya is to drop to 42 years from the present 50 by the year 2010
because of the killer AIDS disease.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Health Ministry warned that the AIDS death
will reach the 2.7 million mark while AIDS orphans will rise to
1.5 million by 2005, the East African Standard newspaper said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the National AIDS/STD Control Program
said that 15 years of life expectancy have been lost due to the
pandemic. It projected that life expectancy, which had dropped
from 65 to 50, will fall to 42 year in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
It noted that cumulative AIDS deaths will hit the 2.7 million
mark by 2005 and the number of new cases recorded every year is to
top 240,000 by 2000, saying HIV prevalence is to increase from 14
percent of adult population in 1998 to 15 percent by 2005 and then
stabilize.
</P>
<P>
The number of AIDS orphans will rise from 860,000 at the turn
of the century to 1.5 million by 2005, the reported added.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that at present more than two million Kenyan
including 100, 000 children under five have been infected with HIV
and over 700,000 people have already died from AIDS since the
first AIDS case found in the country in 1984.

<HEADLINE> ABB Agrees to Build Airports in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The infrastructure development
arm of Zurich-based ABB Asea Brown Boveri has signed an agreement
with the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority for the construction
and operation of two airports in the Western Desert.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which was signed on September 20, also provided
for ABB to develop tourism facilities around the airports in the
Farafra oasis, 460 kilometers southwest of Cairo, and Bahariya
oasis, about 350 kilometers southwest of the capital, the latest
issue of the Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will entail ABB signing a build-operate-transfer
(BOT) contract for the development of the airports and surrounding
areas, said the magazine, which focuses reports on the Middle East
economy and business.
</P>
<P>
ABB will construct and run the airports for 50 years before
handing them over to Egypt. It has nine months to prepare a
business plan for the project, after which final contracts are to
be signed.
</P>
<P>
The multinational corporation is estimated to invest some 110
million U.S. dollars in each airport over 10 years, and a further
280 million dollars in developing tourism facilities around the
airports.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government has offered incentives to lure foreign
investments in the country's infrastructural projects, including
airports, seaports and roads.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two aforesaid airports, Egypt will invite foreign
investors and the domestic private sector to build more than 10
airports in the early years of next century, which are mostly
tourist destinations.

 The central governments of all dynasties following the Han
developed and consolidated the united multi-ethnic entity. The
central governments of the past dynasties were established not
only by the Han people but also by minority peoples. In the 13th
century, the Mongolians established the united multi-ethnic Great
Yuan Empire (1206-1368). The Yuan Dynasty practiced a system of
xingsheng (province, or branch secretariat, a paramount
administrative agency in a provincial area) across the country and
appointed aboriginal officials or tu guan (hereditary posts of
local administrators filled by chiefs of ethnic minorities) in the
prefectures and subprefectures of the southern regions where
minority peoples lived in concentrated communities. It established
the Pacification Commissioner's Commandery in charge of military
and administrative affairs in Tibet, whereby Tibet has thenceforth
become an inalienable part of Chinese territory, as well as the
Penghu Police Office for the administration of the Penghu Islands
and Taiwan. Ethnically, the Yuan Empire comprised most of modern
China's ethnic groups. The rise of the Manchu in the 17th century
culminated in the founding of the last feudal dynasty in Chinese
history, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The Qing Dynasty set up the
Ili Generalship and Xinjiang Province in the Western Regions,
appointed resident officials in Tibet and established the
historical convention of conferring honorific titles on the two
Living Buddhas Dalai and Panchen lamas by the Central Government.
In addition, the Qing Dynasty carried out a series of policies,
including a system of local administrators in minority areas
appointed by the Central Government, in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
 Although there were short-term separations and local
divisions in Chinese history, unity has always been the mainstream
in the development of Chinese history *(3).
</P>
<P>
 During the long process of unification, economic and cultural
exchanges brought the people of all ethnic groups in China close
together, giving shape to a relationship of interdependence,
mutual promotion and mutual development among them and
contributing to the creation and development of the Chinese
civilization.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's Fish Exports to Spain Under Threat: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Namibia's whitefish
exports to Spain are under threat after undesirably high levels of
bacteria were allegedly detected in a consignment of fish headed
for Madrid, South Africa' s Business Day newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fish exports constitute almost 99 percent of Namibia's exports
to Spain, which were worth 790 million Namibian dollars (170
million U.S. dollars) in 1997, but Madrid has quarantined Namibian
whitefish after the Spanish media claimed that it had high counts
of harmful bacteria.
</P>
<P>
This comes in the wake of an undertaking by the two countries
to diversify Spanish investment in Namibia away form its
concentration on fisheries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Spanish media claim the contamination could ruin Namibia's
fishing exports to Spain. However, Namibia's fishing industry
insists that local fish is processed under very hygienic
conditions and that there is strict quality control.
</P>
<P>
The industry says there is no way that an isolated case could
jeopardize the country's exports to Europe.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A coalition crisis was defused Sunday night after the
religious party Shas reached an interim agreement with the
government that will allow salaries to be transferred to its
teachers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to lay out their differences in a
document and have given themselves 30 days to come up with a
permanent agreement. Shas had threatened to quit the government if
some 12 million shekels (about 2.8 million U.S. dollars) was not
transferred to its educational network.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- An inter-ministerial committee decided at a meeting
convened by Prime Minister Ehud Barak Sunday night to take a
series of limited steps aimed at tightening the supervision over
the Islamic Movement in Israel.
</P>
<P>
This followed the involvement of Israeli Arabs belonging to the
movement in two attempted car-bombing attacks in Haifa and
Tiberias, as well as the murder of a couple near the northern West
Bank, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The General Security Service and police have expressed
"great disappointment" over the relatively moderate measures
decided by the government to restrict the Islamic Movement.
</P>
<P>
They were critical of the government for not implementing steps
designed to eradicate the movement's hostile activity, such as
closing down media that engage in incitement and shutting down
some of its institutions.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak will examine the new building permits issued by
Housing Minister Yitzhak Levy in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
Peace Now said since the installation of the Barak government
at the beginning of July, the Housing Ministry has issued tenders
for the building of some 2,600 residential units in the West Bank
and Gaza.

 Due to their interdependent political, economic and cultural
connections, all ethnic groups in China have shared a common
destiny and interests in their long historical development,
creating a strong force of affinity and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
 The unity and cooperation among the various ethnic groups
have helped to safeguard China as a united multi-ethnic state. In
particular in modern times, when China became a semi-colonial and
semi-feudal society and the Chinese nation suffered from
imperialist invasion, oppression and humiliation and was reduced
to the status of an oppressed nation, in order to safeguard the
unity of the state and the dignity of the Chinese nation, all the
ethnic groups united and fought unyieldingly together against
foreign invaders and ethnic separatists. In the 19th century, the
people of all the ethnic groups in Xinjiang together with the Qing
troops wiped out Yakoob Beg's reactionary forces and defeated the
British and Russian invaders' plot to split China. At the end of
the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Tibetan
people and troops dealt a heavy blow on the British invaders at
the Mount Lungthur and Gyangze battles. During the eight-year war
of resistance against Japanese imperialist aggression (1937-1945),
the Chinese people of all ethnic groups shared bitter hatred of
the enemy and fought dauntlessly and unflinchingly. It is well
known that many anti-Japanese forces with ethnic minorities as the
mainstay, such as the Hui People's Detachment and the Inner
Mongolia Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Contingent made great
contributions to China's victory in the War of Resistance. The
people of all ethnic groups fought unswervingly and succeeded in
safeguarding national unity against acts aimed at splitting the
country, which went counter to the historical trend and the will
of the Chinese nation, including plots for the ``independence of
Tibet,'' for the setting up of an ``Eastern Turkestan'' in
Xinjiang and the carving out of a puppet state of ``Manchoukuo''
in Northeast China, hatched or engineered by a few ethnic
separatists with the support of imperialist invaders.

<P>
 Before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the central governments of the various periods in China each had a
sequence of policies and systems of its own concerning ethnic
affairs, but under all of them, whether set up by the Han people
or by ethnic minorities, there was no equality to speak of among
ethnic groups. The founding of the People's Republic of China
opened up a new era in which all ethnic groups in China enjoy
equality, unity and mutual assistance. In the big, united family
of ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China, on the basis
of equality of all rights, the people of all ethnic groups unite
of their own accord for mutual promotion and common development
and dedicate to the building of a strong, prosperous, democratic
and civilized New China.
II. Adherence to Equality and Unity among Ethnic Groups
</P>
<P>
 In China, equality among ethnic groups means that, regardless
of their population size, their level of economic and social
development, the difference of their folkways, customs and
religious beliefs, every ethnic group is a part of the Chinese
nation, having equal status, enjoying the same rights and
performing the same duties in every aspect of political and social
life according to law, and ethnic oppression or discrimination of
any form is firmly opposed. Unity among ethnic groups means a
relationship of harmony, friendship, mutual assistance and
alliance among ethnic groups in social life and mutual contacts.
To achieve such unity, the various ethnic groups are required to,
on the basis of opposition to ethnic oppression and discrimination,
safeguard and promote unity among themselves and within every
particular ethnic group and the people of all ethnic groups should,
jointly and with one heart and one mind, promote the development
and prosperity of the nation, oppose ethnic splits and safeguard
the unification of the country. The Chinese government has always
maintained that equality among ethnic groups is the precondition
and basis for unity among ethnic groups, that the latter cannot be
achieved without the former, that the latter is the logical
outcome of the former and a guarantee for promoting ethnic
equality in its true sense.

He added that "I'm not daydreaming. what I am saying is that
membership to the EU is a right for Turkey based in our history,

Equality and unity among ethnic groups as the basic principle
and policy for resolving ethnic problems have been clearly defined
in the Constitution and relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: `
`All ethnic groups in the People's Republic of China are equal.
The state protects the lawful rights and interests of the ethnic
minorities and upholds and develops a relationship of equality,
unity and mutual assistance among all of China's ethnic groups.
Discrimination against and oppression of any ethnic group are
prohibited.'' Citizens of all ethnic groups in China enjoy all
equal rights accorded to citizens by the Constitution and law. For
instance, they have the rights to vote and stand for election,
regardless of ethnic status, race and religious belief; their
personal freedom and dignity are inviolable; they enjoy freedom of
religious belief; they have the right to receive education; they
have the right to use and develop their own spoken and written
languages; they enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly,
of association, of procession and of demonstration; they have the
right to engage in scientific research, literary and artistic
creation and other cultural pursuits; they have the right to work
and rest, and the right to material assistance from the state and
society when they are disabled; they have the right to criticize
and make suggestions regarding any state organ or functionary; and
they have the freedom to preserve or change their own folkways and
customs*(4).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has adopted special policies and
measures to effectively realize and guarantee the right to
equality among all ethnic groups, which is prescribed by the
Constitution and law, in social life and government activities. As
a result, a favorable social environment has been created for
ethnic groups to treat each other on an equal footing and to
develop a relationship of unity, harmony, friendship and mutual
assistance among them.

Before the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the economic and social development of the areas inhabited by
ethnic minorities was unbalanced; some areas were in society under
the serf system, some under the slave system and some even in the
later period of the primitive system. The masses of the minority
people in these areas were vassals of big feudal lords, nobles,
temples or slave owners; they had no personal freedom and could be
sold or bought or given as gifts by their owners at will*(5). In
Tibet the Thirteen-Point Law and Sixteen-Point Law formulated in
the 17th century and used for more than 300 years divided the
people strictly into three classes and nine grades: the people of
the upper class were big nobles, Grand Living Buddhas and high
officials, the people of the intermediate class were ordinary
clerical and secular officials, junior officers and stewards of
upper class people, and the people of the lower class were serfs
and slaves. According to these laws the value of the life of a top-
grade person of the upper class was measured by the weight of his
body in gold, while the life of a lowest-grade person of the lower
class was as cheap as a straw rope. However, the people of the
lower class exceeded 95 percent of the total population of Tibet *
(6). It is obvious that without the reform of the backward social
and political system in minority areas the various equal rights of
minority peoples stipulated in the Constitution and the law could
not be realized.

Under the system of ethnic discrimination and oppression in old
China, many ethnic minorities did not have proper names or names
given in the spirit of equality. The names of certain minority-
inhabited areas even carried the implications of ethnic
discrimination or oppression. In 1951 the Central People's
Government promulgated the Directive on Dealing with the
Appellations, Place Names, Monuments, Tablets and Inscriptions
Bearing Contents Discriminating Against or Insulting Ethnic
Minorities, and such names, appellations, etc. were resolutely
abolished. Some ethnic appellations not implying insults were also
changed at the wish of the given ethnic group, for instance, the
appellation of the Tong ethnic group was changed to Zhuang.
</P>
<P>
In China any words or acts aimed at inciting hostility and
discrimination against any ethnic group and sabotaging equality
and unity among peoples are regarded as violating the law. Any
ethnic minority subjected to discrimination, oppression or insult
has the right to complain to judicial institutions at any level,
which have the duty of handling the complaint.
</P>
<P>
China has joined international conventions such as the
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination, International Convention on the Suppression and
Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid, and Convention on the
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and has
conscientiously performed the duties prescribed in these
conventions and made unremitting efforts together with the
international community to realize ethnic equality and oppose
racial segregation and ethnic oppression and discrimination in all
countries of the world.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
Chinese government adopted different measures to institute
democratic reform successively in the minority areas at the will
of the majority of the people in these areas, and completed the
reform in the late 1950s. This reform abolished all the privileges
of the privileged few -- feudal lords, nobles and tribal chiefs --
and the old system of exploitation and oppression of man by man.
As a result, tens of thousands of the minority people won
emancipation and personal freedom and became masters of their
homelands and their own destinies. The democratic reform which
took place in Tibet in 1959 eradicated the feudal serf system
marked by the combination of government and religion and the
dictatorship of nobles and monks, thus tens of thousands of serfs
and slaves under the old system got their personal freedom and
became masters of the new society.
</P>
<P>
All Ethnic Groups Participate in State Affairs Administration
on an Equal Footing
</P>
<P>
In China, the minority and Han peoples participate as equals in
the management of affairs of the state and local governments at
various levels, and the rights of the minority ethnic groups to
take part in the management of state affairs are especially
guaranteed. Elections to the National People's Congress (NPC) --
the highest organ of state power -- fully reflect respect for the
rights of ethnic minorities. In accordance with the provisions of
the Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local
People's Congresses of the People's Republic of China, the
minority peoples shall have their own deputies to sit in the NPC,
and the ethnic groups whose population is less than that
prescribed for electing one deputy are permitted to elect one
deputy. From the first session of the First NPC, held in 1954, to
the present day, the proportions of deputies of ethnic minorities
among the total number of deputies in every NPC have been higher
than the proportions of their populations in the nation's total
population in the corresponding periods. Of the 2,979 deputies
elected in 1998 to the Ninth NPC, 428 deputies were from ethnic
minorities, accounting for 14.37 percent of the total, which was
about five percentage points higher than the proportion of their
total population in the nation's total population at that time.

In areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated
communities, each of them may have its own deputy or deputies sit
in the local people's congresses. Ethnic minorities living in
scattered groups may also elect their own deputies to the local
people's congresses and the number of people represented by each
of their deputies may be less than the number of people
represented by each of the other deputies to such congresses.
</P>
<P>
The state has made great efforts to train ethnic minority
cadres and enlist their service. To date, there are well over 2,
700,000 minority cadres throughout the country. The ethnic
minorities also have a fairly large number of personnel working in
the central and local state organs, administrative organs,
judicial organs and procuratorial organs, taking part in the
management of national and local affairs. Today, among the vice-
chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the NPC, those of ethnic
minority origin account for 21 percent; among the vice-
chairpersons of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), those of ethnic
minority origin account for 9.6 percent; of the leading members of
the State Council, one is of ethnic minority origin; among the
leaders of the component departments of the State Council, two
ministers are from ethnic minority groups; and the heads of the
governments of the 155 ethnic autonomous regions, prefectures and
counties (or banners) are all from ethnic minority groups.

Before the founding of the People's Republic of China, it had
never been made clear how many ethnic minorities there were in
China. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, to
implement the policy of equality among ethnic groups in an all-
round way the state has organized large-scale investigations since
1953 to identify the ethnic groups. Proceeding from conditions
both past and present and in accordance with the principle of
combination of scientific identification and the wishes of the
given ethnic group, every group which accords with the conditions
for an ethnic group is identified as a single ethnic group,
regardless of its level of social development and the sizes of its
inhabited area and population. By 1954, the Chinese government had
identified 38 ethnic groups in all, after careful investigation
and study. By 1964, the Chinese government had identified another
15 ethnic groups. With the addition of the Lhoba ethnic group,
identified in 1965, and the Jino ethnic group, identified in 1979,
there are 55 ethnic minority groups which have been formally
recognized and made known to the public. Now, in New China many
ethnic minority groups which had not been recognized by the rulers
of old China have been recognized as they should, and they all
enjoy equal rights with other ethnic groups in China.

To safeguard equality among ethnic groups and enhance their
unity, the Constitution contains provisions on the need to combat
big-ethnic group chauvinism, mainly Han chauvinism, and local
ethnic chauvinism. The state also educates all citizens in the
unity of all ethnic groups. In literary and art works, films and
television programs, news reports and academic research, China
vigorously advocates the equality and unity of ethnic groups, and
opposes ethnic oppression and discrimination, and especially big-
ethnic group chauvinism. Besides, to prevent and eliminate big-
ethnic group chauvinism and inequality in the ideological field,
the relevant departments and organs of the Chinese government have
worked out special provisions to strictly prohibit contents
damaging ethnic unity in the media, publications, and literary and
art works.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, the Chinese government and the relevant
departments have held meetings to commend ethnic unity and
progress, at which those units and individuals who uphold the
equal rights of ethnic groups and promote harmonious coexistence
and common progress and prosperity of ethnic groups are praised
and encouraged.

in ethnic autonomous areas all use one or more languages of their
areas when they perform their duties. In the educational field the
organs of self-government, in accordance with the educational
principles of the state and the law, work out their local
educational programs and decide on the languages to be used in
teaching in the local schools. In schools with minority students
as the main body and other educational institutions the languages
of the ethnic groups concerned or languages commonly used in the
locality are used in teaching. China publishes about 100
newspapers in 17 minority languages and 73 periodicals in 11
minority languages. The Central People's Broadcasting Station and
local broadcasting stations use 16 minority languages, and
regional, prefectural and county broadcasting stations or
rediffusion stations use more than 20. As many as 3,410 feature
films have been produced and 10,430 films dubbed in minority
languages. By 1998, 36 publishing houses specializing in
publishing for national minorities had published more than 53
million copies of 4,100-odd titles of books in 23 minority
languages.

Following the launching of a nationwide in-depth movement for
the unity and progress of ethnic groups, in 1988 the Chinese
government held the first national meeting to commend and give
awards to units and individuals distinguished in this regard, at
which the commendation involved 565 advanced collectives and 601
advanced individuals. At the second national meeting, held in 1994,
a total of 1,200 model units and individuals were cited, and the
third national meeting is scheduled to be held in Beijing in 1999.
The holding of this kind of meetings has gone a long way toward
inspiring the advanced, encouraging healthy trends and making
ethnic unity become a powerful part of public opinion and a fine
moral conduct in society. It has not only pushed forward the cause
for unity and progress among ethnic groups, but it has also
exerted a far-reaching influence on the maintenance of stability
in ethnic minority areas and the nation at large.

 Respecting and Protecting the Freedom of Religious Belief of
Ethnic Minorities
</P>
<P>
China is home to many religions, mainly Buddhism, Taoism, Islam
and Christianity. Most people belonging to ethnic minorities in
China hold religious beliefs. In the case of certain ethnic groups
religions are followed on a mass scale, for instance the Tibetans
have Tibetan Buddhism as their traditional religion. In accordance
with the Constitution's provisions on freedom of religious belief
of citizens, the Chinese government has formulated specific
policies to ensure respect for and safeguard freedom of religious
belief for ethnic minorities and guarantee all normal religious
activities of ethnic minority citizens. In China, all normal
religious activities, such as those of Tibetan Buddhism, which is
followed by the Tibetan, Mongolian, Tu, Yugur and Moinba ethnic
groups, Islam, followed by the Hui, Uygur, Kazak, Dongxiang, Salar,
Bonan, Kirgiz, Tajik, Ozbek and Tatar ethnic groups, and
Christianity, followed by some people of the Miao and Yao ethnic
groups, are all protected by law. To date, there are more than 30,
000 mosques in China, of which 23,000 are in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region. In Tibet there are over 1,700 places for
Tibetan-Buddhism activities.

All ethnic groups in China have the freedom and right to use
and develop their own spoken and written languages. In the 1950s,
China organized specialists to make investigations of the spoken
and written languages of ethnic minorities, and established
special organizations involved in work connected with the spoken
and written languages of ethnic minorities as well as institutions
to research these languages, to train specialists in these
languages, help minority peoples create, improve or reform their
written languages, and promote the use of spoken and written
languages of ethnic minorities in every field.

Now, of the 55 national minorities, except the Hui and Manchu,
who use the Chinese language, 53 have their own languages: among

III. Regional Autonomy for Ethnic Minorities
</P>
<P>
In China regional autonomy for ethnic minorities is a
basic policy adopted by the Chinese government in line with the
actual conditions of China, and also an important part of the
political system of China. Regional autonomy for ethnic minorities
means that under the unified leadership of the state regional
autonomy is practiced in areas where people of ethnic minorities
live in concentrated communities; in these areas organs of self-
government are established for the exercise of autonomy and for
people of ethnic minorities to become masters of their own areas
and manage the internal affairs of their own regions.
</P>
<P>
 Autonomous areas for ethnic minorities in China include
autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures and autonomous counties
(banners). 1) Autonomous areas are established where people of one
ethnic minority live in concentrated communities, such as the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region; 2) autonomous areas are
established where two ethnic minorities live in concentrated
communities, such as the Haixi Mongolian-Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture in Qinghai Province; 3) autonomous areas are
established where several ethnic minorities live in concentrated
communities, such as the Longsheng Ethnic Minorities Autonomous
County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; 4) autonomous
areas are established within a larger autonomous area where people
of an ethnic minority with a smaller population live in
concentrated communities, such as the Gongcheng Yao Autonomous
County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region; 5) autonomous
areas are established for people of one ethnic minority who live
in concentrated communities in different places, such as the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the Linxia Hui Autonomous
Prefecture in Gansu Province and the Dachang Hui Autonomous County
in Hebei Province. For places where ethnic minorities live in
concentrated communities but where autonomous areas and organs of
self-government are not fit to be established because the areas
and populations of the ethnic minorities are too small, ethnic
townships are established so that the minority peoples there can
also exercise their rights as masters of their homelands. Ethnic
townships are a supplement to the system of regional autonomy.

<P>
 By the end of 1998, five autonomous regions, 30 autonomous
prefectures and 120 autonomous counties (banners) had been
established, as well as 1,256 ethnic townships. Among the 55
ethnic minorities, 44 have their own autonomous areas, with a
population of 75 percent of the total of the ethnic minorities and
an area of 64 percent of the area of the whole country. The number
and distribution of the autonomous areas are basically the same as
the distribution and composition of the ethnic groups nationwide *
(7).
</P>
<P>
 The following are the three reasons for China to practice the
system of regional autonomy for ethnic minorities: First, it
conforms to the conditions and historical traditions of China,
because China has been a centralized and united country over a
long period of time. Second, over a long period of time China's
ethnic groups have lived together over vast areas while some live
in individual concentrated communities in small areas. The Han
population accounts for the majority of the total population of
the country, while the populations of ethnic minorities are in the
minority. In the early period of the People's Republic of China,
ethnic minorities only accounted for six percent of China's total
population. In most multi-ethnic group areas the population of the
national minorities is less than that of the Han people except in
Tibet, Xinjiang and a few other regions. The national minorities
are distributed over large areas, in more than half of the total
territory of China. Economic and cultural contacts over long
periods have evolved among them a relationship in which
cooperation and mutual assistance, rather than separation, is the
best choice for them. Third, following the outbreak of the Opium
War in 1840, all the ethnic groups of China were faced with the
common task and destiny of struggling against imperialism and
feudalism and striving for national liberation. In the long-term
revolutionary struggle against foreign enemies and for national
independence and liberation, the various ethnic groups have
developed a close interrelationship characterized by the sharing
of weal and woe, and the common political understanding that the
Han people cannot go without the minority peoples nor can the
minority peoples go without the Han people or one minority people
can go without another minority people. So a solid political and
social foundation for the establishment of a united New China and
the practice of regional autonomy in minority areas was laid in
that period.

<P>
 Regional autonomy for ethnic minorities conforms with the
national interests and the fundamental interests of the people of
all ethnic groups in China. The practice of regional autonomy for
ethnic minorities has ensured their equal footing and equal rights
politically and satisfied the desire of all the ethnic minorities
to take an active part in the nation's political activities to a
large extent. According to the principle of regional autonomy for
ethnic minorities, an ethnic group may establish an autonomous
area in a region where it lives in concentrated communities, or it
may establish several autonomous areas at different administrative
levels in other parts of the country in line with the distribution
of the ethnic group. The practice of regional autonomy not only
ensures the rights of the ethnic minorities to exercise autonomy
as masters of their homelands, but also upholds the unification of
the state. It enhances the combination of state policies and
principles and the concrete conditions of the ethnic minority
areas and the integrated development of the state and the ethnic
minorities, the better for each to give free rein to its own
advantages.
</P>
<P>
 The system of regional autonomy in China has two
distinguishing features. First, regional autonomy is under the
unified leadership of the state, and the autonomous areas are
inseparable parts of China. The organs of self-government of the
autonomous areas are local governments under the leadership of the
Central Government, and they must be subordinated to the
centralized and unified leadership of the Central Government. The
concrete conditions and requirements of the various minority areas
must be taken into full consideration and assistance and support
solicited from all quarters when policies and plans are formulated
and economic and cultural construction is conducted by the organs
of state at higher levels. Second, regional autonomy for ethnic
minorities in China is not only ethnic autonomy or local autonomy,
but is the integration of ethnic and regional factors and the
combination of political and economic factors. The practice of
regional autonomy in China should be beneficial to the unification
of the country, social stability and the unity of all ethnic
groups; it should also benefit the development and progress of the
ethnic group that practices autonomy and assist in national
construction.

 The establishment of the system of regional autonomy for
ethnic minorities has undergone a long period of exploration and
practice. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the
first provincial-level autonomous region--the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region-- was founded in 1947. The Common Program of the
CPPCC, adopted at the first CPPCC session on September 29, 1949
and serving as the country's provisional constitution, defined
regional autonomy for ethnic minorities as a basic policy and one
of the important political systems of the state. The Program for
the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's
Republic of China, issued on August 8, 1952, embodied overall
arrangements for the implementation of regional autonomy for
national minorities. The Constitution of the People's Republic of
China, adopted in 1954 and later amended and promulgated, defines
such autonomy as an important political system of the state. The
Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnic Regional Autonomy,
promulgated in 1984, contains systematic provisions on the
political, economic and cultural rights and duties of ethnic
minority autonomous areas. After the founding of the People's
Republic of China, four autonomous regions were established
successively: the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, founded in
October 1955; the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, founded in
March 1958; the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, founded in October
1958; and the Tibet Autonomous Region, founded in September 1965.

 The Constitution stipulates that the organs of self-

people's governments of autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures
and autonomous counties. The establishment and organization of
organs of self-government of autonomous areas are based on the
basic principles of the people's congress system, but these organs
are different from ordinary local state organs. The Law on Ethnic
Regional Autonomy stipulates that all ethnic groups in autonomous
areas shall elect an appropriate number of deputies to take part
in the people's congresses at various levels; among the chairman
or vice-chairmen of the standing committee of the people's
congress of an autonomous area there shall be one or more citizens
of the ethnic group or groups exercising regional autonomy in the
area concerned; the head of an autonomous region, autonomous
prefecture or autonomous county shall be a citizen of the ethnic
group exercising regional autonomy in the area concerned, and the
other members of the people's governments of these regions,
prefectures and counties shall include members of the ethnic group
exercising regional autonomy as well as members of other ethnic
minorities as far as possible.

 While exercising the functions and powers of a local organ of
state, organs of self-government in autonomous areas at the same
time exercise other functions and powers as stipulated by the
Constitution and the Law on Ethnic Regional Autonomy. These
include legislative power, the power to flexibly carry out, or
halt the carrying out of, some decisions, the right to develop
their economies and control the local finances, the power to train
and employ cadres belonging to ethnic minorities, the power to
develop education and ethnic culture, the power to develop and
employ the local spoken and written languages, and the power to
develop scientific, technological and cultural undertakings.

<P>
 --The people's congresses of the autonomous areas have the
right to enact regulations on the exercise of autonomy and
separate regulations in light of local political, economic and
cultural characteristics. By the end of 1998, 126 regulations on
the exercise of autonomy and 209 separate regulations had been
enacted by the autonomous areas.

higher-level state organs are not suited to the actual conditions
of the autonomous areas, the organs of self-government of these
areas may be flexible in carrying them out or may decide not to
carry them out after approval by the higher state organs.
According to Article 36 of the Marriage Law of the People's
Republic of China, supplementary regulations have been worked out
for carrying out the Marriage Law by the five autonomous regions
and some autonomous prefectures in line with their own actual
conditions. They have changed the legal marriage age from ``not
below 22'' to ''not below 20 for men'' and from ``not below 20''
to ''not below 18 for women.''

of Zambia's Mosi-O- Tunya Hotel Inter-Continental that will pave
way for the construction of three new hotels near the Victoria
Falls in Livingstone, the tourist capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Once operational, the new hotels will attract 130,000
international tourists, create 6,000 jobs and earn the country 40
million U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest investment under the accommodation sector to-date
is that of the Sun International, which is set to get off the
ground some time this month," Zambia's Acting Finance Minister
Vincent Malambo was quoted by Times of Zambia newspaper as saying
Monday.
</P>

for 46 percent, 32 percent, and 35 percent, respectively. In 1998,
Tibetan cadres accounted for 74.9 percent of the total in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, and at the regional, prefectural and
county levels Tibetan cadres and cadres from other local ethnic
minorities accounted for 78 percent, 67 percent and 62 percent,

<HEADLINE> UAE Poised to Follow More Assertive Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) is poised to follow a more aggressive foreign affairs policy
as it seeks to play a greater role within the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) and strengthen ties with the West.
</P>
<P>
With Lt. General Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chief of
staff of the UAE Armed Forces, having a hand in the foreign
policy, the UAE is expected to make more assertive decisions,
according to a latest report of a Britain-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
The think tank on business and political affairs, the Economist
Intelligence Unit (EIU) said that the recent developments in the
Gulf have shown that the UAE is departing from traditional
discretion on its stance, the Gulf News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
One notable example is the UAE's public objection to Saudi
Arabia's warmer relations with Iran, with which the UAE has a
territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia are members of the GCC, which
also includes Oman, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain. Relations between
Saudi Arabia and Iran have been improving since Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami took office in 1997 and vowed to improve ties
with all countries, especially the Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's overture toward Iran has angered the UAE because
it and Iran are locked in a dispute over the sovereignty of three
Gulf islands, the Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the three strategic islets after Britain ended
its protectorate in 1975. So far, Iran only agrees to start
negotiation with the UAE over the Abu Musa.
</P>
<P>
"It will seek to play a greater role within the GCC by
increasing financial assistance to, and investment in, Oman and
Qatar in an effort to counter Saudi Arabia's influence in Bahrain
and Kuwait," analysts said in the EIU report.
</P>
<P>
"Fear of being dominated by Saudi Arabia and Iran, were U.S.
interests in the region to diminish, is pushing the UAE to seek
parity with Saudi Arabia in its regional influence," the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has recently settled a border dispute with Oman over
the Umm Al-Zamoul area with the promise of financial assistance.
The agreement led to Muscat's move to support the UAE to begin
developing oil reserves on the Abu Dhabi side of the border.
</P>
<P>
The border pact further gave Abu Dhabi the confidence to
express its anger over Saudi Arabia's move to resume harmonious
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Oman reiterated its support to the UAE's claim to the islands,
without mentioning the prospects of improved ties with Iran, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar was more cautious, but its foreign minister, Hamad Bin
Jassem Bin Jabr Al Thani, said that he could understand why the
UAE was displeased.
</P>
<P>
On the UAE's move to raise its international profile to reduce
the influence of potential aggressors, the country has been
involved recently in humanitarian efforts in Albania and has also
deployed peace keeping troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, said the report, the UAE keeps good
relations with Western powers like the U.S., France and Britain
by purchasing large amounts of weapons and maintaining military
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"It will use its forthcoming naval expansion program to
broaden relations with any putative joint security apparatus in
Europe," the report said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Promises to Reconsider Law on Honor Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Lower House Speaker
Abdul Hadi Majali has promised to take into consideration the
amending of the penal code which pardons or reduces penalties for
alleged honor killings.
</P>
<P>
The speaker said the House is ready to examine any ideas or
suggestions, hoping women groups would provide conclusion and
recommendations on the so-called honor killings, the semiofficial
Jordan Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks Sunday at the opening ceremony of a two-day
conference in Amman, which was entitled "Crimes of Honor - Latest
Developments" and organized by the Jordanian Women's Union.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that a Jordanian parliamentary leader
has promised to address the issue of honor killings, which claimed
dozens of lives of young women each year in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Human rights and pressure groups in Amman have long campaigned
to remove the Article 340 in the penal code, which pardons or
reduces prison terms for those who kill their wives and female
relatives for actual or suspected illicit relationship with man.
</P>
<P>
A special committee under the Justice Ministry has decided to
eliminate Article 340, but the decision still needs the
endorsement of the lower and upper houses, then followed by a
Royal Decree.
</P>
<P>
An independent action committee have garnered more than 8,000
signatures during the first month of a nationwide campaign to
eliminate Article 340 and to stem alleged honor killings in the
kingdom.

"Some of the gear for traditional sports originated in Guangxi
weigh up to 1.6 tons, which has cost us a lot of money for
bringing them to Beijing," Wei said. "Some of the delegations had

added.

 --Organs of self-government of autonomous areas may decide
their own local education programs, including the establishment of
schools, the length of study, the forms of school running, course
contents, language of instruction and procedures of enrollment and
develop independently their own type of education based on their
ethnic minority characteristics and within the state education
policies and relevant laws (see Table 1). Before 1949, the
illiteracy rate was upwards of 95 percent in Ningxia, and there
was not a single institution of higher learning. But today, a
rational multi-level educational system embracing different types
of school that complement each other for coordinated development
is in place in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. By 1998, there
were 6,100 different kinds of schools in Ningxia, with a total of
1.3 million students. Among them there were five institutions of
higher learning, with 11,000 students. As a result, in this region
89.5 percent of the people are literate. In old Tibet, there were
no schools in the modern sense, and the illiteracy rate was 95
percent. But by 1998, there were 4,365 schools of all levels in
the Tibet Autonomous Region. About 81.3 percent of school-age
children now attend school, and the illiteracy rate has been
reduced by 47 percentage points.

 The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province
has made considerable progress in its education in the past 50
years, proving itself worthy of its time-honored reputation as the
``home of education.'' According to the latest statistics, 99.97
percent of school-age children in this prefecture were in primary
schools in 1998, 99.98 percent of them have entered secondary
schools of all types and 95.2 percent of them have entered regular
junior middle schools, with a graduation rate of 96.8 percent.
Nine-year compulsory education is virtually universal in this
prefecture. Higher education, vocational education and adult
education have gradually got onto the track of coordinated
development. The proportion of graduates from universities and
secondary specialized schools and intellectuals of the
intermediate rank and above in the population of Yanbian exceeds
the average number in the country.

 It took only three years for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region after its founding to check the spread of the plague. The
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region controlled the spread of the plague
in 1963. In 1961, smallpox was eliminated throughout the whole
country, including minority areas. The life span of Tibetans has
increased to 65 years from 36 in 1959, the year the democratic
reform started. The infant mortality rate shrank to 3.7 percent in
1998 from 43 percent 40 years previously in Tibet. The life span
of the people of Ningxia has increased to 69 from 30 before 1949.

IV. Promoting the Common Development of All Ethnic Groups
</P>
<P>
 Before the founding of the People's Republic of China,
agriculture and animal husbandry, the main economies in China's
minority areas, developed very slowly. Some areas still remained
in the primitive ``slash-and-burn'' stage of agricultural
production, and in some areas, iron farm tool were not in use. In
addition, water conservancy facilities were inadequate. In 1949
the average per-hectare yield of grain in minority areas was only
1,125 kg, and the total agricultural output of those areas was
only worth 3.12 billion yuan. Before the founding of the People's
Republic of China, there were almost no modern industries in
ethnic minority areas. In 1949, the total industrial output value
of these areas was only 540 million yuan. Communications, posts
and telecommunications were also very backward; goods were
transported mainly by animals and people. There were very few
automobiles or highways, and more often than not, it took one
month or longer to deliver a letter. Many people had never seen an
automobile or a telephone, and there was not a single road in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
 Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
state has spared no effort to promote the common development and
progress of all ethnic groups. In accordance with the actual
conditions in the ethnic minority areas, the state has worked out
and adopted a series of policies and measures to assist these
areas in developing their economies, and mobilize and organize the
developed areas where Han people live to support them. In the Law
of the People's Republic of China on Ethnic Regional Autonomy, 13
articles specify the duties of the state organs at higher levels
to help the ethnic autonomous areas with their development. While
working out the plan for national economic and social development,
the state arranged some important projects in the national
minority areas in a planned and conscious way to readjust their
single-product economic structure, develop diversified industries
and improve the comprehensive economic strength of those areas.
Especially along with the constant deepening of China's reform and
opening to the outside world in recent years, the state has
increased its investments in minority areas to speed up their pace
of opening-up, thus making the minority areas show new vitality
for economic development.

<P>
Strengthening the Construction of Infrastructure Facilities
and Promoting the Development of Basic Industries in Minority
Areas
</P>
<P>
 During the First Five-Year Plan period (1953-1957), the state
started to construct a number of key projects in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, such as the Baotou Iron and
Steel Base in Inner Mongolia, the Qingtongxia Hydropower Station
in Ningxia, petroleum exploration in Xinjiang and the development
of the Hinggan Mountains Forest Area in Inner Mongolia. In the
1950s and 1960s, China completed the Sichuan-Tibet, Qinghai-Tibet,
Xinjiang-Tibet and other main highways in minority areas, and
built the Baotou-Lanzhou, Lanzhou-Xining, Lanzhou-Urumqi, Guiyang-
Kunming, Chengdu-Kunming, Chengdu-Guiyang, and Changsha-Guiyang
trunk railways leading to the minority areas in northwest and
southwest China. In addition, a large number of large and medium-
sized industrial enterprises were set up one after another in
minority areas, and a total of more than 1,400 industrial
enterprises were set up in the five autonomous regions and the
places where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities in
Yunnan, Guizhou and Qinghai provinces.
</P>
<P>
 The state has shown great concern for infrastructure
facilities construction and basic industries development in
minority areas, giving priority to the arrangement of water
conservancy, power, communications, environmental protection and
natural resource development projects in central and western China
where ethnic minorities are comparatively concentrated. A
preferential policy on investment has been adopted so as to divert
more foreign investments to those areas. In 1998, of the total
increased financial investment by the state, 62 percent was used
in central and western China, and the investment made by the
central authorities in fixed assets in central and western China
increased by 31.2 percent, or 14.9 percentage points higher than
that in eastern China and the highest figure since the founding of
New China. These policies and measures have greatly promoted the
economic development of ethnic minority areas (see Table 3).
According to statistics, in 1998 railway traffic mileage in these
areas totaled 17,300 km, or 4.6 times the 1952 figure, and the
highway traffic mileage, 374,100 km, or 14.4 times the 1952 figure.
The postal routes and total rural delivery distance came to 1.1354
million km, or 8.6 times the 1952 figure.

 The Central Government has extended special support to the
construction of infrastructure facilities and the development of
basic industries in Tibet. In 1984, the Central Government
organized manpower and material resources from nine provinces and
municipalities to help Tibet build 43 projects in just over a year,
covering energy, communications, construction materials and
municipal works and involving a total investment of 480 million
yuan. In 1994, the Central Government also decided that the
central authorities and the provinces and municipalities
throughout the country should help Tibet construct 62 projects
without compensation, with the total investment exceeding four
billion yuan. So far, 60 of them have been completed. In 1997 the
Yamzho Yumco Water Pumping and Energy Storing Power Station, built
with state investment totaling 2.014 billion yuan, was completed
and began to generate electricity. According to statistics, from
the 1950s to 1998, the Central Government invested more than 40
billion yuan in Tibet, and transported a great amount of materials
to it. The aid offered by the Central Government and other
provinces and municipalities has greatly improved the construction
of infrastructure facilities and basic industries in Tibet. Now
Tibet has power, mining, construction materials, forestry, woolen
textile, printing, food and other modern industries.

 In recent years, thanks to huge state assistance, Xinjiang
has completed a number of modern, technologically advanced large
and medium-sized industrial projects, such as the Urumqi General
Petrochemicals Factory and the ethylene project of the Dushanzi
General Petrochemicals Factory, as well as a number of large
communications facilities, such as the Southern Xinjiang Railway,
the Tacheng Airport and the high-grade Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan
Highway. According to statistics, during the 20 years from 1978 to
1997, Xinjiang completed and put into operation more than 50,000
projects, including 64 large and medium-sized ones, with fixed
assets totaling 190 billion yuan. These investments have greatly
improved Xinjiang's water conservancy, communications, posts and
telecommunications and other infrastructure facilities. Xinjiang
has become the fourth-biggest oil producing and processing area in
China, as well as an important cotton and woolen textile base and
a fur processing base *(9).

<HEADLINE> Feature: Trainer's Edification Secret of Tightrope Walk King 's Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by sportwriter Wang Zijiang
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Every time he comes off the
high wire, Adili, the "tightrope walk king", always recalls his
late trainer Liu Fusheng.
</P>
<P>
"Right before he passed away five years ago, Liu told me that I
should aim high and fly. I will never let him down," said Adili,
28, an member of the Uygur minority nationality in Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region in northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Adili, who is participating in the on-going China's National
Games for the Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities in
Beijing, has been listed as one of the world's most successful
tightrope walkers.
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old usually tiptoes along an angled cable leading
to a tight wire dangling some 20 meters above the ground and
performs such daredevil routines as forward and backward steps,
walk blindfolded, somersaults, sit-up, stand upside down on head
top and jumps.
</P>
<P>
Adili established his world-wide fame in June 1997 when he
performed a record-setting walk along a wire stretched across
China's longest river the Yangtze, in 13 minutes and 48 seconds.
He completed the performance on the 640.75-meter steel wire
dangling 375 meters above the flushing water. It broke the
previous Guinness world record of 53 minutes and 10 seconds set at
the same site by Canadian tightrope walker Jay Cochraine in
October of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A seventh-generation member of Xinjiang's famed professional
Dawazi (tightrope walkers) family, Adili said he could not have
achieved such a stunning success without the help of his trainer,
although he could make steps on the tightrope ever since he was
five.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Han nationality himself, Liu, an acrobatic
coach in his hometown Yingjisha County of Xinjiang is a close
friend of Adili's father.
</P>
<P>
Adili's father died in 1976, when his son was only five.
Fearing his family's traditional stun skills would get lost, he
asked Liu, before his death, to look after his son and continue to
teach him the skills.
</P>
<P>
"My trainer took me a son of his own," Adili recalled. "He
taught me all about Dawazi, and told me how to be a man. Without
him, I would have never flown up in the air," Adili said.
</P>
<P>
Liu died five years ago.
</P>
<P>
In an accident caused by a snapped wire years ago in Shanghai,
Adili fell 15 meters to the ground, breaking a collarbone, pubic
bones and several ribs and injuring his kidney.
</P>
<P>
As nobody thought he would be able to perform again on the
tightrope, Adili almost gave up his hope. It was Liu's
encouragement that helped him restore the confidence. "Once I
thought of my trainer's words, I told myself that I should not
flinch." He managed to resume performing the stunt just after
sixth months' rest.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrating Dawazi skills in the National Games for
Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities only to the second
time, Adili wished liu's family members in Xinjiang would be
watching him perform through TV screen.
</P>
<P>
"I will keep on flying in the future," he said. "I will never
disappoint them," he added.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Slams U.S. Report on Religious Freedom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) has condemned the United States for its
groundless slandering of the DPRK on religious freedom, press
reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a "1999 annual report on international religious freedom"
published on September 9, the United States charged that religious
freedom in the DPRK is not guaranteed and harsh penalties are
inflicted on those taking part in religious activities.
</P>
<P>
The official Korean Central News Agency quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as warning on Sunday that if the United States
continues to put pressure on the DPRK over the "religious problem"
based on false data, it would jeopardize the narrowly progressed
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have improved slightly as
the United States announced recently to ease economic sanctions
against the DPRK after their talks in Germany earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman denounced the U.S. religion report as "another
broad attempt to interfere in others' internal affairs in
violation of basic international norms," just like its annual
slanderous report on human rights conditions in other countries.
</P>
<P>
He noted the move could not work on anyone and will only invite
ridicule and rejection.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that in his country religious belief and
freedom of people are perfectly ensured by the constitution, and
that believers can go in for religious activities at their will.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Navy Repulses Rebels' Attack on Chinese Cargo Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's navy over the
weekend repulsed a Tamil rebels' attack on a Chinese cargo ship
off the northeastern coast of the country, security sources said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said the ship carrying fertilizer was on its way to South
India's Madras when it was fired upon by Tamil rebels Saturday
night about 50 miles east of Mullaitivu, the stronghold of Tamil
rebels, 280 kilometers northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The stern of the cargo ship was badly damaged from a rocket
propelled grenade from a boat of Tamil rebels of Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
About 15 Navy fast attack craft patrolling the seas had come to
the rescue of the cargo ship and engaged the LTTE rebels in a
fierce high sea battle.
</P>
<P>
During the nine-hour battle lasting till four on Sunday
morning, the navy beat back the attack of 12 LTTE's water jet
boats, destroying four of them, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
They said the cargo ship with 34 people aboard was later towed
into Trincomalee port, about 250 kilometers northeast of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
One person was injured in the attack.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the LTTE rebels had been attempting to
frighten civilian ships and cargo ships away from Sri Lankan
shores by launching terrorist attacks, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a 16-year-old war against
the government to demand an independent homeland for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.

<HEADLINE> IMF Pledges to Enhance Debt Relief Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) and World Bank announced here Sunday an enhanced debt
relief initiative to help the poorest countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
At the first-ever joint meeting of policy setting committees,
the two agencies pledged to support "deeper, broader and faster
debt relief" for the poor countries and strengthen the link
between debt relief and poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
The new coordinated effort will provide a debt relief of 100
billion U.S. dollars to 36 of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
Some requirements are erased to allow three-fourths of the
eligible countries, many in sub-Saharan Africa, into the debt
relief program by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, the IMF and World Bank launched an
Initiative for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) to cut
some 70 billion dollars in nominal terms off the 214 billion
dollar debt burden of the world's 40 poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
However, because of strict performance standards, so far only
four countries -- Uganda, Bolivia, Guyana and Mozambique -- have
received relief under the HIPC.
</P>
<P>
The new debt relief initiative, to be financed in part by
revaluing 14 million ounces of the IMF's gold reserves at market
prices, would provide 50 billion dollars for the HIPC debt relief
program.
</P>
<P>
Valued in its accounts at less than 50 U.S. dollars an ounce,
the IMF's gold will be sold for cash at the current market price,
which is above 260 dollars, thus enabling the IMF to spend the
difference.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal was strongly protested in gold producer
countries, some of which are among the poorest that the HIPC
program was supposed to help. They fear such a sale would cause a
price collapse and throw thousands of people out of work.

<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Tourist
Corporation (PBC) has so far earned 14.01 billion taka (280
million U.S. dollar) in foreign currency during the past 25 years
when 2.66 million foreigners of different countries visited
Bangladesh, a local newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Express quoted a senior official of the BPC as
saying that The BPC, since its inception in 1973, earned the
highest amount of 2.74 billion taka (54.8 million U.S. dollar) in
1997 when 182,420 foreigners visited the country.
</P>
<P>
The corporation also earned 665.1 million taka (13.5 million
U.S. dollar) from 47,008 foreign visitors in the first three

</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Planning Department of the BPC was
quoted as saying that the earnings from Bangladesh's tourism
sector are not significant in comparison with those from the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of facilities in communication system and insecurity in
different places are hampering the tourism sector in the country,"
he said, adding the government and different privately-owned
organizations should come forward to develop the tourism sector.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Seek Evidence for Evolution of Chinese Civilization ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Widely recognized nowadays,
the fact that the Chinese civilization has a 5,000 year history
was doubted and challenged half a century ago. Finding evidence
for this conclusion, therefore, has become a common goal pursued
by Chinese archeologists during the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Numerous archeological finds since the founding of New China
have helped scholars to piece together the course of development
of Chinese civilization. The central China province of Henan made
particularly important contributions with its rich cultural
heritage.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that excavations of the five historical sites in
Henan, and research of findings unearthed at these sites, provide
sound evidence for establishing the existence of the Xia (about
2100 -- 1600 B.C.) and Shang (1600 -- 1100 BC) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
"All these heritages, except the Yin site in Anyang, were
discovered during the past 50 years," according to An Jinhuai, a
78-year-old veteran archeologist who has devoted the past 50 years
to searching for and excavating the cultural heritage sites in
Henan.
</P>
<P>
Documents show that most areas of Henan Province fall into
centers of the Xia and Shang dynasties. Archeologists have
therefore focused their research on Xia and Shang cultures with
the findings in the province.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists of New China had their first significant finds in
the spring of 1951, when a Shang Dynasty site was unearthed in
Zhengzhou, capital of Henan. Four years later, the remains of a
Shang city were excavated at the site, which is the largest to be
found so far. The Shang city in Zhengzhou is believed to be more
ancient than the Shang city in Anyang, which was excavated in 1928.

<TEXT>
<P>
With the discovery of another Shang city in Yanshi in 1983,
Chinese archeologists were able to patch a basic framework for the
history of the Shang Dynasty. They unanimously held that the
ancient city in Yanshi was built even earlier than the Shang city
in Zhengzhou, and could be a landmark dividing the culture of the
Xia Dynasty from the Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Another important contribution from Henan has been the
archeological exploration of Xia culture. An ancient city was
unearthed in 1983 in Dengfeng, which was established as the first
capital city of the Xia Dynasty, thereby bringing the history of
Chinese cities to an even earlier date of between 2300 BC and 2200
BC.
</P>
<P>
"More than 20 ancient dynasties located their capitals in Henan,
which left the province rich in the vestiges of ancient
civilization," said Chang Jianchuan, director of the Henan
Provincial Bureau of Cultural Relics. "But the most significant
archeological findings are related to the cultures of the Xia and
Shang dynasties."
</P>
<P>
Chang's view was echoed by Zhang Guangzhi, a Chinese-American
scholar, "The science of archeology has made many spectacular
finds; our top finding has been the culture of the Xia, Shang and
Zhou dynasties."
</P>
<P>
"Whereas fifty years ago we didn't know how or where the
history of China began, we know it now," he stressed.

Chinese journalist, rode a horse through Qinghai Province in
northwest China, and depicted the poverty in the province in his
book "Northwest Corner of China."
</P>
<P>
That was before the founding of New China in 1949. Now, a
modern transportation network has been created in Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven flights now take off every week from the Xining
airport in the provincial capital bound for other parts of the
country, and more than 20,000 travelers came to Qinghai by air in
August alone.
</P>
<P>
Tracks have been laid to Golmud as part of the railway line
from Qinghai to Tibet. Golmud, once a small village, now handles
90 percent of the materials and 80 percent of the passengers
heading for Tibet, making it a hot tourist city.
</P>
<P>
Upgrading of the Xining-Lhasa Highway, the main highway passage
leading to Tibet, was recently completed, and cars can now travel
at speeds of up to 80 kilometers per hour on the highway, twice
the original speed.
</P>

According to a local source, nearly all the towns and townships
in Qinghai now have access to highways.

JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The military handover was
held in Dili, capital of East Timor, on Monday morning, according
to the Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The handover of security command was done behind closed doors
at the military resort command in Dili following the International
Force for East Timor (Interfet)'s request that it would not be
done at the Comoro airport or by exhibiting troops.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, chief of
Indonesia's Restoration Command in East Timor, handed over the
security command to Maj. Gen. Peter Cosgrove, commander of the
Interfet.
</P>
<P>
Following the handover, only one Indonesian army battalion and
combined companies of the airforce special force, marine and
mobile-brigade troops would remain in East Timor until November
when the region will be handed over to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the situation in Dili remained tense on
Sunday. Although no gunfire was heard smoke was still bellowing
from a burning Bank Danamon building.
</P>
<P>
The Interfet troops continued patrolling the city in light
armored vehicles while holding SA-80 guns, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Today's Life of Those Guarding Genghis Khan's Mausoleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-three-year-old Yang
Qingke is a guard at Genghis Khan's Mausoleum in China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, but he works as a tour guide on the
side.
</P>
<P>
He gets more than 400 yuan (48 U.S. dollars) monthly from his
guard work and his family also has more than 100 sheep and a total
annual income of more than 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
His life did not get this way until the chaotic "Cultural
Revolution" came to an end in 1976. The Central Government then
allocated funds to rebuild the mausoleum which had been severely
damaged during that period and gave him money to guard it and some
land for his livestock.
</P>
<P>
Genghis Khan (1162-1227) died at the age of 66 in what is today
Gansu Province, when he attacked the Xixia Kingdom to try to unify
the country. His remains were taken to the Ejin Horo Banner on the
Ordos Highlands in Inner Mongolia and buried there. Five hundred
families were chosen to protect the mausoleum. Yang comes from one
of those families.
</P>
<P>
Guards moved Genghis Khan's remains to Qinghai Province when
Japanese troops invaded China in 1937 and the mausoleum was left
behind. The remains did not return to the region until the
founding of New China in 1949. The mausoleum was rebuilt as 3
connected palaces and Yang Qingke became the 38th generation to
take care of the mausoleum.
</P>
<P>
Wang Dao'er, the head of the mausoleum's Administrative Bureau,
says that the guards used to live near the mausoleum and all
looked after it and prepared memorial ceremonies every March 21 of
the lunar calendar. Now, only 54 people guard it and hold memorial
services and they serve as tour guides on the side.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 members of the 500 families living
elsewhere in the Ordos Highlands and more than 2,000 living near
the mausoleum and farming, doing business, or working for the
local government. Many younger members have their own hotels,
restaurants, or shops near the scenic spot and provide various
services for tourists and carry on the folk tradition on wedding
days and for ceremonies.

BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The size of the Thai force
going to East Timor on a peacekeeping mission may be reduced to
about 1,100 from 1,778 under the original plan, Bangkok Post
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chokchai Hongthong, the Thai armed forces chief of staff, was
quoted as saying on Sunday that the cut is being made at the
request of Prime Minister and Defense Minister Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces have agreed to propose sending either 1,100
men, 1,200 or 1,400 men, Chokchai said. The prime minister is
expected to choose the first figure, he added.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Thai troops are from the Rapid Deployment
Force of the 3rd Battalion of the 31st Infantry Regiment,
according to Chokchai.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 33 Thai soldiers left for Darwin of
Australia to join an advance multinational peacekeeping force in
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The second batch of 100 soldiers will leave for Darwin before
October 1. They will later proceed to Bakao in East Timor, and the
main part of the Thai force will leave for the territory on
October 15.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Prime Minister Hails China's Achievements as Miraculous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- "The mankind has witnessed
many earth-shaking changes in the 20th century, one of the most
significant is the birth and development of the People's Republic
of China," Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said in a
recent interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese society has been transformed from a semi-feudal,
semi-colonial agrarian base to a miraculous economy, with an
annual growth rate two and half times the world average," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The 20 years of reform and opening-up are particularly
remarkable during which China doubled its gross domestic product
every 10 years, which would have taken 58 years in Britain, 47
years in the United States and 34 years in Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the great accomplishments in China's economic,
scientific-technological and cultural construction, Khai said
facts proved that the Chinese people have followed a right way of
development which has enabled it to assume an important role both
in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the practice of the Chinese people has
offered a wise choice for other people in the world in their
efforts to build a society of fairness, love, prosperity and
happiness.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Sino-Vietnamese relations, Khai said, "we two
peoples have been enjoying a long history of friendship and good
neighborhood. The Vietnamese people will never forget the huge
support given by the Chinese people when we were in difficulties."
</P>
<P>
He said that cooperation between the two countries has been
going well in every field, especially since the visit to China of
Vietnamese Communist Party leader Le Kha Phieu in February this
year.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries and two parties set forth
the principle of establishing a long-term stable, future-oriented
neighborly and all-round cooperative relationship, which will lead
the Sino-Vietnamese friendship into a new era of development, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Quits U.S. Presidential Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Vice President
Dan Quayle has decided to drop out of the Republican presidential
race, the Associated Press said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Quayle made the decision after determining that he cannot
compete with Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
in fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
Quayle is expected to announce his intentions at a news
conference Monday in Phoenix, Arizona. His departure left eight
major candidates in the Republican field for presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
Quayle's aides said the former vice president decided to quit
this weekend, after consulting with his wife, Marilyn, and
campaign manager Kyle McSlarrow.
</P>
<P>
The former vice president is not able to raise enough money to
compete deep into the primary season with Texas Governor George W.
Bush, who has raised more than 50 million dollars, five times that
of his nearest challenger. Quayle has been running a debt since
early in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Representative John Kasich of Ohio, former Tennessee Governor
Lamar Alexander and Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, dropped
out of the Republican primary contest earlier this year.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Opposition leader Kim Beazley has risked the unity of the
"yes" case on an Australian republic by highlighting that a Labor
government would be prepared to run a referendum for a directly
elected president if the more limited republic model wins in the
November 6 referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard's new doctrine in
favor of a more decisive regional role for Australia has attracted
further criticism at home and in Asia as a "foolish" and
"intolerant" foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Howard is under new pressure to redefine his
"Howard doctrine" of a military role in Asia after Australia's
military chief revealed Sunday that the matter had not been raised
specifically with him.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>
<P>
-- The Japanese government has promised the world's leading
industrialized nations to take action to limit the rising Japanese
yen and avert damage to its own and other world economies.

<HEADLINE> Wimbledon Hoping for Ref Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Wimbledon manager Egil Olsen
is hoping video evidence to prove John Hartson is innocent after
he was sent off for using his elbow on Spurs defender Luke Young.
</P>
<P>
Hartson picked up a second yellow card after 79 minutes of the
1-1 draw at Selhurst Park and now faces a one-match ban.
</P>
<P>
But Olsen branded the incident, which was spotted by the
referee's assistant, as "a wrong decision" and will ask referee
Graham Poll to look at the tape and maybe change his mind.
</P>
<P>
"I have watched it again on TV and it is a wrong decision,"
said Olsen. "Everybody in the team thinks it was a wrong decision.
</P>
<P>
"John did not use his elbow and I cannot see anything wrong,
the tapes don't lie. You cannot jump with your arms by your sides
but John did not use his elbow.
</P>
<P>
"Players make mistakes and so do referees, and John should not
be banned for this. The linesman was further away from the
incident than the referee. I wonder if people in this country don'
t like him."
</P>
<P>
Olsen was unaware that it is possible to appeal against such
decisions and ask for the referee to view the incident again.
</P>
<P>
But he is likely to take that course of action after having it
explained to him by the media.
</P>
<P>
He said: "In Norway, it is not possible, but now you have told
me this I shall discuss it with the people around me. If the
referee is prepared to change his mind that will be good of him."
</P>
<P>
Amazingly, since working with Hartson, Olsen believes the big
Welsh striker needs to be more aggressive. He said: "I like John
as a person and a player but he can improve. He is very soft and
can be more aggressive."

LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur missed the
chance of moving into the top six in the English premier league on
Sunday when they played a one-all at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
Welsh target man John Hartson, a constant threat in the air,put
the home side ahead in the 57th minute with a fine downward header
at the near post.
</P>
<P>
But Spurs defender Stephen Carr levelled with 14 minutes
remaining, collecting a floated Allan Nielsen pass on the right
and firing into the roof of the net as he broke into the area.
</P>
<P>
Moments later Hartson was sent off for a second booking after
catching a defender with an arm. Tottenham captain Tim Sherwood
could have stolen the points in the final moments but blasted over
the bar.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United lead the table with 21 points from nine
matches, two clear of Leeds United and Arsenal, after they were

<HEADLINE> N. Irish Parties Discuss Peace but Remain Apart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's leading
pro-British unionists and pro-Irish republicans were back in the
province on Sunday after separate sessions to decide how to
progress with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
held a two-day "think-tank" seminar across the border in Donegal,
in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, it set up a committee to examine the findings of a
controversial report on policing in the British-ruled province,
the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein also discussed the ongoing peace talks chaired by
former U.S. senator George Mitchell at the seminar, which was
attended by party leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Sinn Fein vice-president Pat Doherty said
republicans wanted to work with the UUP "in partnership" to
achieve the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist Party, led by David Trimble,
also held a meeting over the weekend in a hotel at Glasgow airport
in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to plan the UUP's participation in the
Mitchell talks and to discuss whether the peace process deadlock,
over IRA disarmament, could be broken.
</P>
<P>
According to some newspapers, during the weekend strategy
meeting in Glasgow, the party's assembly group considered a
proposal to share power with Sinn Fein ahead of IRA
decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
But as UUP assembly members returned from Scotland, south
Tyrone MP Ken Maginnis insisted there would be no change in policy
without the backing of the party officials and the 110-member
executive.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Good Friday agreement, the UUP has
insisted it would not form an executive that included Sinn Fein
without the handover of at least some IRA weapons.
</P>
<P>
Reports had suggested the UUP assembly team was considering
several approaches to the decommissioning and devolution deadlock
blocking the formation of a multi-party executive in Northern
Ireland.

MEXICO CITY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Over 50 people dead in
downtown Celaya, some 300 kilometers northwest from Mexico City
after series of explosions and a fire destroyed a section the city
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the tragedy apparently began when a
fireworks storehouse across the street from the city bus station
exploded about 10:30 local time, starting a fire that caused
cooking gas tanks at nearby restaurants to explode a few minutes
later. The second explosion apparently trapped some rescuers who
had responded to the first blast.
</P>
<P>
Among those reported dead were a police officer, two Red Cross
workers, two fire fighters, a local reporter and four children.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican army was called in to help seal off the disaster
site and evacuate local residents. Fire fighters brought the blaze
under control by midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
So far, the explosion caused at least 50 people dead and 76
wounded.
