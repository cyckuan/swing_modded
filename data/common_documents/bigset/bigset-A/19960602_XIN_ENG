<P>
WASHINGTON, June 1 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said

Middle East would continue although Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres was defeated in the country's elections.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio address, Clinton said that he had talked
with Israeli Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu by telephone
and the incoming Israeli leader "said some very encouraging things
to me" about continuing the peace process in the region.

<HEADLINE> Academies Underscores Role of Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Scientists and engineers who have
met here prior to the Second United Nations Conference on Human
Settlements (HABITAT II) called on world leaders to place higher
priority on role of science and technology in solving urban
problems.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by representatives for 72 of the world's
academies of science claims that science and technology issues
are ignored in the document being prepared for HABITAT II, also
known as "city summit".
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism, Dr.Wally N'Dow, Secretary
General of HABITAT II, denied at a press conference today that
they have not realized the important role of science and
technology in urban development.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, science and technology are and must be the
foundation of our effort" for urban development, said N'Dow.
</P>
<P>
He added that science and technology can offer solutions to
problems that cities are suffering, such as inadequate housing,
traffic congestion, pollution, energy waste and insufficient water
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Nobel Laureate F. Sherwood Rowland, foreign secretary to the
U.S. National Academy of Sciences, said science and technology
have a crucial role and responsibility in providing solutions and
in ensuring the long-term sustainability of cities.
</P>
<P>
"But it cannot be done unless you have the education and
training in place to ensure that scientific capacity continues to
grow. And that concept, as well as others regarding science and
technology, is missing from the U.N. document." said Rowland.
</P>
<P>
The academies' statement also lists a series of new
discoveries in science and technology which can help solve some
of the problems facing megacities.
</P>
<P>
These include global positioning systems, biotechnology and
ecological engineering, disease surveillance and control, waste
disposal and recycling.

<HEADLINE> 11th Panchen Lama Initiated into Monkhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Panchen Lama, Panchen
Erdeni Losang Jizun Qamba Lhunzhub Qoigyijabu, was officially
initiated into the monkhood today in the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery,
the residence for successive Panchen Lamas in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Strictly in line with religious rituals, the initiation
ceremony was held in front of the statue of Sakyamuni, the founder
of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Today is the Sagadawa Festival in the Tibetan Calendar and also
the anniversary of the birth, achievement and nirvana of the
Buddha, Sakyamuni.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred monks started scripture recitations at 5:30
this morning with 11 senior monks joining them an hour later.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama, amid scripture recitations, saluted to
Kanpos (abbots at the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery) and presented them
with manzhals (offerings).
</P>
<P>
In return, Kanpos and senior monks began awarding the 11th
Panchen Lama monkhood status.
</P>
<P>
After the initiation ceremony, the 11th Panchen Lama put on a
brand-new kasaya, an outer vestment worn by a Buddhist monk.
</P>
<P>
Bomi Qambalozhub, a Kanpo, was very satisfied with the
ceremony, saying "the ceremony was carried out strictly in line
with religious rituals and was very successful and satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Tibet Autonomous Region and representatives of
the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee and
the Bureau of Religious Affairs under the State Council presented
hada to the 11th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
At 9:30, the 11th Panchen Lama began blessing people by
touching them on the head and then joined the scripture recitation
at 12:30, which lasted for three hours.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama was chosen in front of the statue of
Sakyamuni last December as the reincarnated boy of the late 10th
Panchen Lama through the practice of lot drawing from a gold urn
out of several candidates.

<HEADLINE> 11th Panchen Lama Leads Scripture Recitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIGAZE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 700 monks gathered at noon
today in the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, the residence for successive
Panchen Lamas in Tibet, waiting for the leading scripture reciter,
the 11th Panchen Lama, who was initiated into monkhood this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old Panchen Lama, wearing a brand-new kasaya, an
outer vestment worn by a Buddhist monk, sitting still, began
leading the scripture recitation in a sonorous voice.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama was chosen in front of the statue of
Sakyamuni last December as the reincarnated boy of the late 10th
Panchen Lama through lot drawing from a gold urn out of several
candidates in this lamasery with a history of more than 500 years.
</P>
<P>
He was then approved by the central government and enthroned
on December 8 last year.
</P>
<P>
With his efforts in the past five months, he is now versed in
the scriptures of Tibetan Buddism.
</P>
<P>
Losang, a 61-year-old Lama who entered the Lamasery at the age
of nine, said with tears rolling down his cheeks, "the
reincarnated Panchen Lama chosen through lot drawing from a gold
urn is efficacious as expected."
</P>
<P>
Senior monks in the Lamasery said that the 11th Panchen Lama is
extraordinarily smart and cute and he is doing well in his
studies and can recite seven kinds of basic scriptures.
</P>
<P>
The Panchen Lama is early to rise and early to sleep. Early
every morning, he attends scripture recitations and spends five to
six hours a day on his studies.
</P>
<P>
Although it was the first time that the 11th Panchen Lama led a
scripture in front of so many monks today, he remained energetic and
calm during the entire process which lasted for three hours.
</P>
<P>
Losang said: "The 11th Panchen Lama truly reflects the style of
great master the 10th Panchen Lama."
</P>
<P>
Sengqen Losang Gyaincain, honorary director of the Democratic
Management Committee of the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, pointing to the
golden board inscribed with the words "Safeguard the Country and
Benefit the People", which was presented by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, said the inscription serves as not only a high
assessment of all previous Panchen Lamas but also great
expectations for the 11th Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to bring up the 11th Panchen Lama into a
great religious leader with profound knowledge in Buddhism, a
master who is sociable, patriotic, devoted to Buddhism and the
cause of safeguarding the country and benefitting the people,"
Sengqen added.

<HEADLINE> Business, Labor Must Work Together: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 1 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki today called for greater participation by
business and labor in dealing with the issues of economic growth
and job creation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual summit of the National Economic
Development and Labor Council (NEDLAC) in Midrand, north of here,
Mbeki said the government was committed to the NEDLAC negotiating
process and concerned parties should unite to tackle the
challenges of job creation and the continued racial and gender
disparities in wealth, income and opportunity.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said while the transformation of South African society
would be a long and complex process, business, labor and
government should work together.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that NEDLAC provided the sectors of society
with the opportunity to promote and canvass their views to impact
on the government of the country.
</P>
<P>
While referring to the deepening divides between business and
labor, Mbeki warned parties not to treat the tabling of a point
of view for discussion as an act of hostility.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the government's lagging behind in drafting a
comprehensive economic policy, mbeki said the government was
addressing the issue with urgency and would present a combination
of measures to NEDLAC ranging from a macro-economic framework to
sectoral proposals ''as soon as possible''.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the summit, Mbeki said a policy
plan on the delivery of reconstruction and development program
goals would be presented to cabinet on June 12.

LUANDA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Angolan party, Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA),has reaffirmed its
determination to continue its efforts for realizing national
peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued yesterday to mark the fifth

The communique said the signature of the Bicesse agreement
five years ago by the Agolan government and the opposition UNITA
in Lisbon, Portugal, demonstrated that the Angolans can and
should solve their problem through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It said the agreement has opened broad prospects for peace in
Angola, but peace has'nt been achieved in the country since the
UNITA (the national union for the total independence of Angola)
failed to meet with the requests and willing of the people as

are the prerequisites for sustainable economic development in
Angola, the communique stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans' life expectancy is the
lowest in Africa, reported the local daily "The New Vision"
today.
</P>
<P>
The average Life expectancy for Ugandans has dropped from 45.7
years for males and 50.5 for females in 1991 to 42.2 and 44.3
years respectively at present, said the paper quoting a report
issued by U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) country director Francois
Farah.
</P>
<P>
Separate reports have attributed the decline to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The report lists 14 east African countries among which
Mauritius leads with 68.3 years for males and 75 for females.
</P>
<P>
Others are Burundi (49.4, 51.6), Madagascar (57.5, 60.5),

52.9), Zambia (45.4, 46.8) and Zimbabwe (49.8, 51.8).

<P>
The report said that Uganda's population, which now stands at

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Arab World Concerned About Fate of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- An atmosphere of concern prevails the
Arab world following the victory of Likud party leader Benjamin
Netanyahu in the Israeli general elections.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, King Hussein today expressed optimism that the
Middle East peace process will go on under Israel's new right-wing
government.
</P>
<P>
The king said he had "no fears whatsoever, nor suspicions" that
the peace negotiations were in danger.
</P>
<P>
His reaction was in sharp contrast to that of Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Syrian official newspapers, which usually reflects government
views, today criticized voters for choosing the hard-line Likud
party leader Netanyahu over Labor party's veteran leader Shimon
Peres in the elections.
</P>
<P>
"Electing Netanyahu exposes Israel as a war-loving country,"
the English-language Syria Times commented.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli voters should be ashamed for "choosing a war-maker
like Netanyahu and preferring war to peace," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic-language newspaper Tishrin reiterated today Syria's
commitment to the Middle East peace process on the basis of
land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Tishrin said peace started with a first, land-for-peace
step. But Netanyahu has strongly rejected the notion during his
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Boueiz told
reporters upon returning from an official visit to Germany and
France that Netanyahu's campaign platform was "negative."
</P>
<P>
"If he sticks to the platform, we definitely believe that his
election will have a negative impact on the peace drive," Boueiz
said.
</P>
<P>
Although Netanyahu had pledged to continue the peace process,
Boueiz added, "it means nothing because the bases (of the peace
process) which he sees are different from those on which we had
made our minds and agreed in Madrid (peace conference)."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Lebanon's position -- the peace should be based
on the principle of land-for-peace and a complete Israeli
withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued early today, the Palestine Liberation
Organization Executive Committee and the Palestinian Authority
cabinet urged Netanyahu to adhere to "everything that has been
agreed upon, including the beginning of talks on the final status"
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told the Middle East
News Agency that Netanyahu's victory "reflected the will of the
Israeli people."
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty
with Israel in 1979, is keen to establish a just and comprehensive
peace in the region, and it welcomes Netanyahu's show of
willingness to support the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Friday that Arab
leaders should adopt a wait-and-see approach to the change in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said it was wise to give the new Israeli prime minister
enough time to form his policies and positions on the peace
process, irrespective of the statements issued during the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government today still kept silent about the result
of Israeli elections, but local press warned Islamic countries of
pitfalls from Netanyahu premiership.
</P>
<P>
Two local English papers, Iran News and Tehran Times, said
Netanyahu's victory was a manifestation of Israel's expansionism.
</P>
<P>
The two papers, with strong background of Iran's foreign
ministry, warned the Islamic countries of the dangers to regional
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
"The victory of Netanyahu is a victory for extreme religious
factions in Israel," Iran News said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
The paper recalled that the Likud Party in its campaign
platform promised not to return the Golan Heights to Syria and
rejected a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times said today that Netanyahu's government can bury
the peace process and shake Israeli foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi said Peres' loss to Netanyahu
indicates that a show of military force is not enough to persuade
voters, and that should serve a lesson to U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to Israel's 16-day bombardment of south
Lebanon in April, which killed more than 100 people and caused
wide-spread criticism.
</P>
<P>
"The only important thing about the success of Likud and the
downfall of Peres is that the killing of children and the
destruction of peaceful cities will no longer constitute acts to
rely upon to win elections," Gaddafi said in a statement carried
today by the official JANA news agency.

KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Over 1,000 bags of banned

<HEADLINE> Uganda' Credit Scheme Boosted by 500,000 Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
released 500,000 US Dollars as part of the second phase of the
country's credit scheme, reported the local daily the New Vision
today.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State for Finance in charge of the scheme,
Wilberforce Kisamba Mugerwa, was quoted as saying here on Friday
that 6.6 million dollars will be given out in the second phase.
</P>
<P>
By December, 1995, a total of 6.42 million dollars had been
released to all the 214 counties in the 39 districts countrywide,
marking the end of disbursement of the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The credit scheme was designed by the government to loan money
to the poor people to enable them to start income-generating
projects.
</P>
<P>
The loans are vital since the poor in Uganda are unable to
obtain loans from the conventional financial and lending
institutions, which insist on security.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was officially launched at Kapchorwa, eastern
Uganda, on March 23 last year by President Yowerl Meseveni as
part of his un-poverty crusade launched by himself last year.

<HEADLINE> PLO Official Calls for More Consultations among </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Farouk Kaddoumi, head of the
Political Department of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), today called on Arab parties concerned with the Middle East
peace process to have more consultations among them.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi, currently on a visit to Egypt, said the consultations
are important as some Arab countries are in the process of
normalizing their relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PLO official said that he rejects the normalization process.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi, long considered the PLO's foreign minister, met with
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa today for talks mainly on
issues related to the regional peace process in light of the
Israeli elections, in which opposition Likud leader Benjamin
Netanyahu emerged as the winner. Netanyahu will replace Shimon
Peres to become the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Kaddoumi, who has been opposed to the direction in which the
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks were going, said it is necessary
to realize Arab solidarity as the current situation in the region
is "dangerous."
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Kaddoumi said that Netanyahu's victory in Israel's
elections may slow the peace process but won't derail it entirely.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes Likud and the Labor Party are largely the
same, but differed in tactics and the way they presented their
policies to the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
He urged Arab countries to hold a summit to better coordinate
their positions.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the lack of a clear-cut winner in the
Israeli elections indicated that Israel may not be ready for
peace.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Prospect for Netanyahu's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- A shift in the Israeli policy on
the peace process and international relations is looming after
Likud Party leader Benjamin Netanyahu won the race for premiership
over Labor party leader Shimon Peres by 50.4 percent to 49.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here say that as prime minister, Netanyahu
will have two basic options: One would be an explicit rejection of
the existing peace process and agreements between Israel and the
Palestinians, which is unlikely in view of his moves he made
before and after his elections.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu pledged his commitment to the peace process during
the election campaign, and repeated it to the Palestinian side
through his top political advisor soon after the election results
were announced Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The alternative approach for him is to try to remain within
what is permissible under the Oslo accords, but interpret them in
his way. Analysts say that this options is very likely.
</P>
<P>
Three pressing issues -- Hebron, Jewish settlements and
anti-terrorism activities -- may be cited to illustrate this
point.
</P>
<P>
On Hebron, Netanyahu has suggested that Israel stay there
until a final agreement, a stance clearly in violation of the
PLO-Israel Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, with a population of 94,000, is the last West Bank town
still occupied by Israel. According to the PLO-Israel peace
accord, Israeli soldiers were to have pulled out of most of the
city by March, remaining only in several downtown areas where 450
Jewish settlers live.
</P>
<P>
On the Jewish settlements, the Oslo accords permit building
within existing Jewish communities but do not allow their
expansion. Netanyahu has, however, pledged to invest huge amount
of money into the settlements.
</P>
<P>
As settlers claim outlying areas where no building has been
previously erected, his stance will bring about confrontations
with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords, Israel retains overall responsibilities
for security in Area B -- the Palestinian villages in the West
Bank, while the towns of Area A come under the jurisdiction of
the Palestinian Authority (PA). Thus, Netanyahu could send troops
into Area B in search for suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
This, however, would probably lead to confrontations between
the Israeli troops and the Palestinian police. If he orders
troops into Palestinian towns as he repeatedly claimed he would
during the election campaign, it may probably trigger even bigger
violent conflicts and constituting a violation of the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
In a nutshell, these would, at worst, lead to a halt to
the peace process, a reversal of Israel's gains in relations
with the Arab world, and problems with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu cabinet would also refuse to discuss any
concessions on Jerusalem. The abandonment of any Jewish
settlements would be out of the question, as would any form of
Palestinian independence.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, PA President Yasser Arafat would be
likely to reduce efforts to stop anti-Israeli attacks by Hamas or
other radical groups. Some of those currently supporting Arafat
would probably shift to the conclusion that Hamas was right all
along in denouncing the possibility of making peace. Thus, the
situation would become complicated.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Syrian track, Netanyahu has time and again
said that there would be no withdrawal from the Golan
Heights. This will make it certain that the Israeli-Syrian
talks would grind to a halt, and Damascus could always blame
Israel for the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
A conflict in the U.S.-Israeli relations would gradually
emerge as Washington's support for the peace process and
Netanyahu's vision come into collision. The extent of conflict
could be limited, as Netanyahu would be simultaneously trying to
maintain ties with it. But the warmth and extra benefits Israel
has derived in recent years would be probably cut back.
</P>
<P>
While Netanyahu voices support for continuing the peace
process, negotiations would become more difficult.

<HEADLINE> AL Official: Netanyahu Should Not Represent Only </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition leader Benjamin
Netanyahu, who won this week's Israeli elections, should not only
represent his Likud Party but all Israelis, including those who
voted for the incumbent prime minister Shimon Peres, an Arab
League (AL) official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who will become the new Israeli prime minister, will
be required to honor Israel's commitments to the Middle East peace
process, Arab League Assistant Secretary General for Political
Affairs Mowafaq al-Allaf was quoted by the Middle East News Agency
(MENA) as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have to wait to see what Netanyahu will do when he is in a
position of responsibility as compared to what he said during the
elections campaign," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Netanyahu said he would take a tougher
line than his predecessor in peace talks with the Palestinians and
Syria.

<HEADLINE> Elections over, Jerusalem Issue to Heat Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 1 (Xinhua) -- With the Israeli elections over,
the issue of Jerusalem became pressing in the Israeli-Palestinian
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of Palestinian Report, a weekly
issued by the Palestinian News Agency JMCC, there were indications
from the Israeli side that the Jerusalem issue may have been
"settled" before it ever reached the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team negotiating with the PLO unveiled last
week a proposal which would create two Jerusalems, but not
divide the so-called united Jerusalem, which will remain the
capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis were suggesting that the Palestinians establish
their capital in the town of Abu Dis, situated on the outskirts
southeast of Jerusalem, said the weekly.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis is located within the Jerusalem governorate in
accordance with the Jordanian Municipality Divisions. It sits
within Area B under the PLO-Israel Taba accord, while Ramallah
is designated as the West Bank commercial center.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Prime Minister's office, which authorized the
plan, says it gives Palestinians access to Jerusalem, and that if
the Palestinians agree to this proposal, Israel will provide
assistance through organizing funds to build up an international
trade and industrial center, and also guarantee access to the
holy sites.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, in his May 26 debate
with his rival Benjamin Netanyahu, said that his government
had an "understanding" with the PLO that Jerusalem would
remain the undivided capital of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, a new plan for the division of the Palestinian
self-rule districts prepared by the Palestinian Authority (PA)
Local Government Ministry created a new Jerusalem District,
which includes what is now East Jerusalem, the Old City, Abu
Dis, Ezzariya, Essawiyyah and 33 other surrounding villages.
</P>
<P>
Now, the PA has no authority over the Old City and East
Jerusalem proper. Critics of the plan complained that by
naming outlying suburbs like Abu Dis "Jerusalem," the PA will
facilitate an Israeli effort to keep the city "united."
</P>
<P>
PA negotiator Hassan Asfour has recently announced that the
PA has no intention of accepting the proposal announced by
the Israeli Prime Minister's office. He stressed that the
issue of Jerusalem is still under negotiation as part of the
final status talks.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Palestinians not to be misled by the Israeli
proposals and propaganda.
</P>
<P>
Three pressing issues, namely, Hebron, settlements and
Jerusalem, have surfaced in view of the prospect of changing
hands in the Israeli government. It is no doubt that
Jerusalem issue will be the hardest one to solve.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Israeli Society Divided over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Delegate to the Arab
League Mohamed Sobeih said the outcome of the Israeli elections
makes clear that the Israeli society is divided over the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih told Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) today that
Israel should honor the Israeli-Palestinian agreement to expand
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, which was signed in
Washington last September.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the statements made by Likud officials
during the elections campaign were aimed to woo the votes of the
right-wing supporters, stressing that the political positions of
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu, who won the elections and will
become Israel's new prime minister, will certainly change in the
light of the reality of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, Netanyahu said that he would expand Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, block the creation of a Palestinian
state and not discuss the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel can not maintain security and peace while it usurps the
rights of others, Sobeih said, underlining that Israel needs peace
more than any other party.
</P>
<P>
He said the future of the peace process will rely on Arab
solidarity and the U.S. role.

HANOI, June 2 (Xinhua-OANA) -- Italy's European Champions' Cup
holder Juventus beat Vietnamese national squad 2-1 in a soccer
friendly here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Italians, led by star striker Gianluca Vialli, failed to
penetrate the packed defense in the scoreless first half.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese apparently lost steam in the second half and had
to allow Vialli and Parente scored one each.
</P>
<P>
But the host saved part of the face when they pulled one point
back on a penalty.
</P>
<P>
Juventus, who did not put up its best team in this Asia tour,
had only Vialli and Lombardo as the big names and lost to South
Korea 4-0 in an earlier match.
</P>
<P>
Soccer became an increasingly popular sport in Vietnam after
the country won the single medal at the South East Asian Games
this year.

The national team is going to Germany and China to prepare for

round.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Government Silent on Israeli Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today still
kept silent on the results of Israeli elections though the local
press warned Islamic countries of pitfalls from Israeli opposition
party Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu's assumption of premiership.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Abrar today predicted that the Arab-Israeli
peace process will continue as before with no significant changes
despite the claims by Netanyahu during his election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The daily said in an editorial that the Camp David accord
between Israel and Egypt was signed during the leadership of the
right-wing Likud Party. The Madrid peace conference, which served
as the outset of direct Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, was held
during the premiership of Yitzhak Shamir who was also from the
Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the paper noted, the Likud prime minister can not go
back on a well-established policy of its party.
</P>
<P>
The editorial continued that "the Middle East peace process for
Israel is unavoidable" and irreversible with no way back.
</P>
<P>
Israel is under pressure from the Western governments,
Washington in particular, and it can not ignore the White House'
decision on the necessity of continuing the peace talks, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the paper said, the U.S. can use the threat of
withholding its massive financial and military assistance as a
lever to compel Tel Aviv to get back on the peace track.
</P>
<P>
The English daily of Iran News Saturday said in its editorial
that "the victory of Netanyahu is a victory for extreme religious
factions in Israel."
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the editorial stressed, it becomes an
absolute necessity for Islamic countries to unite and ward off the
common enemy.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged Islamic states to reject the ploy of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's administration to undermine Islamic
countries and weaken their unity.

<HEADLINE> China's First BOT Power Project Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China's first power project which
will be constructed in the form of BOT (building, operation and
transfer), has been approved by China's government departments and
will be solely funded by International Energy Group (IEG) of the
United States with a total investment of 1.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be built in Changshu, east China's Jiangsu
Province, will be built and operated by Jiangsu Power Construction
Corporation with an operation period of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the investment risks by the US company, China will
be responsible for other risks. According to official sources, the
power project with two 600,000-kilowatt generating units, will
start operation with the first unit starting power generation in
2000.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official said the foreign investor can sell its
shares after the power project is built and can also expand its
investment project to related business areas upon approval.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest industrial province, Jiangsu produced 940.1
billion yuan in industrial output value in 1995. Though the
province has a installed power capacity of over 10 million
kilowatts, it is hit by serious power shortage owing to rapid
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the province plans to build power plants with nine
million kilowatts in installed capacity in the next five years
known as China's Ninth Five-Year Plan period. To this end, the
province is seeking two billion US dollars of foreign funds, about
25 percent of the total investment needed.
</P>
<P>
To attract more investment, the province plans to give foreign
investors more preferential policies in building power projects
such as tax exemption for the first two years for projects with
more than ten years of operation periods.

The New York Times reported today that noise barriers are
rising along highways in urban and suburban areas around the
country, but in a too slow pace, largely because of the high
costs.
</P>
<P>
"since the early 1970s, when Federal regulations first defined
highway noise as an environmental nuisance, the sound barriers
have slowly caught on," it said. Each mile of barrier built
created demand for miles more -- on new roads, on existing roads
being widened or rebuilt, and on old roads, too.
</P>
<P>
In some states, the money the government has to spend on sound
barriers is far short from that required.
</P>
<P>
Experts said a 50 meter strip of thick vegetation would well
muffle the highway noise. But it is just not feasible to plant
thousands of miles of highways, according to the report. So most
barriers are made of cinderblock, wood, steel or pre-cast concrete
panels.
</P>
<P>
Most states build them for about 1 million U.S. dollars a mile,
including foundations and drainage. Usually sound barriers are 12
beet high, which will cut noise by 5 to 10 decibels. ( A
10-decibel reduction halves the noise level.)
</P>
<P>
Congress recently passed a bill that limits Federal money for
barriers on old highways. The logic is that residents who bought
homes near old highways knew what they were getting into.
</P>
<P>
And not everyone is delighted with the visual effects of the
concrete walls either. Sound barriers provide an ideal backdrop
for graffiti vandals, it said.
</P>
<P>
Some drivers have begun to complain about feeling hemmed in and
losing the view of the open road. But the prospect of building a
network of concrete canals is still a long way off, the paper
noted. The country has now fewer than 1,000 miles of highway with
barriers, growing at a snail's pace of 100 miles a year.

<HEADLINE> League Leader Dalian Ties August First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua/OANA) -- League leader Dalian Wanda
struggled to a 1-1 draw with August First in their home match in
an eighth round match of the Chinese Soccer League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
August First dominated the first half with effective attacks
and jumped to a 1-0 lead in the 26th minute in the northeastern
city of Dalian.
</P>
<P>
Luan Yijun scored easily when a Dalian defender intended to
head the ball out of the pitch for good but made a fatal mistake
by delivering it to Luan.
</P>
<P>
Dalian stepped up the offensive in the second half but would
have ruined its record of not losing a single home match in the
league for two years had Zhang Enhua not netted in the closing
minutes.
</P>
<P>
In the 89th minute, Zhang made a spectacular dive in the
penalty area to head the ball past the goalkeeper of August First.
</P>
<P>
In Guangzhou, Shanghai Shenhua, second in the league standings,
also played a draw tie with Guangzhou Songri 1-1 in a rain-soaked
pitch in Guangzhou's Tianhe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Shanghai opened the scoring on a
surprise shot in the 50th minute by Russian Baskov Vlaolislav just
outside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Songri responded with a goal in the following minute, when Zhou
Wendong beat Shanghai's Georgian goalkeeper Gocha Jurjoliani in
close range.
</P>
<P>
Shenhua's Wu Chengying was ousted from the match in the 78th
minute after receiving two yellow cards from the referee, who
handed out eight yellow cards overall in the action, including one
to star striker Fan Zhiyi.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, Beijing Guo'an shaked off its humiliating 3-0
defeat to Italy's Napoli last weekend to win a 3-1 victory over
lowly Sichuan Quanxin 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Li Hongzheng scored in the 13th minute, Deng Lejun added one
seven minutes later and Gao Hongbo converted a penalty kick to
seal the victory 21 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
Quanxin's Zou Yougeng scored the face-saving goal in the last
minute.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other matches, Guangzhou Apollo routed Yanbian
Hyudai 2-0 in Guangzhou, Tianjin Samsung tied Guangdong Hongyuan
0-0 in Tianjin and Jinan Taishan beat Guangdong Shenzhen 3-1 in
Jinan.

KIGALI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Some Rwandan ministers will visit
refugee camps in Tanzania to persuade Rwandan refugees to return
home voluntarily.

<P>
Dr. Anastase told reporters that the ministers' trip to the

Hundreds of thousands of Rwandans fled and settled down in
refugee camps in western Tanzania after the genocide in the
central African country in the second quarter of 1994.

<P>
The minister disclosed that in Tanzania, he was met by Prime
Minister Frederic Sumaye and several other cabinet ministers of
Tanzania.

centered on repatriation of Rwandan refugees in Tanzania and
bilateral relations between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 2 (Xinhua-OANA) -- Chinese Olympic swimmer Chen
Yan was confident of getting good performances in the upcoming
Atlanta Games, her coach said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time for Chen Yan to come here for a
plateau training, but she showed a quite good form after one
month's stay," said caoch Han Binyan before the Chinese swimming
team left for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan ranked second place for the women's 400 meters
freestyle in the world last year.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old sensation, who took four events at the Chinese
Olympic trials in Tianjin in April, had been training along with
other Olympians in suburban Kunming, the provincial capital of
southwestern Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Han said that after one month's hard workout, Chen improved her
oxygen usage and stamina and was "in high morale".
</P>
<P>
In Tianjin, Chen won the 200m, 400m, 800m in freestyle and 400m
individual medley to become the only Chinese swimmer who will
compete in the most events at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Chen will fully take advantage of the effects of the plateau
stay in Beijing for some intensitive training before the Olympics,
Han added.
</P>
<P>
But considering the humidity and heat in summer in Atlanta,
Chen will leave for in early July to accustom herself to the
climate there.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts had said the temperature could be as high as 38
degrees Centigrade and relative humidity 80 percent during the
Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Albania Begins Second Round of Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Albania began a second round of
general elections today with the boycott of major left-wing
parties, including the leading opposition Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
The first round of elections were staged May 26, in which
President Sali Berisha's ruling Democratic Party won 95 of the 115
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
A second round was arranged today as none of the candidates in
nine constituencies were able to gain a simple majority of votes
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of leftist parties, only the conservative
Democrats and six other rightist and center-right parties are
running for the parliament seats. Voters were not active in
polling today.
</P>
<P>
In order to win over other rightist parties, the Democrats
withdrew from three of the nine constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Albania was plunged into chaos after the May 26 election. All
nine opposition groups withdrew halfway through the polling in
protest of alleged irregularities of the Democratic Party, which
include manipulation of vote counts and harassment of opposition
candidates and electoral officials.
</P>
<P>
The allegations were later re-proved by international observers.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats claimed a landslide victory but the opposition
refused to recognize the results and demanded a fresh election
under "proper democratic conditions."
</P>
<P>
The opposition staged a rally in central Tirana Tuesday, which
was quashed by the riot police. About 100 opposition leaders
began a hunger strike Friday to press for fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the United States have urged the Balkan
nation to re-run the general elections in regions where
irregularities were reported.
</P>
<P>
So far, the authorities have agreed to hold reelections in
four constituencies.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims to Achieve Missile Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran has achieved the technology of
missile production, claimed Ahmad Dadbin, commander of the Ground
Forces of the Iranian Army, in a report carried in the recent
issue of the government-owned Kayhan Havai Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Dadbin termed the technology for missile production as "a great
achievement." However, he did not elaborated on the issue or gave
any detail about ranges of missiles Iran is manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
He said that hundreds of missiles were fired during the recent
"Velayat" military exercise which was said to be the biggest in
the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
Western reports said Iran has procured missiles with a range of
about 1,000 kilometers, or is producing Scud B missiles.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran only admitted they are building conventional
missiles but denied any purchase of 1,000 kilometers long-range
missiles from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from the DPRK Embassy in Tehran also rejected the
allegation, saying that "we only pay little attention to these
allegations because they are groundless."
</P>
<P>
According to an Iranian report, Iran's revolutionary guards
have possessed advanced ballistic missiles and Sam-2 and Sam-6
rockets.
</P>
<P>
Rahim Safavi, deputy commander-in-chief of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) said that the IRGC had also
manufactured ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Iran conducted four-day missile maneuvers in the
Persian Gulf waters, which were said to "have served as a warning
to the Israeli threat" to bomb Iran's first nuclear power plant in
Bushehr which is built by Russian experts.
</P>
<P>
The Ra'd (thunder) maneuvers, designed to test the missile
power of the IRGC, used missiles stationed along the Iranian
shores as well as missiles stationed on the ships.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States have alleged that Iran is seeking
to produce its own atomic weapon. Israel has even threatened to
make an air raid against the nuclear power plant.

<HEADLINE> Hometown of Chinese Sika Welcomes Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Dongfeng County in Northeast
China's Jilin Province, hometown of a black spotted deer or
Chinese sika - a rare breed of Asian deer - welcomes investment
from overseas to promote the sika breeding industry and develop
other natural resources.
</P>
<P>
For the 200th anniversary of artificial sika breeding, Dongfeng
County expects foreign businessmen to invest in sika breeding, the
refined processing of the pilose (hairy) antler, the production of
pilose antler drinks and the processing of sika by-products.
</P>
<P>
The county also wants to promote the trade of sika products
with foreign businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Dongfeng county also expects to cooperate with foreign
investors in growing vegetables, edible wild herbs, ginseng,
domestic fungus, producing mineral water and developing granite
and some other light industry products.
</P>
<P>
Dongfeng county is located at the juncture of the Changbai
Mountain area and the Northeast Plain. As early as 1796, during
the Qing Dynasty, residents there began to domesticate sikas.
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, the county was named "Royal Sika Farm," and
began contributing sikas and sika products to the royal courts.
</P>
<P>
New China's first state-run sika farm also was built in
Dongfeng County and in recent decades the farm has produced more
than 10,000 purebred sikas. The county's pilose antler products
have sold well in Japan, the Republic of Korea and Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 30 kinds of pharmaceuticals using sika
as a raw material have been exported to more than a dozen
countries worldwide. Sika products are believed to build energy
and revitalize the blood circulation. Products from pilose antlers
also are deemed to have healthful benefits.
</P>
<P>
To date, the county's eight state-run sika farms have about
18,000 sikas and the individually-run sika farms raise more than
20,000. Sika breeding has become one of the leading industries of
Dongfeng County.

<HEADLINE> 2nd-Phase Construction of Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China today launched the
second-phase construction of the Qinshan Power Plant in east
China's Zhejiang Province after years of preparatory work.
</P>
<P>
With two generating units each with a capacity of 600,000
kilowatts, the second-phase project of the Qinshan Nuclear Power
Plant was approved by the State Planning Commission at the end of
last year, and its construction period is planned for six
years. The project is meant to be completed in June 2003 and the
first power generating unit to go into operation a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2003 when the entire project is completed, the
plant will provide seven billion kilowatt/hour of electricity for
east China, which has built up a booming economy yet still suffers
from a serious power shortage.
</P>
<P>
In the ceremony to mark the beginning of the second-phase
project of the Power Plant, Wu Bangguo, vice-premier of the State
Council, said that as a new energy source, nuclear power has
become known by more and more ordinary people. China is expected
to start building four nuclear power plants before the turn of the
century with their total installed capacity reaching 6.6 million
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the purpose of developing nuclear power is not
only aimed at easing the country's power shortage. But More
importantly, he added, China should have a good and all-round
mastery of the relevant technology, so as to lay a solid
foundation for achieving still greater progress in its power
industry in the next century.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in Shanghai Up in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Dozens of foreign businessmen
crowded into Shanghai's commercial and industrial administrations
to get approval in the first quarter this year, and nearly seven a
day have gotten permits for Shanghai's bustling market, a city
official says.
</P>
<P>
China's biggest municipality has 15,106 foreign-funded firms,
619 of them added in the first quarter, adding 27 billion yuan in
investment.
</P>
<P>
The official said that because of high labor and raw material
costs, large enterprises are more interested in Shanghai than
medium and small-sized ones, and that 93 newcomers invested 10-30
million US dollars, up 11 percent from the end of last year, and
424 invested more than 30 million US dollars, up 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
Solely-owned foreign-funded companies grew faster than joint
ones. There are 3,161 in Shanghai now, accounting for 21 percent
of the total number of foreign-funded companies, a growth of
nearly six percent over last year. This was in contrast to the
more than 8,700 joint companies, which grew 3.6 percent,
accounting for 58 percent of the total number.
</P>
<P>
The service industry got preferential treatment from local
government in accordance with Shanghai's goal of becoming an
international economic, trade, and financial center, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign-funded service firms in Shanghai was
4,538 with investment of 43 billion US dollars, accounting for
55.6 percent of the total investment.
</P>
<P>
Large profits for foreign businessmen have attracted more to
Shanghai, the official said, citing statistics for the first two
months of this year, showing that sales of foreign-funded
companies were 28 billion yuan (3.4 billion US dollars), an
increase of 60 percent from 1995.

Interest rates running above 30 percent were a result of the
government's "colossal" borrowing on the domestic market that
contradicted the professed intention to localize the economy,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The UP also finds itself concerned at the amount of
corruption that pervades every facet of the government and local
government institutions. The ruling ZANU PF has institutionalized
corruption to a frightening degree," said Manyemba.
</P>
<P>
He said, "hefty" bribes were being paid by people intending to
acquire houses built by the Ministry of Public Construction and
National Housing "from their taxes".
</P>
<P>
"More often than not the people who are getting these houses
built from public funds are not the intended beneficiaries, but
those who can afford the heftiest bribes and those who are either
concubines of, or well connected to, top government officials,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Securities Supervisor Arrested for Taking Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 2 (Xinhua) - Chief of South Korea's stock
supervisory board was arrested Sunday on a charge of receiving
bribes from businesses in return for helping them list their
shares on the Seoul bourse, Yonhap News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Paik Won-Ku, head of the Securities Supervisory Board (SSB),
was charged with taking 141,000 dollars from ten firms in listing
and sales of their shares on the Korea Stock Exchange, Yonhap
quoted prosecutors as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of offering them business benefits in
connection with mergers and acquisitions and probes of illegal
sales of stocks.
</P>
<P>
In one case, Paik allegedly accepted 10 million won (about
13,000 dollars) from the chief of an information and communication
firm in mid-March, when the chief asked Paik to arrange for the
firm to be listed on the Korea Stock Exchange, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
Paik, 56, has confessed to receiving up to 25,640 dollars from
each company, they said.
</P>
<P>
The investigation may include some officials at the Ministry of
Finance and Economy, which controls the powerful stock supervisory
board, Yonhap said.

<HEADLINE> Seles Sails into French Open Quarter-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- American Monica Seles beat Bulgarian
Magdalena Maleeva 6-1, 6-1 to advance into the quarter-finals of
the French Open tennis championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Playing Maleeva for the first time since the day she was
stabbed three years ago, Seles needed only 52 minutes to dispose
of the Bulgarian to set up a clash with Czech Jana Novotna in the
next round.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who shared the world number one spot with Germany's
defending champion Steffi Graf, slammed four aces and numerous
clean winners while Maleeva had a score of unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
Seles met Maleeva last time on April 30, 1993 in Hamburg,
Germany, where she was stabbed in the back by a Graf fan during
the changeover after the seventh game of the second set.
</P>
<P>
"At the changeover, it was really tough," Seles conceded during
Sunday's match. "I knew that before coming in. I told myself to
keep going and to try not to think about it."
</P>
<P>
This was also the first time that Seles returned to the French
Open since winning her third straight title in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who missed nearly four months this year with an injury
to her left shoulder, seemed to be unaffected and has yet to lose
a set in four matches here.
</P>
<P>
In the other women's fourth round match, 10th-seeded Novotna
scored a 6-1, 7-5 win over unseeded Irina Spirlea of Romania.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, 13th-seeded Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands
won 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 against Sweden's unseeded Jonas Bjorkman in the
men's competition to enter the last eight.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Trade Food, Medicines for Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today approved the proposed counter-trade of Philippine food and
medical supplies for Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, President Ramos
said:" The Philippine International Trading Corporation (PITC)
welcomes the opportunity to again participate in supplying food
and medicines to Iraq under a no-dollar, counter-trade
arrangement."
</P>
<P>
He said the PITC was the official supplier of sugar, coconut
oil and medicines to Iraq under the Philippine-Iraq
20-million-dollar goods-for-debt settlement agreement reached in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told the Iraqi leader that the Philippine government will
assist in the necessary representations with the United Nations on
the required authorization for the counter-trade arrangement.
</P>
<P>
According to a news release from the office of the Philippine
press secretary, the counter-trade arrangement is consistent with
the terms of the recently-approved Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food
agreement allowing Iraq to export one billion U.S. dollars worth
of oil each quarter to raise money strictly for humanitarian
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said the
PITC is targeting 20 to 30 percent of the one billion dollars
worth of oil every quarter.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said the counter-trade agreement would be a good
promotion for Philippine products "with the view towards active
trade with Iraq after the (United Nations) sanctions are lifted."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed trade sanctions on Iraq in August
1990 following its invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Tribunal on
Rwanda's Genocide expects to receive suspects from Cameroon soon to
join three other accused awaiting trial in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The local paper ''Sunday Observer'' today quoted tribunal officials
as saying that tribunal registrar Onico Adede had gone to Cameroon to
arrange for several accused to be transferred to the tribunal
headquarters where cells are being prepared.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 Rwandans held by Cameroon are former Rwanda army
colonel Theoneste Bagosora, sought by the tribunal and Rwanda as
allegedly a leading organizer of the 1994 killings of up to a million
minority Tutsi tribe members and Hutu moderates.
</P>
<P>
A defense lawyer in Arusha said Adede left for Cameroon last Friday
and would bring four suspects including Bagosora back along with him.
</P>
<P>
Bagosora was arrested in March and is wanted by Belgium in
connection with the killing of 10 Belgian U.N. peacekeepers at the
start of the three-month genocide in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
U.N. tribunal president judge Laity Kama said on Friday the
prosecution had issued requests for national courts in Belgium,
Switzerland and Cameroon to defer to the tribunal's jurisdiction and
hand over suspects in detention for trial.
</P>
<P>
''We have passed the stage of infancy and are now walking on our
own,'' Kama told a news conference after the arrangement last Thursday
and Friday of the first three accused to appear in dock over the
genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Senegaless judge described the first court appearances in
Arusha by suspects as ''historic moments'' and said the work of the
tribunal is vital to promote reconciliation in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal judges were installed in June last year for a four
year term.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Sets New Fund helping Foreign investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 2 (Xinhua)--Kuwait has decided to form its
first investment fund aimed at helping direct investment in new
ventures and development of the existing companies in the
economic sector, according to official sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Monetary controller at the audit office in Kuwaiti Finance
Ministry Mazen Madowa said the fund would offer foreign companies
accredited in the offset program investment opportunities and
help them realize the program's targets in introducing advanced
technology and expertise to the country and finding new job
opportunitis for the Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
He said the new fund aims to raise 50 million (167 million US
dollars) to 100 million Kuwait Dinars (334 million US Dollars) and
will provide a channel for foreign companies that must meet
investment targets set by the Kuwaiti government's offset program.
</P>
<P>
"The main investors are going to be companies with offset
obligations," while local private companies and possibly
government organizations may also participate, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The counter-trade offset program was set up in 1992 and
ensures that foreign companies that win major government supply
contracts "offset" some of the contract's value in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
The new fund called Offset Direct Investment Fund will be
managed by the local Industrial Investment Company. The Finance
Ministry had approved the plans and the fund could now seek a
licence from the Commerce and Industry Ministry, which would take
up to three months, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the funds would be invested inside Kuwait
and the remaining 20 percent to be invested offshore.

<HEADLINE> Two Greek-Cypriot Dailies Shuts Within Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Greek-Cypriot daily newspaper
"Vima" became the second newspaper to cease publication on Sunday
following the suspension of "Eleftherotypia" on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Director Frixos Colotas of the daily announced Saturday that
the paper was being suspended indefinitely because of financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
"Vima", which sold an average of 1,500 copies a day, first came
out on April 17, 1992. It was the mouthpiece of the Free Democrats
Movement (Ked), led by former President of the Republic George
Vassiliou.
</P>
<P>
The decision for the suspension of the newspaper came less
than a week after the May 26 parliamentary elections in which Ked
received 3.69 percent of the vote and two seats in the House of
Representatives, becoming the only new-comer party in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Cypriot daily "Eleftherotypia", mouthpiece of the
center-right Democratic Party, was indefinitely suspended on
Thursday after it too declared huge losses.
</P>
<P>
The paper, established 15 years ago, had a daily circulation
of about 2,200 copies.
</P>
<P>
A third newspaper, "Nea", mouthpiece of the socialist Edek
Party is going back to its Sunday weekly publication after going
daily for some period before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the announcement of "Vima" suspension, President
 of Cyprus Journalists Union, Andreas Kannaouros, said that the
Union called both the government and the publishers to help the
Cyprus press solve its problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Publisher's Union warned that many other local
publications might be forced to close down because of rising
production costs, lack of state support and rising union
demands.

<HEADLINE> China Opens First "Big Foot" Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The country's first museum dedicated
to China's purported "Big Foot", has opened in the Shennongjia
Nature Reserve, said to be the home of the creature.
</P>
<P>
Items on display include samples of hair and plaster models of
footprints collected by scientists over the past years, which are
said to be evidence of the existence of the half-ape, half-man.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by forests of bamboo and China fir, the museum also
features documents and pictures of various operations mounted to
investigate the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s both scientists and amateurs have been
searching for the creature in the Shennongjia Valley in central
China's Hubei Province, as well as in the Himalaya Mountains. The
latest expedition was mounted last year. However, no conclusive
evidence of the existence of a Chinese "Big Foot" has emerged so
far.
</P>
<P>
As more scientists become skeptical about the existence of the
creature, the local people become more insistent on telling
visitors about their "local hero".
</P>
<P>
"All the materials in the museum are genuine," said Chen Renlin,
chairman of the Shennongjia Cultural Research Society and himself
a "Big Foot" expert.
</P>
<P>
He said many materials are first hand and provided by reliable
people who claim to have seen the two-meter-tall apeman, who is
said to be covered in red hair.
</P>
<P>
For the Shennongjia local government, the inauguration of the
museum is part of its tourism promotion program.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the museum has attracted an average of some
1,000 tourists every day since it opened on May 17.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
is expected to pay a two-day official visit to the European Union
(EU) and Belgium Monday, Turkish reliable sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Yilmaz will hold talks with EU officials
on the relations between Turkey and the EU and with his Belgian
counterpart Jean-Luc Dehaene on the bilateral ties as well as
regional and international issues concerning the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Yilmaz will discuss with EU officials the
reason why Greece has placed financial and political obstacles in
the relations between Turkey and the EU, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In March, Turkey and the EU agreed to establish a necessary
partnership council, but it has not been realized due to the Greek
opposition.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the customs union with the EU took effect as of
January 1, 1996, the EU should have supported an aid of 375
million ECU to Turkey, but the EU has not so far sent this aid to
Ankara due to the Greek obstacles.
</P>
<P>
With the economic integration with the EU, Turkey will remove
its customs tariffs on industrial goods from the EU.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Activists To Launch Jewish Growth Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of Jewish activists have
already devised a plan to greatly expand Jewish development in
the Arab East Jerusalem under a new Likud government led by
Binyamin Netanyahu, according to a report of The Jerusalem Post
today.
</P>
<P>
The 15-point plan drawn by the Jerusalem Forum includes
building Jewish housing projects in the Ras Al-Amud neighborhood,
in the City of David section of Silwan, and on the Mount
of Olives next to the Beit Orot Yeshiva, in the A-Tur
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Shmuel Meir from the National Religious
Party, who heads the Jerusalem Forum, came up with the plan
together with Matti Dan of Ateret Cohanim, and David Be'eri of
Elad -- groups that promote Jewish settlement in Arab
neighborhoods -- and other forum members.
</P>
<P>
The plan also touches on other areas in addition to
Jewish development-- calling for the immediate closure of Orient
House and 50 other Palestinian offices allegedly connected with
the Palestinian Authority in the city, and the eviction of
Palestinian security agents from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We have been preparing ground work for years for the
time when a government that truly supports Jerusalem as the
eternal capital of the Jewish people would come to power,"
Meir told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Meir said that the plan, which includes a call for
Israeli sovereignty to be expanded to include Ma'aleh Adumim,
Givat Ze'ev and Betar, would be presented to Netanyahu early
this week.
</P>
<P>
"We already own much land and many homes in east
Jerusalem, but have waited until now to take them over because
of the former government's opposition," Meir said.
</P>
<P>
A major part of the plan is road expansion in east
Jerusalem. The Jerusalem Forum is demanding the construction of
the east Jerusalem beltway, Route 45 linking the coastal
plain, and a tunnel under Mount Scopus.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for the construction of the Har Homa
neighborhood, a controversial project in southern Jerusalem held
up for years because of Palestinian opposition and legal
battles. The neighborhood is aimed at creating a continual
stretch of Jewish development between Gilo and East Talpiot.
</P>
<P>
Meir and the settlement activists are also calling for the
completion of the Western Wall tunnel, held up for years
because of opposition of Wakf, the Moslem religious authority
that runs the mosques on the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Meir said the plan is aimed at strengthening Israel's hold
on Jerusalem.

<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Deafening Explosions twice rocked
Nigeria's only armament factory, the Defense Industries Corporation,
in the northern Kaduna state on saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted eyewitnesses as saying that both
explosions discharged huge bails of flames that lit the whole of
Kakuri, South kaduna where the factory is situated, for at least 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no official announcement on the explosions.
</P>
<P>
The flames were immediately smothered by the factory's fire
fighters, they said.
</P>
<P>
Details of casualities and the cause of the explosions were still
hazy but military sources said many bombs have exploded in the
factory established about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cautious sources said the explosions could be ''accidental'',
resulting from improper handling of explosives
manufactured in the factory before they are conveyed to the
corporation's stores located outside the complex.
</P>
<P>
Some are of the view that the explosions were delibrately done by
terrorists. But evidences have not shown up yet for the military has
shunned any visit by outsiders.

<HEADLINE> China to Tighten Labor Export Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to standardize the
application procedures for labor exports, "China Daily" reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to avert overlapping and redundant
administration and to bring order to the industry, the English
paper cited Li Rongmin, an official with the Foreign Economic
Co-operation Department of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation, as saying.
</P>
<P>
A new regulation has asked agencies to obtain government
approval before they can contract Chinese labor for overseas
projects, the paper revealed.
</P>
<P>
The previous procedures had some problems, including shady
practices and loopholes in management. "Often, workers are cheated
by foreign contractors. for example, people may be sent abroad
without work to do there," Li explained.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rule, agencies still engaged in the
business without proper authorization will be weeded
out. Contracted laborers hired through such channels will find it
impossible to get necessary passports and visas.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, contracted laborers for overseas employment must
comply with State rules, regardless of the type of passport they
carry, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979 when China began to open to the rest of the world,
1.1 million Chinese have gone overseas as contract laborers, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, in the last couple of years the expansion of the
industry has been hindered by a number of factors, including
protectionism in some developed countries, ideological differences
and challenges from developing countries which can offer lower
labor prices.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the changes in the labor export policy will
"ensure the healthy development of the industry" in the long run.

<TEXT>
<P>
DARA ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The wreckage of the mv Bukoba
which sank on Lake Victoria, will not be retrieved because the
exercise would be more costly than buying a new ship.
</P>
<P>
Acting director of shiping in the Ministry of Communications
and Transport Justus Blazi said here over the weekend that the
government may only recover some jseful equipment from the wreckage
like engines.
</P>
<P>
"It is not worthwhile to tug it out but some useful equipment may
be recovered," Blazi said.
</P>
<P>
He added the government would not afford to hire a floating crane
to tug out wreckage of the sunken ship, about 30 meters underwater.
</P>
<P>
Blazi said even if they got a heavy floating crane it would be
impossible to tug out the sunken ship because a colossal amount of
money would be needed to transport the crane to Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
He noted if the wreckage was left underwater, it would not affect
the smooth passage of other vessels operating on the lake.

<HEADLINE> GCC Fails to Reach Agreement on Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 2 (Xinhua)--The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries have failed to reach an agreement on an unified
customs tariff but promised to make it later this year.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported today that GCC Finance and Foreign
Ministers met on Saturday in Saudi Arabian capital Riyad and
decided to delay the agreement until September for further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
The difference of customs tariffs among the six GCC member
states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Oman and Qatar, was the main obstacle to trade expansion,
it was understood.
</P>
<P>
However, Omani Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Yousef Bin
Alawi Bin Abdallah told reporters that the GCC had endorsed a
proposal by the general secretariat for imposing an eight percent
common tariff starting at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Second Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Nasser
Al-Roudhan said that the meeting scheduled for September will
discuss a mechanism to implement the proposal which envisages an
average of the minimum and maximum tariff rates currently imposed
by the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states have debated over a common tariff for several
years but it was blocked by differences on the level of the new
duties and insistence by some members to maintain selective high
tariffs to protect their burgeoning industries.
</P>
<P>
Now Customs tariffs in the GCC vary widely, with Saudi Arabia
and Bahrain imposing duties of more than 20 percent on some
imports and the United Arab Emirates and Oman levying below five
percent while Kuwait is imposing the lowest tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The delay of a unified tariff system has hindered the long
proposed establishment of a common market among the GCC
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bin Abdallah said the issue of customs tariffs unification was
also the most important issue on the agenda of the talks with the
European Union and one of the major requirements for membership
of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
A two-year deadline was set during the latest meeting between
the GCC and the European Union to reach a free trade agreement,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Ports of entry are playing an
increasing important role in the economic expansion of east
China's Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, one of China's most economically developed provinces,
has set up a dozen international air routes, and its shipping
lines link up with more than 400 sea ports in more than 100

<HEADLINE> Shinshinto Veteran Urges Party Reform Before Next Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior member of the Japanese main
opposition Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) on Sunday called for an
overhaul of the party, whose decision right was allegedly gripped
by the few powerfuls, before the next parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Hajime Funada, 42, suggested in a commentary contributed to the
June issue of Gendai (modern times) magazine that he may quit the
party if efforts to shake it up fail, the Kyodo News Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
In the article, Funada bitterly criticized party head Ichiro
Ozawa's leadership, accusing his aides of overriding party
executives in making policy decisions through "closed-door
politics."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile. appearing on a Fuji Television program, he welcomed
a pack of reform moves within the party following his dismissal
last month as deputy head of its decision-making executive council.
</P>
<P>
"The time limit (for reform) is until the next general election
(for the House of Representatives)," said Funada, who was in
effect fired from the post for supporting a proposal for the
formation of a new political force to be led by Yukio Hatoyama,
secretary general of New Party Sakigake, the smallest partner in
the tripartite ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
"We must give top priority to our party colleagues winning the
next election. We must be cautious toward hasty action before the
election," Funada said, referring to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said he will consider joining an anti-leadership group in
the Shinshinto led by the party's vice-president Tsutomu Hata if
the reform efforts fail.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Senior Likud Official Outlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from Israel's
Likud bloc has declared that the new Israeli government, to be
formed in 10 days, will honor the Oslo agreement reached by the
outgoing Labor-led government with the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO).
</P>
<P>
But he also said the pace of the Middle East peace will depend
on the Palestinian ability to control terror, reported Israel
Radio today.
</P>
<P>
Dan Meridor, Likud Member of Knesset (parliament), billed for
the defense portfolio or other senior post in the new government,
told the radio that Likud started the peace process almost 20
years ago with Menachem Begin and it continued with Yitzhak Shamir
in Madrid in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu has defeated Labor Party leader
Shimon Peres in the recent Israeli national elections for the
premiership.
</P>
<P>
Meridor said: "We did not like the Oslo agreement. We thought
it a bad agreement. We still think it is." "But it is part of the
reality that we inherit from the present outgoing government."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement is part of the reality and violation by the
other side of the agreement is part of this reality. We have to
take it from there and continue the peace process in search for
peace and do it in our way, that is to say, a cautious way, a
gradual way, giving very heavy weight to the security elements in
the process and in the agreement in an effort to stabilize the
situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I would say that negotiations can be useful and constructive
only if there is stability. That means no terror accompanying
negotiations. Stability may be built on the positive side by
cooperating with Palestinians wherever there are common
interests. We have interests in that they have. But on the
negative side, I think, it should be clear that we will not allow
conflicts to deteriorate into terror," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Likud official warned: "If anybody thinks that one is to
be given everything he wants and otherwise he will resort to
terror, that is a great mistake. And we should establish a
situation on the positive and negative sides and only with
stability will negotiations be able to continue."

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Recovery of bodies from the
sunken mr Bukoba is continuing at a slow pace, however, the speed of
divers was faster yesterday compared to the last three days, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Thirty two bodies were retrieved yesterday, bringing to 391 the
number of bodies which had so far been recovered from the ship
which capsized 12 days ago, causing death to over 500 people.
</P>
<P>
According to Mwanza Regional Commissioner (RC), James Luhanga,
conditions of the recovered bodies were not good because of low
temperature underwater.
</P>
<P>
"Even identification of the bodies is not that difficult because
most of the fished-out bodies have name tags," the RC explained.
</P>
<P>
Luhanga assured that recovery of the bodies would not be
abandoned adding that divers would fish out as many bodies as possible.
</P>
<P>
Nine senior marine officials, including Captain of the sunken
vessel Jumanne Rume, appeared in court on Wednesday, last week,
charged with the murder of 615 people who had boarded the sunken
ship.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Decide on Hebron Redeployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israel's current prime minister,
Shimon Peres, will not deal with the redeployment in the West Bank
town of Hebron, but leave the decision to his successor Benjamin
Netanyahu, according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said this was announced late last night by Peres's
spokeswoman Aliza Goren, who said that Peres will not order the
Israeli army to withdraw from Hebron before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
Likud Chairman Netanyahu, who defeated Peres by 50.49 percent to
49.51 percent of the total votes in the May 29 elections, is to
become the first directly elected prime minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"There were elections, and we will not be part of any 'grab'
before leaving power," said Goren, while adding that Peres
expected Netanyahu to abide by the Oslo accords with the
Palestinians, which call for such a redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media pointed out that it seemed that some people
around Peres believe that a preemptive redeployment in Hebron
would make things too easy for the new premier, and instead they
would like him to grapple with the problem himself.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo 2 accord, Israeli army was supposed to
pull back from about 85 percent of the Hebron area by March
28. However, following a series of suicide bombing attacks, Peres
delayed the redeployment.
</P>
<P>
During his election campaign, Netanyahu has said that he would
like the Hebron issue to be part of the final status arrangements
with the Palestinians. But, at the same time, he also said he
would stand by international agreements.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Netanyahu authorized a top aide to
make initial phone contact with top Palestinian official Mahmoud
Abbas, making it the first time the right-wing Likud has
officially made contact with the PLO.
</P>
<P>
Dore Gold, Netanyahu's informal foreign policy adviser who is
expected to be a key player in the peace process under a new
government, initiated contact for the newly elected premier
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a courtesy phone call," said Gold, "but I was
authorized to convey to Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen, that a
mechanism of contact with the PNA (Palestinian National
Authority) will be made once the government is formed."
</P>
<P>
He said that since it was a courtesy call, no substantive
issues were discussed, and there were no plans for a meeting at
this time between him and Abbas, deputy to PNA President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He also added that he obtained Abbas's phone number from his
own contacts, and it was not due to any intervention of a third
party such as the United States.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today praised neighboring Ukraine for having shipped all its
nuclear warheads to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma announced Saturday that it
had shipped to Russia the last of the nuclear weapons it inherited
from the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today, Yeltsin hailed the close
cooperation between Moscow and Kiev in dismantling and
transferring the nuclear warheads, noting the political, economic
and technological difficulties encountered.
</P>
<P>
"Common sense and commitment to international obligations
always took the upper hand," Yeltsin said, pledging further
cooperation with Ukraine in security affairs.
</P>
<P>
Under an accord signed in January 1994 by presidents of Russia,
Ukraine and the Untied States, Kiev agreed to get rid of its
nuclear weapons by this month in exchange for economic assistance
from Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
When the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991, Ukraine inherited
about 2,000 nuclear warheads left on its territory.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Subterranean springs will soon
replace heavily polluted Huangpu River to supply daily drinking
water for Shanghai, China's leading industrial city.
</P>
<P>
So far the city has dug 1,200 groundwater wells, and
inhabitants nearby are expected to be the first users in the near
future, according to an official with the office of water planning
under municipal government.
</P>
<P>
Results of scientific research show that the groundwater of the
city has an age of more than 100,000 years, bearing many kinds of
trace elements indispensable humans.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the groundwater is also proved to be as good as
the mineral waters sold on domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The official said that because such a recovery project is not
costly, the price of pipelined groundwater will be at an
affordable level.
</P>
<P>
Until now the Huangpu River, a severely contaminated tributary
of the Yangtze River, has been the only source of drinking water
for Shanghai's 13 million people.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China's Defense Industry Lures Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The defense industry in Southwest
China's Guizhou province has become a major field of overseas
investment in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial office of science, technology and
industry for national defense, over the last five years, the
sector has established 55 joint ventures with businesses from
Japan, Germany, the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
These joint ventures are in the fields of electronics,
machinery and automobile parts. They have so far used 110 million
U.S. dollars worth of overseas capital, office director Lei Xun
said.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures which were first to start have already begun
to turn out remarkable profits for investors, Lei said.
</P>
<P>
China built a number of defense industry enterprises in the
great mountains of Guizhou in the 1960s and 1970s, when China
thought a world war was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
In recent years many of these enterprises have been moved to
nearby cities or close to the railway system. Their advantages in
management, technology and personnel also appeal to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has helped defense industry enterprises
upgrade their technologies and adjust the structure of their
products, making their products more competitive in the market,
Lei said.

Local press reports today quoted eyewitnesses as saying that both
explosions discharged huge bails of flames that lit the whole of
Kakuri, South kaduna where the factory is situated, for at least 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
So far there is no official announcement on the explosions.
</P>
<P>
The flames were immediately smothered by the factory's fire
fighters, they said.
</P>
<P>
Details of casualities and the cause of the explosions were still
hazy but military sources said many bombs have exploded in the
factory established about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Cautious sources said the explosions could be ''accidental'',
resulting from improper handling of explosives
manufactured in the factory before they are conveyed to the
corporation's stores located outside the complex.
</P>
<P>
Some are of the view that the explosions were delibrately done by
terrorists. But evidences have not shown up yet for the military has

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Starts Coalition Talks today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu starts intensive talks today with potential
partners on forming his new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, leader of the Likud bloc who ousted outgoing Prime
Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the Labor Party, with a
razor-thin lead in the recent national elections, intended to form
his new government within 10 days, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has appointed his long-time right-hand man and Likud
director- general Avigdor Lieberman to head the transition
team. A team was also created on conducting the coalition
negotiations, which began this morning in the Knesset (Israel's
parliament), they said.
</P>
<P>
One representative for each of the potential coalition
partners was invited to attend the preliminary session.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman will be in charge of the talks with Yisrael
Ba'aliya, who belongs to a new Russian immigrant party which won 7
seats in the new Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert and MK Moshe Katsav will head the
the talks with Shas and United Torah Judaism (UTJ), who represent
the two religious parties which gained 10 and 4 Knesset seats
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Mordechai will negotiate with the National Religious
Party (NRP) (9 seats), Tzahi Hanegbi and Doron Shmueli will lead
talks with the Third Way (4 seats) and Moledet (2 seats).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, MKs Michael Eitan and Yehoshua Matza will be in
charge of working out the composition of the various Knesset
committees.
</P>
<P>
Lieberman is ticked to be named director-general of the Prime
Minister's Office, and Danny Naveh, Netanyahu's another close
aide, will be appointed cabinet secretary, Likud sources said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that David Levy, leader of Gesher, will be
awarded with the foreign affairs portfolio. Gesher and Tsomet,
led by Rafael Eitan, are two campaigning partners of the Likud.
</P>
<P>
The defense portfolio will most likely go to Yitzhak
Mordechai. Two other possible candidates for the post are Olmert
and MK Dan Meridor. Former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon is
expected to take over the finance portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu does not intend to amend the law and expand his
government from the current 18-minister limit and will likely
allocate two cabinet seats to Shas and the NRP each, and one to
the UTJ, Yisrael Ba'aliya and the Third Way each, the English
daily Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the heads of Shas, the NRP and UTJ will meet
tonight to coordinate their positions in the coalition talks and
will reach an agreement on dividing cabinet portfolios among
them, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The three religious parties oppose Netanyahu's plan to
allocate one minister for every four Knesset seats for the
coalition partners but for every three seats for Likud party, the
radio added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DARA ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The wreckage of the mv Bukoba
which sank on Lake Victoria, will not be retrieved because the
exercise would be more costly than buying a new ship.
</P>
<P>
Acting director of shiping in the Ministry of Communications
and Transport Justus Blazi said here over the weekend that the
government may only recover some jseful equipment from the wreckage
like engines.
</P>
<P>
"It is not worthwhile to tug it out but some useful equipment may
be recovered," Blazi said.
</P>
<P>
He added the government would not afford to hire a floating crane
to tug out wreckage of the sunken ship, about 30 meters underwater.
</P>
<P>
Blazi said even if they got a heavy floating crane it would be
impossible to tug out the sunken ship because a colossal amount of
money would be needed to transport the crane to Lake Victoria.

-- The United States assistant secretary of state for democracy,
human rights and labor, John Shattuck, began his week-long tour to
Nigeria on Saturday.

This was the first visit by a senior U.S. government official to
Nigeria since the results of the general elections in 1993 was
cancelled by the military. Shattuck's tour is believed to be a
fact-finding one aimed at reassessing the bilateral relations which
has been frozen during the past three years.

<HEADLINE> Two-Tier Licensing Scheme in Derivatives in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will adopt
a two-tier licensing scheme for banks and other financial
institutions that wish to engage in derivatives.
</P>
<P>
According to Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson, the
two-tier licensing scheme is being adopted upon the request of the
Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the BAP objected to the strict derivatives regulations
issued by the central bank, which requires all banks and financial
institutions wishing to engage in derivatives to secure a license,
comply with a high capitalization requirement and meet strict
qualifications.
</P>
<P>
The central bank argued that most banks already engage in
simple derivatives transactions such as swaps and forwards and
would like to continue doing so without having to engage in the
more complicated and sophisticated variants.
</P>
<P>
With a two-tier licensing scheme, banks which prefer to stick
to swaps and forwards only need to get a "regular" license.
</P>
<P>
Banks which plan to engage in the more complicated and
sophisticated derivatives variants will have to get an "expanded"
license.

<HEADLINE> China To Use More Foreign Capital In Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- China has pledged to use more
foreign capital and creating a better investment environment for
overseas "gold-diggers" to help accelerate the growth of its power
industry.
</P>
<P>
Ye Qing, vice-minister of the State Planning Commission, told a
seminar here that China's power industry has grown rapidly during
the past five years, but it is still inefficient for fueling the
country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
He told the seminar, jointly sponsored by the commission and
the ABB Company, that China's power generation increased at an
annual rate of 10 percent during the Eighth Five-year Plan period
(1991-1995), and the installed capacity at a rate of 9.1 percent,
but per capita use of power is only 830 kwh. Some farmers and
herdsmen in several border areas still lack any access to
electricity.
</P>
<P>
"China will build a number of large coal-fire power plants,
hydropower plants, nuclear power plants, super high voltage
transmission and distribution projects, and clean coal technology
model projects in the last five years of this century," Ye said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that foreign investors can enjoy a wide scope to
manoeuvre in those fields.
</P>
<P>
"The ABB company has certain advantages in this area, and has
already many cooperation projects," he said. "Actually, ABB
started its cooperation with China long time ago."
</P>
<P>
Lu Youmei, general manager of the Yangtze River Three Gorges
Development Corporation, said that the Three Gorges Project,
construction of which began at the end of 1994, has offered a
market that cannot be neglected by international power
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges Project will need 26 hydraulic turbine
generating units, with the installed capacity of each being
700,000 kw," he said. "Only in China does there exist such a big
market in the world."
</P>
<P>
He said that the company will invite international bids this
month for the first batch of 14 hydraulic turbine generating units.
</P>
<P>
Percy Barnevik, chairman and CEO of ABB, said that his company
will further assist China's power industry and achieve "returns on
investments for all parties."
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of its first China representative office in
Beijing in 1979, ABB has set up eight offices in China. ABB's
first joint venture in China was founded in Shanghai in 1985,
paving the way for another 13 joint ventures for ABB in China.

<HEADLINE> hke - Round-up: Bosnian Peace Process Continues to Be World Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Realizing that Bosnia is still far
from peace although it did end the bloody war, the international
community will hold a series of meetings this month to see peace
accords on the country implemented.
</P>
<P>
To begin with, the Balkan leaders are meeting in Geneva on
Sunday under the auspices of the United States to make sure the
general elections in Bosnia go ahead in line with the Dayton
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Serbia, Croatia and Bosnia, who signed the Bosnia
peace accords last December in Paris, as well as representative of
the five-nation Contact Group, will discuss the crisis in the
Muslim-Croat federation, the elections in mid-September and the
fate of indicted Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army chief
Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, foreign ministers of the United States,
Germany, France, Britain and Russia, members of the Contact Group,
will meet in Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting will also be attended by the foreign
ministers from Italy, Spain and Ireland -- the EU's current
president and its immediate predecessor and successor.
</P>
<P>
There they will review the outcome of the Geneva conference,
discuss implementation of the Dayton accords and coordinate their
future efforts, said German foreign ministry officials in Bonn a
few days ago.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting is planned later in Sarajevo, capital of
Bosnia, to be attended by the three parties in the Bosnia war and
representatives of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be followed by a regular six-month summit of
the European Union in Florence, Italy, to focus on the peace
process and reconstruction work in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, the prospects of the Bosnian peace will be
discussed by the leaders of seven industrialized Western
countries, known as the G-7 summit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the coming activities demonstrated the resolution
of the international community, the United States in particular,
that the Bosnia peace plan should be implemented consistently and
fully.
</P>
<P>
At these meetings, strong pressures are expected to be exerted
on all the parties to fulfill their commitments.
</P>
<P>
Officials, including Implementation Force (IFOR) commander
Admiral Leighton Smith, have said the conditions for a general
election in the war-ravaged Bosnia have not yet been created,
which include the freedom of movement, free access to media and
mass return of 2.4 million refugees and displaced persons to their
homes to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. President Bill Clinton, who believes that the
Dayton agreement and Balkan peace are one of the priorities and
best achievements of his foreign policy, has categorically stated
that there will be no change in the Dayton agreement, meaning that
the elections will not be postponed and the return of 20,000
U.S. troops from Bosnia delayed.
</P>
<P>
The only thing to do in Geneva is to dispel the latest
suspicions and hesitations concerning the elections and set a
definite date for them, according to Western diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Linking tightly with the elections is the ouster of Serb
President Radovan Karadzic as required by the Dayton accords and
the West.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Karadzic as the greatest obstacle to peace in Bosnia,
the international community has mounted pressure recently to force
the indicted war criminal suspect to relinquish power and stand on
trial in the Hague international court.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to reimpose sanctions against
Yugoslavia, the patron of the Bosnian Serbs, unless Karadzic was
ousted and brought into justice.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic also said today the
Muslims will boycott the elections if the Serb leader and his army
chief did not step down.
</P>
<P>
"If the Americans fail to do something to remove Karadzic and
Mladic and to hand them over to the Hague tribunal, it will be a
great shame for them," the Muslim leader said after arriving in
Geneva today for the conference.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure, Karadzic delegated most of his power to
Serb Vice-president Biljana Plavsic last month, but international
community refuses to deal with the "acting" president, also a
hard-liner and a close fellow of Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Independent Beta news agency in Belgrade reported today that
Karadzic agreed to sign a letter of resignation on condition that
he not be extradited to the Hague tribunal. The letter will be
brought to the Geneva conference by Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. envoy to the Balkan region John Kornblum said in
Sarajevo that he still lacked guarantee from the Yugoslav
authority that Karadzic was removed from office.
</P>
<P>
"I did not have any indication of this from Milosevic
yesterday," he said. Kornblum held a meeting on Friday with the
Serbian president in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the coming meetings will also discuss the fate of
the NATO-led multi-national peace Implementation Force (IFOR).
</P>
<P>
If the elections fail to take place in September, the NATO-led
peace implementation force may have to extend its one-year mission
which expires in December.

<HEADLINE> "Green Corridor" of Vegetables Built in South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A 45 km long "green corridor" has
been built in Gaoyao City, south China's Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The 6,000 hectare belt of vegetable area runs alongside
highways in the city. Vegetables are transported to major cities
of the province, including the provincial capital of Guangzhou,
Shenzhen as well as Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
A total of 600,000 tons of vegetable produced in the green
corridor is scheduled for the market this year, while last year
450,000 tons were grown.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,200 tons of vegetables go to seven specialized
markets everyday. Local farmers have become rich by growing
vegetables in 80 varieties.
</P>
<P>
Most vegetables grown in the city go to the Zhujiang Delta, one
of China's richest areas. Some are directly shipped for Hong Kong
and Macao.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Tobacco Harvest Up 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's tobacco harvest jumped 25
percent to nearly 32,000 tons for the 1995-1996 season which ended
in May, with a further jump of 28 percent to up to 41,000 tons
forecast for next year as the land used for tobacco planting
expands by a quarter.
</P>
<P>
This year's increase will enable the nation's export-oriented
cigar industry to produce 70 million cigars, generating 100
million dollars of income for the island country now facing
tightened U.S. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Cuba's Pinar del Rio province produced more than 70 percent of
the harvest, followed by the Sancti Spiritus and Villa Clara
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Caribbean island nation plans to invest 60 million dollars
in tobacco production in the next season, expanding the area of
cultivation by 25 percent from 47,400 hectares to 60,400 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Tobacco Union says the nation expects to harvest
between 39,100 tons and 41,400 tons of tobacco in the 1996-1997
season. But that's still well down on the record harvest of 53,682
tons in 1980-81.

It was reported that some parts in east and central Nepal had

<P>
They warned that increased thundershower activities were
expected in eastern Nepal in coming days while hilly regions of
western Nepal would experience a few brief thundershowers.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Health Care Development in Rural East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 2 (Xinhua) -- There is now better hygiene and
health care for rural residents in the river crossed Zhejiang
Province in east China, thanks to a primary health care program
launched in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
More than 75 percent of the province's 66 counties have passed
state inspections by establishing primary hygiene and health care
systems, and the province expects to meet the global goals of the
World Health Organization (WHO) for health care by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
WHO's aim is to guarantee basic hygiene and to see that health
care services that reflect social justice are provided, which
people and governments can afford.
</P>
<P>
To reach WHO's goals, the Chinese government began to launch
pilot projects in rural areas nationwide in the 1980s. Zhejiang
launched its rural health care program in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The province sends a large number of medical personnel to rural
areas each year and encourages local people to participate in hygiene
and health care facilities construction. Regulations were also
developed, so that the province now has a medical care system in
rural areas where doctors and medicines were in short supply.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang now has more than 500 medical facilities at the county
level, over 3,000 at the township level, and 22,300 at the village
level, with 73,000 medical personnel in township and village-level
clinics, meaning that there is one medical worker for every
thousand rural people.
</P>
<P>
Loans from local governments and some funds from farmers
themselves are being used, and more than 6,600 villages in the
province have some kind of medical cooperation covering 6.8
million farmers.
</P>
<P>
The province has built 33,000 water stations in rural areas,
and more than 70 percent of local farmers have running water, one
of the highest rates in China.
</P>
<P>
The old style toilets of the past, which caused serious
pollution, have also changed, with the province having removed
500,000 of them in recent years and built or improved more than
two million hygienic ones.
</P>
<P>
More rural households are using indoor toilets and the number
of water-saving toilets has increased from more than 3,000 in the
early 1990s to the current 200,000.
</P>
<P>
The province has publicized hygiene and health care among
farmers by holding various courses and including them in the
curriculum of local primary schools.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the quality of local foods has improved, the
incidence of infectious diseases is down, new methods of
delivering babies have been adopted, health care for pregnant
women and children is better, and the infant mortality rate is at
or nearly at state standards for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Some endemic diseases, such as snail fever and iodine
deficiency have disappeared or are under control, and infectious
diseases such as measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, and
osteomyelitis are now under control.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Colombia
will be near 20 percent for the whole of the year, 3 percentage
points higher than the government forecast, the Statistics
National Administrative Department (DANE) said today.
</P>
<P>
Since inflation in the first five months of 1996 has
reached 12.75 percent, the government's target of 17 percent for
1996, would only be possible if the increase stayed at just 0.6
percentage points a month for the remaining seven months, said
DANE.
</P>
<P>
The inflation index for May was 1.5 percent, 0.15 percentage
points lower than that for the same month of last year, said DANE
and the cost of living during the last 12 months was 19.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
DANE estimates that food prices might rise in the coming months
because crops have been affected by cold weather last winter.

SAN JOSE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Fernando Naranjo said his country will demand the rejection of the
U.S. Helms-Burton Law that threatens sanctions against
international enterprises doing business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica will vote against the law if it is discussed during
the 26th General Assembly of the Organization of American States
(OAS), Naranjo was quoted as saying by today's issue of the "La

<P>
Naranjo left for Panama today for the OAS meeting to be held

operating in Cuba by commercial means is unacceptable.
</P>

The Helms-Burton Law, named after its authors, was passed by
the U.S. Congress in March to discourage foreign investment in
Cuba as a way to tighten its 37-year-old economic embargo against
the island nation.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Train International Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will set up an
international nurse training institute (LPPI), the first of its
kind in the country, to meet overseas needs.
</P>
<P>
President of Alabour Recruiting Company (PJTKI), Binawan Group,
Saleh Alwani said Saturday in Cianjur, West Java, that his company
in cooperation with the University of Indonesia and a hospital of
Malaysia, is scheduled to open the LPPI in Purwakarta, West Java,
reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The institute will train nurses of international
qualifications, because the demand for paramedics with such
qualifications has been increasing of late.
</P>
<P>
The highest demand came from the Gulf countries, including
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait.
"Saudi Arabia asked for an unlimited number," Saleh said.
</P>
<P>
The British Commonwealth nations, such as Malaysia, Australia
and Britain, needed a great deal of nurses. The United States also
needed foreign nurses, he added.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the LPPI, according to Saleh, was one of the
forms used by the company to produce skilled Indonesian human
resources ready to compete and work abroad.
</P>
<P>
The company also plans in a not too distant future to change
its training system into a polytechnic training system, as in
Singapore, Saleh disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bookworm Farmer Is Wrapped up in Sea of Words </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Liu Bingji never turned
down a chance to buy books, even when he was assigned to buy
wedding dowries for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
Liu, 54, was sent by his family to buy the dowries in city
shops. But instead of buying dowries, Liu spent hours in city book
stores and bought a 120-volume ancient book.
</P>
<P>
There are very few libraries in Jiangxi province that has the
book worth 2,050 yuan, a sum which an average farmer would spend a
year to earn. And Liu is the first and only person who owns such a
precious book.
</P>
<P>
Liu now has a collection of some 30,000 books and he harbors a
dream of writing books.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Liu, from Quanxi Village, Pingxiang city of east China's
Jiangxi province, does farming and breeding just like ordinary
farmers, and he once ran a village firm by contract.
</P>
<P>
What is unusual between Liu and his neighbors is that he is
especially interested in collecting and reading books.
</P>
<P>
Liu's hobby of collecting and reading books was inherited from
his grandfather, who left some 10,000 books to his family and a
teaching telling his offspring the great significance of
reading. The ancestor served as head of two counties during the
late Qing Dynasty, China's last feudal dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Liu has a five-room study which is equipped with nine bookcases
and seven book shelves, where his stock of 30,000 books. The books
cover politics, philosophy, history, literature, medical sciences,
agriculture and religion. Some of his books, especially those on
history, are rarely seen in ordinary book stores.
</P>
<P>
When he was young Liu's family was very poor. Besides reading
books left by his grandfather, Liu often went to city book stores,
running through mountainous areas and reading through the day.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who only read for few years in primary school, is
especially interested in books on history. It was at that time
that he had his plan to collect books.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of contract responsibility system in
China's rural areas, Liu's family became rich by planting crops
and breeding domestic livestock. Still he continued to buy books.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade and more, Liu visited book stores in
Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan and other big cities across the
country, and never missed a chance to buy books, especially
classical works.
</P>
<P>
Liu now boasts whole set of "Records of the Historian",
"History As A Mirror" and "Chinese General History", as well as
dictionaries, and many other books covering a great variety of
topics.
</P>
<P>
Precious historical materials and rare publications in Liu's
study have attracted both domestic and overseas scholars.
</P>
<P>
Liu does not only collects books, but also likes reading books
and exchanges views with people on books.
</P>
<P>
He also has a good command of agricultural knowledge, since he
reads a lot. He now has completed more than 100 poems depicting
farming activities, and happiness of reading and family life.
</P>
<P>
Liu has four children, three of them are college students.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Urges World to Oppose U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto
Robaina today called on the international community to oppose
the Helms-Burton bill, a U.S. law aimed at tightening its
long-standing economic blockade of the island country.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of unleashing worldwide economic terrorism
and said the whole planet is suffering the extraterritoriality of
U.S. laws.
</P>
<P>
"Maybe now it will be better understood what Cuba has suffered
over the last 37 years," Robaina said in an interview with the
official news agency Prensa Latina.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the bill, which Robaina
calls "an imperial decree", into law on March 12, tightening the
economic embargo against Cuba and threatening to extend it to
countries doing business with the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban foreign minister said that the U.S., which touts
itself as a promoter of free trade, introduced the principle of
intimidation into commercial relations "with black lists and
imperial letters."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State sent letters last week to some
enterprises doing business in Cuba, warning them they would be
punished if they did not leave the island in 45 days.
</P>
<P>
Robaina said that, for Cuba, the news is not that some
enterprises have left Cuba, but that many others continue doing
business here, some are signing new agreements, and some will come
later.
</P>
<P>
And he said that if the war started by the U.S. causes some to
fall, Cuba will never speak an offensive phrase against those who
are also victims of the law.
</P>
<P>
Washington is demonstrating that it is not looking for changes,
opening, or pluralism on the island, but servilism, which now is
faced with rejection, and the U.S. is now trying to destroy the
country.
</P>
<P>
But Robaina vowed Cuba will continue the process of economic
transformation and opening at the pace and with the amplitude
decided by Cubans themselves.
</P>
<P>
The best way to condemn and protest against the Helms-Burton
law, he said, is to work successfully and confidently with those
who defy the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Robaina reiterated that entrepreneurs, enterprises, and
governments should be confident of Cuba's process of opening and
reform.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- American Michael Chang, finalist of
last year, was defeated by Stefan Edberg of Sweden in the third
round at the French Open tennis tournament here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It's a repetition of the 1989 final between the two when Chang
beat Edberg to become the youngest winner at Roland-Garros.
</P>
<P>
Seven years later, the fourth-seeded Chang lost to 45th seed
Edberg 6-4, 5-7, 0-6 and 6-7 (1-7), with the latter making the
fourth round for the first time since 1991 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Against the 30-year-old Swedish veteran, Chang who won the
first set, was out of the rhythm miserably by losing nine games in
a row from the second to the third set.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened. All of a sudden I could not read
his serve anymore and he started to play brilliant tennis," said
Chang.
</P>
<P>
Failing to win one single game in the third set, Chang managed
for a tiebreaker in the fourth set before accepting his defeat 1-7.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Croatian Goran Ivanisevic beat Czech Bodan
Huhlirach in straight sets, and Swiss Marc Rosset was on his way
to play Edberg after his victory over compatriot Jakob Hlasek 6-4,
6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Former Wimbledon champion Michael Stich also survived the third
round match by beating Sweden's Mark Tillstroem 4-6, 6-0, 6-4, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
Both title-holders Thomas Muster and Steffi Graf walked further
with ease as their third round opponents retired respectively with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Muster led 6-2, 5-2 when his Romanian rival Andrea Voinea
twisted his ankle, while Graf only spent 26 minutes on the court
for a 6-0 first set victory before Czech Petra Langrova pulled her
groin muscle.

<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of the port city of Dalian
has never let the grass grow under his feet since he took office
three years ago. He set out to turn the city into the most
beautiful in China - by turning eyesores into beauty spots.
</P>
<P>
Bo Xilai hauled down the mud walls of parks, governmental
compounds and factories and planted more grass. He ordered the
demolition of nearly 100 chimneys, and the building of an
underground heat power factory as part of his achievements during
his mayorship.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, with a bachelor's degree in history from the
renowned Beijing University and a master's degree from the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, even had a beer brewery in the city
center blasted so that grass could be grown on its site.
</P>
<P>
"Why did I destroy the beer brewery to get a plain piece of
land? " the 47-year-old mayor explained, "It's a question of
sensible financial management."
</P>
<P>
He said that the beer brewery could sell the land for a large
sum of money because of its location in the city center, adding
that with part of that money, the firm rebuilt in a suburban area.
</P>
<P>
Besides growing grass on the open area, he also had an
underground garage built.
</P>
<P>
"A parking problem was solved and the environment turned more
beautiful," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The citizens cheered this and the rent of the land nearby also
soared."
</P>
<P>
This year he authorized the import of cold-resistant grass from
Canada and the US with the result that the city is green even in
winter.
</P>
<P>
He said he's planning to build two to three new squares every
year so that the city can be more spacious and attractive.
</P>
<P>
The mayor rebuffed suggestions that he knows only about growing
grass.
</P>
<P>
"My job is a matter of playing the piano," said the mayor, who
is studying for a doctorate from the Northeast China University of
Finance and Economics.
</P>
<P>
"Every area of the work should be looked after, of course, and
one should be good at using helping aids and substitutes."
</P>
<P>
"However, urban planning and construction is extraordinarily
important," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not a few coastal cities have been all out for luring foreign
investors, paying little attention to the environment."
</P>
<P>
"The high-tech industry are very particular and demanding about
the quality of the environment. Who would care to invest in a city
that is full of roaring dust and suffering from traffic jams?"
</P>
<P>
Dalian, one of the 14 coastal cities China opened to overseas
investors in 1984, has approved the establishment of more than
5,000 foreign-funded enterprises, with total foreign investment
nearing 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the contribution of Dalian being the most
beautiful city in North China to the high volume of foreign
investors cannot be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
He hates the idea that a modern city must be very big.
</P>
<P>
"We might be a little brother of Beijing and Shanghai in terms
of economic power," he said. "But we want to be a little brother
economically capable and environmentally beautiful."
</P>
<P>
"Some foreigners complain that Chinese cities are crowded,
ragged and dirty, but I want the world to see that China also has
the world's most beautiful city."
</P>
<P>
He said that Dalian is bestowed with a god-sent location to be
a fairyland-like city.
</P>
<P>
"Dalian, which leans against range of mountains and faces the
open sea, can be carved into an exquisite art piece," he said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this dream, he said, more grass is needed.

Li called Poland China's "important cooperation partner" in
central and eastern Europe, saying China is interested in
cooperating with Poland in the realms of politics, economy,
science and technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski reiterated Poland's one-China policy and said his
country is prepared to forge friendly and comprehensive

<HEADLINE> 2,000-year-old Coins Found in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A farmer in Inner Mongolia has found
a pot full of 2,000-year-old coins while digging an irrigation
ditch with a bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made 80 km away from Hothot, capital of north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Among the collection were 144 which had been shaped with a
knife and 13 Bu (cloth) money dating from the Warring States
Period (476-221 BC).
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the find will contribute to the
study of the relationship between the two warring states of Zhao
and Yan which used the two kinds of coins.
</P>
<P>
The coins were found near the ruins of ancient Yunzhong city
which was initiated in the Warring States Period by the Zhao State.
</P>
<P>
The city remained a site of political, economic and military
importance for 1,039 years until the citizens and institutions
were removed to Datong, present-day city in north China's Shanxi
Province, in the Tang Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
Seals of city governor, gilded bronze buddhas from the Northern
Wei Dynasty (486-534), and China's only well preserved sundial
from the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) have been found before in the
area.

<HEADLINE> China's Heavy Industrial Province Has 200 Billion Yuan in Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Bank deposits of residents in
urban and rural areas of northeast China's Liaoning province have
topped more than 200 billion yuan (24 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The per capita deposits of local people has also hit 5,000
yuan, about 160 times the figure before the country adopted a
reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
The deposits have continued to rise since 1978, jumping from
100 billion to 200 billion yuan only within two years.
</P>
<P>
However local people had just 1.2 billion yuan of bank deposits
in 1978, equal to just 30 yuan per person in local banks.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that the deposits from local residents had
reached about 70 percent of the banks' totals in the province, and
still kept increasing, despite the country cancelling
anti-inflation deposits and lowering the interest rates for
depositors.
</P>
<P>
The deposits in the Shenyang Industrial and Commercial Bank
have also surpassed 20 billion yuan this month, which positioned
Shenyang, Liaoning's capital, the second among the provincial
capitals in China that have deposits of more than 200 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year residents' deposits in China had
reached three trillion yuan. So far Liaoning is the country's
fifth province where deposits exceed 200 billion yuan.

from across the nation gathered in Washington Saturday to express
their concern of children's health, safety, education and future.
</P>
<P>
The day-long activities, including a rally and concerts at the
Lincoln Memorial ground, and a march by thousands of people across
the Memorial Bridge to the Lincoln Memorial, were sponsored by the
Children's Defense Fund (CDF) and some 3,000 other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Participated by parents, grandparents from various fields as
well as students and children, the Stand for Children activities
highlighted the children's problems, such as drugs in school,
violence in neighborhoods. Slogans and banners reading "Save Our
Children" and "Leave No Child Behind" are seen everywhere in the
area.
</P>
<P>
"We stand today at the Lincoln Memorial as American families
and as an American community to commit ourselves to putting our
children first," Marian Wright Edelman, president of the CDF, said
to the crowd of some 200,000 lining both sides the Reflecting Pool
in front of the memorial and stretched towards the Washington
Monument.
</P>
<P>
"We commit ourselves to building a just American that leaves no
child behind and we commit ourselves to insuring all our children
have a healthy and a safe passage to adulthood," Edelman added.
</P>
<P>
According to CDF's annual State of America's Children Yearbook
1996 report, every day 2,660 American children are born into
poverty and 27 die from poverty; every day 8,493 children of all
races and classes are reported abused of neglected and three die
from abuse.

<HEADLINE> Plavsic Promises Implementation of Dayton Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 1 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb acting President
Biljana Plavsic said today the Serbs would do their utmost to
ensure the success of the general elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Tanjug news agency, the acting Serb president
promised that the Serb side "will do everything to provide all
necessary conditions for holding the elections within the
envisaged rules and to ensure in particular full freedom of press,
movement and assembly of people."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the efforts made by key international factors, the
former warring sides in Bosnia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia, "significant results have been recorded so far in the
implementation of the peace agreement," Plavsic was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic, also a hardliner in the Serb leadership, was delegated
most of presidential duties by Serb President Radovan Karadzic in
mid-May after the international community increased pressure for
the step down of the indicted Serb leader.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic added that only a consistent, comprehensive and
unbiased implementation of the Dayton agreement could open
prospects for peace and equality in the country.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic also said the Serb side wholeheartedly supported the
meeting to be held in Geneva Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be attended by U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo
Tudjman of Croatia, Bosnian Muslim Leader Alija Izetbegovic, and
officials of the five-nation Contact Group to discuss the civilian
aspects of the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Plavsic said the Geneva meeting would undoubtedly be conducive
to the implementation of the peace agreement, in particular the
organizing of elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"A further impulse to the peace implementation will be provided
by the upcoming elections, for which preparations are under way,
and Republika Srpska will participate fully in a constructive
manner in this process," Plavsic said.
